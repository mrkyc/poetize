Everybody's got a secret
But I'm an open book
You're the one I want to read it
C'mon and take a look
I'm not gonna try to make you
Read between the lines
I'll spell it out

Inside you'll find an empty space for you
To write whatever you want to

Say we belong together
Say this will last forever and ever
No one could love you better
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell
That we belong together
(Ah, Ha-ah)
(Ah, Ha-ah)

Do you really need a reason
To believe in love?
Open up your eyes and see it
Right in front of us
Everybody needs somebody
And we were meant to be
Without a doubt
You might also like
Right now's the time
It's never too late
Let's go

Say we belong together (We belong together)
Say this will last forever and ever
No one could love you better (We belong together)
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell that-
That we belong together (We belong together)
And this will last forever
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell that we belong together

(Yeah, oh)
Forget what you knew
Forget about whoever hurt you
Let's make something new
Leave the past behind
'Cause when you know, you know

We belong together, baby, we belong together
We belong together, baby, we belong together
Say we belong together
(We belong together, baby, we belong together)
We belong together
(We belong together, baby, we belong together)
Say we belong together (We belong together)
Say this will last forever and ever
No one could love you better (We belong together)
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell
That we belong together (We belong together)
And this will last forever (We belong together)
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell that, that, that- (We belong together)
This ain't no fairytale
Baby, I can tell
