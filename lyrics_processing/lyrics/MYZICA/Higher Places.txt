I knew you were a leaver when I asked to kiss you
Just like the ones who came before
You made a trade for a seat at the table
You know that I can make you more

If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older
If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older

Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah

I've made my way to higher places
My friends have a long, long way to fall
So I keep myself in their good graces
You can't trust your heroes after all
You might also like
If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older
If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older

Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
(Oh)
Na, na, na
Ah, ah

I can see the future in the palm of your hand
Oh, you're so well-intentioned
Now the lion's at the mercy of the teeth of the lamb
Don't you know my reputation?
If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older
If you wanna be something to see
C'mon, you gotta stop lookin' over your shoulder
Doesn't matter what they want you to be
For now we're gonna live it like we'll never get older

Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Na, na, na
Ah, ah
