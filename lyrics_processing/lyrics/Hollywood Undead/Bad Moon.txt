It's a bad moon
A bad, bad moon
Haha

I wait till midnight, I can feel a cold breeze
A box of moonlight, a silhouette of palm trees
With one foot in the grave, beware of what I crave
My loneliness is the only bitch that holds me
No use in thinking 'bout it, don't need a reason
The moon is changing me, yeah, my heart is beating
You better run away before it gets too late
Black sunsets on the sky, and I'm thinking

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone home?
Hope you're awake for the nightmare
Hope you stay for the show

You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight

So take my hand now, I welcome you to my bad dream
Up in the clouds now, that bad moon comes, and it grabs me
I see the city below, this city is my soul
And when it takes to control, it's got me thinking these bad things
So let's not talk about it, I know the day is done
There ain't no getting 'round this, your ship is sinking
Get to your knees and pray, blue skies, they turn to grey
Black sun sets in your eyes, am I dreaming?

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone home?
Hope you're awake for the nightmare
Hope you stay for the show

You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight

Blacked out streets, looking like a wolf
Bad moon up, need to check my pulse
Creep in the woods, and I got you shook
Eyes locked in, gonna get you hooked
No look pass, coming up real fast
Sip up the flask, then I hit that gas
No time to crash, gonna make it last
Wake up inside in a cool black mask
Got gold fangs, I'm with my kin
No silver chain, it burns my skin
Hitting those threes, I was born to win
Pop from the trees, and I give you a grin
Check out the hair that grows out my skin
That's just the beast crawling within
Bloodstains on my fresh white Nikes
Oh my God, what the fuck did I do last night?
You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
