Fuck it, fuck every single memory
How you done wrong, but who's the real enemy?
You better figure out not a single thing is meant to be
The only thing that matter's how you live before you're put to sleep
That's how you're living if you're living just to breathe
I never waste a sentence, better listen when I speak
Or you're gonna know the truth when they put you underneath
And no one's gonna listen when you're six feet deep
I keep my heart tucked in my chest
I hide it underneath with a bulletproof vest
Who's next? I, no, I never gave a fuck
I was too busy dying, too busy giving up

Yeah, trust me, just breathe
One day you're gonna see
Yeah, trust me, just breathe
Otherwise, you're living on your knees

This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
You try to run but fall again, you get back up, that's living

Every day I feel like I wanna forget
And everywhere I go, I see the angel of death
To the left, I see what's right, b-but I hold it in the wrong hand
It's a fight, I see my life given no chance
It's hard to wake up, but I wanna believe
That I'm not alone with a broken dream
All the glitter ain't gold, don't be naive
Leave it all behind, just follow me

Yeah, trust me, just breathe
One day you're gonna see
Yeah, trust me, just breathe
Otherwise, you're living on your knees

This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
You try to run but fall again, you get back up, that's living

Today, I finally felt like I wasn't in a dream
This ain't who I am inside or how it's supposed to be
My mind is on an endless road, and I've been losing sleep
And as the road is trembling, these demons start to creep
I can't hold back, you couldn't stop me if you tried
You should know that and when the fire burns inside
You can't hold back anything that never dies
You should know that, you can't hold back
This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
