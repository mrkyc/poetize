'Cause I, I think of you now and then
The memories never end when gravity pulls you in

I remember looking back Converse and a Starter cap
Now I'm sitting wishing that, wishing I could just go back
I was happy with no fame, Ford Fiesta, switching lanes
Buying 40s with some change, them Southern California days
I watch you pass me by, my words, they can't describe
But I can see the gravity way up from the sky
We leave the past behind 'cause we all wanna fly
Deep down in life, you can't deny we're all the same inside

'Cause I, I think of you now and then
The memories never end when gravity pulls you in
'Cause I, I think of you now and then
We'll never be there again when gravity pulls you in

Oh, gravity
Oh, gravity
Oh, gravity
Oh, gravity

I remember looking back walking 'round, sagging Khak
Dime sacks, alley cats, burnt out, always slack
Now I got a platinum plaque, and life seems to stay the same
Knowing that I'll never change Southern California days
Gravity can't stop the hope in the have-nots
This artery's a part of me, and blood is all I'm gonna be
I'm gonna see concrete, bottles in bad dreams
I'm everything and anything, a memory that never leaves

'Cause I, I think of you now and then
The memories never end when gravity pulls you in
'Cause I, I think of you now and then
We'll never be there again when gravity pulls you in

Deep in the black is the place I call home
Taking me back to the place I belong
Deep in the black, I can't find my way home
Please take me back to the place I belong

'Cause I, I think of you now and then
The memories never end when gravity pulls you in
'Cause I, I think of you now and then
We'll never be there again when gravity pulls you in
Oh, gravity
Oh, gravity
Oh, gravity
