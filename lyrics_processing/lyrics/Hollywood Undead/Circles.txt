Take my hand, let's go
Somewhere we can rest our souls
We'll sit where it's warm
You say "look, we're here alone"

I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me, you were perfect

I'm scattered through this life
If this is life, I'll say goodbye
She's gone like an angel
With wings, let me burn tonight

I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me, you were perfect

I see me writing on this paper, praying for some savior
Wishing to intake her and save her
In a world so, so godless, so thoughtless
I don't know how we wrought this, all the love that you brought us
It feels like I'm killing myself, just willing myself
Just to pray for some help
I'd give it all just to have, have your eternity
'Cause it's all that assures me, it's worth all that hurts me
I'd give you my heart and I'd let you just hold it
I'd give you my soul, but I already sold it
On that day, that day I walked away in December
I will always remember, I'll regret it forever
I remember brown eyes so sad and blue skies
Turned to darkness that night, I'm so sick of the fight
I won't breathe unless you breathe, won't bleed unless you bleed
Won't be unless you be till I'm gone and I can sleep

But to me, you were perfect
I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me, you were perfect

I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday, I hurt myself
It's hard to say that everything will be okay, I hurt myself
I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday, I hurt myself
