I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder
I have told you once, I'm the only one who holds her
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to

I look inside of myself and try to find someone else
Someone who's willing to die just to watch you crying for help
I know that blood will be spilled, and if you won't, then I will
My grave will never be filled, it's either kill or be killed
So let heaven be told that some may come, some may go
Where I'll end up? I don't know, but I ain't dying alone
I keep on asking the question, can I be saved by confession?
You see this blood on my hands? At least they're still reaching to heaven
I gotta pick up the pieces, I gotta bury 'em deep
And when you look in my eyes, I'll be the last thing you'll see

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder
I have told you once, I'm the only one who holds her
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to

Words turn into blood, and the blood keeps on pouring
From every pore, I wipe it off 'cause this just could be the moment
Now someone's gotta die, and I'm my only opponent
'Cause I won't watch my baby cry, so I keep on just going
Am I a man or a beast? It's Mother Nature at least
Watch humanity cease 'cause it's our human disease
"You gotta kill when you gotta kill," yeah, that's what they say
And I can't go against God's will, you better pray
'Cause I'm an angel, a demon; yeah, I'm hell and I'm heaven
I'm everything you couldn't be, now you believe in the Devil
I gotta pick up the pieces, I gotta bury 'em deep
And when the dirt hits your coffin, just go to sleep

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder
Told you once, I'm the only one who holds her
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

Now that I see, I see you buried six feet below
Another life goes into the night
I couldn't let 'em breathe 'cause I didn't wanna die
Now that I see, I see you buried six feet below
It's not alright, can't you hear me as I cry?
I couldn't let you live 'cause I didn't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die...
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die, so you're gonna have to

I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to
I don't wanna die
