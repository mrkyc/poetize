I don't mind, no, I don't mind, I don't mind the rain
The simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I don't mind that I don't mind, no, I don't mind the rain
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart, then never fade away, fade away

Oh, like a child, do you know where I came from?
No, I don't, but I'm singing all the same songs
I'm alone, and you're looking for your anyone
Does it hurt just to know that it's all gone?
I can feel the pain in the words that you say
Hidden in the letters that were written in no name
Let me be the hands that you hold to your face
'Cause I'd give it all up if I could take it away
Buried in red, white, and silenced in blue
Some will die too late, and somebody too soon
And if he could come back, we'll see what it cost him
We had to lose it all just to know that we lost one
I am just a shape in the shadow of greats
I am just a voice in the choir of saints
Oh, all the souls that nobody could save
And just like a light, we faded away

I don't mind, no, I don't mind, I don't mind the rain
The simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I don't mind that I don't mind, no, I don't mind the rain
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart, then never fade away, fade away

Fade away
As I fade away, away, away

If I could take it all back
Before the flags were forced to wave at half mast
That was long before my heart became black
There's no way to make it change or go back
You know that some of us grow old with no home
Some of us die in a cold house with no hope
Still surrounded by the people you don't know, so don't go
'Cause once it's over, the time fades your photo
How many goodbyes could fit in a lifetime?
How many good lies can make it seem alright?
What do you see when you look into my eyes
Or in the sky right before you say goodnight?
I could be the son that stands beside your bed
And I could be the voice right inside of your head
I could say goodbye, and you know where I went
I just wrote a letter that'll never be sent

I don't mind, no, I don't mind, I don't mind the rain
The simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I don't mind that I don't mind, no, I don't mind the rain
Like a widow's heart, we fall apart, then never fade away, fade away
Fade away
As I fade away, away, away
As I fade away, away, away
As I fade away, fade away
