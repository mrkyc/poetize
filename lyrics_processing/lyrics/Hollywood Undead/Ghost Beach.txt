In an old apartment, down in the garden
I was born on a sunny day when the riots ruled the streets like a Sunday parade
Everyone was cruisin', gang signs were movin'
You know how we doin', white lines abusin'
On the boulevard, we never go too far
Nothing really matters when you're walkin' on stars
Last call at the Rainbow Bar
Mistress Los Angeles stole my heart
You can sell yourself if you've got no soul
Nowadays, auditions to the Devil are sold
From the Boardwalk, I see the ghost on the beach
Memories of my city keep haunting me

Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?

No rain, just sunshine
All the broken taillights
Earthquakes on silver lakes
False dreams, yeah, I can hear the heartbreak
Malibu, we're cruising, the cops come, we lose 'em
You know how we do it and this life I'm usin'
We out here in East L.A
'Bout to start a little shit down on PCH
Whatever happened to my favorite place?
Runnin' red lights, never touch the brakes
I used to have my own map to the stars
Wouldn't you know, the stars were open scars?
I wouldn't have it any other way
And I don't give a fuck, come Judgment Day

Tell my mother, my brothers, my father, and others
I'll be gone 'til November with L.A., my lover
Tell my mother, my brothers, my father, and others
I'll be gone 'til November with Los Angeles, my lover
Hold your sons, your daughters, the sand, the water
We are California like no other

Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.? Where's L.A.?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
