I just want a life that seems a little better than a dream
But I just can't seem to get on my feet
So I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go
I hope someday that you will know

I sit back and think about the life I've had
So much to change, but I can't go back
What happened to that kid who used to play in the street?
I think about that kid, he looked just like me
Had a smile, had a home, never grew old
When we grow up, do we have to grow cold?
Spent his whole life looking for salvation
Never realized nobody could save him
So all these words, for what they're worth
I know it's hard, I know it hurts
And we laugh at the past 'cause that's how we learn
Welcome to the world, now let's watch it burn

I just want a life that seems a little better than a dream
But I just can't seem to get on my feet
So I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go
I hope someday that you will know
You gotta let go, gotta let go
I hope someday you'll understand

Sometimes I sit and wish that I could see
A future picture of an older me
Would he be smiling and would he be happy?
Would he say a thousand words while looking right at me?
Is he different or the same old me?
Is he still chasing after these same old dreams?
I know that I'll never reach perfection
At least he could point me in the right direction
Some grow old, and some grow cold
They'd sell their souls for a heart of gold
God only knows where the hell would I be
If I had the old me sitting beside me

I just want a life that seems a little better than a dream
But I just can't seem to get on my feet
So I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go
I hope someday that you will know
You gotta let go, gotta let go
I hope someday you'll understand

No one knows what it's like to be alone
Please, tell me, is anyone out there?
