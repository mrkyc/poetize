I've been searching for an answer, but I ain't found one
I've been known to tear shit up and go off like a gun
I've been drinking way too much, but now I think I'm done

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Right on
Let's start a riot
Right on
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Right on
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Right on
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet

I gotta get, I gotta get that feeling
Gotta get higher than the 20-foot ceiling
Just outta rehab, primed for a relapse
Had to do three dabs just so I could relax
Walk in the room and I check for bitches
Check my .44, check my ammunition
Got all my homies here, and that's fucking bitching
We got more pots than your fucking kitchen
Cooking shit up with the heat up high
With your middle fingers up, let the cops stroll by
No motherfucker here is drunker than I
And if we get drunk enough, we can set it on fire
Like fuck it, I don't wanna come down
I wanna get fucked up right about now
Gonna tear shit up, I don't wanna fight it
Who the fuck here wants to start a riot?

Roll up to the party in my grandma's Chrysler
Jump into your circle 'cause I'm dying to cipher
The older I get, I'm like wine, I get finer
And I can tell your girl wants Charlie inside her
I'm a ride-or-dier with that eye of the tiger
Cornrows banging out the side of my visors
I'm so damn tight, they should call me the Scheister
Hitting bud and Budweiser, shit, I couldn't get higher
You done turned me into the "Swan Songs" Charlie
Peeling out on a Harley at a high school party
Got a frame like Bane, call me young Tom Hardy
I'm the fucker to blame for the Undead Army
Got the fire tonight 'cause my ass got laid
Now I'm high and tight like my flat top fade
Mixed some Molly and Xanax and Tanqueray
And I'm fucking bad bitches like every single day
I've been searching for an answer, but I ain't found one
I've been known to tear shit up and go off like a gun

Tear it up, burn it down
Pour them drinks up until we drown
Go all night, every day
And when you walk into the party, make sure you say

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Right on
Let's start a riot
Right on
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Right on
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
