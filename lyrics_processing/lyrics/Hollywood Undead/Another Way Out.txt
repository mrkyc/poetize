Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish there was another way out

Voices won't go away
They stay for days and days
They say some awful things
Ways to make you fade away
I don't think no one's home
And we're just here alone
I better find you first
Before you find the phone

Better run, better run, better run, yeah, I'm coming after you
When you're sleeping at night, yeah, there's nothing you can do
There's no place you can hide 'cause I'm coming after you

I wish there was another way out for you
Wish there was another way out for you
I wish there was another way out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish there was another way out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish there was another way out

You gave up? I'll check and see
No one cares less than me
Dead wrong I guess you'll be
These voices won't let you leave
Got you down on bended knee
What should my next weapon be?
It's over, you can't breathe
Just sleep now, rest in peace

Better run, better run, better run, yeah, I'm coming after you
When you're sleeping at night, yeah, there's nothing you can do
There's no place you can hide 'cause I'm coming after you
