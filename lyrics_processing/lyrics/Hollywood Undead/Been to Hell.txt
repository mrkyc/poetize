Welcome to a city that'll bring you to your knees
It'll make you beg for more until you can't even breathe
Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see
So follow me into the night 'cause I got just what you need
We're all rolling down the boulevard full of pimps and sharks
It's a motherfucking riot we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold 'cause now you know you're falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold, but they're dirty and dark

Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here, you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here, you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares

Welcome
Welcome

In the belly of the beast, I'm a wolf amongst sheep
At the bottom of the hill but at the top of the street
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit
And you're running hard but this wolf, it's always at your feet
Yeah, you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore
Another victim of the Star-Spangled Banner of the street
Now you're in the world of the wolves, and we welcome all you sheep

You need to wake up and face it so you can taste my reality
Now you're stuck in this place you hate, and you came here so happily
Then it made you lose your faith, and that's what fucked with your sanity
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
Hollywood is your friend, and the Undead are your family
We'll take you to the edge and turn your regret into agony
And I'll never let you go 'cause I know you'll come back to me
I'm the reason you came here, I'm the American Tragedy

Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here, you live forever
