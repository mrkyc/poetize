I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind

Woke up one morning on the Sunset Strip
With a half-smoked blunt and some blood on my lip
Hit up Loraine for that Mary Jane
Man, all she had left was Menage a Twang
Rolled in the Pink, I picked up some Cuervo
Walking sideways, and I'm starting to swerve-o
Last night was wild, blew my money at Jumbo's
Wine and dine, tig ol' bitties and bimbos
Hollywood rat pack, cans in my backpack
Cruise through your valley, and I'm snatching your snapbacks
Huffing on some paint, and I think that I'm half-black
Roll another blunt and fuck it up over this track

I think I've lost my mind
But I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
I think I've lost my mind
Yet I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
See Hollywood Undead LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like
If everybody gotta be everything they wanna be
I don't think I'd see you bitches sitting right in front of me
You can tint them windows, pack another pistol
This bitch was talking shit 'bout my Hollywood hits, so...
You can come west, but you'll never be West Coast
Doping on these motherfuckers deep in the DeSoto
Oh no, tell me what you wanna be
You could be anything but not another Three
I'm a holy roller, slow blunt smoker
The mask on the page of a wanted poster
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
The wickedness in you is the wickedness in me

I think I've lost my mind
But I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
I think I've lost my mind
Yet I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city

How did I let this happen? This life I can't get back from
This fully loaded magnum; if you got some questions, ask 'em
I turned into a madman like Dahmer mixed with Manson
I'll take this song for ransom, make you scream my fucking anthem
I'm knocking at your door, I'm pacing back and forth
You better board up your windows 'cause I might start a war
Or maybe I'm just tripping, this weed has got me spinning
Undead until I die, so when I die, you know I'm living
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind

I think I've lost my mind
But I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
I think I've lost my mind
Yet I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
I think I've lost my mind
But I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
Looking through the bars and I see my city
I think I've lost my mind
Yet I'm feeling so alive
What a pity, it's so pretty
