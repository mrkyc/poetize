Can't stop, I need some help
Fuck you, I'm by myself
Is it a truth or lie?
It's what you can't deny
'Cause it's the way you think
Mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way you are
Float up till you're close to God
You know that hiding ain't gon' keep you safe
Because the tears on your face, they leak and leave a trace
So just when you think that true love's begun
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun
You know I can take you straight to heaven if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate, you know!

Can't stop the feeling, high as the ceiling
I got the money, who's fucking dealing?
You feel the heat like the barrel of a gun
I forgot the last time I saw the sun
We've got this disease that's digging deeper in me
It's like my mind is leaving but my heart keeps beating
So I'll paint the walls red, drip from the nose
Where it goes, nobody really knows
Hit the bottle, she's gone, I'll follow
I fall asleep, there ain't no tomorrow
Gone so far, no one can save me
Who needs you when I got my baby?
My baby's beautiful, she loves me true
And if she dies, I hope I die too

I'mma put down on another sack of them
Then it's straight back to the flask again
I can't help stop what's happening
On the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again
Up shit's creek and I'm paddling
Blacked out room in a Travel Inn
Good ideas, I'm lacking them
I'm too fucked up, now I'm babbling
Wonderin' how to fix these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covered myself with bandages
From all these d-damn damages
Wonderin' how to fix these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covered myself with bandages
From all these goddamn damages

You know I can take you straight to heaven if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate, you know
