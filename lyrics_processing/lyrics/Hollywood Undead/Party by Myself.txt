I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone
I checked my head, but no one's home
The mood is right, the party's on
Looks like tonight I'll be drinking alone
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Higher than a kite with nobody but myself

Baby! One more shot, then it's time to roll
Smoke these Kroks and I'm out the door
Chug Ciroc, but I sip Patron
Hit that spot till you lose control
You thought I'd go out alone?
Bitch, you must be out your dome
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor
Ludacris, I throw them 'bows
Life of the party, got the bitches laughing
Funny on-point, his jokes are cracking
Grind on the wall just to get some action
Looking at the mirror like I'm Michael Jackson
Business is risky, don't try to diss me
I get more pussy than a bowl of Friskies
I roll solo, can't keep up with me
You go home early like you're fucking sixty
You're coming down, my high is peaking
Think you're having trouble speaking
You a freak and I like freaky
Me, myself, and I've been drinking
See Hollywood Undead LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like
Blowing up my cell
But I don't think I'ma answer
I'm all by myself
So I don't think I'ma answer

I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone
I checked my head, but no one's home
The mood is right, the party's on
Looks like tonight I'll be drinking alone
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself
Higher than a kite with nobody but myself

Oh! Picked myself up in my Mitsubishi
Said "what's up it's nice to meet me
Never met someone so damn freaky
Who at the same time is such a sweetie"
So when everybody else is being such a puss
Doesn't mean you can't straight get off the hook
I don't need another partner to shake my tush
I can party all night and slay some bush
So I'ma go out and do some thrashing
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking
'Cause this motherfucker can do some damage
If you don't think so, you can suck my package
'Cause I don't need no static when I feed my habits
So don't be combative when I wreak some havoc
From this weed I'm having, where's my keys, goddamnit?
I should be out having me a threesome, taxing
In my Nissan, blacking out, I need some action
Let you peons have it from this heat I'm packing
Dickies are sagging, let me see what happens
When your cheeks are clapping, Charles P. is rapping
Blowing up my cell
But I don't think I'ma answer
I'm all by myself
So I don't think I'ma answer

I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone
I checked my head, but no one's home
The mood is right, the party's on
Looks like tonight I'll be drinking alone
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Higher than a kite with nobody but myself

Me and my cup are both solo and both need beer
I'm seeing double but there's only one guy here
Motherfucker, I'm getting weird
Motherfucker, yeah, let's get weird

Blowing up my cell
But I don't think I'ma answer
I'm fresh to death, I'm in the zone
I checked my head but no one's home
The mood is right, the party's on
Looks like tonight I'll be drinking alone
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else
Fuck everyone else, I'ma party by myself
Higher than a kite with nobody but myself

Let's get weird
Let's get weird
Let's get weird
Let's get weird
