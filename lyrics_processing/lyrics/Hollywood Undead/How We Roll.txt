Nightfall, when the day begins
I need the bright city lights as I start to descend
'Cause I keep it Undead till the very end
And I got some low lifes that I call my friends
It's some West Coast, beach bum, gangsta shit
Fuck a Hollywood hit, I'll ghost ride the whip
On the Sunset Strip, just me and my clique
And we running the streets, so suck my dick
Six deep we creep, into the streets, we go
Cadillacs and Chucks, so we ready to roll
Just a couple of gangstas, Mimosas in Big Gulps
Smoking and swerving, coming straight for your throat
Get back when we enter the room
Get back 'cause we're digging your tomb
Get back, what the fuck you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do when we're coming for you?

'Cause this is how we roll out here
We're packing heat 'cause it's cold out here
Hold your own, don't show no fear
Or you're gonna lose your soul out here
This is how we roll out here
We're packing heat 'cause it's cold out here
Hold your own, don't show no fear
Or you're gonna lose your soul out here

Oh, shit, yeah, here comes Johnny
He's popping a wheelie on his fucking Ducati
Oh, no, yeah, there goes Charlie
Mad dogging shirtless on the back of a Harley
Let's go, yeah, we ready to party
The best duo since Spade and Farley
Let's roll, hop in the whip and get gnarly
We blaze more spliffs than a young Bob Marley
Get some, yeah, get your dick sucked
I'm blazing a quick one in the back of a strip club
You're our victim forced into a sixsome
And ain't nobody leaving till all of our dicks cum
So kick back when I flash this gat
I got more straps than Matt's assless chaps
So hands up, yeah, we're lying 'em low
All cocked up and we're ready to go

We're packing heat 'cause it's cold out here
Hold your own, don't show no fear
Or you're gonna lose your soul out here

Hold your own, don't show no fear
Or you're gonna lose your soul out here
Hollywood, where the fuck you at?

'Cause this is how we roll
Drop top and we ready to go
Hollywood, where the fuck you at?
Undead, straight creeping in the Cadillac
'Cause this is how we roll
Undead, bitch, you already know
