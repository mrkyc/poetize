Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

I woke up feeling the same way
That I did yesterday
Don't know what these tears would say
But I miss my friend that went away
I watch the seasons as they go
The rain, the sun, the heat, the snow
I don't know much, but this I know
I miss my friend, I miss him so
I say my prayers, I raise my hands
I move my feet and when I can
I said "Help, won't you help me now
And lift me up if my legs give out?"
'Cause I know that life is short
And living is the hardest part
And someplace through the dark
We will meet and never part

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

The calm that comes before the break
The sun that sets like yesterday
The good may come and go away
While bad news waits for you to wake
We all kneel down before the storm
When waves come crashing at your door
I've been down, been down before
And I have faith, but I need more
We're specks of dust caught in a whirlwind
Nothingness behind the curtain
Life is short, but death is certain
That will always be our burden
Free, afraid to follow
If I promise you tomorrow
See through the dark
We will meet and never part
Someplace through the dark

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

I had something to say
But the words went away
Just like they always do
I'll be there with you

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
