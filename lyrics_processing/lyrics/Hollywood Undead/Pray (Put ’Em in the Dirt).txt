Born on the right side of the wrong side
I wear my fucking insides on my outside
You can see my heartbeat, it beats right through
Till the day, it stops I'm gonna motherfucking persecute
Every single one of you, I'm not alone
I got the devil, and he's coming too
Coming through to straight motherfucking bury you
Someone's gonna die, and I'm fucking bulletproof
I'm fucking bulletproof
Let me tell you a story, it's about a little kid
Who never really understood much of anything he did
He had a chest full of heart and a body full of scars
In a broke down palace on a broken boulevard
And he was faithless, but he'd live through all the hurt
'Cause every time he did, he knew he got what he deserved
Had to hold up to the fire even if he had to burn
Maybe pain became the only way that he could ever learn

So faithless, but he knew that he could take this
Everything then came apart, so one day he could make this
This song for the nameless that's ageless
Hold onto my hand, I'll show you scripture in these pages
They're bulletproof

Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, there's not always tomorrow
Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Now it's your turn to die
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt

Feel the fire, the heat, the pyre
The angel you know is the devil admired
Everything ends like a voice in the choir
Telling the truth to you motherfucking liars
It's the comedown, I know I gotta hold out
Can't fucking fall down, the mirror says I sold out
God had a vision and that vision is me
And I hold it in my heart every second that I breathe
So, Holy Ghost, hold me please
I don't need these lethal things
What are these songs that I'll need?
I see this image when I dream
So I'll live it 'cause it's the only motherfucking thing I got
'Cause I'm motherfucking Three and you're motherfucking not
I got a motherfucking gun and the motherfucker's cocked
And I'll put it to my head until the motherfucker drops

So faithless, but he knew that he could take this
Everything then came apart, so one day he could make this
This song for the nameless, that's ageless
Hold onto my hand, I'll show you scripture in these pages
They're bulletproof

Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, there's not always tomorrow
Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Now it's your time to die
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt

Most men lead lives of quiet desperation
Eventually, that desperation has to end
But first, come back to the crucifix
'Cause that sentence will come to pass

Now it's your time to die
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Now it's your time to die
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
