Loses her life working in a fast food restaurant
And all the store lost was a hundred dollars
Sha la la la la la
While a six-year-old in Cleveland
Ides his bike without training wheels, sis two front teeth missing
Smiles all the way to show his mother at the soccer field
Sha la la la la la
Under the very same sky
At the very same time
Somebody's laughing
Somebody's crying
Somebody's living
And somebody's dying
I'm just a guy who's in love with a girl
It's a beautiful day
In the cold cruel world
A young mother in Dallas, Texas who doesn't have long to live
Makes a video for each of her children's 16th birthday
It's the present that she'll give
Sha la la la la la
While a couple in Davidson County after a bitter separation
Reconcile and renew their vows in front of the church's congregation
Sha la la la la la

At the very same time
Well somebody's laughing
Somebody's crying
Somebody's living
And somebody's dying
I'm just a guy who's in love with a girl
It's a beautiful day
Tomorrow Wall Street's gonna rise or it will fall
The earth will keep on spinning 'round like some big old crystal ball
And we keep pretending like we really understand
While the children's choir keeps singing
"He's got the whole world in His hands"
Under the very same sky
At the very same time
Well somebody's laughing
Somebody's crying
Somebody's living
And somebody's dying
I'm just a guy who's in love with a girl
It's a beautiful day
In the cold cruel world
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a beautiful day
Yeah, yeah
It's a beautiful day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a beuatiful day
In the cold cruel world
