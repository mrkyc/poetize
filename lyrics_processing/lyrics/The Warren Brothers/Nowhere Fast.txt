Playin' for the beer and tips
Livin' by the Poncha Train
Watchin' drunks and sailin' ships
Now I'm sittin' on a midnight train
Gonna bury momma on my birthday
And never's gonna be too soon
To see these streets
Of Vieux Carr'
Thirty years ago
Momma was a pretty bride
She took this train to New Orleans
Made a mask for Mardi Gras
And never took it off it seems
Daddy drank away their honeymoon
He never wore his wedding band
They fought just like a hurricane
But she fell in love with Dixieland
Now I'm on a train to nowhere
To find the future in my past
I'm on a train to nowhere
Feelin' like a no one
How long will this last?
Goin' nowhere fast

She labored deep into the night
I was the baby in her arms
And she was weakened by the fight
I grew up fast I grew up hard
The alleyways were my backyard
Momma sang at Pat O'Riley's
And I sat in with the band on Fridays
Now I'm on a train to nowhere
To find the future in my past
I'm on a train to nowhere
Feelin' like a no one
How long will this last?
Goin' nowhere fast
Tonight we'll cross the
Mason-Dixon line
Finally takin' Momma home
She will find a restin' place
Beneath the garden made of stone
And I came here to find tomorrow
Now I hear my station name
If I can just forget my past
Maybe I can start again
Now I'm on a train to nowhere
To find the future in my past
I'm on a train to nowhere
But this trip will be my last
Yeah if I can just get goin'
And get myself on track
Off this train to nowhere
