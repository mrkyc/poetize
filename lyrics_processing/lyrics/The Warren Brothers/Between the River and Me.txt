Momma worked two jobs just to get by
It seemed like a blessing when Harley came around
So she took his name but I had my doubts
It didn't take long for his drinking ways
To start showin' up on Momma's face
One violent night hiding under my bed
I swore that he'd never see another sunset
Next day I followed him down to the river bank
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away
I mighta had a plan but he didn't know it
I mighta been scared but I didn't show it
That's all between the river and me
With the current and the rocks it could have been risky
He might have been sober but I brought the whiskey
And that's all between the river and me
I walked up to him and I said his name
Just so he could see the look on my face
He stood out a while and told a joke
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home
He raised his fist to me but I didn't flinch
I said, "I ain't your son or the son of a bitch, no"
I mighta had a knife in my back pocket
I mighta pulled it out before he saw it
But that's all between the river and me
I mighta had a gun but I didn't fire it
He mighta tried to yell but I kept him quiet
But that's all between the river and me
But that's all between the river and me
Ooh, the river and me
Yeah
The sheriff come knockin' on our front door
Said they found his body by the reservoir
Bottle in his shirt, liquor in his blood
Must have fallen in the river and he never came up
Might've been blood but they never saw it
Just a little mud on the living room carpet
But that's all between the river and me
After what he did Lord there ain't no wonder
Can't remember how long I held him under
But that's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
Lord, that's all, that's all between the river and me
Oh, that's all between the river and me
