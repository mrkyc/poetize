Yeah
My Young Homie Sends Me Messages All The Time
Only 15
So I Tell Him Something Like This

Who The Fuck Said
Its Cool To Be Broke?
You Gotta Focus
Go & Get It
With a Different Approach
You Gotta Watch Who You Kick It With
You Make A Bad Decision
Those The Ones You Go To Prison With
My Older Brother Is Doing Time
Nobody Goes To Visit Him
The Pain Is In His Eyes
And He Ain't Never Got a Letter
From His So Called Friends
They Disappeared
I Really Thought
That They Were Road Dogs Then
Too Many Possibilities
I'm Constantly Giving You Knowledge
But It's Obvious
The Obstacles Are Much Greater
Your Close Friends
Become Your Close Haters
But It's Nothing To Be Afraid Of
Tomorrow Is Never Promised
Yo It's Not What It Seems
I Know Its Hard Homie
Hope You Go & Follow Your Dream

I Know You Fucknig Up In School Lately
I Know Your Moms Feeling Like You Rude Lately
You Won't Admit It
But You Chillin' With The Wrong Circle
And I Know That You Been Fighting
Till Your Knuckles Turn Purple
You Don't Wanna Live
Your Whole Life At Your Moms Crib
Become a Young Dad
Stuck With The Wrong Chick
Gotta Dream Big
Take Your Momma Out The Ghetto
Provide For Your Family
Take Em To Another Level
Believe Me Kid
You Don't Wanna Pick Up That Gun
I Know Some Coward Muthafuckers
That'll Do That For Fun
That Don't Make You A Man
It's The Love For Your Fam
You Gotta Look Into Your Mothers Eyes
And Know Where You Stand
Brainwashed By The Streets
Behind Enemy Lines
The Loves Blind
Time Flys Till Your Best Friend Dies
When You Stop For A Second
And Your Heart Turns Cold
Another Young Man Lost
Another Story Gets Told
