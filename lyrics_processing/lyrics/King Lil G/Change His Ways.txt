How many guns?
Four, two in the front
And one in the back carrying revolvers
The other one, 12 gauge shotgun man

Nothings gonna change his way...
Nothings gonna change his way...

Ion' give a fuck
This is it this it this it now
Tell me what you think
Yo, I started off as a young kid banging a set
Little knucklehead motherfucker loving the best
Trying to follow the steps
Because psycho had a rep
And I love the way that motherfucker showed him respect
Even surf for a lil' like I got what you need
Bust missions on the regular
Smoked a lil' weed
Momma tried to raise us right
Open our eyes
Trying to tell us we was wrong
While we lived this life
Yo I could've seen it coming
Psycho raised us
Two gangstas for gangstas
It's not even funny
I remember times he couldn't control his anger
Putting in work
And there was nothing to change him
The street life is nothing to play with
You fuck up
The system will throw you fast in one of those state pens
All I could do now is answers his calls
Writing letters to him, let me see what he wants

Hello?
You have a collect call
From an inmate at the correctional facility from, Psycho
Press one to accept the charges
If not, simply hang up
Aye, what's up G?
How's everything on the out?
How's that music shit going
When's your shit coming out?
Have you made any songs?
Let me hear how they sound
Is your label treating you good?
If not you should bounce
Man...
I'm stressing like a motherfucker
I'm facing ten to thirty-two
It's a motherfucker
Next week, I go to court
Let's see what they say
I'm prepared for whatever
It's my sentence today
Last night I couldn't go to sleep
Why is that man?
Thinking of our old time memories
That's some crazy shit
This is my destiny
I guess it's meant to be
An Eye for an Eye
It equals the penitentiary
I don't regret shit
Cus when the hood calls
It's either me or him
And you know we stand tall
Fuck it I guess I'll talk to you later I got to go
Tell the family I love em
Ease up it dawg
Nothings gonna change his ways...
Nothings gonna change his ways...

Yesterday, I received your letter
You say times is getting rough
But they gon' get better
You a strong motherfucker
Trying to keep your head up
Never turned on you once dawg
I'm here forever
Now I'm roaming and thinking
How to get you out
God please hear me
I really need you now
I'm lost and confused
Man I needa hit a lick
Wanna get you a lawyer
So I need the money quick
Blood, is thicker than water
Through the good and the bad
Stick together like a motherfucker
You need a mission done
Call me up I'll buck em'
If you ain't down with someone
You know I'll say fuck em'
Me and you, walking alone
Came from a broken home
Holding our own
We had nowhere to go
It's crazy when you think
How we even survive
I see motherfuckers miss
