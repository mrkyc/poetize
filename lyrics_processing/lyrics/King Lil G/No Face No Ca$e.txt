I saw your homie snitching on The First 48
It's the first of the month, don't get murked by the gang
I said, "Bitch, get in the car with the Backwoods"
Bitches wanna fuck because I rap good
Enemies caught slippin', they get ambushed
Tick, tick, tock, all I see is dollar signs
I was running in the hood but now I run an enterprise
Take a look at the account, everything monetized
Four-fives, AK's, all sides, mob ties
I do it for my mama 'cause we had them hard times
Anybody playing with me, I'ma have to press lines
TEC-9's, I'ma have to flex mines
E's up, I'ma have to rep mines
King Lil G, I'ma see you next time
That's what your bitch said when she had to text mine
But I lied to the bitch, I was high with the bitch
You see it on my stomach, Double 9 in this bitch
You see it on my stomach, Double 9 in this bitch

No face, no case (Hell nah, it wasn't me)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
Putting bands in the safe (Putting bands in the safe)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
I don't fuck with you lames (I ain't fucking with you lames)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)

I been fucking hoes to the best of my abilities
My dawgs turned up in them correctional facilities
What up to Big Will locked up in the cage
Out in Pleasant Valley and the rest upstate
Lil Ratchet, Trip-A-Lot, YG and Young Daze
I'ma miss you on the real, we the ones that run fades
I told this little bitch all my homies on the mainline
Get naked, I'ma put you on a FaceTime
She dropped it down then she picked it up slow
I suppose she's a pro, she's a real go-getter
Monday night up in Sam's, I was with her
Started throwing bands, I'm a Southside hitter
Really I was faded, but I'm always on some dumb shit
No time, I don't spend it with a bum bitch
I came up last week, went and got a few belts
Louis V's, Fendis, and a couple YSL's

No face, no case (Hell nah, it wasn't me)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
Putting bands in the safe (Putting bands in the safe)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
I don't fuck with you lames (I ain't fucking with you lames)
No face, no case (No face, no case)
