Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke

47 everything
Young Drummer Boy in this muthafucka
Smoke! yeah

It's been 2 days
And bitch I'm still high (still high)
They try to hate
But bitch I still shine
I almost panic
Had a tooly on me
Now police are trippin'
And they pull me over
Got some money on me
Got some bullets homie
Got some homies
That's catching them cases for me
Kept it G and never told on me
What you mean the homies rolled on me?
That they snitching on me?
That they turned informants?
Man I plead the fifth
I got my lawyer coming
Bitch I'm from Pomona
Where the hood die young
Where the hood die young
I'm gon' ? my soldier bones
With some real nice guns
Gone off that liquor
Whole squad full of killers
If you don't fuck with him
You don't fuck with me
And why you trying to hang with us?
All I want is that money
The bitch I'm fucking she love me
If you ain't bout that paper chase
Then you ain't really bout nothing
You might also like
I been living in a different world
I seen some shit you ain't never seen
Murder cases for the little homies
I hope that future ain't a one for me
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
I be on another level
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
She was smoking with the devil
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
Can't imagine how I felt
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
I do this shit all by myself
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke

They got the hood under investigation
Swerve
They talking bout gang allegations
Bitch swerve
Who the fuck lied to you homie?
Don't get it twisted
I'm kind to you homie
You the type
That'll lie to the homies
You ain't the type
That'll ride for the homies
I'm not adjusted to this generation
I'm still waiting for all of the stars to align
Too many mumble rappers
I'm a humble rapper
With a seat that's about to recline
What did you put in my cup?
I been going through some issues with trust
I don't really wanna talk about it
But who the fuck voted for Trump?
You was distracted by strippers & ones
You was distracted by killers & guns
You was distracted with all of the things
That we going
We buy all the ones we love
Fuck it then
Go and pass me that gold bottle
God knows I can't be your role model
I been living in a different world
I seen some shit you ain't never seen
Murder cases for the little homies
I hope that future ain't a one for me
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
I be on another level
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
She was smoking with the devil
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
Can't imagine how I felt
Get cash, get cash
And then go smoke
I do this shit all by myself
Get cash, get cash
