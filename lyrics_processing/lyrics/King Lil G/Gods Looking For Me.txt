I'm a victim of this evil world
My close homie started fucken with my old girl
And I've been dealing with drama, I never thought i'd see
I'm tryna make it to heaven
But I know gods not inviting me
I'm tryna be optimistic and learn
Wise words every time I speak
It's hard to trust, even the words coming from
A priest
Suicidal thoughts lost, now I'm on a mission..
Voices in my head
Asking god "what's the right religion
Am I fucken with the wrong, or the
Right bitches?"
The principal of life: Homie you could die
Snitchin'
Indicted all my homies for the white business
I'm talking coke
Now they looking at a life sentence
I'm in the dark in my cold room, stuck
With the fact
That you won't be coming home soon
That you won't be coming
Home soon
Commissary three smokes, and a colt too

I heard that god keeps looking for me
I hope you find me lord
I heard that god keeps looking for me
I hope you find me lord
I close my eyes and put my headphones on
Knowing that the worlds gonna to judge me
Everybody sins all day
But it's funny how the world wants to judge me

I seen the best fade away
Lay sprayed from the kay
Some say "Hate burns"
Fuck funerals today..
I'm a bastard with mistakes
Hustlin' for stakes
Baby momma hates my guts
But my son knows I'm great
Heaven here me
See I don't see things clearly
I wanna put in work, thinkin the enemies will fear me
Jealous lies
Kilogram pies, ballin' out
Asking for forgiveness, but the lord knows I'm fallin' out
You hear me calling out
Angel city knows about
Villaraigosa's plans, just to take me and the homies out
It's got me knocking on heavens door
And I ain't trusting no one homie, we ain't ever met before
This ain't simple
The fame aims change souls
Slow your roll
Love ain't on a strippers pole..
They call lust the devils candy, on a lonely night
My life changed once I took the name Kryptonite..
