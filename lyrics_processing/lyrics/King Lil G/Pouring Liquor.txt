My Mother Kicked Me Out The House When I Was 17
Chalked Up Bodies, Gun Shots - Enemies
Momma I'm Corrupted With The World
Momma I'm Corrupted By These Girls
I Believe In God & Them Serious Things
She Believes In Cars & Material Things
I Wanna See What's Really Deep Down In Your Soul
See If Your Dreams Reach Down To My Soul
Cause None Of Em Was Ever Loyal
Trust Issues, That's The Reason Why I'm Paranoid
I'll Never Fear Death And That's A Promise
You Should Be Afraid Of Fake Prophets
Who Make Profit
The Lames Gossip, They Hate Progress
I'm A Make You Reconsider Whose L.A.'s Hottest
You Never Got To Hear My First Demo
Record Labels Said
I'm Talkin' Way Too Much About The Ghetto
It's A Ghetto Cold World Where I Come From
They Only Call My Phone When They Want Somethin'

Aye, Sippin On That Olde English
Forty Got Me On Some Shit
Pouring Liquor For My Dead Homies
Got Me Feeling Like
La-La-La-La-La-La-La
Got Me Feeling Like
La-La-La-La-La-La-La
Got Me Feeling Like

Lately I Been Feeling
Like The World's Against Me
Everybody Hating On Me
Like The World Against Me
Only Got A Few Homies
Cause The Rest Are Filthy
Keep My Circle Real Tight
With All The Enemies Close
See I'm Searching For A Life
Where We Can Chill & Smoke
Where We Can Be Around The People
To Us Meant The Most
That We Lost Off In The World
That They Said Was Cold
But Talking All Depressed To Me
Is Really Getting Old
Cause I Seen A Lot Of Things
And I Ain't Spoke A Word
But It Change The Way I Think
When I Smoke The Herb
Now They Hating Cause I Made It
Bitch Don't Act Spoiled
And Don't Call Me Conceited
Just Cause I Live Royal
Yall Remember When Yall Did Me Dirty?
Forgot Who You Asked For Help
Cause Your Pockets Hurting
See I Ain't Got Nobody Here
Who Am I Run To?
I Wish I Had My Family With Me
Cause I Love You
But I'm A Cut Whoever Off
That Be Trying To Leech
They Never Notice That They Need You
Till You Finally Leave
Aye, Sippin On That Olde English
Forty Got Me On Some Shit
Pouring Liquor For My Dead Homies
Got Me Feeling Like
La-La-La-La-La-La-La
Got Me Feeling Like
La-La-La-La-La-La-La
