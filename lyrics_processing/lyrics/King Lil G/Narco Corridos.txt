Yeah, one time
Anybody wanna go to war with us
Every boss, get at me

Never been afraid of death, tell Pac I'm coming soon
My music is the reflection of Makaveli's wounds
I'm a fucking king, put gold up in my tomb
Even though I made to Heaven, my rag is still blue
I'm dressed in white and I'm tatted, too
Visions of all my ex bitches loving my attitude
God won't forgive me for the way that I acted a fool
I smash these other rappers, what did I have to prove?
My raps improved, hand guns, I had a few
I caught my enemy slippin' in lonely avenues
I'm sorry, but you bitch motherfuckers just had to go
Around the same time I sold my first grams of coke
I'm from the ghetto, my dad was broke
The fridge was empty with spoiled milk, the ham was old
I use to look up at the sky wishing we had the most
Gang banging had a long list of fools we had to smoke

Marijuana, cocaina, kilos
I'm talking 'bout this real shit like narcocorridos
I'm rapping real shit like narcocorridos
Fuck my rivals, balas pa mis enemigos
I'm in the building, sucios in the building
I'm in the building, sucios in the fucking building
I'm in the building, sucios in the building
Nobody cries after the death of a drug dealer

They bumping this on the east side, loving this on the west side
Bumping this on the south side, enemies know I'm 'bout mine
