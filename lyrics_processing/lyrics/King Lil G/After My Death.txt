I Wanna Take The Time To
Give A Shout Out To Everyone Who's Been Supporting Me
And I'm Talking About Strangers When I Say This
Cause Some People That Been A Part Of My Life
Gave Up On Me A Long Time Ago
This Ones For You

Whose Gon' Love You When You Dead Homie?
Whose Gon' Love Me When I'm Dead Huh?
You Lost Everything You Own
And You Left With No Bread Homie
Whose Gon' Love Me When I'm Dead Huh?

I Kept Fucking With You
But I Didn't Know No Better
I Guess I Had To Learn My Lesson
Now My Flow Is Better
I Felt Like Some Of You Left Me
Up In The Coldest Weather
And Now You Callin' My Phone
Cause Now My Shows Are Better
I Remember When You Never Pressed The Like Button
You Like Frontin'
Like Its Hard For You To Like Somethin'
No Legitimate Reason
I Guess You Haters Love It
I Rise Above It
A Dime A Dozen
My Time Is Comin'
Tell Me How You Did It
When Your Father Was An Alcoholic
A Drug Addict
Who Never Gave You The Love You Wanted
Will These Politicians Change The Rules?
They Gave My Homies More Time
For Some Gang Tattoos
I Closed My Eyes For A Second
And My Freedom Is Gone
If You In Court Right Now
Keep Believing In God
They Say They Love The Way The King
Keep On Speaking The Raw
I'm From The Region
Where Disbelievers Believe In This Song
I Was Trouble For A Second
Till The Day That God Spoke To Me
They Keep Judging Me
Tell Me What They Want From Me
They keep Judging Me
Tell Me What They Want From Me
