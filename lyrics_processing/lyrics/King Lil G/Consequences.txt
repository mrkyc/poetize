I got no friends in this life, sleep with one eye open and one on the strap

I know about those consequences
My G's doing the longest sentence
Street has got it on lock again
Weed is like my oxygen
They say they got probable cause on the Benz
Say the description's a Mexican
Fuck it, I gotta go flex again
Ignore these bitches when they text again
They say the king is who's hot now
I drive around in a top down
I sent you money, you was locked down
My brother Kado he got out now
I miss no one from my older team
Your newest bitches can't get over me
I know she wishes she was home with me
Tatted and I got some gold on me

I been with the gang a lot
I been moving cane a lot
I been moving weight a lot
I don't wanna face the trial
The DEA got me waiting out
I just relocated now
Think I got some haters now
My bitch bouta have my baby now
You might also like
Yeah my name is EMC hoe
Bitch I ain't too friendly hoe
My homies were fake so they all had to go
You should feel blessed when I walk through the door
Do you know someone that's grindin' like me?
You ain't see no one that's higher than me
You ain't met no one that's flyer than me
DM'ed yo bitch and she's dyin to meet
Just fucked her once now she's crying to me
She tells me "I'm lovin' your style EMC"
"I just wanna have your child EMC"
Detectives comin' and they askin' for me
But I've been on tour so I'm not even home
Don't like to talk so I'm not on the phone
I don't trust no one I'm always alone
I don't trust no one I'll roll with the chrome

I been with the gang a lot
I been moving cane a lot
I been moving weight a lot
I don't wanna face the trial
The DEA got me waiting out
I just relocated now
Think I got some haters now
