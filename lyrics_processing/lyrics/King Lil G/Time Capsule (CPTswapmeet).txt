Hey, I know you don't smoke weed, I know that, but I'ma get you high today
(Yeah)

I just wanna go and do my thing
I suggest you go and do the same
Understand my ambition was different
I love my woman cuz my woman was different
I'm optimistic never losing my hope
That's how unfaithful and room full of hoes (Too many bitches)
That's another distraction
Maybe it's trouble that finds me attractive
I don't know what the fuck happened
I'm talking 'bout way before rap (way before rap)
I didn't have a car
Homies picked me up
Compton swap meet
Yeah somebody hit me up
I need a burner yo can you get me one?
That's when I seen big booty Cynthia
I had a bloody nose
And maybe some blood on my shirt
Repercussions from avoiding the obvious
Maybe that's what I deserve
Would you finger trigger fingers itching
Had some gangsta brothers who I never mentioned
(Yeah)
Gangsta brothers who I never mentioned
(Yeah)

I know you heard all my latest shit
Back at it with some gangsta shit
Classic vibe
I talk greatest hits
Yeah that's me with some raider shit
Back when I wished I had amazing whips
I had amazing plugs that could've made me rich
Talked in code, in different languages
I was way too fly with my gangsta bitch
One white girl, One Asian bitch
I'm like bring your best friend
I wanna blaze it with
No role models, just a gangsta clique
Blue bandana like a gangsta Crip
I went to Compton, got Dayton rims
One year later I was weighing bricks
One year later on the Vegas strip
Two months later cops raided quick (Man)
How we gon' get this money?
When you got no job?
And you stuck in the hood?
And you can't go far?
Close your eyes and tell me what you see
God if only I could show you what it's like to be
