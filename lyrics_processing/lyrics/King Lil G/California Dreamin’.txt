Woke Up Early
At About Noon
Thought That I Had To Be
In South Gate Soon
Then I Went To Downtown
And I Hit Blue Moon
All The Way To The Back
Of The Private Room
Gang Bang Season
Like '92
Send A Text Girl
Can I Get High With You
Then I Started To Smoke
And I Told Her Some Things
That I Never Told No One
I Know That You Feelin'
The Vibe With Me
You Don't Know This Feeling
Inside Of Me
I Suggest That You Come
And You Try With Me
Baby Don't Lie To Me
I Could See Us
All The Way To Top
In A '64 Rag Top
Smilin' Bout Things
That Corrupted My City
Some Way I Connected To God
I Been Tested By God
Listen Baby
Don't Get Out Of Line
Too Much Confidence
My Type Of Vibe
I Brought Some Purple
For The Ambiance
Day Dreamin'
Bout My Cali Life Like

It Was After School
I Wanna Know You Better
You Gon' Take The Bus
Where We Could Roll Together
Knowing I Didn't Live Close To Where Ever
You Was Going
But I Wanted To Get Ya
Without You Seeing
That You Live By The Projects
Thats A Trip My Homies Live In The Projects
With Police Around
Just Patrolling The Site
And Lil Homies Rolling Around On They Bikes
Girl I Want Ya
And You Know That It's Obvious
Let's Just Get High
And Get Lost When We Conversate
Post You On My Snapchat
And See How They Start To Hate
Talk About Life
And The Way Yall Live On The A
