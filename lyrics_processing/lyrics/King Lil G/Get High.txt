I Wanna Get High With Ya
Wake Up In The Morning
Like Fuck It Spent The Night With Ya
Baby Take A Hit Of This
I'm Looking At Your Best Friend
Baby We Should Really Kiss
Maybe I'm Just Trippin' Cuz I'm High
Hits From The Bong
You Can See It In My Eyes
I Had To Send A Text To The Homie
Bring A Couple Blunts
Got Some Bad Bitches On Me
