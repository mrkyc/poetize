Was Wondering If You'd Ever Sign A Mexican..

Imagine We Could Take It Back
Just Imagine When Radio Still Played Gangster Rap
And Rappers Talked About Being From The Streets

Fuck The Police
Imagine Drake Really Being From A Hood
Imagine If Lil Wayne Was A Real Blood
Would He Go To Watts?
Or Would He Chill In Compton?
With No Bodyguards
Will Anybody Rob Em?
Getting Gangsta On A Song
But You Never Killed
I Know Get Tat'd Up
You Can Say You're Real
A Bunch Of Mexican Rappers With No Deals
I Pissed The Fuck Off
I Gotta Tell You How I Feel
Fuck The Dumb Shit
I Want A Big Deal
I'm Talking Bout Them Jay-z Eminem Deals
Making 10 Mils
I Want The Best Wheels
If This Bitch Don't Fuck
