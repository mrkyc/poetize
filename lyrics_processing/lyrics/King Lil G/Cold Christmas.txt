I wish I could show you my photo album growing up
One bedroom apartment, Shit was hard

When you drop new songs they relate to
All your close friends wanna go & hate you
That's when the police wanna go & raid you
And all the pretty little bitches wanna date you
I motivated me, no one else did
Apartment seven, that little broke kid
Wanted toys, my moms can't afford it
My mama's love became more important
All I ever did was eat rice and beans
I appreciated those types of things
Faded pants, no designer jeans
That's when I said "Fuck that! Man I'd rather dream."
Maybe I don't wanna be broke
Maybe I don't wanna keep sleepin' on the floor
Maybe I don't wanna be sad no more
From the things that I see every week at the store
I'm sorry if I embarrassed ya
I kept complaining at the register
Cuz you never bought me them wrestlers
It's like having things was not meant for us
Thank you God for being next to us
I know some day you'll start blessin' us
I know that's why you gave me confidence
And mama gave me always that extra love

Cold Christmas
Young Boy I was just like you
Man you have no clue
When I told you
I had a cold Christmas
My father was gone
I felt so alone
Oh man, oh man, oh man
Cold Christmas
Tell me oh why (Tell me)
Tell me oh why (Just tell me)
Tell me oh why (Why?)
We never had them days
Cold Christmas
Young boy I was just like you
Man you have no clue when I told you
I had no Christmas

My best friend got a new bike
New clothes and some new Nikes
He kept braggin', I kept smilin'
I'm thinkin' "Homie them shoes nice"
I never got shit
Even though I got good grades
My little homie came through with some new J's
I guess I gotta thank God
It's a new day
If you didn't get shit, what would you say?
Besides the truth
Mama loves me, I know she do
She been at work and the rent is due
And she has no man, that's dependable
That type of shit ain't acceptable
My mother still so affectional
Besides the fact, we got left alone
She still raised me respectable
She taught me to never go steal
Never be a thief, that will get you killed
Gave me advice, that gave me the chills
Never had money but I had a hot meal
She picked me up from school
I was hungry, she made me happy
With Mexican food
She made the greatest food
Mama I'm sorry I called you from jail
The feds put a hold so I got no bail
Got commissary, don't even worry
I'ma make it by myself
Just pray for me
And say you love me
And respond to my mail
Just pray for me
And say you love me
I'm sorry if I fail

This to my little homies growin' up in watts
Hell yea, growin' up in the muthafuckin' projects
Or sometimes we don't get to value family
And shit as much as we should
We too worried about materialistic things and all that bullshit
There's only one thing you need to give a fuck about
