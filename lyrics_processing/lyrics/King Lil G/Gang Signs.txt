Black Cortez, It Depends On Occasions
Its Deep On The Block
With A Glock In All Places
What You Gon' Do Now?
Getting Tattoo'd Now
Groove Now
All I Wanna Do Is Wear Blue Now
Who Down, Running From The Jura
On A Shoot Out
Back To The Crib
Now We Bout To Eat A Soup Now
Where The Fuck You From?
Tell Em Where The Fuck You From
Lil Suckas Better Back Off Now
Cuz I'm Back Up Now, With a Platinum Crown
And A Trap Kidnap, For The Ransom Now
Your Baby Mama Saying That I'm Handsome Now
Tell Em My Bitches Will Drive Me

You Should Come Thru With Your Friend
Cuz I'm Feelin' Her Vibe & I Kissed Her Before

Hallucinatin' On Afghan Kush
Just Copped a Bag Full
But Not That Much
Hate On Us, But We Give 2 Fucks
One Pretty Bitch Breaking Up 2 Blunts
Hittin' Your Town
Bitches Knowing My Name
They Wanna Come Back With Me, Back To L.A
I'm Sorry But Baby Girl You Gotta Stay
5 o'Clock In The Morning
I'm Catching A Plane
Meanwhile You Should Smoke
And Just Pour Me A Drink
I Could Tell You The Stories
Bout Rollin' Up Dank
Seriously We Go Hard On The Paint
Only 13 & A Part Of The Gang
With A Blue Flag
Tellin' My Homies About My New Tats
My Enemies You Better Shoot That
Fuck Skinny Jeans & Your New Swag

You Need To Stop Inviting Me To Smoke Weed With You
If You Don't Have No Weed
Can't Be Smoking You Out All The Muthafucken Time
