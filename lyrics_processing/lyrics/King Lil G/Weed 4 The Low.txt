Yeah, I slide through in that Benzo (All white)
Everybody knowing it's official
My clic tatted up, hoes be acting up - bitch, get a hold of my pistol
I dedicate it to the rivals
Ain't no really telling what I might do
This the kind of shit I like to vibe to
Smoke weed if you'd like to
I'm West Coasting 'til I'm overdosing
Smoking the potent I hold in my lungs
Bitches getting my undivided attention
Did I mention that they feeling me like the plates on a trunk
Blue bandana even though I'm cold blooded
Self-Provoked, that's my L.A. cuz
And my clic stay busting, ra-ta-ta-ta
Notorious, man I'm ready to die
Tiffany, she don't fuck with me, tell Alexis said she was in love with me
AK4-7 company, we came from nothing to luxury
Like blah!

I got the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (I got it)
Come fuck with me on the low, come fuck with me on the low (Fuck with it)
I get the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (I got it)
Come fuck with me on the low, come fuck with me on the low (Fuck with it)

You got a gun, but ain't using it
Why the fuck you act like you shooting shit?
You ain't got no plugs, you ain't moving bricks
I made my point, you ain't moving shit
Fuck you know about a prison term? I lived and learned it
Fuck what you heard about prison murders
Fuck what you heard about my clic, we murderers
AK47, boy pack a burner
Where the fuck you from? I probably know all your big homies
I give you a number to contact, you call it... And see if they know me
I'm smoking that killa, I'm selling that killa
I'm getting that shit by the O-Z
You fake and you fuck with the police
Fool, why you be fronting? Boy, you ain't no killa

I got the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (For the low)
Come fuck with me on the low, come fuck with me on the low (On the low)
I get the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (I get it)
Come fuck with me on the low, come fuck with me on the low (Fuck with it)

A bone in the motherfucking west Side
Where they gangbang and they got the pretty model chicks with the boobs and they thick thighs
All right, let's write
Late night, no alarm we the late time
Catch flights, no breaks, jet lag, bitch you know that I take mine
Yo
We are the Elohem  if you cashed out right then I can trust in you
But if you tell me lies I'ma contribute to the same old thing that could've ended you
Tell the rate, no betrayal, frail temper, and I ain't real centered
I remain with the same crew
Venom shoot through veins, when I'm on the same page 
I'm angel, with a devilish grin
Let me tell you a little something about the message I give
My mom, my pops, my blood,  take it all in
Mom striked the bong on July twenty third
Here I am, crazy minded, about to blow superb
Dismiss common sense, I don't think like you
Critic my minds and what the fuck you do
On A High Note, I will rep it 'til the sun blows and the world's dark and still
Ain't here to prove to anyone that I got skill
Do what I got to do, fuck how you feel
Side hustles just to get me by and now I'm thinking bigger
Company shit with hella big figures
Barely back  game into my name
So I swig my liquor, run it
I got the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (I got it)
Come fuck with me on the low, come fuck with me on the low (Fuck with it)
I get the weed for the low, I get the weed for the low (I got it)
