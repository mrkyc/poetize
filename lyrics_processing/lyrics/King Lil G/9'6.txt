All I Ever Do Is Smoke Weed
Lost In The Clouds
With A Bunch Of Pretty Bitches
On The Hood That I Met Last Week
I Bump That Shit From The 90s
All Day On The Hood
Muthafucker Thats Me
What The Fuck They Know About
1996 West Coast
Who The Fuck Wants Beef?
If Its On, Then Its On
Rest In Peace Eazy-E (Eazy)

Surrounded By The Killas, Up In 9'6
Nice Wrist, Nice Whip, With a Fly Bitch
I'm Rolling 4 Deep In The Camaro
And I Keep It Fully Loaded
When I Ride Thru The Ghetto
Don't Ever Try To Get
Caught Slippin' By The Goons
If Your Homies Don't Like It
Fuck It They Can Get It Too
Old English Letters On The Wall
Trying To Bang Tough, We Was Way Too Small
But I'm Glad I Made It Thru, Boy I Put That On My Moms
Couldn't Think Straight, We Was Running From The Law
Back In High School We Would Ride For The Cause
At A House Party With A Tank Full Of NOS
Party Till The Helicopter Came Thru
Don't Never Let The Money Or The Fame Change You
I Took A Few Hoes From My Enemies
Shout Out To Jessica, Veronica & Destiny

All You Pussy Ass Bitches Better Lay Low
They Better Let My Homies Out, Free Kato
From The 213 To San Diego
Drug Dealer By The Border, Getting Pesos
I Walk Around With It Tatted On My Face
Keep That Automatic On My Waist
My Girl Keeps Trippin' But I Don't Lie
And My Girl Kept Callin' But My Phone Died
I Was Up In Long Beach By The 405
Don't Get Caught Slippin' At The Wrong Time
You Just Got A Thousand More
And You Ain't Got Money For The Child Support
Thats Why Your Baby Mama Talk Alot Of Shit About You
Don't Try To Act Brand New
No, no, no, no
Don't Try To Act Brand New
Stop Getting Bitches Names Tattoo'd, Sucka

Crazy Muthafucka Named EMC
Got Juice With The Mob That Pay Me
Got Juice On The Streets
Where The Dogs Be
I Be Worried About My Money
Fuck All Beef
I Was Just A Mexican Off Slauson
Stealing In My Area, The Law Broke Often
When I Walk Cooper, I Feel Closer To My Coffin
Your Girl Eyeballin', When She Know You Watchin'
Click So Strong They Can't Even Get Close
Taking Your Bitch, Off The Smell Of The Smoke
She Asked What I Bump, I Say The West Coast
I Asked If I Could Fuck And She Said Is That A Joke?
And Now We Smokin' On Reefer
Back To The A, Slappin' The Hoes
Jockin' The Bitches, Chucks On My Toes
I Was Born In 9'5, Now I Chase The Gold
All I Ever Do Is Smoke Weed
Lost In The Clouds
With A Bunch Of Pretty Bitches
On The Hood That I Met Last Week
I Bump That Shit From The 90s
All Day On The Hood
