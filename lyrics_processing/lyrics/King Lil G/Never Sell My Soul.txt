I'm a keep it
(King Lil G 47 Eternal)
G forever
(They gon' hate regardless)

I could've threw my life away my mother wouldn't let me
I used to trip not knowing she's tryin' protect me
She didn't understand I wanted the hood to accept me
She said the only thing that's promised is haters and envy
You never lied I see it clear mama
I fear no man, God's the only one I fear mama
I owe you everything I dedicate you dear mama
When I'm away from you the only thing I see is drama
I wanna chase the fortune and fame
Help the kids in the ghetto who's tryin' maintain
Homie I know the only thing you know is section 8
Don't let them hold you down your future gotta elevate
We couldn't pay the rent but now we in a better place
Nobody showed me how to do this, set the record straight
They sing along to my song in every other state
My own people don't support, that shit is hella fake

I will never sell my soul
All I do is count money and smoke OG
We keep it gangster from coast to coast
That's why nobody fuckin' with me
I'm a keep it G forever

If I could go back I'd change a couple things like
The whole world telling me how to think like
We was just a couple kids under the street lights
In the hood putting creases on my Levis
I put my life line on my trigger finger once
Loyalty in life is all my woman really wants
I hung around snakes so I did it solo
Faded up with anybody, Miguel Cotto
I can't believe how some of you went and snitched
Tatted on face and body, how you still gon' switch?
There's no excuse when you fold under pressure
You should've slowed it down but you went and did the extras
Time passed I ain't a kid anymore
I live my life and can't nobody tell me shit anymore
Can't nobody tell me shit anymore

I will never sell my soul
All I do is count money and smoke OG
We keep it gangster from coast to coast
That's why nobody fuckin' with me
I'm a keep it G forever
I'm a keep it G forever
