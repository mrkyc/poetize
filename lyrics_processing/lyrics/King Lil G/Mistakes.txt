Put Those Mistakes Behind Me
Cast Shadows To Remind Me
I Truly Hope God Never Gives Up On Us

Its Kinda Hard For Me To Listen To That Drake Shit
I'm Far From Being Heartbroken, Fucking Yo Main Bitch
Roll Up A Blunt With Me, Smoke A Blunt With Me
Your Enemies My Enemies, Come Shoot a Gun With Me
I Seen Some Beautiful Women In Salt Lake City
I Traveled Thru The East, Its Gangsta & Grimy In Philly
People Tell Me I Change, Well Maybe You Never Knew Me
I Have To Switch Up The Page, To A Different Chapter In My Life
I Wanna Progress
Maybe See You In Heaven And Show You What I Possess
Ambitions Like No One Else
We Did It With No Ones Help
Fuck All You People Who Criticize, Saying That I Would Fail
65 Thousand Dollar Bail
I Put Money In My Homie's Books The First Day In Jail
It Changed My Life, When I Read Your Fan Mail
I Made Mistakes In My Life And I Regret Em Fo'Real
