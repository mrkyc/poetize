She Hit The Blunt
And Then Pass It Back
Drove Slow
In That Cadillac
Talked About
Many Things In Life
Like I'm Not Your Man
But I Got Your Back
What The Fuck IS Wrong
With Your Ex-Man
Makes You Sad When He's Txtin'
You Can't Control
You Get Emotional
Like Who The Fuck Is Your Ex With
Take A Sip Of This Drink
Forget About That
We Smokin'
Forget About The Bullshit
For Just One Night
You & I We Own It
Giving Up On Love
You Don't Even Try
You Wanna Feel Good?
I Could Be That New Supply
All Of My Homies They Know
That My Feelings Is Cold
And I'm Over
There's Nothing Like Honestly
Back Then When I Lost
The Most Beautiful Girl
Never Spoken
She's Taking A Part Of Me
And I'm Done With The Old Shit
Pictures That I'm Not Even Posting
Thank God For The City That I Live In
We Smoke By The Ocean

And I'm High Ass Fuck
Its Like My Mind Rewinds
To A Time
When I Didn't Have Shit Back Then
Back When I Handed Out Sacks
In The Back Of The Black Cadillac
Just Trying To Win
I Had A Righteous Woman
Now I'm Just Fucking Models
Feeling Like They Don't Mean Shit
I Hit It & Quit
No Calls Tomorrow
No Sorrows Giving Head
In This Heart Of Gold
If Sucios Is Dirty Business
Then I Guess I'm Cold
Inhale My Pain
On To PCH I'm Drivin'
Chillin' With Her
While I'm Txtin' Her
But I Guess She Ain't Replyin'

You Supported
Could Of Been Somewhere Else In Life
But My Destiny I Rewrote It
Bumping That Drug Dealer Music
As I'm Rolling Through My Hood
Slowly Blinking
Thinking Bout The Drinks
That I Gotta Pour In My Cup
Can't Wait Till I Go To Atlanta
Then Go To Denver
And Smoke With Amanda
Hope I Can Hit Arizona
Shout Out To My Fans
