And I'm Never Gonna Tell Em
Who The Shooter was
I'm Gonna Keep On Getting High
Til The Budda Comes
Gang Signs In The Sky
We The Hooligans
And I'm Never Gonna Tell You

And I'm Never Gonna Tell You
Who The Fuck It Was
I Hesitate
So Basically I Made It To The Gang
In The Major League
Rap Game Came Through
So It Pays A G
Get Love So Much
I Don't Play With Beef
I Just Ride Homicide
Through The Enemies Hood

Got Them Shooters Moving Weight
We Come Through & Pull That K
We Like The Muthafucking Navy
I'm Trying To Save Money
I'm Hoping That God Is The One
That Could Save Me
It's Easy Concealing A Weapon
It's Almost Impossible

Keeping It Gangsta Is Hard
And I Do It But Often
