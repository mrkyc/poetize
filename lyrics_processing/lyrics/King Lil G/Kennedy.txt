Yeah, This Dedicated To My Dog In That Cell
Waiting For The Mail To Come
I Know You Probably Feel Like People Forgot About You
For My People Stuck In The Projects

Momma I'm Get You That House
You Always Wanted
In The Hills Of The City
Where Cops Never Patrol
Let Me Take You Back To '96
Where Me & Black Kids Would Co-Exist
And Race Wouldn't Exist
All We Wanted Was That 23 Jersey
By The Chicago Bulls
I Got Older
So I Had To Follow Prison Rules
They Separate Us
Give Us Guns
Want Us To Hate Us
Another Funeral
Checkmate
Homie They Played US
It's Like A Dream
We Never Wake Up From
Trying To Ignore The Pain
We Just Blaze One Up
Momma Don't Shed No Tears
My Intentions Are Great, Yeah
I'll A Get You Out Of Section 8 Now
I Know You Hope I'll Find A Righteous Girl
Remain Calm - Blindfolded
In A White Man's World
The Streets Told Me Many Secrets
Either You Dying From A Gun Shot
Or Diabetes
If They Tell You That It's Cancer
Then You'll Never Beat It
Ask The Government
They'll Tell You what It Is They Feed Us
They'll Probably Put Me On The News
And Tell You That I'm A Hoodlum
Tell You Some Lies About Me
Like The Way They Did To Muslims
Rest In Peace
That's The End Of Me
They Putting Prices On My Head
Damn Don't Forget The Kennedy's
They Putting Prices On My Head
Damn Don't Forget The Kennedy's
I'm Out

The world is very different now
For man holds in his mortal hands

I Used To Look Out My Window
My Heartbeat Didn't Match My Life's Tempo
I Was Moving Quick
Hanging With The Troubled Kids
They Would Go To Class
And I Was Trying To Hustle This
Being Was Never Easy
I Could Never Lie
Half The Time I Was Blind
Gangsta Juvenile
A Single Woman On Welfare
Never Gave Up
Under Pressure
That's The Only Way I Came Up
Now There's No Telling Where I Might Be
Trying To Forget My Pain
Smoking Till My Eyes Bleed
I'm In The Dark
Trying To Turn On My High Beams
With A Couple Drugs Stuffed In My Nike's
Cortez, Baggy Pants And A White-Tee
The Intention In My Soul
Is What Defines Me
I Wanna Be A Better Father
Than My Father Was
Become A Millionaire
And Kick It With My Youngest Son
The power to abolish all forms of human poverty
And all forms of human life
