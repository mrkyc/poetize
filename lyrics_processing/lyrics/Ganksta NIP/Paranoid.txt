Yeah, Ganksta Nip and Triple Six got you mothafucka's paranoid
Don't we, hahaa
South Park is in the house
Check it out, bitch (Check it out)

Never in your life step up
Nine milli' boom-boom, bloody bodies bein' swept up
Bitch, I'm far from soft
Keep talkin' shit, half your head'll get smothered off
Diss Nip, that's how you get sprayed
Different pieces of bodies, that's how trash piles are made
I'll come to your funeral, you know I'mma get ya
(*gunshots*) Before you die, take that with ya
Killed 800 people, 'cause the Ganksta is raging, G
(*phone beeps*) That's 801 pagin' me
Shoot a nigga at the top of a dime
Hollow point, hand grenade, followed up with a Tec-9
Blast, I shoot fast, then I smash
Bullets in your ass makes the blood trail last
Longer, but yet, I'm stronger, I come up on ya
Shoot you in your head, then dip you in ammonia
Yeah, 'til your blood turns pink
Another body decayed 'cause his insides stink
Lettin' you know that Houston is hard
Ganksta Nip and Triple Six got you mothafuckas paranoid

Niggas try to front like they so damn dope
Egypt E (What up, Nip?)
Pass the Tec-9 scope
So I can start shootin' reckless
To show these pussy niggas they can't fuck with Texas
I see a bitch, now it's time for a blow
If you down with Ganksta Nip, say "Ho"
My album, you can't understand it (Ho!)
Side 1 is Ganksta shit, Side 2'll blow up this planet
Rick Rubin, fuck you!

Fuck with Nip, your ass get done up
Last nigga tried, left pickin' his tongue up
Ganksta Nip, the media say madman
South Park Coalition, the media say mad clan
Nah, I ain't playin', skip that fairy tale jive
You make me mad by talkin' shit, I'll fuckin' eat you alive
South Park is the slangin' route
Left a nigga dead with his chest meat hangin' out
In South Park, you got to be hard

Paranoid, sittin' in a deep sweat
A-a-aw, yeah-y-yeah
Paranoid, sittin' in a deep sweat
A-a-aw, yeah-y-y-yeah

You can step up, but I'm hard as a rock
I'll cut up your guts into miniature porkchops
A nigga hit me, I picked up a pipe
Judgin' by the blood, his asshole was tight
Never sparin' no lives, no lives that I spare
Approach if you dare, you'll just be food for my bear
No runnin', but gunnin', leavin' mothafuckas dead
Fuck arms and legs, I collect peoples heads
Rampagin' and gagin', yo', some shit finna start
Had a fight in January, we just finished in March
Vanilla Ice is erased
He'll be a dead white bitch with a knife in his fuckin' face
Step to me jockin', you know I'mma cuss ya
I can simply look mean, and start a flood in Russia
You wanna battle? I'll put you in your place
Your arm is the toothbrush, your blood is the toothpaste
Cops hate me, 'cause I'm too damn mean
Turn your mothafuckin' stomach into refried fuckin' beans
Lettin' you know that Houston is hard
Ganksta Nip and Triple Six got you mothafuckas paranoid
