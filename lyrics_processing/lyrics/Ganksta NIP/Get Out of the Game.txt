Gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out the game, I'm slangin' the caine
I gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out - I'm slangin' mothafuckin' caine
Gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out the game, I'm slangin' the caine
I gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out - I'm slangin' mothafuckin' caine

I tried to get out, but I can't stop
I knock on wood, and pray I don't get popped
Nigga livin' lifestyle, don't try to do me
The cops made a bust, so my dope, I had to chew it
I almost blew it, damn, that was close
So I relocated to another post
I can't get caught, I've been to jail too many times
Can't get a legit job, so I slang to get mines
I'm in it to win it, if ya gank me, I catch you
And two weeks later, they'll find you floatin' in a bayou
Your family, they're cryin', aw, that's too bad
You've been layin' in muddy water, eaten by crawdads
This posse found out it was me, so now they're after me
A bunch of pussies, they ain't fin to come fuck with me
'Cause then I'll have to show 'em the splatter flesh drama
Do it Mafia style, and kill all they fuckin' mamas
King of the kingpins, collectin' a bankroll
You fuck me, and I shoot you, then cement ya ankles
'Cause I got a rep for takin' no shit, bitch
A serial killer, somethin' you can't fuck with
And hoes love a dope man with money
But all they get is this black pipe, 'cause I ain't no dummy
They tried to blow him while he up, and diss him when he down
That's why I cum in they ass, laugh, and skip town
"No where's does the games end" so many disputes
Bitch, get out my face, I'll pull yo' hair out by your roots
Your boyfriend owe me money, if you love him, better tell him
I wants my mothafuckin' shit before I kill him (*gunshot*)

Fuck gettin' out, my reputation is stopped
If my money ain't legit, yo' mama's heart gets ripped out
You wanna gank me, but you ain't slick
Come short, one rock?
Oh, man, nah, you finna die, bitch
It ain't funny, you think I'm a ho?
.357 to yo' head, why you ain't laughin' no mo'?
Nah, it's too late, bitch, look what you did
Now here's a (*gunshot*) to yo head
(*gunshots*) for your grandkids
Cops try to control me
It takes 852 jail cells to hold me
Diss Nip? Oh, fuck, I'mma diss you
A Uzi in my hand, yo' family gon' miss you
I ain't the one to be fucked with
9 millimeter hollow point cap in yo' ass, bitch
That crooked cop, he must think that I'm soft
I might start by shootin' up his mothafuckin' house
Got a kilo in my trunk with some lead
Mac-10 infrared scope aimed at a cop's head
Niggas geekin', and kids geekin', too
"Just say no!", Bitch, fuck you!
The Godfather, I'm always scopin'
Got them bitches in my bed, with they pussy wide open
A nigga snitched, he fucked my connection
They found parts of his daddy's head in every direction
Here come the jumpout boys, let 'em jump out
I'll get the Uzi, Dope-E, you get the pump out
And let's blast in the dark (*gunshots*)
36 crooked cops just died in South Park
Gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out the game, I'm slangin' the caine
I gotta get out the game, I gotta get out the game
I gotta get out - I'm slangin' mothafuckin' caine

Creepin' down the street of MLK just the other day
There go that nigga who owe me money, I yell, "Hey!"
He heard my voice, so he bailed down the street
'Cause he know his ass fin to get beat
Over the head with the lead of a gun, teach him don't run
That's the way a nigga be slangin' up in Houston
Yo, Nip, grab the pipe, get the bat, and the gat
(*gunshots*) Watch his guts splat, fuck, and that's that
Keep my finger on the trigger, steady watchin' my stash cash
Got to move fast, 'cause cops be watchin' my black ass
See I ain't got a pity over another brother
I'll kill yo bitch ass, and I'm serious than a mothafucka

Dope! (What up?)
Get the mothafuckin' scope (Got it!)
Don't stop shootin', 'til twenty niggas crawl (*gunshots*)
Takin' no shit while I'm slangin'
Gank me? They'll find yo' mothafuckin' lil' girl's throat hangin'
Drug related killin's, cops don't bother
16 died from the hands of the Godfather
Lettin' you know, I ain't down for braggin'
Call 911, fuck it, call the meat wagon
You'll die fuckin' with my dope
Like that nigga they found dead, bleedin' with his neck broke
Slangin' 'caine, you can never fail
But me and Dope-E'll see yo' ass in Hell
