Ouh, right there, ouh, ouh, ouh
I feel I'm finna cum, hold up
Ah oh, ohhhh
Ohohoh, you filthy bitch
I ain't never had one like you bitch, haha
Hahaha, check it out

I was lyin', I ain't in love, bitch, I wanted to bone
Get yo' ass out my car, I don't know how you gon' make it home
Said I was cummin', that's when you was droolin'
Why you just can't lick the nut like yo' sister and yo' mama do it?
I left her naked, with her body all cummy
Had her walk to the crib, and made her give me some gas money
See, I'm a pimp, from my head to my roots crib
My best friends don't even know they mama's a prostitute
Fucked a bitch on a bus undercover
Looked up and saw two old ladies playin' with each other
This hoe was gettin' mad, 'cause she couldn't make it this second
Boned a bitch on the ninth month, so she was born pregnant
I'm faithful to my freaks, I ain't waxin' no other butts
I'll go with you, if you lick my Bobby old brother nuts
Went out to eat with a bitch that I hate
So I nutted in her cup to keep her buyin' a vanilla shake
Raised up her dresser, pussy smellin' like socks
I got mad, and made her drink some period blood on the rocks
I got in my car, and started drivin' her home
She so fresh, she sucked my dick with my drawers on
Pound a hoe named Lyn, by the quarter to ten
Got to her house at 10:15, she was eatin' her best friend
Suckin' so good, it left her jaws cracked
Tell ya mama to come and get her nasty ass drawers back
I'm disgusting

Ouh, bitch
Bend yo ass over, bitch
I don't give a fuck if you 88, bitch
I done fucked a 93 year old before, ha, bitch

The other day - I had to run to my room quick
My ex gal was jackin' off with a broomstick
I thought the bitch was a acrobat
She put her head between her legs, and started eatin' her own cat
Will I ever forget it? I doubt it
I almost bust a nut just from thinkin' about it
Took off my drawers then I started to rip
I fucked her 'til her pussy said "Ah, ha, ouh, hold up, Nip"
Called 976, that's when I got took
So nasty, when we hung up, nut was comin' out the hook
It's a fact, bitches lickin' my crack
Sucked her titty through her chest, until they hung off her back
Comin' faster than fast, like a dynamite blast
I got married last week, and the week before last
I fucked a pregnant girl, 'til she started to sweat
I fucker her, 'til the baby said "Damn, boy, you ain't through yet?"
Fuckin' in shacks, dirty floors and mats
She sucked my dick, while she was gettin' ate by roaches and rats
Met a freak who wouldn't fuck, 'cause she said I couldn't get it
Ouh, you should of seen what she did to that Pitbull
My girlfriend is nasty, like me, she's a winner
She was born bustin' a nut, with a vibrator stickin' in her
Ganksta Nip would fuck a bitch on some glass
That's enough, you fuckin' slut, get yo tongue out my ass
I'm disgusting
Ah, ha
Any bitch from 14 on up
If yo' pussy can handle my dick, I'mma fuck you, bitch

I'm disgusting, like I said, I'll fuck in a shed
Pull out my dick, I'm finna cum, and let it drip in her head
Some say I'm nasty, some say I'm a freak
Let me catch you while you sleep, I'll stick my dick in your teeth
I'll fuck you on your period, so it can't go to waste
Grab a hand full of blood, and wipe that shit in your face
Ganksta Nip is disgustin', you better beware
Do these bitches suck dick? (Hell yeah!)
They let me do it without fussin' and cussin'
On second thought, you stupid bitch, Ganksta Nip ain't disgustin'
You know it, I'm deaf, put your pussy on a shelf
Stick my dick in a piano, watch it play by itself
'Cause I'm disgusting

Bitch, I'll fuck yo mama after 875 niggas just done fucked her
Haha
You be horny to get y'all to fuck a fuckin' animal
Ahahaha
I'd like to say peace to Joyce, you slut, ahaha
Peace to The Terrorists, peace to O.G. Style, The Convicts
The Geto Boys, Too Much Trouble, First Offence
High Pain Clan, my nigga C-Rocks in the house
