That's a promise from the good hands speech

H-Town niggas ain't soft, bitch
I get a brick, and bust you in your mouth, bitch

Ganksta Nip, I own this place
Mean enough to shoot a dead pitbull in the face
Aw, yeah, I'm hype tonight
Which one of you weak mothafuckas wanna fight?
Whoever you are, whoever you be
Don't come to Houston with that bullshit, G
'Cause if you do, you finna get dropped
Go insane, leave a mothafuckin' bomb in your mailbox

Bullet hit him in his head, and came out through his spine
Ganksta Nip, a terrible man
I cut a ladies throat just for shakin' my hand
East coast, West coast, yeah, all that's fine
Say Houston is weak, I'll stab you 69 times
Other cities, they think that we're suckers
It ain't about cows and horses, mothafucka

He'll kill your parents, but I'll kill your children
In 4 words, I'mma rate you

9 millimeter leavin' blood stains in a ditch (*gunshots*)
People think Houston is just a cowboy town
Pop that shit inside my face
You'll hear that (*gunshots*) sound
Never call the Ganksta fake
Throw a bomb in a crowd just to see how many niggas break
Yo, I'll be damned if I quit
Kickin' that hard ass H-Town gangsta shit
'Cause that's how it is down here
It's slangin' that dope, smokin' weed, and drinkin' beer
I'm puttin' Houston on the map
You think I give a mothafuck if y'all don't clap?
Front me with that shit, then, I'mma have to whoop you
And after that, Triple Six gon' cook you
In H-Town, you can't act like a sucker
