Ganksta motherfucking NIP, Point motherfucking Blank
Dope motherfucking E, K motherfucking Rino
SPC in full effect
If you run up you will leave with no neck
Hahaha

This goes out to gangster G, a test for your crew 'cause you're wack
I'm handing out ass whoopings, take one and pass 'em back
When I catch you I'ma end my frustration
Give your shotgun the black asshole resuscitation
I play games so A&M thinking I'm a vet
Fuck a tail, play pin the knife in the sucker's chest
Legend of H-Town throwing a fit
Rock the mic 'til it was on the ground bleeding, saying, "Oh shit!"
Little 2 foot punk tryna crash town
I wish you would run up boy, I'll slap your little ass down
Radical rhymes beat a trick like a bat
Charles Manson saw what I did and said, "Damn, why I ain't think of that?"
K-Rino's first offence coming fast
If I'm tired I might make a motherfucker whoop his own ass
I ain't lying, my bite'll murder my bark
K-Rino, the rough brother from South Park

Guess what? I got my nigga Dope-E coming up behind me
Watch what you doing with that knife, man?
I'm finna kick a rhyme so you better watch you back
Ready to attack
The rhyme Dope ain't it sick

The holocauster Dope-E rolling with the Terrorists
Labeled as the scariest bombs are planted when I'm very pissed
Egypt-E'll chain ya down like Barne
And shove a stick down your throat, 'til you gag and vomit
Terrorism continues shut your motherfuckin' mouth
The South is in the house, South Park think so
'Cause that's where the Dope-E chill
Sometimes I feel I got a serial kill for real
Biogenetic look it up and let it be imbedded that Dope-E said it
So give me my fucking credit or you will be beheaded
In other words chopped, you can be a citizen or a fucking cop
It's a bomb threat and we'll blow you hoes up
With lyrics from Hell, dead bodies I ain't givin' up
Me, Dope-E I'm hard, black, and dark
One of the hardest motherfuckers in South Park, bitch

Yeah
Check it out
Correlation nationwide, damn fool
And my boy from Illinois, bringin' the noise
Point Blank
Yeah, what's your name nigga?

Point Blank, a rough motherfucker from South Park
Taking no shit and I'm straight up hard
Some people say I'm mentally reactive
A psycho Prone To Bad Dreams, so I sleep in a straight jacket!
When I was young, I used to do lot of crazy things
Like sticking my head back and forth under a guillotine
I felt bad 'cause my mom didn't trust me
Maybe 'cause I lit that  in her pussy, shit
I never meant to be a bad boy
Didn't want to be a sad boy, now I'm a MAD boy
Killing motherfuckers just for looking at me
I got upset and choked the shit out my granddaddy, man
I ain't playing, I think I need to be killed
Had to fuck niggas up just get my prescription filled
'Cause I fiend over dead bodies after dark
'Cause I'm a rough brother from South Park
Yeah
I got my homeboy Ganksta motherfuckin' Nip in the house
A psycho ass nigga
Dissing your crew straight out of South motherfuckin' Park!
Kick that shit

Arms, legs, heads, necks and throats
All of the symptoms of 26 dead goats
Cocaine, yeah it got me addicted
Saw a cat on the ground dead, I hugged it and licked it!
A taste of blood just give me smidgeon
Tried sexual intercourse with a motherfuckin' pigeon
South Park is the ponderosa
You think I won't hit your ass? Shit come closer
'Cause I killed the best
I was born in a dead fishhead in my brother's chest
Don't come talking that pig shit
'Cause if you do, rip out and get your motherfucking wig split
Triple 6 was born with 10 legs
He only uses 2 cause the other 8 is dead
I wouldn't stop chopping till only Troy legs was left
In less than a minute, his insides bled to death
A&M better get that mud up
Troy on the ground, bleeding, I'm lickin' his blood up
Ganksta Nip, a psycho indeed
I won't stop whoopin' your ass till your motherfuckin' blood bleed
Bitch, I can't be beat
My mama hit me yesterday her funerals next week
That's how it is in the dark
Ganksta Nip is the roughest mothafucker In South Park
And I mean that shit!
Yo, Triple 6
Let the Devil take over your hand on that table
And tear that mothafuckin' break up
