Yo, Yo, Yo
Ganksta Nip is in the house
I'm finna pimp some of these bitches like I do in the park everyday
Haha

I'm that Ganksta Mac
Add more bank to the stack
Girls step out broke, but bring me 3 or 4 grand back
Started at 18, makin' a kill
Out of 25 grand, I might kick her a dollar bill
Check the cut every night about 10
See a trick tryin' to slap one of my bitches again
I had to be cool, the last dude I mopped up
Left his ass bleedin' in a garbage bag chopped up
Ganksta Nip got so much clout
By the time I stepped up, Triple Six done took him out
So I fade, It's time to get paid
Bitches I played still cuttin' for me like switchblades
In South Park, I'm sharp as cactus
Punks I hate, plus, my gun, equals Mac-10 target practice
I wish a nigga would think he's payin' me
See his girl on the street in a G string payin' me
Think it's a game? You think I'm trippin'? Cool
Ask your little sister why in the fuck she been skippin' school
Her brother stepped up, he wasn't quick enough
Now he's bleedin' on my shoes, man, y'all better come pick him up

I step in infinity, so many people, I walk through 'em
Brothers lookin' at me like I'm supposed to speak to 'em
See a bitch that I want, so I get - closer to her
Nip don't care who she came with
You better learn that I'm not concerned
Somebody better tell 'em that hot bullets burn
If your girl chase me, don't try to catch her
You'll be a big black bold nigga layin' in a stretcher
My bitches play every corner, chillin'
I get bank from all of 'em, 'cause they pussy makes a killin'
Willin' to make a sacrifice for your life
I'm nice to my hoes, ask my mothafuckin' wife
I get paid when she get paid (What if a nigga take the pussy?)
The mothafucka gets sprayed (*gunshot*)
Ganksta NIP, I'm never alone
Call your girl from the job, I bet her answer the phone
Slap a bitch in a minute, 'cause I love to fight
This bitch didn't make my money, so she lost her eyesight
South Park pimp makin' a stack
Ganksta pimp ass Nip aka Ganksta Mac
Keep countin' the stacks ('Cause I'm the Ganksta Mac)
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks (I'm the Ganksta Mac)
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks

I don't need a job, 'cause I run shit
If business is slow, that's a bitch in a ditch
One of my hoes didn't reach her quota
She was last seen bleedin' in North Dakota
I saw this bitch, I started runnin' game
Her credit cards and checkbooks are now in my name
She asked me for a quarter, so I slapped her
She asked me for a dollar, I damn near snapped her
My game is tight, I play cards right
My favorite time of the day is the mothafuckin' night
Didn't know when to stop, so in jail, I got dropped
Somethin' told me not to throw that hand grenade at that cop
Niggas, come quick, your ass better run
I'm havin' a sale on bitches: 2 for the price of 1
See, I'mma pimp, hoes better please me
Always remember that pimpin' ain't easy
Ganksta NIP'll slap a bitch real quick
Either with my hand, or with a big ass fuckin' stick
'Cause to me, she's nothin' but a stack
I bet you didn't know your mama was like that
Bitch
Keep countin' the stacks ('Cause I'm the Ganksta Mac)
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks
Keep countin' the stacks (Yeah)
