Yo, yo, yo. What's up? It's your boy Ganksta Nip, unahwhaimsayn?
Showin love for everybody
Lettin everybody know it's a new millennium. We gotta get our minds right
We can't go into the new millennium with the old mind state
Which is ignorance, know what I'm sayin?
We gotta come together, pull our resources
Praise God... and hope... for the best

I over came everything
Every obstacle tryin to hold me down
And young G that's a shame (that's a shame)
The way brothers do brothers cold (mane)
It ain't worth sellin your soul to go gold
And that ain't real, and I'ma tell you the deal
Homies locked in the pen, tryin to get in the pill
I gotta, keep strivin and raise on up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I keep God in my heart I stay so smart
Billboard psychopath, and I'm holdin the charts
I can't be held down (bang-bang, I can't be held)
Hold up, I think I just saw the five-o's roll up
Never ever on the street can I let somebody drop me
My determination is to great to let somebody stop me
Psycho Nip, South Park, A soldier with heart
And I got love for Lil J for givin me my start (Lil J)

I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff

Rest in peace Fat Pat, cause cops gon' drop
Same thing Big Steve, cause the love don't stop
Bobby Boy, ESG, and Lil Keke
And bring it back to DJ Screw and I'm the psych N-I-P
And C-Note, Mad Hatter playa keep on sippin
Herschelwood understood D-E-A ain't trippin
We showin love everybody comin with skills
KB Swishahouse north side keepin it real
And we ain't trippin, even bout no plexin' man
Holla at the South Park Mexican
For real, this the deal, Psycho Nip come with skills
Robert Muhammad, mosque 45, knowledge to build
But I'ma psycho thug I come from down south
And I'm holla at Lo' Light, 5th Ward Boys in the house
And Double-O, E-Roc, Yellow Twins ain't afraid
And if it wasn't for Scarface I woulda never got paid
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff

And I'm from H-Town, where we hustle for skrilla
Where my hustlers move keys young playa we killas
All Day MLK these boys slang yay
Ounce, six quarters, halfs, and bust AK's
We roll thick, trick, we mortal with guns
And if we don't hit the weed lounge
We gon' hit the leshons, for real
Who's the rapper to put South Park and the map
It was me N-I-P Psycho Nip with a strap, for real
