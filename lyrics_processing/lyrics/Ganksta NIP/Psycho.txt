A psycho ass nigga, I'm dissin' your crew
If you don't like the way I rap, tough shit, nigga, fuck you
It's time for a murder, I'm finna kick ass
Breast feed newborn babies with unleaded gas
Blood gushin' out your head, it's gettin' thicker and thicker
Pour some chocolate on your arm, so it can taste like a Snicker
Push your ass off a buildin', check to see if you're dead
Flash back on second grade, pencil sharpen your fuckin' head
I'm strapped with the Uzi, so get ready to die
Catch a nigga while he sleep and strike a match in his eye
I'll sneak in your house and kill your ass for fun
Check to see if you're still sleepin', burn a hole in your tongue
Bloody bodies in caskets, the measures are drastic
Dead babies in my house, suffocated by plastic
Think you can beat me? You gotta' be jokin', ho
Threw a brick in Houston, Texas, broke a window in Tokyo
Your sister stole my money, that's alright, I'mma slam her
Catch that bitch by herself, and finger fuck her with a hammer
Throw your daughter in the air, hope that bitch break her leg
Be nice, and help her up, then kick her dead in the head
No bullshittin', you must be smokin' that rock, ho
Snatch some meat out your stomach, so I can make me a taco
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is when you fuckin' with a psycho
