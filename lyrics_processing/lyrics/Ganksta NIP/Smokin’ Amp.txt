Yo, Triple Six, pass the mothafuckin' amp square
Nigga, everybody else wanna get fucked up, too
Man, hold on, man
I ain't even hit the mothafuckin' good yet, nigga
Well, go-, well, go on hit the bitch one more time, hit it!
(coughs)
Le-Let me hit it
(coughs) Oh, I feel like killin' a mothafucka!
Yo, check it out

It starts off in my house smokin' amp
Fiendin' for blood like a mothafuckin' vamp
I kept hittin', now my brain's on fire
I felt like stuffin' mothafuckas in a dryer
So I take my last puff
Then I shot my mothafuckin' next door neighbor for good luck
I jetted to the car
Strapped with a fork, and a 20 blade chainsaw
I'm rollin' down a block
That's when I saw this pussy ass cop
Pissed in his car, like I said in Slaughter
Banana clip, (*gunshots*), to his daughter
He pulled his gun, I reached for my axe
And drew "Texas" in blood in his mothafuckin' back
I wasn't through, he said I was soft
Flashbacks from walkin' tall, cut his mothafuckin' legs off
Jumped in the ride, then I fired up another square
So damn potent, had me pullin' out my fuckin' hair
Stopped at a store to get a 40
Somethin' in the air said, "It's time to get naughty"
I got pissed, and took me a beer
(*gunshots*) down with the cashier
She died in my violent caper
(what happened next?) Then Triple Six raped her
This nigga started screamin' for Heaven
He tried to run, but he died on isle seven
Now it's time to break camp
Fuckin' with that mothafuckin' amp

(Coughs) Ooh, Nip, man, I'm fucked up, mane
Here, man, take this shit
Ouh, me, too, I'm finna kill a bitch

Back on the block, sounds messin' with my head
Peekin' for some amp, eyes blood shot fuckin' red
So I drive to a Burger King
Lookin' real mothafuckin' mean
Thinkin' about a hearse
Shot the people in front of me, 'cause I wanna order first
(May I help you brother?)
(*Gunshots*) Help that, mothafucka!
Cut out his heart, then he fell to his knees
It tasted like a whopper with cheese
Saw some people at a table eatin'
It's Halloween, time for trick or treatin'
I walked over, their little boy got scared
He kissed his mother, then he gave me his fuckin' head
She got mad and hit me in the chin
So I stabbed her in the neck with a 20-foot stickpin
Her little girl kicked me dead in my chest
For 20 days, I was kickin' her in her fuckin' breasts
I tried to stay calm
Drainin' urine samples out her mothafuckin' arm
Her daddy, he thought he was hard
I went insane, pulled the veins out his spinal chord
I had visions of a lamp
Fuckin' with that mothafuckin' amp
Damn, Triple Six, man, this our last amp square, man, damn
For real man?
Hell yeah
Fuck it, aye, look
Aight
(*Lights*)

Rollin' once again with the amp controllin' me
I wonder whats the fuck's comin' over me?
I hit the amp, now it's time for a sequel
Drivin' on the sidewalk, hittin' people
I saw this little sweet old lady
Yo, Nip, you gon' kill her?
Yeah, maybe
She started walkin' 'cross the street
Finna get her mothafuckin' ass beat
Blew my horn, she should of been listenin'
Hit her ass so hard, her head rolled to Michigan
Innocent bystanders dead, 'cause I dropped one
Like Scarface said, "I popped one"
I kept hittin', and kept gettin' mean
Shot every mothafucka I saw under 13
There go the cops, it's time for death
Loaded up the 12 gauge, and killed myself, fuck it, I'm dead
Goddamn, Triple Six, man
This mothafuckin' amp got me wantin' to
Commit suicide like a mothafucka
Man, take this shit from me
Damn, man, you did that shit alone, man
If It's gon' make you want to kill yourself
Hell yeah, man, you right, man
