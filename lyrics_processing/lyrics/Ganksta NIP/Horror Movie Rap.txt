A tisket, a tasket, a bloody, bloody basket
Cut his head and ate his leg - now he's in a casket
A tisket, a tasket, NIP and Dope E did it
He tried to get smart, so we ripped out his heart
Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed
You want a new leg? Give me some needle and thread
So I can sew you one - 'cause I'm in it to win it
My horoscope said I'mma die in 20 minutes
Ganksta NIP, I'm worse than Freddy
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm dead already
Egypt E is the mothafuckin' shrink (Damn right!)
After 12 o'clock, my blood turns hot pink
Nah, you weak-ass hoes can't dub it
A thousand dead cut up elephants in my luggage
Fuck with a psycho, you'll end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection (*gunshot*)
Woke up this mornin' with a dead dog on me
So I thought, "Huh, bologna!"
If a nigga run up, I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around, and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with NIP, you must be tired of livin'
Cut off your head - mmh, Thanksgiving
If you wanna live, yo' ass better beg
People say I'm crazy 'cause I go with a cow's leg
Don't run up, 'cause I kick like Bruce
I wanna, and I'm gonna trade heads with a moose
Ganksta NIP with the psycho voice
Some say I'm insane 'cause I married a dead horse
It's Christmas time - Happy New Year, G
A dead pig's head makes a good ass Christmas tree
Kill a nigga for a measly ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up, and watch your black neck bend
Dead men walkin' 'round, cuttin' throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie, I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today, now there's footballs on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, Point Blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick, then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with NIP, I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talkin' shit to a tractor
I'm gettin' pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screamin' "Caesar!"
Quick, to break your mothafuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant, and said it was mine
Ganksta NIP, I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV, they put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap
You might also like
A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't NIP's fault that he got crazy thoughts
Blame it on the TV
A tisket, a tasket, you might think I'm sick
If you don't like what I write, you can suck my dick
