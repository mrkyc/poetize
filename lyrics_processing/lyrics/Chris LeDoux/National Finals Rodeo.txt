From ol' Cheyenne to Houston they never cause too much fear
But let me tell you about one that will chill your very soul
It happens in December when it's snowin' and it's cold
In Oklahoma City there's a building of concrete
It's where the toughest stock and men will gather and compete
The points have all been tallied and the stock has all been brought
We've got just two more hours cause it starts at eight o'clock
It's the Finals the NFR the Series of the sport
Hey rookie can you take ten head have you got the heart
You think you're a tough cowboy we'll find out in the end
When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen
The coliseum's quiet except for the sounds
Of cowboys getting ready and the workmen of the grounds
The cowboys ask each other, what each other's got
"Did you draw ol' Necklace or pluck old Double-Ought
The tension now is mounting as the crowd starts pouring in
A shiver goes all through me like from a cold cold wind
I hear the horses comin' runnin' down the alleyway
They're snortin' and a blowin' as men shut the sliding gates
It's the Finals the NFR...
We had too much time a while ago but not enough time now
The Anthem is now over the grand entry's going out
I sit there on my bronc I'm ready and I wait
I hear a chute gate open so I look out through the gate
A horse comes boiling out and blows up at the roof
And then there comes another kicking like a curly wolf
I hear the chute boss holler through the yelling of the crowd
He says there's one ahead of you so you'd better get screwed down
It's the Finals the NFR...
You might also likeI nod my head, I'm in a daze the horse goes boiling out
I run my spurrs into his neck and then I drag 'em out
My mind is in a blur my eyes are seeing red
The flank catch slams into my back, his rump bangs on my head
From somewhere in the background I can hear a buzzer sound
My hand's jerked from the riggin and I crash into the ground
I stumble to my feet as I stagger to the wall
I wonder to myself is it really worth it all
