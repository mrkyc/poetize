Bus headed north one headed south
I call a farm in Colorado
And I lift a dusty pay phone to my mouth
She says hello I say it's me hon
Sorry I stayed away so long
Tell the kids thier old man's through with playin' rodeo
Cause if it's alright with you I'm comin' home
Well there's silence on the line
She says you sure did take your time
But I still need a man for the things a man is good for
You know how it is raisin' crops and raisin' kids
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
So come on git on home there's hay that needs a mowin'
A boy that needs a whippin' and a hundred things to do
I hope you've finally found your mind
To leave that rodeo behind
I've spent half my life just waitin' here for you
I guess that nows the time I'd better tell her
Hon I've got this old friend that's here with me
He used to be a cowboy and a good one so they say
But now his legs are crippled he can't walk you see
But hon you ought to hear him tell his stories
Sing the old songs play the guitar too
I'd really like to show him Colorado
But I thought I'd better leave it up to you
You might also likeWell there's silence on the line
And now I hear her sayin'
Babe I only need a man for the things a man is good for
And you know how it is a place just half this big
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
Put yourself in his place it'd awful hard to face
All the chores and work and nothing he could do
If you want to know my mind leave that rodeo bum behind
Don't waste our time I'm waitin' here for you
Well cryin's just for kids I put down the phone
Fumble with my crutches movin' slow
I wish that I was on the bus that's Colorado bound
