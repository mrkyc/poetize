Tonight's rodeo is over, but the fight had just begun
He was pounded into the ground, while chasin after his dream
He ain't one to laying down and livin in misery
You gotta cowboy up, dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle give it one more try
Sweat and blood it takes all you got
Cause the road to heaven is a hell of a ride
The tough get goin when the goin gets rough
Cause they know they gotta cowboy up
He stopped at a roadside bar to have him a beer or two
He was laying it on the jukebox when he saw her across the room
He asked her for a dance cause he had a case of love at first sight
But he didn't take it personal when she said your not my type
You just cowboy up, dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle give it one more try
Sweat and blood it takes all you got
Cause the road to heaven is a hell of a ride
The tough get goin when the goin gets rough
Cause they know they gotta cowboy up
From business suits to cowboy boots it hurts when you get thrown
But if your gonna be th ebest you can you gotta get back on

Get back in the saddle give it one more try
Sweat and blood it takes all you got
Cause the road to heaven is a hell of a ride
The tough get goin when the goin gets rough
