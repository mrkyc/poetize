(Shut up !)
Take the C and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, yo', rock that, yo'
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)

You might also likeThree words to the whack, step yourself back
Just gettin' down, and you then you're givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with the radical sacks
On time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you're funkin' up, be sure to pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, Oh, yeah
Cause we are the Jam On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come people check out the sound
