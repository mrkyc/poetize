You came into my life
You just made everything right
And even though
My man has left me behind
I don't regret a thing for having you
Thanks for my child
I'm really thanking you
The man above
Thanks for my child
You brought me so much joy
This bundle of love
Thanks for my child
And though your father
He ran away free
The love I have for you, baby
Is the love I have in me
Ooh, oh
I'll stay and watch you grow
Yes, I will
I'll raise you by myself
A one-woman show
You might also likeYou make life worth singing a song
With you
Right here with me
I'll have the strength to go on
Thanks for my child
I'm really thanking you
The man above
Thanks for my child
You brought me so much joy
This bundle of love
I'll hold you in my arms
I hold you close to me
Rock a bye, my baby
I'll rock you to sleep
I understand your language
Your baby talk
You forgot to crawl
Before you walked
There you are
Just looking so beautiful
And all the while
You're wrapped in blankets
You are my love child
Thanks for my child
Here we are today
The years have gone by
Thanks for my child
You grew before my eyes
Time after time
Thanks for my child
And though your daddy
He ran away free
The love I have for you, baby
Is the love I have in me
Inside of me
The love I have in me
Oh
I just know
I'll never let you go
No, no
No, no, no, oh, yeah
'Cause you're my sweet baby
Papa can't preach
Papa was a rolling stone
Because he left his beautiful
Cause he left us all alone
But that's okay
'Cause I'm your mother, baby
I carried you for nine months
And I'm gonna carry you
Until you can carry yourself on your own
I love you, sweetheart
