I like the way he looks
I even like the way he smells
I don't know
Could be me but
Guess I'm in love

You came on to me
And you had it going on
Yes you did
Na na na na now I'm a fool for your love
But you knew that all along

Mama tell why I feel this way
Is it real or should I not feel
Please someone help me
My friends think that I'm tripping but I can't let go
Why I don't know

Guess I'm in love
That's the reason why I trip and get delirious
When I'm next to you
I'm in love (I'm in love)
And I got to let the whole world know it's serious
I'm in love

Girls! (What!)

When I hear your voice
Boy it gives me such a rush (When we touch it's too much)
Just the mention of your name
Puts a smile on this girl's face that you can't erase

Every time I see you smile I get wild
You got me acting like a child
Do you feel the same
It doesn't even matter
Cause I know that you'll be mine
I guess love is really blind

Guess I'm in love
That's the reason why I trip and get delirious
When I'm next to you
I'm in love (I'm in love)
And I got to let the whole world know It's serious
I'm in love
I'm in love
That's the reason why I trip and get delirious
When I'm next to you
I'm in love (I'm in love)
And I got to let the whole world know It's serious
Guess I'm in love
Hey girls are you really in love?
Don't be shy
Just give him a call

Every time I see you smile I get wild
You got me acting like a child
Do you feel the same
It doesn't even matter
Cause I know that you'll be mine
I guess love is really truly blind

Guess I'm in love
That's the reason why I trip and get delirious
When I'm next to you
I'm in love (I'm in love)
And I got to let the whole world know It's serious
Guess I'm in love

I love you
Guess I am in love
That's the reason that I'm tripping (delirious)
Every time I'm next to you (I'm in love)
And I got to let this whole world know (I'm serious)
Oh I'm in love
