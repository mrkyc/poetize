Sometimes you can take but so much
Well, I think I've had enough
Ooh (How can you hurt the one the one you love?)
Oh-oh-oh

No more pain
No more suffering
No more physical abuse from you
From this day on
You will hurt me no more
(Can't take it anymore)  I can't take it anymore

How can you hurt the one you love?
(How can you hurt the one you care for?) Mhm
From this day, on there will be no more

My body has suffered
You keep on hitting me
Every time you say sorry
See, I keep forgiving
But when will this end?
I keep asking again, oh, oh-oh
(It ends right here and now)
It's gonna stop, stop right here and now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

From this day on, there will be no more

You used to say (You used to say)
That you love me so much
But you were killing me softly (Killing me softly) with every touch
And I was a fool, yeah
'Cause you were so cruel, yeah, yeah
I'm not taking it anymore
No, no, no, no-no-no-no, no-no
Never again will you knock me down to the floor
I used to love you
I, I, I, I used to love
But you never loved me

How can you hurt the one that you love? Oh, oh, hey
From this day on, there will be no more pain
(How can you love when there is no love there?)
How can you love when there's no love there?
From this day on, you keep your hands to yourself
Oh, oh, no more physical and mental pain
No, no, would you stay away
Ooh-ooh, oh, hey
How can you hurt the one that you love?
