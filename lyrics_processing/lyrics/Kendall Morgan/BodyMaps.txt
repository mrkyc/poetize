Let me draw a map on your body
Of where I want you to take me
Oh, yeah we're just getting started
And you're already shaking
I know you want me, babe
I can see in your eyes
Is this the part of love
Where I get to see you naked
Lately all I think about is what we'll never do
And I know that deep down inside
You're thinking it too
Oh, I really like the sound of you
The sound of you
The sound of you
The sound of you

Wasted rooftop games
Taking pebbles to the face
Barb wire wounds
Bloody mess leaving a trace
Of where we once were
Jumping over buildings and machines
To look out upon the city
As aliens with human dreams
Flashback to a time when all we had was our armor
Building walls to break them down
With the shit that seems to harm us
You might also like
With the shit that seems to harm us
Building walls to break them down
With the shit that seems to harm us

Self loathing prematurely
On this mound you call a hill
Just like the ones who fought beside me
On the weathered battlefield
(2x)

Intratelevisions
Explaining missions after missions
We've been delivered by the gods
And given bottles to believe in
The puppets learn religions
Blinded by their saints and sins
And this war that they've been fighting
Isn't with the world but lies within
Preaching silence to beginners
Turning fables into mirrors
Throwing everything away
To make the standing water clearer
And they say the end is near us
It's not the end, it's the first chapter
The distant lands are not so distant
And love defeats disaster
The distant lands are not so distant
And love defeats disaster
So what you're implying is that
You have the inability to express yourself
