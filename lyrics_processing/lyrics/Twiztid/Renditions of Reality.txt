When you slip into reality
Ho's want to straddle me
Player haters wanna battle me
But I shed them all like calories
Prophecy preacher, lend your ear and I'll reach ya
And if your willing to be taught I'mma teach ya
I'm not a people person, truth is I can't stand too many people
So many fake the funk and perpetrate and call me evil
But evil is a harsh word, tell the mockingbird that I said it
A man of my word I won't regret it
If I let it get to me like it get to them I'm no better
The same message over and over with different set-up
Player hating is a art of a scandalous and shifty person
Some do it oh so well I'll be damned if they don't rehearse it
Disperse it to people like me and you everyday
And they expect the common man to turn his cheek and walk away
And now I pray for an end of the madness, no more sadness
Should fall to my people that preside to be the baddest
And all that they do and say
But overshadowed by a cloud turning night to day
It's so tremendous that you couldn't even walk away
If you chose to you even suppose to
Watch the ones you close  to, now that's insane
Tell me will it change, I'm confused, not a thing to lose
This shit is far from positive and saddens like the blues
Paying dues ain't the only part of duties that bestow to the chosen
Spitting lyrics in the microphone and
Dodging player haters 'til my temper hit the ceiling
And this how they got a nigga feeling
I done fell into reality
You might also like
My renditions of reality
Call it bad or good
Wrong or Right
Note! Believe in me
Believe in me
And I believe in you
Everything is alright

One day it's going to hit me like a ton of bricks
I'm feeling so sick, one of my dogs passed and shit
I'm feeling like killing 'em all, but what's that solve
He's still goin be dead in the morning, why take the fall
Inside I be so mad I'm finna burst
Instead of Chevy's, my homie's rolling in the back of a hearse
You know what's worse
It's too hard to cope with some days
Murderous ways leaving me shaking in a daze
Comatose, completely tore up
Nerves be so bad I want to throw up
I'm about to blow up
In a rage, I need to talk nobody want to listen
On the corner, murder mind state condition
Overload, pull the trigger
Stress got the best of suicide, pour out some liquor
Another grave digger gets paid
Digging our grave for senseless ways
Keep to ourselves and stay paid
All of my dogs can't die
I visit the sky and reminisce when I'm high
I'm never going to lie
I got love for peoples, dead or alive
Or we can smoke out in the ride in my memory
Reality is just a fragment
A fragment inside of my soul
My eyes are closed
My head is spinning
My head is spinning
I swear to god I don't know

This is a musical masterpiece, dedicated to down riders
Keep it in your clique, fuck the outsiders
People hating on everything and everything's the same
Everybody is a player and life is a silly game
It's a damn shame, daddy died eleven years today
I wonder if he know I'm doing straight
Could you tell him something if you see my pops before I do?
Let him know that he's remembered by my crew
And everyday, in my mind, anyplace, anytime
Looking in the sky for the seventh sign
I walk around, nobody knows what I do
Sealing fates and date rapes
As my body transcends through this portal of life
Smoking blunts, wronging my rights
I live for the night because I melt in the light
Completely out of site for facts so unknown
So grotesque never stated on microphones
So alone in this fucked up world, it sucks dick
Everybody got a problem with something and you can bet
I be the last one, more like the last dragon
No swords to ever let this world contort
The way you're thinking, it's so essential
It gives us all the potential
To take over the world in our mentals
If I can't live my life the way I want to live my life
Then why can't I die, why can't I die
My renditions of reality
Bad or good
Wrong or Right
Believe in me, I believe in you
Rendition of reality
Alright, Note

Bad or good, wrong or right
Believe in me and I'll believe in you and everything's tight
Reality is a fragment inside my soul
My eyes are closed, head's spinning and I don't know
It's just reality, bad or good, wrong or right
Believe in me and I'll believe in you and everything's tight
Reality is a fragment inside my soul
My eyes are closed, head's spinning and I don't know
And I don't know...
???
Since you're too fuckin' lazy to turn this shit off (Right)
And seein' how you're just sitting there listenin' doin' nothin' (Mhm)
We figured we'd tell you a story (Okay)
Let's see if you can figure out what I'm trying to say (Alright)
Yeah
(What do you got to say? Say it, spit it out)
(Come on)
There once was a ninja named Jack Picklebush (Oh yeah?)
He lived in the thre-one-three (Three-one-three) area code
(I know that guy)
Now this kid wasn't no ordinary ninja because his nut bag
Was four (Four) times the size of his head (Whoa) (Nut bag)
Everybody in the neighborhood calls him Fat Sack Jack
Now his three (Three) homeboys, Ron, Don, and Jon
From over on eighth (Eighth) St. (I know Ron)
Used to dash home from school
Just so they could jump up and down
And play on Jack's fat fuckin' ball sack (That's gotta be painful)
Now, the other day
While they was hoppin', and flippin', and having fun
Jon ripped a huge ass crease right up the ass of his Wranglers
He wasn't wearin' any drawers
But the fact that his naked ass fell out
Wasn't what embarrassed Jack
What did, however
Was that all his friends now knew his lifelong secret
Jon has two (Two) anuses
That's right, double rosebuds
Now, everybody got a great laugh on, including Fat Sack Jack
And when they finally finished bustin' on Jon
They noticed it was eight (Eight) o' clock (That's pretty late)
Time for Monday night wrestling (Ah, wrestling)
And so they all ran over to Don's house
Because he's the only one (One) that has cable
After wrestling was over, they all grabbed some Faygo's
And some Swisher Sweets packed with buds
(Oh yeah gotta have the weed)
And they all laid out on fat sac Jack's fat fuckin' ball bag
And stared up into the stars (Comfortable)
When they finally got home and went to bed
Shit, it was something like two (Two) in the morning
(That's pretty late)
Now, figure it out, smart ass (Stupid ass)
(Who you calling a smart ass?)
(Put it together)
(Figure it out)
(Uh, I don't get it)
(It's a puzzle)
(What're you supposed to do with it?)
(Fuck off)
(Figure it out)
(I don't get it, where'd he go?)
(Hey, here'd that guy go that was tellin' the story?)
(I'ma wait here, go see if you can get him)
(He just walked away, done, that was it?)
(What the fucks going on?)
(No "see ya later"?  "Bye"? I mean, I got the story, but )
(Word up)
(Fuck off)
