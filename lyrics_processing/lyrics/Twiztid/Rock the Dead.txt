They're all dead...

Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on

Space symbiote, mind of an idiot
I stole your headstone from your grave plot
Conscious and confused
See tomorrow's dreams on tonight's news
Falling through a hole in the sky, will I die
And all the time I've applied with this life, love and lie
Slipping into darkness
Walking through my conscience
Like an android I remain heartless
Underground and middle know me well
Bring ya to the white lights or the depths of Hell
Walk through the time flux hand in hand with clear mind
Thoughts are harmonious like the rhythm of wind chimes
Peel back the rind and examine the fruit
Rotten to the core buried in they best suits
Maggots crawling out they face
Eyes sunk in they head
Throw your fucking arms up and rock the dead
You might also like
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead

Screaming like ahh
I can't even take it no more
Release the straps on my jacket and let me go
Ill medication got my whole body shaking
Thinking escaping
But they gonna keep on chasing
I'm facing off with the world and the planet
Dig a hole
Buried alive like good goddammit
It ain't a living thing
It's a no fuck given thing
Bring the pain
And I'ma bleed with the reign
Insane when I leave this bitch
I got the whole world screaming out, you ain't shit
They'll be the wrong ones you can bet
I don't know why you hide your face
'Cause I'm coming for your neck
Intricate parts of of the plot, what you got
Should've cut your head off on the spot
A whole pile of dead bodies I'm on top
Me and my man rocking the dead like UHH non-stop
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead

Think about it a hundred years from now
It was all different people living on the planet
Now they're dead
200 years ago it was a whole 'nother posse
Now they dead
The dead probably out number the living 10,000 to 1
A hundred years from now we'll be dead
So fuck that! I'mma run with the mutha fucking dead

Got my vision on you point blank range
Strange look coming 'cause I'm in all black
And I'll be rocking with an axe
Everyday life how I'm living
Cemetery walks and grave digging
Sacrifice another victim
You can hear me screaming through the trees in the woods
Hang myself on a higher branch if I could
Gotta get 'em out
Gotta get these sick thoughts outta my head
So I be rocking the dead
Some of my best friends are dead
If you include Monoxide, Violent J, Shaggy, and Evil Ed
Serial killers from the West and the East
And all the dead mother fuckers from here to Greene Street
Fuck it if you're missing some limbs and patches of hair
Nod your bald head and throw your nubs in the air
I wanna see zombies jumping, screaming loud
And kill every live mother fucker in the crowd

Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Take it
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise (Rock the dead!)
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead

But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to ten
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts running all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
