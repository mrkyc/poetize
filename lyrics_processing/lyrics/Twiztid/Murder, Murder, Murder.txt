Murder, murder, murder, murder

First I plan my escape
Nothing on papes and leave the scene without a trace
I'm lookin' dead in her face, but she don't see me I'm unnoticed
I head straight to her bedroom window for better focus
Hocus pocus, I see the door's unlocked, I let myself in
Head for her room with plans of murder and mayhem
There she go, there that bitch lay
Livin' on this earth to my dismay (Time to pay)
Palms are sweaty I'm 'bout to vomit
I grab the knife outta my belt and jab it in her stomach
Again and again and now she's screamin' like I care
But I could give a fuck less
Before she dies I grab her by her blood-soaked hair
And tell her shit's gon' be alright on my end
I'm glad it happened this way, back in my daughter's life again
Ain't it a shame that it came to this
Life goes on except for one less bitch, ain't it a trip?

Murder murder murder murder, you never heard of
Redrum in reverse, bodies in the hearse
Now your life's gone 'cause we wanted you to die
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, don't ask why
Murder murder murder murder, you never heard of
Redrum in reverse, bodies in the hearse
Now your life's gone 'cause we wanted you to die
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, don't ask why

It was Tuesday December 24th '97
Time on the clock 1:11
Thinking 'bout sending somebody to heaven
On the crossroads the fate of a soul lies in my hands I suppose
Now I'm wearin' dark clothes parked on the side street
Peepin' out the scenery make sure nobody's seeing me
As I move to the trunk of the stolen car
Up to the back door with the crowbar
So far the plan's foolproof, call from the phone booth
Got the message machine, nobody's on the scene
Kicked in the back door 1:34
Lookin' for the family dog Thor
Kicked him in the jaw with the work boots
Knock a couple teeth loose
Smacked him in the mouth with my empty deuce deuce
Then I smile, break his neck and watch him piss on kitchen tile
Never liked him since the day he tried to play me foul
And tried to bite me, stab a steak knife in his head
So much for that man's best friend
Now I'm all up in the place, sittin' in the bedroom masturbatin'
Cummin' on the sheets and pillowcases, fuck that bitch
She's just a cunt, and her mother's nothing but a slut
Can't wait to seal her mouth shut
2:30 she returns home from work, nice blouse, tight shirt
Business attire for this hooker for hire
Throw the keys to the table said, "baby, are you home??
Didn't expect to see Bones, we're alone
And she's reachin' for the telephone to call the police
Strangle with the cord now deceased
In the process of her suffocation
Finger fucked her for demonstration
Let her know I know her many faces
Now she's dead in the closet
Hangin' out with all the winter clothes
In the struggle suffered a bloody nose, but I'm straight though
As I move to the bathroom to wash my hands
It's all part of the plan, don't think you understand see
Murder murder murder murder, you never heard of
Redrum in reverse, bodies in the hearse
Now your life's gone 'cause we wanted you to die
