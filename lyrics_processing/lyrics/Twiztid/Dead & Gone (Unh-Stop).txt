Uh, from the dark side of the night time I'll be creeping
Nocturnal child of the night, day time come I'm asleep then
Six feet deep hole in the Earth literally speaking
I'm underground with the glowing eyes the other demon not leaving
This soul here is not for the eating
These voices are taking parts
Of my life and leaving within my reach a butcher knife
You know how to kill them right
Stop asking me questions
I'm blocking out the voices and ignore any suggestions
Sick methods of draining the blood from all the bodies
With nine inch threading needles and hell jubalaties
Never one DVD, face paint, kill kill, kill, kill, kill, shit
Psychopathic lunatic
Who in this head of mine
Won't you leave me alone and die
I ain't looking for a fight
I'm just trying to get high or get drunk
Now somebody dead in the front seat
In the trunk and the sun coming up

With their blood soaked faces and my own glowing eyes
(And just the sight of them can make you feel paralyzed)
When the night turns day
Time to change back to your other disguise
(You hear them echoing, these voices got you hypnotized)

(Don't Stop!) Telling me to kill them!
(Unh-Stop!) Showing me the victim!
(Why!?) Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone
(Don't Stop!) Telling me to kill them!
(Unh-Stop!) Showing me the victim!
(Why!?) Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone

Paint floor, give me the chainsaw
Looking to maim all the people who late call
Laugh when the day falls
I'm not a killer but I'm cut from same cloth
As any serial killer you name off
Please don't let me out of the bedroom tonight
Regardless of what I say or what I sound like
I got a head full of murder and violence I can't control
From a mind full of voice that are telling me where to go
I'll end up in your bedroom with my hand around your throat
And what happens after that, well you know
Bodies obliterated, chopped up, incinerated
Not a single trace, all completely eliminated
Not sure why it happens but the voices are telling me to keep on
Chop, hack and stab it
And I really can't believe
I haven't been caught in the action
I just want it all to leave
But It gets worse when you're asking
It's my fatal attraction
With their blood soaked faces and my own glowing eyes
(And just the sight of them can make you feel paralyzed)
When the night turns day time
You change back to your other disguise
(You hear them echoing, these voices got you hypnotized)

(Don't Stop!) Telling me to kill them!
(Unh-Stop!) Showing me the victim!
(Why!?) Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone
(Don't Stop!) Telling me to kill them!
(Unh-Stop!) Showing me the victim!
(Why!?) Why won't you leave me alone?
