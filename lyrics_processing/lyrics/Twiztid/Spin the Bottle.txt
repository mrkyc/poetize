Man, fuck that shit man
FUCK THAT
What?
Whats up with this bitch?
She better come suck my dick or something
Bitch

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Its Paulie, baby Paulie, with nipple licking love
Sporting Cowboy boots and a florescent glove
I lassoed you up, and then I jump on your back
I needs no saddle, I just sit on my nut sack

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

It's Stretch Nuts up to bat, and I'm finna get this ho
Bottle still spinning, and my sack about to blow
Up in my pants, chicky-chick stop the fronting
Lets skip the game and get down to humping
You might also like
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Its me Jamie Madrox, the clitoris's dream
I tap and touch and tickle 'til you melt like ice cream
I know you want my body, fat kids are so sexy
Take off all your clothes come over here next to me, biatch

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Its Violent J baby, the wizard of the street
Sporting your panties, just to show you I'm a freak
I'll slide in your bed for a cotton surprise
You got clown makeup smeared on your inner thighs

(Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Man, who the bottle pointing on?
What, what
(Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Somebody better suck on my dick in this motherfucker
I ain't playing no more
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

You can call me the plumber, 'cause I snake your drain
But buttermilk lovenugget, that be the name
I swings to the left, 'cause I'm swift with my meat
And I tickle, twist your nippy nipples off, damn

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Spin number two, and my chances looking good
Already hit one neden, now I'm going for her friend
It don't make a difference, I really don't care
The size or the shape, as long as she got neden hair

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Ah well a bang bang bang, no I ain't tripping
Pink fun so wet that my thang is slipping
But quicker than I bat my eyes, she replied
I could get better traction, if I hit it from the side
Now baby, bitch, lemme get some neden
I'm trying to leave this nut stain on your momma bed
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

It's me again, J! I would love to turn you out
But, I think I'll pass, 'cause your shit is blew out
Just hold your shit together, or something, baby, yo
Or maybe you can let me holla at your booty hole

(Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Man, you gonna suck Violent J's dick, lick Shaggy's Balls
(Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Fuck Monoxide, and you can't even touch my butt?

Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me
Who's going next? I'm dying to see
Spin the bottle, baby, and give it to me

Bitch, I'll choke your ass
Motherfucker, how many times the bottle gotta land on me?
I ain't get no love in this motherfucker
Hey look, touch my butt
