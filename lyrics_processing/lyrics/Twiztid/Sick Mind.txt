I'm in such a fucking dark place
I look in the mirror but I don't know who that is
I just know that is not my face
Feeling unusual that is my usual, albeit beautiful mind state
What will I do to you? Maybe some voodoo
Who knows what I'll try, I'm so sick in the mind
That the doctors will tell you there's nothing that they can prescribe
All that aside, how many times have I woke up at night
From the whispers and voices from shadows who tell me it's murder tonight?
And I hurd 'em like cattle, wait, I don't think I'm even using it right
Like confusing a spoon with the knife
And I feel like I'm losing it
Might be a lunatic in front of you
And him and you and him, I'm wondering (Why am I doing this?)
I'm on the loose, I just escaped
I was just looking for somewhere to stay
'Til he went away and then there was you, he was there too
Just molesting, I'm through with you guessing
Just shut the fuck up, it's about to get messy, so stop the confessing
It's too late, I bet they were begging but you kept progressing
And you were there pressing the button, recording it all
So I welcome you both to the end of it
I'ma be person that's ending it
Funny how the mind can be intertwined with the dark side
From a thin line of a maniacal salt mine, the benefit
Who gives a shit? It's irrelevant
Like contaminated evidence, I do it for the hell of it
And medicine ain't helping it, so murder is my element
(Murder is my element)

Have you ever come in contact with a sick mind? (Sick mind)
The shadows are the only ones ever listening
(Are the only ones ever listening)
I can't even walk on a thin line
Balance along it one more time
Pay attention and you'll find
That a sick mind is a product of the world we're living in
Have you ever come in contact with a sick mind? (Sick mind)

Imperfections, less than perfect
Examining inward for outward purpose
These spoken words, they provide a service
To those who need them, they're feeling worthless
These feelings surface in times like these
World can make you feel you're a disease
Been there, done that, got lost, came back
Which race, lost track, so familiar
Constantly cold like it's always December
Lack of emotions, I cannot remember
Going through notions to fit in society
All the while quietly feeling no better
This anger, it holds it together
Just like the stitches and staples and capital letters
In all of my letters I write to myself
In an effort to try to lend my future help
Don't think it charity, think of it legacy
Moment they bury me, I'll be alive in the songs
And they carry me off in the wind
As it manifest destiny? Still they gon' question me
Tell me exactly what people expect of me
Silence is deafening, still no accepting me
Still no peace up in my heart while my soul is protecting me
I'm my own enemy, no need defending me
I'll be alive in the revelry, generally lost in the empathy
Mentally find an identity, words are my weaponry
Still no serenity, world will not let me be
So I become what they need of me
Killing my needs and defeating me
Bringing me down to the point where I look in the mirror
And wonder why you still believe in me
(Do you believe in me?)
Have you ever come in contact with a sick mind? (Sick mind)
The shadows are the only ones ever listening

I can't even walk on a thin line

Dark Place
I'm in such a fucking dark place
Dark place, dark place, d-d-d-dark place
I'm in such a fucking dark place
