If you're reading this then I finally did it
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye, there was no time
Understand I was stressed
Livin' day-to-day was hard and I gave it my best
But there was nothin' left for me in this world
To convince me to stay, now I'm long gone away
Don't you do that, don't you start with tears
Just remember all the time we spent over the years
Never cry, never think bad of me
What's done is done and that's the way it had to be
I need you to be strong for me
Say a prayer everyday in my memory, I'm sure it's helpin' me
To earn my feathers to get some wings
And a halo and a harp and angelic things
And even though I'm gone and out of sight
Never worry about me, I'm alright

I'm alright (And if you should die, don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside)
I'm alright (And every time you cry, don't break down, just keep me inside of your mind)
I'm alright (And if you should die, don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside)
I'm alright (And every time you cry, don't break down, just keep me inside of your mind)

You only saw the outside, never knew what I was feelin'
Now everyday you lay in bed, starin' at the ceiling
(I'm alive) But you don't see me no more
You can fill your heart with memories and things from before
(I'm not an angel) But everybody got a purpose in life to survive
And when the sun rise, you gon' live to see another day
Just don't follow me and live life your own way
(Example) All bein' said
And if you forget, get the picture with the cord around my neck
(Can you handle that, can you handle that?)
See me underground and I'm stuck, but it's cool, that's where I wanna be
Keep the drama in hand, but out of sight
And know that I'ma be alright
