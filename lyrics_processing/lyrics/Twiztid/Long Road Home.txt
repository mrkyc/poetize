I've been told that home's where the heart is
Love don't live here no more, regardless
I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me?
I've tried everything no salvation
All they do is prescribe more medication
I can't go
No, no
I can't go home
I can't go home
I can't go home
I can't go home

Feeling unwanted, feeling sick to my stomach
Problems they keep on coming regardless of making money
Hoping someone above me could show them how they should love me
Inside of me's a republic of madness
Then I'm just stuck in recovery, looking to sadness
Rough and feeling so tragic that every bit of my magic is taking seats in the back
It only comes up when I finally get my hands on a bag
It's like the whole world welcomes me back
It's like every problem I ever had is back from the track, into reality
I fall out when it casually comes falling right back
And then it's over
I'm either living to get high or I'm dying tryna be sober, neither bringing me closer
Now I'm sitting in this room detoxing and I'm alone
And all I wanna do is go home
But if I ever get myself up out of this fucking hole
This is the only thing I wanted y'all to know, and it goes
You might also like
Feeling lost in a world that's so alone
There's no change in me so take me home
I've been on my own, I've been gone too long
I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours, but I'll share it too
Because they always question everything we do
And I guess there's just no fixing wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song
(Take me home)

Do you feel like the level you try'na get
Is stuck somewhere between right here and all this stupid bullshit?
You work so hard but it seems just like nothing matters, though
This life can make you feel sick and fed up, is there an antidote?
To feel better, be confident
To be okay with the things I cannot change, but that's positive and I'm the opposite
In a bottomless pit I'm falling, my feelings are all around me
So many sleepless nights, so many tears enough to drown me
Instead you learn to sleep, grab a pillow and work sleep
And be like a bird, never fall when you can simply ride the wind
Wherever they may, and possibly will, beat me along my path
Will I return to you to see you smile and possibly hear you laugh?
When I bet to further, more distance between me and home
As long as you know I'm out there, then you're never truly alone
And on my endless journey floating beyond the stars
Learning life is not eternal, but home is wherever you are
Feeling lost in a world that's so alone
There's no change in me so take me home
I've been on my own, I've been gone too long
I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours, but I'll share it too
Because they always question everything we do
And I guess there's just no fixing wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song
