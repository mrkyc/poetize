We ain't underground by accident
There's only a select few that can handle this freak shit
Apparition of a poltergeist
Blessed with a heart, but it's cold as ice and broken twice
Now I walk with an axe
Dressed in all jet black with contacts, straight maniac
Warlock, Samhain and Salem's Lot
Sand through the hourglass, tickin' of the clock

If you don't know by now, it's too late
We the most serious thing on the market since daybreak
We the dead, we don't explain or feel pain
Berzerko, keep it underground and maintain
Bitch, you better check nuts
I'm doin' voodoo, leave you 66 for 6 months
Ridin' in a decked-out hearse with gold spokes
Puffin on a two-ton blunt with dead folks, and it's like that!

Axe murderers! (We don't die!)
Serial killers! (We don't die!)
Freaks of the night! (We don't die!)
We get high! (We don't die!)
You might also like
Comin' up outta the ground, from the underground tunnel I dug
To keep away from the mainstream love
I just want somebody to move and get hurt
Got your hole dug deep in the dirt
Can't work with your bitch motherfuckers, makin' love to the press
With a bitch named tatted on your chest?
Me and motherfuckin' Madrox, haunting the joint
Bringing death to the people that don't get the point
We don't die!

Uh-huh, we unreal, just like a seven-dollar bill
Voice my opinion, regardless of how you feel
Freak shit, it ain't about being rich
It's about juggalos and runnin' with lunatics
As long as y'all rock this, we won't quit
We do it all for y'all, I mean that shit!
Everyone of y'all means everything to me
We bleed for y'all, that's why we call it family

Axe murderers! (We don't die!)
Serial killers! (We don't die!)
Freaks of the night! (We don't die!)
We get high! (We don't die!)
It's hard to explain the element of my self-inflicted pain
We're not positive, and upliftin', fuck you!
Walk a mile in our shoes
Experience hard times and payin' helly dues
Freak shit, what I live, what I breath
Cast out Mutant X like his disease
Still, they try to ban our sound
Cause supposedly, it be resurrecting the dead from under hallowed ground

You in the dead zone, 10 points for us
Smellin' cigarette smoke right before your lungs bust
You can't trust him, but I can bust him in half
And sit back and laugh at all the shit I did
Can you do that? Could you school that?
Better yet, I'm a wigged out serial killer-type war vet
Freakshow, different from the rest
But I love it though, put you to the test

Axe murderers! (We don't die!)
Serial killers! (We don't die!)
Freaks of the night! (We don't die!)
We get high! (We don't die!)
Axe murderers! (We don't die!)
Serial killers! (We don't die!)
Freaks of the night! (We don't die!)
