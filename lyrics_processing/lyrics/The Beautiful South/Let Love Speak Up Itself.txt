Um...

Don't whisper love and dream of wedding bells
Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself
Mm, let love speak up itself...

So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place
Let it breathe, let it breathe
From the day it came into us, till the day it wants to leave
For it will, it will go
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello

There will not be a send-off, no funeral or mass
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass
To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town

Let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself...
You might also like
And let it rise up in the morning and take us for the walk
And let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk, ah
When we're too tired to talk

And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off
Let it rot, let it rot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
In a knot, in a knot
And let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot

Hang them from a cleaver and say, 'Look what we've got;
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'
To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town

Let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself and let it, and let it
Let love speak up itself
Let love speak, let love rot, let love tear
Let love speak, let love rot, let love tear
Let love tear, let love tear up itself
When you feel a little down, and when you feel a little down
From the oldest swinger in town...
Just let love speak, just let love speak
Just let love speak up itself, just let love speak up itself
And the oldest, the oldest swinger in town...
Just let love speak up, just let love speak up itself
