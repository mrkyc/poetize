I was handed down the looks
Of a man with a broken nose
That's the way our family was
I suppose
But at least you gave me
Deeply profound
As we lay and chatted late
Upon the cricket ground

You didn't have to love me
Where others got rid
You didn't have to treat me like a very good friend
But I'm glad that you did, I'm glad that you did

One thing I never said to you
And one thing I never can
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers
I'm your number one fan, I'm your number one fan

I'm the richly blessed daughter
Of a mother with tattooed arms
That's the way my family life
Life was charmed
You might also likeBut at least it gave me
Mental grace
And a thought, oh, at the pit of my mind
And a smile on my face

You didn't have to listen to a
A word that I'd said
You didn't have to tell me all those silly old jokes
For every tear that I shed, every tear that I shed

'Cause one thing I never said to you
And one thing I never can
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers
I'm your number one fan, I'm your number one fan

Yes I am

I was handed down a bike
With a crooked old wheel
But I rode it on a million lanes
The way that you made me feel
But at least we thought about it
So long and hard
As we sat upon our mother
In the graveyard

And you don't have to listen
To a, a word in this song
Your picture hangs the same and in the same old place
Even though that you've gone, even though that you've gone

'Cause one thing I never said to you
And one thing I never can
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers
I'm your number one fan, I'm your number one fan

Yes, I am
I'm your number one fan
Yes, I am
Yes, I am
I'm your number one fan
