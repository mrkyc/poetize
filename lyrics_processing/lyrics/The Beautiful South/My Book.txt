For every chapter, a thousand memories
A murder, a mystery where everybody bleeds
A fantasy, a thriller with romance and disease

Diary entry, '62, end of May:
It looks as if the nose and chin are definitely here to stay
They're here to stay, they're here to stay...

And if I seem half hearted, it's because I'm broken hearted
And I'm a failure (You are, you are, you are)
I am (You are, you are, you are)
I am...

Diary entry, 10th of April '89:

Back to bed, back to reality
