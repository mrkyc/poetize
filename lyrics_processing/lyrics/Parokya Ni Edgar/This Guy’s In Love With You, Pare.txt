This guy's in love with you pare
Ano?

One look and then 'yun iba na
Malagkit dumikit ang tingin ng mata
One smile, iba na ang ibig sabihin
'Di na friends ang tingin niya sa'kin

Every day parating we're together
Every week, palaging may sleepover
Ang tawag niya sa mommy ko ay tita
Bakit ba 'di ko no'n nakita?

Until out of the blue, I'm feeling so true
Bigla na lang sinabi sa akin that

This guy's in love with you pare
This guy's in love with you pare
This guy's in love with you pare
Bading na bading sa'yo

'Di na ako makasagot ng telepono
Palagi niyang kinakausap ang parents ko
Kulang daw sa tulog at 'di na makakain
Bakit ba 'di pa no'n inamin?

Until out of the blue, I'm feeling so true
Bigla na lang sinabi sa akin that

This guy's in love with you, pare
This guy's in love with you, pare
This guy's in love with you, pare
Bading na bading sa'yo

Every day daw ay rainy day and Monday
'Cause 'di na 'ko maaya to come out and play
Tinataguan na nga, palaging late o absent
Ang sabi pa rin, "I'll always have a friend that you can depend"
Oh, oh-oh, 'di kailangan na mag-on
Parang talong at bagoong

This guy's in love with you, pare
This guy's in love with you, pare
This guy's in love with you, pare
Bading na bading
Converted pa din
Na nakikipag-fling sa'yo

Oh, no, my bestfriend's gay (This guy's in love with you, pare)
And it's the same old friend I had yesterday (This guy's in love with you, pare)
And he's as happy (This guy's in love with you, pare)
And gay (This guy's in love with you, pare)
Yeah, yeah (This guy's in love with you, pare)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (This guy's in love with you, pare)
