So many faces, so many races
Different voices, different choices
Some are mad, while others laugh
Some live alone with no better half
Others grieve while others curse
And others mourn behind a big black hearse
And some are pure, and some half bred
And some are sober, and some are wasted
And some are rich because of fate and
And some are poor with no food on their plate
Some stand out while others blend
And some are fat and stout while some are thin
Some are friends, and some are foes
Some have some while some have most, yeah

Every color, every hue
Is represented by me and you
Take a slide in the slope
Take a look in the kaleidoscope
Spinnin' round, make it twirl
In this kaleidoscope world, yeah

Some are great, and some are few
Others lie while some of us be telling the truth
Some say poems, and some do sing
And others be singing through their guitar strings
Some know it all while some act dumb
Let the bassline strum to the bang of the drum
Some can swim but some will sink
And some of us will be finding our minds and be thinking
Others walk while others run
You can't talk peace and have a gun
Some are hurt and start to cry
Don't ask me how, don't ask me why
Some are friends and some are foes
Some have some, while some have most, yeah
