Hello out there (Ayy)
I'm only human, dawg
Can you hear me? (Ayy, ayy)
I'm only human, dawg
It's an S.O.S (Ayy, ayy)

Ayy, when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm only human, dawg)
Ayy, when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm just a human y'all)
Push the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup (Ayy, ayy)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you poppin' bottles, takin' pictures, look around (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But soon as you fall down, all the haters passin' judgement (Oh, no, no)
Fly as I'm is, shawty, I'ma rise above this (Oh, no, no, no, no)

Hey, what it is, world? (Ayy) Yeah, it's me again (Again)
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No runnin' from the truth (Nah), as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For lettin' you down, I won't take you down this road again (Uh-uh)
Most of you now sayin', "Whatever, here we go again" (What?)
Blogs, radio, and television all goin' in (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I laugh to keep from cryin' through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fuckin' haters is hilarious (Haha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me (Now) lookin' down (Down)
Same clown that was Twit-pickin' at my weddin' (Ayy)
On the same Twitter page disrespectin' (What?), wait a second (Hold up)
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (Damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC, and Wikipedia (What?)
See the stairway to Heaven while steppin' down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (Nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong, but after that
The good I done in your hood, should it over-shadow that? (Shadow)
Yeah, the world laughin' at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
The people with you then, but when they turn on you remember this (Ayy, ayy)
