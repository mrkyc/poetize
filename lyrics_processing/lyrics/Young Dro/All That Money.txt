Girl you makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u
Oohh makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u
(Verse 1)
Booty club 25 grand
Fat pockets look at my pants
We too deep look at my clan
Polo clothes look at my brand
Dro I came here to look at ya'll dance
They say I make it rain so I'm kickin out grands
My partna spent seven and my homie spent three
I spent bout eleven so that's 20 some g's
Just got started and we don't wanna leave
10 for the clit now put yo hands on yo knees
Naw i ain't broke but I'm still on E
I'm rolling like a mother fucker pills on me
Real low key shaking hard for the bread
Still in school so she smart in the head
First Magic city now we all went Onyx
Do it for a stripper makin all that money
(chorus) X2
Girl you makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u
Oohh makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u

She dance for you like she dance for me
She don't handle you like she handle me
She know I came up riding Lamborghini
Shakin her stuff like a tambourine
All my diamonds are tangerine
Throwin this money like Dan marine
All shawty need is a pampering
She'll jump when u call like a trampoline
Got my motor running like Valvoline
Give me what I want u can have the cream
My drop top Chevy so apple green
These niggas in the club they trap with me
So much money they after me
Black Maserati in the scrap with me
Carats on my neck call me young dro money
We can blaze up the saddle then platinum 21 it
Dro
(Chorus) X2
Girl you makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u
Oohh makin all that money
Dont let nobody cheat u cheat u
