Fresh out the house got the beat on suicide
As I ride up and down Martin Luther King Drive
Standin tall lookin down on the bloody boys
Snitchin all day I look around on the block

I'm in a silver SL five pounder on the block
Aintcha ever seen a young playa clown in the Drop, (do ya thang) Ain't nuttin to a G gang spit fluently
Groups of hoe's pursuin me, as if there's more than two of me

Monday my Chevy's orange(errenge) and Tuesday its ocean blue
28's sit over you, Ferrari drops and Rovers too,(do ya thang)
Hoes sit'em out, T.Vs I'mma flip'em out
50 bricks they ain't shit, tell 'em niggas "shift it out"

I'm in the hood in a drop top Super Sport
Mash, let the horses holler and the Porsche is fallin
Niggas on their porches holla (do ya thang )
They call me "thunder bill" cut me down to somethin else
Shorty somethin else, hot enough to make the sun melt
Man I got a friutloop Chevy followin me on 24's
Look at your own Cutlass green diamond purple hearts (do ya thang)
A James Bond car Drizzled as a porn star
The spring refer's green, so my Cutlass is a orange car

I got a curly haired, dirty red broad, eatin lemon heads
Leanin in the Lincoln with a pump by her left leg (Do ya thang)
Lookin in the tan and getcha left side bent
Then leave ya laid out do it by the lake bitch

Color coated rims chop the streets till they rock up
Muscle cars straight buckin look how it stands up(do ya thang)
Yeah I'm in the ride look like a fruit drink
It makes these hoes thirsty when they see the pineapple paint

Earrings in my ear look like a baby flat screen (do ya thang)

"Super-Clean" is on the scene; Italian leather match the Polo boots
And the wood grain lame I'll show you how to do the do (do ya thang) blowin fruits same flavor as the candy gloss in the backseat got a freak pullin her panties off

"Arrr!" weigh the anchor on the Cuban link chain
Diamonds stacked on top of diamonds, custom made pinky ring (do ya thang)
Fishin hats, Polo shorts with the Polo man
Wearin blue and tan in the blue and tan Avalanche

Jackers never had a chance, sell em in the Avalanche
They hopped out the van and startin shootin like a cameraman
Top down, hit the switch an let it drop down
Passin by the underground, they can hear me underground
