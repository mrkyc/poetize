G-girl don't get mad just cause you suck, rip
She don't smoke but my swisher she chief it
She got a good brain that will make her a genius though it ain't no secret
This dick is the cleanest
These hoes could have more diseases than Prometheus
Gross, don't get close
Bobby Ray that boy mac a dosh
Her name Porsha but she never drove a Porsche
Like a motor I'ma fuck her with the power of a horse
Now that's force, that's torque
Eighteen holes lookin' like a golf course
From Dominicans and even them Brazilians
And I ain't even hit 'em man I'm talkin all sorts
If these niggas saw the sides of the women I see
Maybe niggas wouldn't be committed to she
She got a man she ain't mention to me
Maybe what she doin' it ain't meant to be seen
But if I had a daughter
I would tell her from the start
To keep you loved and keep you guarded
'Cause you don't wanna grow up whole hearted
Hollerin' niggas ain't shit
But ain't at the end of the night you alone and a groupie, bitch
