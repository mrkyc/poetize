Oh hi goddamn, brown Trans Am, I'm on fire
Loud as Cham', standing in the trap with these loud ass jems
Loud ass pipes, around these loud ass rims
God, God, look at my garage, Maserati cars
I can't see floors, this is no facade
Bitches go retard
Thousand pass we call that a picture in the yard
My paint keep falling, wet, wet shawty
"Shoulder Lean" money, I'm still balling
Got them soldiers in platoons, pockets on balloon
Stack my money up and take a rocket to the moon
AK in the 'frigerator, but my Glock is in the room
When I get with these hoes, first we pop it then we zoom
The hottest in the room, you know I won't lie
You know I'm sitting tall, you know I'm on fire

Call me Young Dro Because I'm smoking on fire
Run up if you want, please shawty don't try
Players only live once, everybody going to die
So whatever shawty want, you know shawty going to buy
Aye, but shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Call me Young Dro because I'm smoking on fire (X4)

I am Young Dro, what you telling me?
Pocket full of celery, I know how to be a player
I am Bill Bellamy, nigga run up on me wrong know I get a felony
Dead fresh in the club, damn who the hell is he?
Fellas be jealous see my cars look like my Audemar
Goons in the crowd and I don't know how to call them off
I'ma start a hundred cars, raging bull, paid in full
Paint the Regal grey in March, Aqua Blue in April, dimes in the stable
Gauges I'ma blow them out
Tell the bitches if they don't behave I'ma throw them out
Drop top popular, make it rain on the Doppler
Grand Hustle king got a mafia, nigga what's popping?
I'm a beast, soon as I hit release mode
Pop your head open like them Lamborghini doors
Young Dro I'm the "Best Thang Smokin"
On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire


Riding down Edgecombe, I just left Zaxby's
Chickens at the restaurant, chickens in my Chevy trunk
Classic, super straight, Dro you cannot duplicate
Nigga you ain't hustle till you sold it out the Super 8
Travelodge, super cake, do what Uncle John do
On the strong kush got them coughing like the swine flu
Mexicano bricks buy times ten times two
Dro you say you spent a million on the jewelry
Who you lying to? Try who?
Nigga I will suffocate and bust the K
Show them how to cultivate, and buy a house where Usher stay
Plus I say I'm grand with the hustle out for Russell pay
Before they start biting, I require y'all muzzle they mouthes
Doubt me, eight mile high houses
Grand Hustle king y'all know what I'm about bitch
