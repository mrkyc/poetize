Gun in my pants, the eagle gon' sound like the bass (Ayy, oh)
Don't fuck with the badge, you see what I did to his face (Ayy, brr)
Just keeping it real, if it's realer than me then it's fake (Ayy)
Fishtailing down the block
Gang tats is all I got
Fly crippin' never stop (Woo, uh)
Loving you more, loving you less, I'm balling (Balling)
I'm dropping the top, no need for the tint, I'm extra (Uh)

I got that water, no raindrop
Hit her one time, now her name poppin'
Plead the fifth on the bitch, I don't do name droppin'
Came through dripping on them, Gucci tube socks
I'm so geeked up, I think that I'm ScHoolboy
Made some racks off a show, bought some new water
How the fuck did this baddie get 'cross the border?
Got a green card on her to-do list
If he work, I'ma make him my new bitch
I'm out West with the gang on that blue shit
They just talk like they tough, they don't do shit
When that white hit my hand, I'ma move it
Sold a hundred this week just to prove it
Poppin' pills every night, making movies
I be wet like I jumped in a fucking jacuzzi
Blue hundreds stacked taller than Uzi
Young hitter, got your vibe in here choosing
Tell these fuckin' niggas they ain't cool
Half of this thing'll send you to the moon
You can just hit me when you with your dude
Whenever you see me, I be with them goons
We ain't gon' fix 'em but we got 'em tools
I keep that water on me like a pool, oh yeah

I got that water, yeah, I got that water (Huh)
I got that water, yeah, I got the water (Yeah)
