Uh, go
Uh, go

Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses

Days like this, I wish all my locs was unchained (Chained)
I mastered the rap game (Game), I mastered the dope game (Game)
Still I feel like that I'm God-like on these long flights
I'm left behind, it don't feel right
Can't write the script when this real life
Rich, still dodgin' that bus ride
From the west side where don't shit slide, we on trip time
Seen the field in their lies (Their lies)
Can't be serious with no rappers (No rappers)
Stayed down and what happened? (What happened?)
Got my daughter that mansion (That mansion)
Gave my mother that million (Million)
Sold my soul to my feelings (My feelings)
Can't go blind 'bout these women (No)

Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses
I'm goin' off 'til I crash
Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash
My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash
Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my...
It knock me on my...

Nigga gotta hit the golf course to get a peace of mind
Family friends want a piece of mine
I can tell they all piecin' up
And I can show 'em where peace resides
Since eight years old, I knew I'd be rich
'Cause the college route, it wasn't 'bout shit
Tried the honest route, but chose house licks
Tried to lock me up, but can't catch this
Now where we touch down is on my X list, I'm on a fresh tip
Too much time of livin' reckless
Now add that time up on my left wrist
Lil' rappers ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)
Your tax bracket ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)
You buy a chain, but won't buy no land
That hashtag should say, "Desperate" (Desperate)
I'm kickin' game for these young niggas
'Cause one day they'll meet my daughter, uh
All that bullshit I taught her, huh
Way too blessed to be normal, uh
Upper echelon, where we stand at
So, girl, be proud that your skin black
And be happy, girl, that your hair napped
'Cause the school system won't teach that
Where your father been, you gon' reach that
Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
