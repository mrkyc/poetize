You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya, baby, I know how to rock your world
(I know how to rock your world)

Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me, boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

Don't call me "baby"
You've got some nerve, baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me "baby"

Behind my smile is my IQ
I must admit this does not sit with the likes of you
You're really sweet, you're really nice
But didn't mama ever tell you not to play with fire?
(Tell you not to play with fire)
