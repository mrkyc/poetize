All the simple things that you do to me make me feel so right
I've been waiting for a man like you for all my life
The way you hold me close, it's like we're dancing alone, I don't wanna let go
I've been hoping for some lovin' like this every night

Something 'bout the way you are
Something 'bout the way that you've been making me feel
Cos I love the way that you are (you are)
Always thinking about my baby
Always wishing that you are here right next to me
Cos I love the way that you are (you are)

Even when I'm down you change my mood around just by being you
Loving you is so easy, easy to do
Even when you're gone I can feel your warmth, like the morning sun (like the morning sun)
I wanna thank you for the love you bring into my life

Something 'bout the way you are
Something 'bout the way that you've been making me feel
Cos I love the way that you are (you are) (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always thinking about my baby
Always wishing that you are here right next to me
Cos I love the way that you are (you are)
