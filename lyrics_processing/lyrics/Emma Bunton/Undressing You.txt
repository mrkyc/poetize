I don't why
I'm tied up inside
Your names in my head
And all of the old
Records I play
Remind me of you

Oh I keep behavin' in a way that I can't explain
Nothing I know, sure as the done, it's happening again

Well we've only just met and I'm undressing you with my eyes
And I'm trying to chase away all these dirty thoughts in my mind
Oh when you're around and I try to play it down like whatever (like whatever)
And my heart skips a beat and it's hard to hold it together

If I take you home
Just for one night
We'll see how it goes
Candlelit room
Kill all the lights
We'll drink some wine
You might also like
On the other hand I might just bite my tongue
Oh if I can wait, play hard to get, it suits me just fine

Well we've only just met and I'm undressing you with my eyes
And I'm trying to chase away all these dirty thoughts in my mind
Oh when you're around and I try to play it down like whatever (like whatever)
And my heart skips a beat and it's hard to hold it together

Maybe it is time to throw in my pride
Unless I decide to wait a little longer
Each and every time I consciously deny
What's on my mind for you to discover

Well we've only just met and I'm undressing you with my eyes
And I'm trying to chase away all these dirty thoughts in my mind
Oh when you're around and I try to play it down like whatever (like whatever)
And my heart skips a beat and it's hard to hold it together

It's hard to hold it
It's hard to hold it
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
It's hard to hold it
