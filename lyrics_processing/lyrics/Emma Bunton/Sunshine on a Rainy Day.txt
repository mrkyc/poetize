Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I see you in the darkness
I see you in the light
I see your eyes shining
In through the night

Make me feel, make me feel
Like I belong
Don't leave me, you won't leave me here
All Alone
Cast your eyes
Like summer skies
Blue earth and the ocean
Clearer than the skies, yeah!

Sunshine on a rainy day (sunshine)
Makes my soul, makes my soul drip, drip, drip away
Sunshine on a rainy day (sunshine)
Makes my soul, makes my soul drip, drip, drip away

You touch me with your spirit
You touch me with your heart
You touch me in the darkness
I feel it start

Make it feel, make it feel
So Unreal (so unreal)
Like a wind in the desert
Like a moon on the sea

Sunshine on a rainy day (sunshine)
Makes my soul, makes my soul drip, drip, drip away

Makes my soul, makes my soul drip, drip, drip away

Makes my soul, makes my soul drip, drip, drip away
