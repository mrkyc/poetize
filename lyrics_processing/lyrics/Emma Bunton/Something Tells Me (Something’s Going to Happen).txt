Something tells me something's going to happen tonight
I've read in the papers that gemini people will make it tonight
Stars will be shining my sign is alining with love
So come on and make it let's take everything that we've been Dreaming of

Oh baby something tells me something's going to happen to you
The smile on my face is the smile you were wearing
A moment or two
So get it together you see it's gonna be alright
Something tells me something's gonna happen tonight

Oh i woke up this morning with sunshine through my window
Everything that's happened so far has turned out right
And i got every reason to feel it's going better
Its getting better every minute wait till we meet tonight

Oh baby something tells me something's going to happen to you
The smile on my face is the smile you were wearing
A moment or two
So get it together you see it's gonna be alright
Something tells me something's gonna happen tonight
