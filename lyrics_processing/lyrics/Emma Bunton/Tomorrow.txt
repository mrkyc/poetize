He's one of a kind and he's all mine
He's there for me come rain or shine a million times
Then one day suddenly he needed me
Would I be strong enough for two
When he is you

I know how to ease all your sorrow
So come here
Rest your head on my pillow
It's alright, we don't need a tomorrow tonight
I know how to open the window
To your soul
Close your eyes you can follow
It's alright, we don't need a tomorrow tonight

She wants him to see all he can be
Cos all it takes is an open heart and honesty
Then one day suddenly he really believed
That he'd be strong enough for she
When she is me, oh-oh
