Ooh, uh-huh, yeah

Something 'bout your friends are always there for you
Help you with your bad times and they'll see you through
Being with a man is never quite the same
Cos we just have some fun and really play the game

I don't know where will go
But I know we're gonna stop the show

Girls are on the town tonight
Nothing can stop us
You can see it in our eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight
We're gonna get down tonight
See if we can make you blush
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep tonight
Tonight, we're not gonna sleep

We will find the time to party all night long
Now that we're together we just can't go wrong
Dancing in the street and making lots of noise
People wanna join especially the boys
You might also like
But there's no way, it's just the girls
For tonight, we're in our own world

Girls on the town tonight
Nothing can stop us
You can see it in our eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight
We're gonna get down tonight
See if we can make you blush
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep tonight

We're not gonna sleep
We're not gonna sleep tonight
Tonight
We're not gonna sleep tonight
Yeah-hey
We're not gonna sleep

Girls are on the town tonight
You can see it in our eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight
We're gonna get down tonight
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep (yeah)
Girls on the town tonight
Nothing can stop us (can stop us)
You can see it in our eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight (woo!)
We're gonna get down tonight (gonna get down tonight)
See if we can make you blush (see if we can make ya blush)
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep tonight

We're not gonna sleep tonight
(We're not gonna sleep tonight)
We're not gonna sleep
We're not gonna sleep tonight (tonight)
(We're not gonna sleep tonight)
