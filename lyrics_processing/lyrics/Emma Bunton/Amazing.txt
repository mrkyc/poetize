Look at me
Tell me what you see
Does he please you and make you go weak at the knees

I don't know
How you know
But I guess it might show that my eyes are in paradise

Can it really be
That you're here with me
Are you touching me now or is this pure fantasy

Are we in a dream
Then let us be

No don't wake us from this kinda bliss
Cos we never had love that feels like this

You're so amazing
You're so unbelievable
You're so incredible to me
You're so amazing
Just so unbelievable to me
And if I hold you
I know I'll never, never, never let you go
You might also like
Can you hear me now
Like I'm whispering
In a voice dipped in honey that's making your heart want to see

Yes I hear you now
Like a cooling breeze
On that hot summer night that we met back in paradise

When I hear you sing
There's a tingling
Like a million fingers caressing me over my skin (harmony)

Are we in a dream
Then let us be

No don't wake us from this kinda bliss
Cos we never had love that feels like this

You're so amazing (you're so amazing)
You're so unbelievable (so unbelievable)
You're so incredible to me (incredible, incredible, yeah/to me)
You're so amazing (you're so amazing)
Just so unbelievable to me (so unbelievable/yeah-oh yeah)
And if I hold you
I know I'll never, never, never let you go
(I'll never let, I'll never let you go/I'll never let you go)
You're so amazing (you're so amazing)
You're so unbelievable (so unbelievable)
You're so incredible to me (incredible, incredible, yeah/to me)
You're so amazing (you're so amazing)
Just so unbelievable to me (so unbelievable/yeah-oh yeah)
And if I hold you
I know I'll never, never, never let you go
