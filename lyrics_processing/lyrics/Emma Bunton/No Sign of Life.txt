I wake up crying and I think of you
There's something dying and my world lies broken in two
A voice says get out of bed
But instead I lay back and go out of my head
I've never been here at the crying stage
Was I the fool who never turned to read the last page?
And now it's another day
You're gonna pay for the love that I gave away

Baby it's all that I can do
To hold back the love I feel for you
All I can think about is getting through
Now that I know there's

No sign of life
Living without you
No sign of life
Can't seem to face the truth
No sign of life
Can't breathe without you
No sign of life
So how am I gonna get through?
You might also like
No more pretending that my luck has changed
Won't see the crying but the tears still flow through my veins
I know that I'm getting strong
Cos the tears that uyo see won't be there too long

Baby it's all that I can do
To turn back the hate I keep for you
Now all I can think about is getting through
Now that I know there's

No sign of life
Living without you
No sign of life
Can't seem to face the truth
No sign of life
Can't breath without you
No sign of life
How am I gonna
How am I gonna
How am I gonna get through?
Get through
Without you
No sign of life
Living without you
No sign of life
Can't seem to face the truth
No sign of life
Can't breathe without you
No sign of life
How am I gonna
No sign of life
Living without you
No sign of life
Can't seem to face the truth
No sign of life
Can't breathe without you
No sign of life
