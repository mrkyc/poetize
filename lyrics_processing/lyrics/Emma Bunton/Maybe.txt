Love isn't funny when it is burning inside
When all you think of is how to get through the night
And when you want it, it's just a game that you play
And when you get it, they're gonna take it away

Maybe it's nothin', maybe it's all just in my mind
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe it's just a waste of time
But I don't think so, maybe I definitely know
That maybe, maybe I'm in love

So if you want it, you wanna come out to play
Then you can have it, 'cause he's got plans for the day
And if I want it, there's no one out there for me
When you don't need it, there's plenty fish in the sea
You might also like
Maybe it's nothin', maybe it's all just in my mind
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe it's just a waste of time
But I don't think so, maybe I definitely know
Why do I keep fooling myself? Why can't I let go?
This is not like me, but now I definitely see
That maybe, oh, maybe, maybe I'm in love
