I've been there, done that
Ooh-ooh
(Yeah) been there, (yeah) done that
(I've been there, done that)

I gotta take some time
Say what's on my mind
Before I get too close to you
Cos I feel that I'm
About to cross the line
And there's no going back once I do

(So here's the key)
You've ever thought of falling so deep?
Am I pushing you out of your day
(How do you feel)
Gotta know your playing for keeps
Boy I won't accept anything less

Cos I've been there (been there)
Done that (done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
I refuse to (refuse to)
Go back (go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that
You might also like(I've been there, done that)

Now I don't wanna rush
Get too into us
I need a little more from you
And I don't mean to fuss
But this is serious
And I hope that you feel that way too

(So here's the key)
You've ever thought of falling so deep?
Boy the time has come to confess
(How do you feel)
Gotta know your playing for keeps
Cos I won't accept anything less

Cos I've been there (been there)
Done that (done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact (don't wanna get hurt again)
I refuse to (refuse to)
Go back (go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that (to half-hearted promises, simple as that)

For you to break my heart

Before we go too far
