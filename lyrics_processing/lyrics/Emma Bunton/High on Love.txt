Well I know that you're with me when I'm sleeping
And I know that you hear me when I'm speaking
No I'm, not gonna fight it, and I, just can't deny it
Cos I know that it's something I believe in

And you made me listen
And you really showed me where to go
And you made me wonder
Who I am

You're making me high, high, high, high on love
You're making me high, high, high, high on love
You're making me high, high, high, high on love
You're making me high

When I'm cold I feel your arms around me
When I cry you're there to hold me gently
Wanna shout out loud, cos I feel so proud
And I know that you're there to defend me

And you made me listen
And you really showed me where to go
And you made me wonder
Who I am
