Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, talk to me, can't you see
I'll help you work things out?
Oh, don't wannabe your enemy
And I don't wanna scream and shout

'Cause, baby, I believe in honesty
A man that's strong and true
I shouldn't have to say now, baby
That I believe in you

What took you so long?
What took you all night?
What took you forever to see I'm right?
You know I treat you so good
I make you feel fine
And no, I'll never give it up this time
No, no, no

Oh, you touched my heart, right from the start
You didn't know what to say (Didn't know what to say)
But honey, understand, when you take my hand
Everything's okay

I've got something to say
