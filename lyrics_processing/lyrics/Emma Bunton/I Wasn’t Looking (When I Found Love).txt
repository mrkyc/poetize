People say
Never watch and wait
When the pressures on
You know it won't find you
Fate is shy
When you seek it high
When you're looking left
It'll creep up on the right

So I found out for myself
That all the tales were true
You came without a warning
Not a clue

Wasn't looking when I found love
Yeah it took me by suprise
Wasn't looking when you showed up
Now you're all I see
Wasn't looking you took my hand
The way it should be
Wasn't looking when I found love
And it's beautiful
You might also like
Mind your time
Never stand in line
Cause the trouble is
It'll never come your way
Funny how
When you hunt them down
There's a drought
And don't
Then it rains all day

Cause no matter what you do
It'll end up you
And hits you like a boat out of the blue

Wasn't looking when I found love
Yeah it took me by suprise
Wasn't looking when you showed up
Now you're all I see
Wasn't looking you took my hand
The way it should be
Wasn't looking when I found love
And it's beautiful
So I found out for myself
That all the tales were true
You came without a warning
Not a clue
Na na na da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

Wasn't looking when I found love
Yeah it took me by suprise
Wasn't looking when you showed up
Now you're all I see
Wasn't looking you took my hand
The way it should be
Wasn't looking when I found love
And it's beautiful
Wasn't looking when I found love
Yeah it took me by suprise
Wasn't looking when you showed up
Now you're all I see
Wasn't looking you took my hand
The way it should be
Wasn't looking when I found love
