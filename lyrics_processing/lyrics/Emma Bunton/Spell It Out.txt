If I spell it O U T
Will you get the message finally
I don't wanna fight you see
But it's the end for you and me
Sorry that it had to be
But that's the reality
Do I have to spell it O U T for you to see

Dream on in your own little world
Keep thinking I'm your girl
Baby I wish you well
But boy the fact remains
My story's still the same
Hard as it is to tell

I've said it all a thousand times
Now I gotta be cruel to be kind

If I spell it O U T
Will you get the message finally
I don't wanna fight you see
But it's the end for you and me
Sorry that it had to be
But that's the reality
Do I have to spell it O U T for you to see

You don't get what I say
You want it all your way
Hear what you wanna hear
So now I'm showing you
This time we're really through
The writing on the wall is clear

You'll never make me change my mind
So I'm gonna be cruel to be kind

If I spell it O U T (O U T)
