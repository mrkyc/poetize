Kids today get the lights turned out
You got to shine on
Shine on
Sadr City Blues, there is no excuse
Write your name down
Get your name crossed out
You got to shine on, shine on
Sitting in the back on your very own
This ain't jack, or ain't wack
This is real life
You got to shine on, shine on
You can't wait
For the sun to be born
To hold you, keep you warm
The desert has its ice storm
It's too late
For the flowers to arrive
On the road of the cross and knives
When you're looking for just war
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues

The television lights are lives
You got to shine on
Shine on
Sitting in the back on your very own
You get divorced over the telephone
You got to shine on
Shine on
You can't wait
For the sun to be born
To hold, to keep you warm
The desert has its ice storm
It's too late
For the flowers to arrive
On the road of the cross and knives
When you're looking for just war
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues
You can't wait
For the sun to be born
To hold, to keep you warm
The desert has it's ice storm
It's too late
For the flowers to arrive
On the road of the cross and knives
When you're looking for just war, just war
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues
You got to shine, shine, shine, shine on
To make it thorugh the Sadr City blues
You got to shine on, you got to shine on
To make it through the Sadr City blues
