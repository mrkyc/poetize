I'm gonna get sussed out
We're breaking all the trust
I deserve to get cussed out now
The innocence is lost
How much does it cost now
Your head is full of doubt
Are you ganna kick me out now
How can everything go wrong at once
I've got enemies on every front
Could I send a letter back home to make it better
Oh I could kill inside this shell
If I thought no one would see me
When the gates are locked and the gun is cocked
I'd pay a fortune not to be me
Crossing the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
You gotta make a move
There's nothing left to prove now
The worst is all true
Nothing nothing you can do about it
Oh, everything's a lie
Everything's a way out now
You think there's nothing good
No reason that you shouldn't shout now
You might also likeHow can everything go wrong at once
When you never thought bad of anyone
Could I send a letter back home to make it better
Precious light a jagged knife
A conduit for the evil
The guilty love or the reckless stud
I have been so many of these
Crossing the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Across the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Across the line
Across the line
Cross the line
Across the line
Across the line
Across the line
(tonight)
(tonight)
Precious light a jagged knife
A conduit for the evil
A guilty love and a reckless stud
I have been so many of these
Oh I could kill inside this shell
If I thought no one would see me
When the gates are locked and the gun is cocked
I'd pay a fortune not to be me
Crossing the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Cross the line
Across the line
Across the line
Across the line
Across the line
Cross the line
