Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just a little bit older than me
Just a little bit stronger than me
I used to love you but now i see
You only stood in my sun
Talk about how i'd be dead without you
Bring the fear when i start to doubt you
Oh save the breath in your lung
I know you're trying to keep me young
It's your excuse to treat me rough
But i'll prove to you i'm twice as tough
Oh let's see what i do
When now i'm nowhere near you
Here's me laying down the law
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
It ain't gonna be like the way that it was before
I used to think i was something
I used to think i was but now i'm sure
I must admit was a little be scared
About all the demons and the snakes out there
But what did i know
Only what you told me was so
You might also likeBeware of these and beware of those
Better shut your eyes better hold your nose
Oh oh oh oh oh
Little joe you can't face the world alone
It's your excuse to treat me rough
But i'll prove to you i'm twice as tough
Oh let's see what i do
When now i'm nowhere near you
Here's me laying down the law
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
It ain't gonna be like the way that it was before
I used to think i was something
I used to think i was but now i'm sure
This is my time
I'm gonna make mistakes and they'll be mine
I'm gonna make mistakes and I'll still be fine
You'll see
You want to take that away from me
Tell me i can't see what i know i can see
Tell me i can't be what i know i can be
But it's you
Your fear that your best days are through
Last chance is due
Oh overdue
Here's me laying down the law
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no
It ain't gonna be like the way that it was before
I used to think i was something
I used to think i was but now i'm sure
Here's me laying down the law
You don't push me around
You don't push me around
It ain't gonna be like the way that it was before
I used to think i was something
I used to think i was
You don't push me around
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
You don't push me around
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
You don't push me around
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
You don't push me around
You don't push me around
You don't push me around no more
You don't push me around
