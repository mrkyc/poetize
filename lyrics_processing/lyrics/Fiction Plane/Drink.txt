Because I'm weak
Well that's all fine for you to say but I'm too shy to even speak
I can't go out in the world without a little fire in my soul
It puts a fight into me
You push me and I just can't let it roll, roll
I don't know if i should drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Never learning nothing when I don't know I'm alive
It gives me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Turning into nothing when I don't know I'm alive
There was a time don't you forget when I was green and you were red
All boastful lies no great surprise what shit comes out of my drunken head
I met a woman that night
She loved me for the stories that I told
But when the booze ran out my silence left her ring hand feeling cold, cold
I don't know if i should drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Never learning nothing when I don't know I'm alive
It gives me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Turning into nothing when I don't know I'm alive
You give me fire
You might also likeNo drinks no drugs no cigarettes
Nothing but silence caused by doubt
There was a good boy inside me
But the landlord tried to kick that good boy out, that good boy out
I don't know if i should drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Never learning nothing when I don't know I'm alive
It gives me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Turning into nothing when I don't know I'm alive
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
You give me fire
I don't know if i should drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Never learning nothing when I don't know I'm alive
It gives me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone keeping out of trouble
Turning into nothing when I don't know I'm alive
