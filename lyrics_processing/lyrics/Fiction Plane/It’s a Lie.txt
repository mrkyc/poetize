If I lie right here
Girl this was your idea
You know it's not my fault
You say you want my love
Well my love taste of salt
I've got a list of things I want to do before
I think of someone else's sorrow
If there's a deeper meaning that you're trying to find
Well it's in your head
You'd better treat it kind
If you've done misread me
Then I'll make it clear tomorrow
Wish I could tell you I'm a better guy
That love is all around and only real man cry
But all I want to do is jump your bones
And slam dance all night to the music of your moans
It's a lie
If I lie right here
It's a lie
If I lie right here
You might also likeUnderneath my face there is a human skull
Without the living flesh you'd find it pretty dull
Underneath my skull there is a think machine
That only loves itself
And in the best of worlds you are the same as me
You think of life and love and morals separately
You don't expect a promise to last longer than the words themselves
Wish I could tell you I'm a better guy
That love is all around and only real man cry
But all I want to do is jump your bones
And slam dance all night to the music of your moans
It's a lie
If I lie right here
It's a lie
If I lie right here
It's a lie
If I lie right here
It's a lie
If I lie right here
Wish I could tell you I'm a better guy
That love is all around and only real man cry
But all I want to do is jump your bones
And slam dance all night to the music of your moans
It's a lie
(wish I could tell you I'm a better guy)
If I lie right here
It's a lie
(that love is all around and only real man cry)
If I lie right here
It's a lie
(but all I want to do is jump your bones)
If I lie right here
It's a lie
(and slam dance all night to the music of your moans)
