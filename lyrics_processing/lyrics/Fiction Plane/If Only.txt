She's holdin' a grievance for hundred-odd years
We all keep believin'
That history repeats itself year after year
How I fear that the future is worse
We have to give in to a hundred-year curse
Sweat in the sun like we're diggin' a grave
Dig deep enough and our fortune is saved--
"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs
"The bark on the trees was as soft as the skies,"
As the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely
He cries to the moo-oo-oon, "If only, if only."
Chasin' the skirt of a beautiful wife
You make mistakes and it's my back that breaks
And forever my past steals my life
To submission I'm beat, but there's hope beneath these feet
Blisters and blood and the sun makes you blind
Don't let it eat ya, it can't help but be kind
'Cause you know what's important with your back to the wall
You can break metal chains when your friends don't let you fall--
"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs
"The bark on the trees was as soft as the skies,"
As the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely
He cries to the moo-oo-oon, "If only, if only."
You might also likeI'm a sword but I find myself blunt
That is no use when i'm fighting my history, fighting my history
I have no blade, I'm more like a feather
That is no use when I'm fighting my history, fighting my history
I have no blade, I'm more like a feather
But I can't fly away without fighting myself--
"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs
"The bark on the trees was as soft as the skies,"
As the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely
He cries to the moo-oo-oon, "If only, if only."
"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs
"The bark on the trees was as soft as the skies,"
As the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely
