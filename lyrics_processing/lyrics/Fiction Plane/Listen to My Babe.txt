Give them all the guns and clips they need

What is it to say that if they all lay down
That my home would be gone
I wanna put glue down your gun
Imagine pointing that thing at your son
When he dies you tell us who won
And there will be no invasion
Soldier Machismo
And his morals
Who am I to know what you save me from
What is it to say that if they all lay down
That my home would be gone
