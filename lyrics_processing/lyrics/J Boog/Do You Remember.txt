Do you remember? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remember, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)
Do you remember? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remember, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto old days)
Even though, one reason hold your nose still ride
To send out paper, baby blazin like to get stay high
Lost my family in the
But through love I felt the
I just can't wait til we'll be together again
I gotta keep on chasin' the game
Reppin' my name
Stack my cheese right before I get a small den
I just try to try to stay above the water
These dudes are trying to get me that's why I don't need a lotta (Haters)
Pullin' me down, draggin me round', making me drown
They hold up in your mouth, blou
Lay back!
Marinate upon em good ol days yeah
