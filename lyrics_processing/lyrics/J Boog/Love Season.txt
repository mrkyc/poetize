You're here to relax babe
Time to take it slow
Time to wind down and lay your hair
Now all my eyes can do is stare, I'm talking 'bout
Pushing, rubbing, touching, kissing, sheets is missin' babe
All up on the bed
The floor, the bath or even by the porch by the front door, yes, ah
And when it's cold outside, I can be your fire
And when it gets too hot for you girl
I'm going down, down, down, down, yes
B-body heat g-gettin' higher on the double
You shoulda kept your mouth shut 'cause you are in trouble
Your body crumbles 'cause ya love the way I touch you
