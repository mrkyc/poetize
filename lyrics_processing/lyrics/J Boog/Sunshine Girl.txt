Oh oh, oh oh

Oh oh, oh oh
With a song from the sun, aye

She's a sunshine girl lighting up my world
What she does to me
She makes me say woah (woah) woah (woah) woah (woah)
She's so sweet it makes me say woah (woah) woah (woah) woah (woah)
She's so sweet it makes me say woah

I'mma play it real smooth try to not get tied in
Gotta build courage and my confidence
Take it real cool your heart I wanna win
Me can't think straight cause you make me wanna sin
Body bad make me wanna pull out me lighter
Charisma shoot out like a geyser
Break necks of people that pass beside her
The woman is hotter than the fire
I'm burning with love and I'd love to love her
I said forever I'd love to love her

She's a sunshine girl lighting up my world
What she does to me
She makes me say woah (woah) woah (woah) woah (woah)
She's so sweet it makes me say woah (woah) woah (woah) woah (woah)

Peetah, I met this girl in Margaritaville
But this sweet little girl said she was from Brazil
No mister J-Boog it doesn't even matter
She could have come from  or from Samoa
Or Fiji, Solomon Islands, or New Caledonia
Or even Hawaii the land of sweet pakalolo
Peetah I've seen girls all over
And numbers galore
But this one I'm sure of and I'll never let go
She's a sunshine girl lighting up my world
