Why, why, why-ah
Yeh, eyah, eyah, yohh
Ahh, yeh
A long time we all thought fe were fierce
Now it's about time everyone see it
Everyone see it
Emergency, someone call the ambulance
Things outta place, open up your mind again
Stop, wait, listen and take another glance
Them all aren't helping, nobody gives a damn
Long live the golden days we lived in
All of the treaty's torn it's long done
Ain't for the people, now let's prolong
What can we do to change this wrong
Tell me
Nothing's gonna break us apart, but as long as we try
Love will always make us unite
Nothing's gonna break us apart, but as long as we fight
Love will always make us unite
Shots say
Bullet, crowd disperse
All em people member listening how lone it was
Some boy took it, blood all round
Nother kid falls cold from a unknown gun
Now, I pray to our father for guidance
Forgive us for reckless defiance
Let's unite our people and triumph
Well-a-woy

Remembering
When it was nice
Never feared
The streets at night
Oh how I wish
If I could
Turn back
The hands of time
We can't let this make us
Start fresh from today and say goodbye
Need a new example, yeah
To put hope in our lives
Nothing's gonna break us apart, but as long as we try
Love will always make us unite
Nothing's gonna break us apart, but as long as we fight
