Well she has many of guys
Still her eyes
Have been staring at me
Plenty of times
With the kind of a look that would mess with anyones mind
Have me wishing that this lady was mine
But I'm
So confused
With the vibes that I'm getting
Whether she's hinting
For me to approach and not get close
First she smiles, then she winks, now I'm under her spell
Is she playing hard to get, man I just can't tell
But now I'm

Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
To ask if you're the one I'm looking for
Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
To ask if you're the one I'm looking for
Looking for
You might also like
But can I get your attention
Beautiful Lady
It would just take a second
Been thinking lately
Now I have a confession
Wondering maybe
If you feel a connection
'Cause of the way you staring
Straight at my direction
And I'm going crazy
'Cause you're building this tension
Can I be your baby
And can you be my blessing
But if it ain't me
'Nuff said love
I'd rather just know
Instead of

Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
To ask if you're the one I'm looking for
Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
To ask if you're the one I'm looking for
Looking for
I guess I knew for sure
If you're
The girl
Im looking for
Or
A girl I should ignore
Oh Lord
I start there
My heart stirs
My thoughts blur
My thighs shake
My mind blanks
And I can't think
I'm speechless
Your smile is my weakness
I hope one day I hear your answer from your sweet lips
To the question
"Will you be mine?"
But until you answer
That's all I'm ever gonna be is just another guy that

Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
To ask if you're the one I'm looking for
Picking at rose petals, watching them drop
She loves me or she love me not
She loves me or she love me not
I've got, I've got to know and is it a lot
