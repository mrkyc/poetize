Every time I go on tour, communication get poor. God, I'm missin you all night and all day. When I look at your picture I can't help but be annoyed. Oh, what I would give for just another day. You take my thoughts, stress away, your touch and your embrace, I'm missin you all over again. Nothin else could replace the sweet love we make, can't get you out of my head
This long distance love, keep me on it boy, can't do it without your long distance love. Even though it's head of time, this love is one of a kind. (x2)
You've got me Skyping and typing, I'm textin and writin, just wanting to be where you are. I know, no it's alright, how we feel when we unite. How I'm here and you there, it's too far. Livin without you is not easy you know. Tired and lonely nights and squeezin me love. But when I think about our love and think about our trust, it takes my stress and eases it up and I will be faithful until three thousand and ten, yeah. I will be waitin until I see you again
This long distance love, keep me on it boy, can't do it without your long distance love. Even though it's head of time, this love is one of a kind. (x2)
It's been hard on the road, but we can endure, we've been through these hard times before. And not times are not though, drivin for miles, when I meet you it'll be worthwhile. You know I've been searchin for that one that, for someone in my life. That someone that I wanna give you, give em all of my time
This long distance love, keep me on it boy, can't do it without your long distance love. Even though it's head of time, this love is one of a kind. (x2)
