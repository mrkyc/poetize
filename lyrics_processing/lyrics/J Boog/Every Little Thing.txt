Well it's like every little thing, anything you say
Every little sway I just stop and pause and yell out
Wah oh wah oh I
Wah oh wah oh I
Well it's like every little thing, anything you say
Every little sway I just stop and pause and yell out
Wah oh wah oh I
Wah oh wah oh I, yah

Thought I was never ever gonna give up my love again girl
But then her characteristics showed me a whole new world
Because I never knew a girl that I
Can savor and then let me fill it and come back again
To taste some other flavors
Pick it on up let's roll, got that spice to fill your bowl
Need someone to fill my home, love is hot never on cold and girl
There shouldn't be no dull moment, identify them every touch giving them full focus
Love back is what I'm called Daddy giving you what you want
Very special girl it's your lovin that I want to flaunt
Not easy chasing you, my baby baby boo
There are no words up in a book that can compare to you

I've been all across the world looking for you, searching for you
While all them other guys tryna get close to you
Let me paint that picture girl, let destiny untwurl, its me and you I want you in my world
The way you dress up your style and that glow in your smile
Just, do that to me one more time
I never get enough no way keep it coming coming my baby
Only you can drive me crazy


Yo, I'm a make it hot like a perm
Oowee go in light ya girl
With extra curricula sexual charge
Til you say J Boogy don't give me no more
Utilize every little inch of the floor
Stretch out your body til you walk like you're sore
Girl I'm a one whirl hurricane boy, I'ma
Give you the ride give you the morning ride
Anything you want baby everythings outside
