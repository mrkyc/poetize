It's 2 months, it's 12 days, it's 5 hours
Since I can't talk to you
Girl I, really gotta say
It's been driving me crazy for a while

'Cause each time she comes and goes she leaves with a piece of me
And I try to tell myself one day that she'll learn to love me
I bet I'll never see, yeah
She breaks my heart over and over again
But I still ask when will I see her again
I always thought we would be more than just friends
So I ask when will I see her again
Woah oh ohh oh ohh oh
When will I see her again
Oh ohh oh ohh oh
When will I see her again

I can't think of what I do wrong (maybe)
Maybe she just put me in the friend zone yeah
And even though that my feeling strong
I think she only texts me when she feels lonely

'Cause each time she comes and goes she leaves with a piece of me
And I try to tell myself one day that she'll learn to love me
Bet I'll never see it yeah
She breaks my heart over and over again
But I still ask when will I see her again
I always thought we would be more than just friends
So I ask when will I see her again
Woah oh ohh oh ohh oh
When will I see her again
Oh ohh oh ohh oh
When will I see her again

You've made me the one to watch you cry
When you get hurt by these other guys
And accuse me of knowing that I
Can give you everything you need

Each time she comes and goes she leaves with a piece of me
And I try to tell myself one day that she learns to love me
Bet I'll never see it yeah
She breaks my heart over and over again
But I still ask when will I see her again

So I ask when will I see her again
Woah oh ohh oh ohh oh
When will I see her again
Oh ohh oh ohh oh
