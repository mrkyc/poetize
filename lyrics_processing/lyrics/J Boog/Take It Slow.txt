Let's talk tonight, baby
I said, baby, well oh well, oh well
You bet me ready then top off like a fighter
When I get my snake you bite tip with your tiger
You are the crop and the cream, have me hooked like a fiend
And that's you girl so sweet
Everything about you is cool, and now I know is no fool
And her body's right, yeah
You make me think of some more
Like MJ said, that girl is mine
I take her back to the room, she want me tonight
That's when I said

No more words cause my breath will take
