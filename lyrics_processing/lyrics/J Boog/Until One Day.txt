Woah, naw-naw, naw-naw, yes, yes
So, so, so
Woah, naw-naw, naw-naw, yes
Woah, naw-naw, naw-naw, yes, yes
So, so, so incredible
Well how we planned life out
You had my heart, girl I had yours
No room for complication and just my appreciation for you
And girl I love the way your body fits mine
Just a daily dose of your love I need the most
I need your lovah-lovah-love, lovah-lovah-love
Until one day
(You will start to realize, you'll always forever be mine)
Until one day
(For all time)
Until one day, one day, one day
(You will start to realize, you'll always forever be mine)
Until one day, yes nah
(For all time)
What, what is all of this nonsense that's just done came out the blue?
Feelings far away from each other
You blame me I blame you, oh
We don't listen to every word we say
That's why we always brake up and make up now baby
No no no more, no no no more, no
Don't need no more pain in our lives
No no no more, no no no more
I need your lovah-lovah-love, lovah-lovah-love

Open the door
You know we had some tough times before
But there is nothing that this love can not cure
We've got wisdom, and trials and tribulations
Have to step up, face to face when you wanna say some
See, I know you're like no body else from wide and far
My one and only, mine-o my my superstar
Girl, just put your trust in me
You will forever be, my baby
Until one day
(You will start to realize, you'll always forever be mine)
Until one day

Until one day, one day, one day
(You will start to realize, you'll always forever be mine)
Until one, yes nah
