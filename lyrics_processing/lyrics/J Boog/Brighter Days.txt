And all the clouds block out the way
Sometimes you want the road to be straight but a lot of times
You reach a point where it splits four ways
Sometimes it's why you've a plan you don't wanna try
And where you're at you just want to stay
Sometimes you wish you would give it another life
It's yours to live not yours to trade
Hold on
Doesn't help to cry but tell me why tears flood your eyes now just
Hold on
Maybe because what you're feeling inside is too much to act now
Life is gonna get much shorter
That's what's gonna make you stronger
Trust me you won't be here much longer
'Cause with Jah anything we'll conquer
Yeah-yeah, aye
Never give up have a little faith and just wait
It's gonna be a brighter day
All the pain and the struggling is not in vain and just wait
It's gonna be a brighter day (hold on, hold on)
Just wait it's gonna be a brghter day (hold on)
Hold on yes, gonna be a brighter day
