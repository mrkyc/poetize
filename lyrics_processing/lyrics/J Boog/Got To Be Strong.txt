Call the people dem-a say we love the dub version
When we light the guns on fire
And dem tings say we are Taliban
To let the slotta dial-a 9-1-1
Ya got to be strong
Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
Ya got to be strong
Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
Put away ya guns
While a warrior see's fire
Talk to the brother gotta love one another
All ****
Help the consious youth dem burn-a at the fire
Like that patron Saint George beggin effin buy-a
Politicians and false leaders divide and ** conquer
Let's unite and live together
Got to make the world a better place
When we light the guns on fire
And dem tings say we are Taliban
To let this lotta dial-a 9-1-1

Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
Ya got to be strong
Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
A sink fence and border line
Do they make you trick you with them evil mind
They will choke you like a porcupine
Word is win by the blow his unkind
Watch out for mister be*** in crime
Got to note the step without the read the sign
Duck afraid to kiss and have the youth sublime
Whoa we're living in a serious time
When we light the guns on fire
And dem tings say we are Taliban
To let this lotta dial-a 9-1-1
Ya got to be strong
Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
Ya got to be strong
Living in-a Babylon
Ya got to be wise
To escape the dragon
