Watching how, he doesn't treat you right
Well I'm not hating, I'm just another player and I'm trying
Slowly to slide in the position that has tied
You up and then you thought that you couldn't do better
This love is much more stronger than all that cheddar
So if and when you're ready to meet ya true lover
Just call me baby and know I'll come running over, oh
Baby come in, come and let's start this love affair
(Let's start this love affair)
Please don't hesitate, name the place and I'll meet you there
(Baby, baby, maybe)
Let's not rush in to it, if you're not well prepared
(If you're not ready just let me know)
This is something so special and you know it's rare
(No, no, no)
All that flossin while every night you tossin and turnin, wonderin, if you can be with me
Oh baby, oh baby
All that ice on your fingers can not take away this joy we bring, when we're together
Oh baby, oh baby
