Let me take you to the plantation
I wish I could-a-give it to the nation
Roll up something
I wanna blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling
I don't mind getting charged for, charged for
Ten pounds of sensimilla
Who ganja green sativa
Nice to know ya, 
Growing out the meadows greener
Me love the sour diesel
Cross it with the cheddar cheese
Genesis 1:12, tell me
Lion never smoked red evil
Just smoke and let's be merry
Kush and cookies with blueberries
(Wind it up, roll it up, and spark it till the tip is cherry)
Then breath it in, and keep it in, because it's customary
Up, Up, and away we go
I wanna blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling, give me that feeling
Let me blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling
I don't mind getting charged for, charged for

Put all me love marijuana
Me garden 
It is predicted, I am addicted
With Afrikan seed, me conflicted
Always up the weed army
From Compton California, Czech Republic, all the way to Bengali
General said the Marijuan army
General Marijuan they call me
Eyes them red and dye my cherry
I wanna blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling, give me that feeling
Let me blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental

Me seen a lot of ganja, two acres with 
Gringos , legends told of trees some decades older
Fruity fresh, winter green, jackalope and new dream
Where the herbs all reign supreme
Head rush , and Molokai is sweetest
Champion make me hungry
Then the butter make me sleepy
Whatever it is, I know I need it in my life
(And one thing comes to mind when I say)
I wanna blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling, give me that feeling
Let me blaze it for days, take me away
Take me to that higest place where I meditate
With high-grade marijuana, cause diesel sentimental
Give me that feeling
