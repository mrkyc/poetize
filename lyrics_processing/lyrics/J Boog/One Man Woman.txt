Eeah, eeah, eeah, yeah, yeah
Well for some time I've been waiting on you
Procrastinating on the things you always say you wan fe do
You either in it or you're not
No more lies behind my back
Too much weight upon me shoulders not to open back up
Oh no, stop de fun
Just like me love you wan fe hell, you go
Mess with my mind bury a lie after a lie I don't
Know if your words and everything's rough and never makes sense
Well we got to move on, yeah
All I ever wanted was a one man woman for a one woman man like me
She not fussy and she not play no games only filled with virtuosity
When the world is raining all she have fe do is just look at me
So baby girl if you fit the profile take a chance and you will see
We always argue too much
If the moods like her cuz
Never seems to get anything by
We always break up and make up
So just hanging by not much
But thats not gonna happen this time
You might also likeOh no, stop de fun
Just like me love you wan fe hell, you go
Mess with me mind very a lie after a lie I don't
Know if your words and everything's rough and never makes sense
Well we got to move on, yeah
All I ever wanted was a one man woman for a one woman man like me
She not fussy and she not play no games only filled with virtuosity
When the world is raining all she have fe do is just look at me
So baby girl if you fit the profile take a chance and you will see
News flash, splash
They said don't go wild on no glass
Have to keep everything cool
Or de truth-a-lize your ass

My uncompelled to more blacker
Try 'ear your words its just chatter
Feel like your love'll retire
