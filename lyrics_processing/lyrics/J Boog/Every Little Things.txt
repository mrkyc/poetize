Thought I was never ever gonna give up my love again girl
But then her characteristic showed me a whole new world
Because I never knew a girl that I
Can savor and then lick a little come back again to taste some other flavors
Pick it on up let's roll, got that spice to fill your bowl
Need someone to fill my home, love is hot never on cold
And girl, there shouldn't be no dull moment, identify them every touch giving them full focus
Love back is what I'm called Daddy giving you what you want
Very special girl is your love that I want to flaunt
Now is that chasing you my baby baby boo
There are no words up in a book that can compare to you

While all them other guys trying to get close to you
Let me paint that picture girl, let destiny untwirl, its me and you I want you in my world
The way you dress up your style and that glow in your smile
Just do that to me one more time

We got static, it's erotic like listening to Luther V singing
Do you wanna be, say you wanna be, do you wanna be, say you wanna be, do you wanna be
