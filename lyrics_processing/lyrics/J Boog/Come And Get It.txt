Your voice when you speak to me
Your sweat when you leak for me
Said baby my name is Boog from the South Pac way
Every inch of your body
I wanna yell out, ooo-wee
So won't you say yes, laaaady
Come chill with me
Let me lick you up and down and move your body round
Push my love inside and make you say dem sexy sounds
Hit the high key girl you know what I'm talking bout
Please stop fronting now just pull dem satins down

If you want some action
Come and get it
Some real satisfaction
Come and get it
Long lasting all night
Come and get it
Girl I know what you like
Come and get it

Ooh baby
Your body when you move with me
Your eyes lookin in to me
Your touch all over my body
Lying next to you, make me wanna say ooo-wee
Oooh baby
Lying next to you, make me wanna say ooooh
Squeezing and rubbin on you all night long
Takin advantage of your every way
We make sweet lovin to our favorite song
And you can have it your way, baby
You might also like
I know you like it when I pull you hair
Run my fingers down your spine while your back is bare
Make your body shiver baby
Make your toes curl so wild
We get down on the crazy, oh yeah
My body's yearning for you
Your body's yearning for me
Get hotter while we proceed
Let me fulfill all your needs
So after when we are done
We both can lay here with ease, yes now

Let me lick you up and down and move your body round
Push my love inside and make you say dem sexy sounds
Hit the high key girl you know what I'm talking bout
Please stop fronting now just pull dem satins down
