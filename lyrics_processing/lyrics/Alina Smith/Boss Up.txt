I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up, bitch you better boss up fast

Lesson one, never listen to a stupid man
Let him run his mouth while you run errands in your Benz
Lesson two, do whatever you wanna do
Play it big, snatch a wig, elevate your game while they follow rules
Lesson three is never doing wishy-washy business
If you wanna be the creme then put your cookie in it
Flossin' on max, get 'em like plague
And if they think you're way too sick then they can wear a mask
(Mm-hm)

Watch me makin' my luck, every minute, minute
Headin' straight to the top, ain't no limit, limit
Keep on makin' it pop 'til my name in Guinness
And I'm never gonna stop

I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up, bitch you better boss up fast
Boss up, boss up
Yeah, I'ma make you boss up fast
Boss up, boss up
Yeah, I'ma make you boss up fast

Keep my money like I keep my body;
Thick as fuck
So if you wanna get it like I get it
Bitch you better boss up

Look in the mirror, damn I'm fuckin' fine
Got that botox early, she forever twenty-five
Used to be the girl to shrink into a ball and cry
But now I be the women eating little men alive, oh
Yup I'm the first in my fam to get a mil
Put it in my purse 'til it burst from all the bills
In it for the heart of it but money is a benefit
I get it, get it, get it and I'm never getting sick of it
Hard work working, keep all the exes lurking
And if you hang with me, bitch, we will get your ass a Birkin

Watch me makin' my luck, every minute, minute
Headin' straight to the top, ain't no limit, limit
Keep on makin' it pop 'til my name in Guinness
And I'm never gonna stop

I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up, bitch you better boss up fast
Boss up, boss up
Yeah, I'ma make you boss up fast
Boss up, boss up
Yeah, I'ma make you boss up fast
Keep my money like I keep my body;
Thick as fuck
So if you wanna get it like I get it
Bitch you better boss up

Color, color green lookin' good on me
Dollar, dollar tree not the energy
They be bringing heat, but you know I keep it icy
'Cause a CEO is all I see
Color, color green lookin' good on me
Dollar, dollar tree not the energy
They be bringing heat, but you know I keep it icy
