I came to make a name
Catch a star, and leave it
On that pavement
Came to entertain
But what I didn't know
Is that a stage would be my cage

'Cause when you only see your beauty in the applause
You can't love yourself when there's silence
Yeah, I wanna see my worth when no one else does
I keep looking and I keep trying

But I feel my Hollywood Heart
And its every beat is a knock-off
I'm tryna heal my Hollywood Heart
But it's hard to give it my trust

'Cause Hollywood Heart is a faker
Hollywood Heart doesn't show when it's breaking
Hollywood Heart is a hater
Hollywood Heart isn't whole 'til you make it
You might also like
I try to be good to the girl
On the couch on her free day
Easier to say than do
Words pop up like "loser"
And, no, it's not cool

But when you only see your beauty in the applause
You can't love yourself when there's silence (Silence)
Yeah, I wanna see my worth when no one else does
I keep looking and I keep trying

But I feel my Hollywood Heart
And its every beat is a knock-off (Is a knock-off)
I'm tryna heal my Hollywood Heart
But it's hard to give it my trust

'Cause Hollywood Heart is a faker
Hollywood Heart doesn't show when it's breaking
Hollywood Heart is a hater
Hollywood Heart isn't whole
'Til you make it, no
I'm trying to set it free, yeah
(I'm trying to set it free)
I'm trying to find my peace, but
(I'm trying to find my peace)
I'm trying to set it free (Free)

But I feel my Hollywood Heart
And its every beat is a knock-off
I'm tryna heal my Hollywood Heart
But it's hard to give it my trust

'Cause Hollywood Heart is a faker
Hollywood Heart doesn't show when it's breaking
Hollywood Heart is a hater (Is a hater)
Hollywood Heart isn't whole 'til you make it
