Someone treat that lover is like eyes
Smoke come up and leave 'em
Changin' with the seasons (Yeah)
But y'know that shit ain't my style (Nah, nah)
I just want the OGs
Always been there for me

Yeah, he saw me when nobody would
And he loved me good
Through the bad and the ugly
He ain't ever got to knock on wood
Tell him, "Baby, don't worry"

I don't need distractions, I don't need the fun (No)
I just want the one that's been here since day one
I don't buy the cheap thrills, I just get the bond
I got with the one that's been here since day one
I don't need distractions, I don't need the fun
I just want the one that's been here since day one
I don't need to play games, I already won
'Cause I got the one that's been here since day one, day one

Day one
Yeah he always been the only one
From day one
Day one
No I'll never want another one

Some had said we'd soon be old news
'Cause we didn't work on paper
I say "Fuck the haters"
'Cause the day I met him I knew
Felt a chemistry of spirit
Way beyond the physics

What you know about a man who worked double time
Helped a woman chase a dream
Made my dream his horizon
Buying medicine when I'm sick
Brushed my hair when I'm stressed
Made me snacks when I got PMS, yup
Baby been the ground that
I been building on
I wouldn't be the woman I am
Without the years we barely made rent
Way he taught me patience
Loved me at my worst, now he gets my best
