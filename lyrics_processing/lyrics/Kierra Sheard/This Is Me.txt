Or I was living too good to listen to the preacher
You'd make it so that I would realize my disillusion
Then I'd have to re-evaluate some things
At one time I was truly a circumstantial kind of praiser
Only when things were going good I'd lift my voice to worship
Forgetting, when all of the chips were down who faitfully stayed around
And helped me out, Lord I don't know how
At times, I lost sight of my faith
At times, I tried
But I found it hard to wait on You
Many times I have taken things in my own hands
And messed up bad
So here I am singing
This is me
(In my entirety)
This is me
(A person saved by grace)
Humbly, confessing:
With you I'm something but without you I'm nothing Lord
This is me
(So plain and ordinary)
This is me
(Minus everything fancy)
Placed simply here
To give you praises and give you honor to your name
Through trials you mold me
I'm forever a work of art in progress
Though I don't always seem to see it
Yes it does manifest
It's just so evidently
No one can deny that You're the one
Working through me, so I can be
What you called me
With thoughts of faith I read Your Word
And boldly proclaim my blessing
And with my whole heart I will worship you
Simply for being above all things
The morning star that brings light and hope for me
Lord I really need thee
I pray that you forgive me for the times I couldn't take at your Word
Word Lord, I am willing to give my everything
Everything to please thee
Lord, you grace is more than sufficient and
As for your will for me
I accept it and
Who I am in You I'm confident and I believe
Please here me
