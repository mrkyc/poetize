Now why (why)
Ain't it enough that You died (died)
Hung on the cross just to save my soul
And that's just so amazing, so
I gotta serve You like (it's the last time)
And I gotta get it right (cause You gave my)
Life a new meaning, why?
I really can't figure it out
Why somebody like me
Is who You'd worry about
That's why...

I look on the deeper side of me
Is it worth it all just for me?
Yes, okay, if You say so
I just wanna show You that I'm grateful

I was thinking
How did You ever come to
Love somebody like You love me, love me?
Keep somebody like You kept me, kept me?
Ohh
I was thinking
How did You ever come to
Love somebody like You love me, love me?
Keep somebody like You kept, kept me?
You might also like
I've done wrong (wrong)
And I think You've moved on (on)
You reach out Your hand to say I am here
I never left you, I brought you here
So what makes it hard to see that I love you
You gave Your own whole life for me (yes, that's true)
Regardless of everything
I'm with you when you're in doubt
But I know that you know I'm the one that brought you out
That's why...

I look on the deeper side of me
Is it worth it all just for me?
Yes, okay, if You say so
I just wanna show You that I'm grateful

I was thinking
How did You ever come to
Love somebody like You love me, love me?
Keep somebody like You kept me, kept me?
Ohh
I was thinking
How did You ever come to
Love somebody like You love me, love me?
Keep somebody like You kept, kept me?
You've been my deliverer
