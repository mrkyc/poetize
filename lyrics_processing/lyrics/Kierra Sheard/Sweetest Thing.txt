He's the sweetest thing that I've ever known
Sweeter than a honey on a honeycomb
Sweeter than the thing on Love Jones
Instead of me getting weak, He makes me strong
(Sweetest I've ever known)

He is a friend with love that is almost unheard of
(A love from up above)
He is someone that is with me when I feel all alone

He is the sweetest thing (that is ever shown)
He is the sweetest thing (when I think of him, my mind is blown)
He is the sweetest thing (he is the best friend I've ever known)
He is the sweetest thing (when I think of him, he gives me a love song)

He's the sweetest thing that I've ever known
Sweeter than a honey on a honeycomb
Sweeter than the thing on Love Jones
Instead of me getting weak, He makes me strong
(Sweetest I've ever known)

He is a man in my life and he always makes things right
(Yeah, we'd like to have that)
During my struggles and my troubles
It seems like that I always fear
Now I know he's near
You might also like
He is the sweetest thing (He gives me peace in the midnight hour)
He is the sweetest thing (when I'm down, He lifts me higher)
He is the sweetest thing
(With His love, there ain't no shame in my game, no)
He is the sweetest thing
(The money or the fortune don't matter at all)

He's the sweetest thing that I've ever known
Sweeter than a honey on a honeycomb
Sweeter than the thing on Love Jones
Instead of me getting weak, He makes me strong
(Sweetest I've ever known)

You're so wonderful, Jesus
I can't find nothing better, no no no no

Sweeter than the glowy skies
Never knew and don't know why
He rescued me from a sinful soul
And made me whole
He made my life complete from the love you gave
Ahh, ahh, ah-ahh no-no
Ahh, ahh, ah-ahh no-no
Ahh, ahh, ah-ahh no-no
Ahh, ahh, ah-ahh no-no

There's nothing better, no no, nothing better
Can't find nothing better
You give me peace
Nothing better
When I think of your goodness
Oh, nothing better
You brought me out
Out of so many things without a doubt
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I am still here, it's by the grace of God
Oh I am still here, it's by the grace of God

Oh you gave me a second chance
Oh yeah
There's nothing better, no, nothing better
Yeah, yeah
Oh nothing better
Oh nothing better
