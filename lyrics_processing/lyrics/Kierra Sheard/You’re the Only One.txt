Hey, it's me girl B and I have my girl Kiki here
And Uncle Fred is my daddy
Darkchild! What!
Show 'em how you do it, Kiki

I can't believe it myself (myself)
Look at all the things I been through (hurt, pain, defeat)
Yes me (lies, strain, deceit)
But I couldn't get through it by myself
Yes, sometimes I needed help
Not just ordinary, something more extraordinary

Supernatural, I'm talking something incredible
I'm needing you, Jesus, right now
I'm holding on to you right now
When I call your name
And I'm not giving you the praise
I'm needing you, Jesus
That's why you're the only one I...

You're the only one that, that makes me
You're the only one that, that loves me
You're the only one I think about
Whenever I need you I scream it loud
You're the only one that, that makes me
You're the only one that, that loves me
You're the only one I think about
Whenever I need you I scream it loud
You might also like
It doesn't matter what time I call on you
I know you keep (he never sleeps)
He is (always with me)
And that's why I feel so complete
Yes He is the best part of me
There is no comparing
He's out of the ordinary

Supernatural, I'm talking something incredible
I'm needing you, Jesus, right now
I'm holding on to you right now
When I call your name
And I'm not giving you the praise
I'm needing you, Jesus
That's why you're the only one I...


Ooh, and I know what I believe
Ooh, it's your grace that keeping me, oh yeah
('Cause you're the only one I could never give up)
That's why I tell the world
You're the one that keeps me
 (2x)
You keep me, me
I haven't found nobody like you, no
Oh yeah, you keep me in your loving arms
From all the hurt, harm, and danger
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Oh...
Ha ha ha ha ha
Hey hey yeah...
