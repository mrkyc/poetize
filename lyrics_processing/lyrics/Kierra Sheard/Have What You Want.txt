Yo Ki, it's your boy, Young Drew and I want to tell the people
Not to give up, ya know
So let's hear it
Talk to 'em

Were you ever at a point where you felt like you wasn't gonna make it
You don't have to answer
Cause we all had to deal with it
It was like every day you had a fit
Did you ever have a situation where you just wanted to flip the script
Yeah, me too, things got crazy
My people started acting shady
But it was actually reality
I realized that it was the enemy, he had my people hating me
And the crazy thing about it is
I hadn't even made it to my destiny
You know, where I'm supposed to be
And I was like, wait a minute
Are you knocking me
And then my brother said to me

Yo imagine how it is when you get where you're supposed to be
And haters come knocking at the door
They see you blessing me
So don't stress, Ki
So just keep, keep, keep pressing
Everybody put your hands in the air
Here's the message
You might also like
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

You may not understand why
It took me so much time
But you had to realize
I couldn't just run, I had to walk my way through
A storm to get to be a newborn
I was determined to get to a place that was closer to Him
But my main focus was them
When I had to go through that stage
Where I was rebellious
My conscience wouldn't let me listen so I had to learn to listen
To get to my blessing

Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

You were looking for manifestation 
But God has a unique way of taking You
To your destination

Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Don't let them ever get to you
You can have what you want, be what you want
