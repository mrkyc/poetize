Broken relationships
Your hearts been broken and you may feel like there is no hope
But God stands with open arms

So pride resides in your heart and you won't admit that it's hurting you
But don't go and leave it in fear
But it's up to you to let God in
Until then I say

Victory is over you
Better days and peace of mind, yeah
Victory is over you
We declare it
So receive it
