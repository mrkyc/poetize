She'll be there waiting for you
With tear stained eyes
Now he'll be there dressed for the fight
Sword out and mouth full of lies
But you'll be fine
And I already know that it's uncomfortable for a father to ask this of his son
But could you
Kill the dragon, save the girl
He's got a trap down in the world
And you can have her for your bride
But this will cost your life
Love will open with the key
Drenched in blood and suffering
The greatest story ever heard
Kill the dragon, save the girl
Son, there is debt that she made
A price only your life could pay
She needs your love
He made her a slave to her sin
Accused her again and again
She's had enough
And I already know that it's uncomfortable for a father to ask this of his son
But could you
Kill the dragon, save the girl
He's got a trap down in the world
And you can have her for your bride
But this will cost your life
Love will open with the key
Drenched in blood and suffering
The greatest story ever heard
Kill the dragon, save the girl
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon, save the girl
She needs you, go after her
Kill the dragon
Only you can save her
You have the power
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Shes been blinded by the lights
Go get your grain
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Go get your grain, go get her
Since your love will go far
Kill it, kill it
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
Here's what I want you to do
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon save the world
Kill the dragon
Heres what I want you to do
Kill the dragon
Kill the dragon
All you have to do is
Kill the dragon
