You know I'm in love like crazy
People wanna ask what's up, what's up
They say I'm doin' way too much, too much
I say I just can't get enough, enough
'Cause I'm in love like crazy
I tell it everywhere I go, I go
When they tell me not to rock the boat
But they need to know the You I know, I know
That I'm in love like crazy, yeah

Got me doin' things that I never thought I would
Like gettin' locked out of my car in the rain
It's silly but I say that it's all good (cause He)
Never lets me walk alone (and He)
Loves me even when I'm wrong
And knows how to make my day
