(K-I-K-I)
(K-I-K-I)
(K-I-K-I)

When you look at me, tell me what you see
Can you tell what I'm all about?
If I never, ever said a word
Would my life just scream it loud?

That I'm a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N
That's how I represent (K-I-K-I)

If you like the music, if you like the music
If you like the music, if you like the music
Wave your banner, wave your banner
Wave your banner, wave your banner

Unforgettable, all together, wonderful
There ain't no other way to describe
My walk, my talk, and the way that I feel inside
Is way to incredible, I can never hide
You might also like
That I'm a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N (Oh)
That's how I represent
So if you like it

If you like the music (Oh, oh), if you like the music (Got the music)
If you like the music (Oh), if you like the music
Wave your banner (You should wave), wave your banner (Oh, wave)
Wave your banner, wave your banner

If you like the music (Like the music), if you like the music (Oh)
If you like the music, if you like the music
Wave your banner (Wave your banner), wave your banner (Wave you banner)
Wave your banner (Oh), wave your banner

Now it was told to me when the enemy comes in like a flood
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) The Lord will lift up a standard, it's a banner (K-I-K-I)

If you like the music, if you like the music (Oh)
If you like the music (Oh, if you like it), if you like the music (You love the way)
Wave your banner (Your banner, wave your), wave your banner (Wave)
Wave your banner, wave your banner (You can, you can, oh)
If you like the music (Hey), if you like the music (Hey, if you like it)
If you like the music (Come on), if you like the music (Just take your)
Wave your banner (Oh, wave your), wave your banner (Yeah, come on and wave it)
