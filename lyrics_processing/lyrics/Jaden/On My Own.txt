Mmm
The sun is goin'
The sun is goin'
The sun is goin' down

The city late at night, hit a pinnacle
Shinin' on 'em, I rather trip alone
Put those on game, who didn't know the true form
Of pure evil, so visible, so I keep a lot of vision
Every night I try to read your mind and see what's in your eyes
Or that we catch a vibe, we're wastin' time
'Cause all I ever know is

In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, caught off and I'm floatin' by
In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, let's go up
Baby, yeah we can go up
Feelin' just don't stop it now
Niggas tryna hate on us (Mm-mm)
Ain't worry 'bout a thang
Since I'm strong enough
The feelin' just don't stop it now
Baby, yeah we can go up (Mm)
Baby, yeah we can go up (Yeah)
You might also like
I see the light in you, stay strong
The moon will follow you back home
Since I've seen space, it's been too long
That's why I stargaze in my room
Let the dust settle on Venus
We ran off with diamonds
The media mislead us
True wealth is knowledge
They gon' try to hold you down
But we gon get back up right now
They gon' try to mute this sound
But just know that you got that power

In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, caught off and I'm floatin' by
In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, let's go up
Baby, yeah we can go up
Feelin' just don't stop it now
Niggas tryna hate on us (Mm-mm)
Ain't worry 'bout a thang
Since I'm strong enough
The feelin' just don't stop it now
Baby, yeah we can go up (Mm)
Baby, yeah we can go up
I found Eden, between the Euphrates and the Tigris
I'm not dreamin', smokin' J's on the Nile
This is why, why we came
Think I'm done with the hybrids
I don't like how they speakin'
They just talkin' about us (Talkin' 'bout us)
ERYS

I seen Cudi in a mall (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Them kicks go hard (Them kicks go hard)
Chain disco ball (Like disco ball)
Throw someone in the stars
Whole different Galaxy on my Atari
They tryna copy my walk
Handcuff, wrist rock
I don't listen when they talk, 'cause I heard enough
Woah, I wish, I wish, I wish
I could get a hundred mil' for the wrist
I wish I could get that highrise on my deck
Wish I didn't have to hide it when I walk, and ****
I wish, I wish, I wish that I didn't have to flex like this
I wish that I was a paramedic with the whip
I wish that I'd always bein' honest with the drug problem
I wish, I wish I'm thinking 'bout you when I'm dying like this
