So, I'm in 1 OAK the other day
I see a ***** with all pink teeth
Woah, woah
I need to know who the fuck that is
I know, wait
I'm on the move, wait
I'm on the move, wait
I'm on the move, wait

I drip (Pull up), I drip (Pull up)
I drip (Pull up), I drip-or-is (Pull up)
I drip (Pull up), I drip (Pull up)
I drip (Pull up), I drip-or-is (Pull up)

She a centerfold (Tell her), gotta let 'em know (Yeah)
LV head to toe (Huh), MSFTS necklace on (Glowin')
They be stressin' 'cause I'm reckless and I'm flexin' hard (Flex)
Flexin' super hard (Super), she a superstar (Woah)
With the stupid car (What?) and it's supercharged
Rolex, he went to Luther, got my jeweler far (Rollie pollie)
Out the boulevard (Huh), where the **** are
You gon kill 'em if you pull up, bruh, I wouldn't do it
You might also like
I drip (Pull up), I drip (Pull up)
(What's your student's name?)
I drip (Pull up), I drip-or-is (Pull up)
(That's not a fucking name)
I drip (Pull up), I drip (Pull up)
(Nah, fuck this lil' nigga, thinkin' he can come up in this son of a bitch)
I drip (Pull up), I drip-or-is (Pull up)
(Nah, nigga, we come for your mothafuckin' neck, watch yourself)

Call the shooters up, get the crew involved
You was runnin' round the city like you knew it all
If you yappin' bout the mosh I got, the fluent talk
Chop it, then we toss, we ain't sippin' Voss (No)
We just whippin' cars, man the city's ours
Got that shit that make a nigga fight the principal
'Cause we sick of feelin' like we all invisible
Comin' for your jaw, I'ma hit it hard
I had to switch up the bars, you know I live in the stars
Shit isn't really this gorgeous, I got my baby in Florence
Seein' white hoods on the horses
And they ridin' 'round with a torch
Quick call to the boys, keep the fire on the porch (Let's go)
We don't got a choice (No), gotta hear our voice
I gotta chop off the doors, five on that noise
Supersonic boom, when I'm in the room
Fuck them interviews, I ain't into those (No)
Into makin' ****, push it to the goal (Let's go)
And I run the globe, runnin' through the snow (Go)
Keep the windows up, I'm coughin', 'bout to let it blow
Ice on me, I'm huffin', puffin' like an Eskimo
Nigga, fuck Monsanto
Reckless with the bass and the riot goin' pronto
Told you I'm Medici with the racks, call me Cosimo
Got the next generation ridin' like Geronimo
I-drip, I-drip
I-drip, I-drip-or-is
I-drip, I-drip
I-drip, I-drip-or-is

I don't wanna lie awake at night now
I've been thinkin' 'bout you every night, now
When I had the drip, they sent the high tops (Yeah)
Now when they up, I let the bag talk (Go)
Quick with the switch, that's Lysol (Quick, quick, quick)
Niggas feelin' timid 'cause I might drop ('Cause I might drop)
Private jet done flipped and that's a mic drop (That's a... what?)
I'm just tryna get the city right
Big swish when I pull up, catch me drippin' from the side
Kid's lit, man, I got the type of vision get you high
Man, I'm always killin' it, a villain in disguise
Now my baby say she feel it when we peel off in the ride
It ain't 2017, I'm done with all the crying
Man your boy just signed a deal, made a mil' off the designs
Sitting on a yacht, I pray to God, we caught a vibe
Man, I told my mom I'd try to reach the top while I'm alive

What the... like ERYS is dropping
ERYS really just going crazy
ERYS the mixtape crazy
This shit is legendary
