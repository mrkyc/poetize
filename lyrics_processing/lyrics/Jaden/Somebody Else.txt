Oh, oh
Damn, this nigga SYRE is back
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

She don't need my love, she just need someone else
It burns me every time, it's because she's someone else
Got old pictures of us, now she's with someone else
Keep that to yourself (Keep that to yourself)
I don't need your love, I need somebody else
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell
Go nuts in the club, and then throw up on myself
I'm so far of the edge, I'm so far off the edge
She said, "I don't need your love, I need somebody else"
It burns me every time, it's because she's someone else
Got old pictures of us, but she's with someone else
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge
I don't need your love, I just need someone else, yeah
You at my side, you tell me how to help
I'm all lost, I need you to myself
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge

Zoom, go by
We just tryna be alright, we just tryna live life
Oh, God, we alright, wanna hold you tight, yeah
Now I'm all by myself
Now you wanna need my love
She don't wanna see my love
She don't really wanna be mine, oh, oh, oh
(I'm so lost and I know)
We can wait until the sunrise
And there's no one outside
Move slow motion (I'm so lost and I know)
So much snow on the ground
That was such a fun night
Ridin' on the west side
Sorry that I threw up (I just love you, baby)

She said, "I don't need your love, I need somebody else"
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell
Go nuts in the club, and then throw up on myself
Too far off the edge, I'm too far off the edge
She said, "I don't need your love, I need somebody else" (Someone, someone)
Someone all wrapped up, I'm not under your spell (Someone, someone)
Go nuts in the club, and then throw up on myself (Someone, someone)
