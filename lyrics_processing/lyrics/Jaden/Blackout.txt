She still got my heart (Oh)
In love at fourteen, now we don't even talk
Oh, no, play you a song on the Hill at the car (Ooh, woah, oh)
Streetlights from afar kinda feel like the stars

Now you put one in my stomach, girl, now I really know who you are
Got dropped, why you runnin', girl? Need to be here when I fall
No, don't, girl, I can't be, my apologies to the family
Just you, no plan B, we'll work it out, why can't we?
I'ma leave you to the gods, let this drop, do you feel me now?
I-drip-or-is with the sauce
Since then I ain't leavin' the house, I keep up my guards

She still got my heart
I only think about you when it's dark
How could you let us just fall all apart?
No, no, oh, oh
No, oh

I'm big boss, mosh, posh, talk, fuck
Now it's fossils fallin' from the sky
All on Abbey Road trippin' fuckin' balls
Just so I can go, and I go out at night
She never cried
I don't want your tears 'cause I'm fucking cryin'
Individuals tryna get close, man, I'm just so fuckin' gone tonight
She tried to stay close, on her tippy toes
'Bout to flip and roll on the five
Send me overboard goin' all night
You might also like
She still got my heart
I only think about you when it's dark (No)
How could you let us just fall all apart? (No)
Now it's gone, of course, I thought you'd know
I'm on this road, of course, I'm all alone
All of it's gone, also thought you'd know
I'm on this road, of course, I'm all alone
Took this one too far
Baby, did you know I been callin'?
Outside running in the car
All I wanna know is where you are
Lookin' for my baby, my darling
She still got my heart

No, tell 'em come right now, don't even worry 'bout that
No, I pulled it, I pulled it in the other one, that's the thing
No that's why, that's why I walk around with it
No, somebody comin' right now
Somebody comin' right now

Lost boys never find home
Couldn't tell you places I've gone
Every night a different fuckin' time zone
She don't believe in alien, here is six million tons of limestone
I swear they never listen
I woke up trippin'
They need to see my inventions
On my cell phone venting
Abigaelle always listens
Fairy tales, premonitions
I was gettin' too specific
I had to shift the dimension
Atlantis is in the Pacific
I don't panic, the shit is prolific
Took a canvas, shoved it in a canister, and then it vanishes, shit is terrific
On my cheek, your old lipstick
I just cut my heart in three full pieces, I'm 'bout to see you a triptych
All of us roll up, we doin' a kickflip
I fall in abyss and I suddenly miss it
But fuck it, I'm onto some next shit
I need to get back to the flexin', collectin' the checks
Get 'em out of the section
When I see my whole ego's in question
Man, I hate how the people digest it
Next time you shoot me, just make sure you actually k**l me
So I don't have to live with this purgatory state of confusion for the rest of my dwindling life
She still got my heart

Ha, ha, ha
I'll be your boy when the rain falls
I'll be your man when the snow dries
You know what I came for, girl, I just move on my own time
You, you are the one that's been runnin' on my mind
Say she love me is that your or's that the wine?
I just got my eyes on you (You)
Every night she party in the Hills
Hangover just to see if we can feel
When I drive by your house, girl, it still feels real
Said she love me, is that you or is that the pills?
With my niggas, sippin' pink Benadryl
