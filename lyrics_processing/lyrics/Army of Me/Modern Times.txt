He tried to sell fear and paint the streets red
I remember the day that he ended up dead
It was like any other day
We stared in the mirror but we couldn't smile
Our sadness was heavy, it weighed a whole mile
It lasted forever, we waited a while
We wanted a miracle
I want to fly far away, up
Where diamonds hang in the air
I want to take some light from the sun
And bring it back to share
Place it high up on a hill
Yeah to light up the dark
I want to learn love
Want to break my own heart
I walked past the old church and the ghost of a hymn
Came out to greet me inviting me in
I said "nice to meet you, but where have you been
We already know everything"
And a well dressed up man with a well versed up tongue
He told us to trust ourselves to overcome
I told him I didn't come here to have fun
His answers were meaningless

And the shadows are long
The temperature's rising
And something is wrong
I want to try trust
Placed in a whisper of wind
I heard God speak
When the quiet settled in
Oh modern times, I think of a man
Who puts plastic gloves over his hands
Sets about trying to love the best he can
While keeping his fingers clean
And while we were driving, turned left instead of right
Got out of the car to change all the signs
Made us feel better for a little while
But I knew we were still lost
Direction is uphill
Description is war
But this is our future
That we're fighting for
So if it gets worse
Before it improves
Darling don't lay down
We're gonna find a way through
