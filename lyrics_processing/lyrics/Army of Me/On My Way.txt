'Cross mountains, valleys, switchbacks, and stones
The longest of journeys that I've ever known
To take me, take me home
I walked for many-a-miles, many-a-days
Months became years, they asked me my age
I said, "I couldn't see what difference it makes
Once we reach, we reach home"
Off in the distance, there must be a place
Somewhere to find rest, some light on your face
She said, "I've always been open
So come through my gate."
I said, "Love, I'm on my way
I'm on my way"
I started to doubt that I might arrive
Sometimes I wandered and one time I cried
On the breast of a woman who paid a high price
To say "yes"
"Yes" to home
I asked her, "What does it feel like?"
"And how will I know?"
"How long must I wait?"
"Which way do I go?"
She said, "I've always been open
So come through my gate."
I said, "Love, I'm on my way
I'm on my way"
You might also likeOne day in the distance, a mountain did rise
But one that was different, it wore a disguise
I saw my destination for the first time
Yes, I saw it clearly, but not with my eyes
And when I arrived I met a young man
He showed me his heart
He showed me his hands
He wore a strange crown
Said it hurts where he stands, but "welcome
Welcome home"
I said, "Show me the table
I'm a traveling man
I'll eat every last crumb
I'll take all that I can
And she said, "I've always been open
So come through my gate."
I said, "Love, I'm on my way
I'm on my way"
So, "Head To The Heart" is the name of the road
'Cross mountains, valleys, switchbacks, and stones
The longest of journeys that I've ever known
