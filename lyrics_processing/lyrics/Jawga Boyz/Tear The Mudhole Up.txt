I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up

I'm from Alabama, out here we Roll Tide
Chevy 1500 jacked up with some 35 inch mud tires
I'm where that water dirty, we got them mud holes
We sippin' Jack Daniels, but where the bud though
I'll be livin' from under the mud stack
All the way up from your head to your toes
Drenched so deep, 'bout three or four feet
Better crawl out bud, 'cause you ain't know
Uh, I'm muddin' bitch, I got my four by fours
I swear to God that mud comes up to the doors
We wylin' out, we act a fool
And if we runnin' this thing we'll turn it into a tractor pull
We country down here, y'all don't act like you didn't even know
I'm from Georgia back from Alabama you know how it goes

I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up
You might also like
I wanna see you folks flippin' up and down
I wanna feel you vibrate to the ground
It's time to put the face back in the track
And put the pedal to the metal while I'm sippin' on jack
Yeah I give it up to break somethin'
I'm workin' on my truck all week with no money
Got the motor red lined and I keep it in the ditches
I ain't got stuck 'cause I'm slowly movin' inches
I don't know what it means when somebody yells stop
Or when I break a rule it makes everybody watch
'Cause I'm always tryin' to be the main center of attention
Even if I'm in first place I'm tryin' to gain a position
And throw out

I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up

Ridin' high, ridin' high, creepin' slow, creepin' slow
Granny low, granny low, hit the hole, hit the hole
If you don't make it through then you gotta take a shot
Gon' on give it hell show me whatcha got
You don't give a damn if I run my motor hot
Just to get it here was a G on spot
We filled with shine, we feelin' right
We in the mud hole with no head lights
That mud we got 'em comin' we steady sinkin'
We don't give a damn just keep on drinkin'
A few beers later we make it out
Everybody gets loud they scream and shout
Yeah that's how we roll up in the south
A little fun a little mud is what we about
Every hick from the sticks try to keep it krunk
Like dude over here done got too drunk
He's hangin' out the truck he's throwin' up
That's the price to pay when you're actin' tough
Things gettin' crazy cold Bud's in the back
Everybody gone 'cause they sippin' on jack
Raise a lot of hell with them red smoke stacks
Your trucks gone wild baby that's a fact
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
Get krunk, get krunk, tear the mudhole up
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
I wanna see everybody get krunk / What, what, what, what
