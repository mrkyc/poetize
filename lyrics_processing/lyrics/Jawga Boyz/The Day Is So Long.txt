Some people wanna to talk about how it's like
You work hard day and night tryin' to do things right
Set goals but you think they out of sight
Your budget's tight it takes your will and might to fight
And get right but despite your will any chance to fulfill
People wanna steal every single dollar bill that you make until
You can show 'em how it feels to try to stay on top and not drop off a hill
It would not kill you just to be the real you
So until you want to make a deal you
Can just stay where you at 'cause I ain't comin' back
It's D. Thrash on the mic again
You try to live right but unlike the sin
Now you grow older your body moves slower
This is how it goes it was not how I was told

I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Now I'm just tryin' to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Now I'm just tryin' to hold on
You might also like
Yeah sometimes I wanna quit 'cause life's too hard
I've had enough of this it's gone too far
If I take another hit I might lose a part of my face
Then make a mess and go too far
I wanna find a hole to crawl into
Give up sometimes forget what I've been through
Turn the lights out and close the door
Yeah than I won't have to worry no more
Take my bills and throw them all away
Close my eyes and think back to the days
When I couldn't wait to grow up
I couldn't wait to be grown and finally be an adult
But nobody ever told me then 'bout the zen that would begin
You're gonna lose friends to death and kin you met once just at family reunions
I saw too much man I feel like I'm losin'

I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Now I'm just tryin' to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Now I'm just tryin' to hold on
Man the days are long and the nights are short
Makin' me wonder what I keep doin' this for
'Cause it's taken everything that I have
To not give up and fall back in the past
And I guess it all leads to a reason
But every season I'm stuck here bleedin'
And it's leadin' me to mixed feelings
It's my soul this world has been stealin'
So I look up and search for a sign
Know that there are a lot of reasons out there why
I'm still doing what I am doing
Coulda gave up but I keep on pursuin'
Chasin' dreams and tryin' to live a good life
Marry my girl so I can have a good wife
And maybe one day I can even feel like
I broke through and I can see the light
So

I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Now I'm just tryin' to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
Everybody is tellin' me to hold on
I keep on rollin' but the day's so long
