Alright now we're gon' try this one more time
Now CB3, this song is about trucks, not women, okay?
For the last time, let's do this

I see mud flyin', trucks everywhere, they filthy dirty up in the air
And we don't care, it's a redneck heaven, here to play, no time for stressin'
Big compression up in them blocks, use the bed as a mobile dock
Fishin' pole with a line to drop, feet hangin', no need for socks
It's time to rock but not time to roll, we here to stay, ain't tryin' to go
There's big trucks with big nuts, that get stuck and big ruts
Ayy, we just here to blow off steam, everybody on the same team
Man, I can never get enough, starin' at all these trucks

I like my women like I like my truck, filthy dirty
When they're nasty and they ain't cleaned up, oh they're pretty
Okay, we talkin' about trucks or women?
I like some good homegrown, I like my beer ice cold
I like to party till the cows come home
And I like my women like I like my truck, filthy dirty
Okay, okay, Dez let's get back to the trucks
I got you, okay

Comin' down the road in a lifted Cummins
Suffocate the folks with the jet black smoke
Arm out the window and the speakers bumpin'
Needle on their way to the right, let's go
Whoa, almost got decapitated by the tree branch
Got under by the skin of my teeth
Blacked out tint but I keep 'em rolled down
Even in the winter time makin' sure they see me
Got a need for speed and it's heavy duty
Tippin' my cap I tell 'em howdy doody
Rich city friend won't listen to me
Need to trade a Benzo for a dually
Grab some Rockstar's and stick 'em on some Nitto
Lift it up and then you gettin' there bro
Then you put them on that gravel and you put them in the mud
But you better never put it in the car wash though

I like my women like I like my truck, not again, filthy dirty
Oh, when they're nasty and they ain't cleaned up, oh, they're pretty
Listen, we can't keep talking about...
I like some good homegrown, I like my beer ice cold
I like to party till the cows come home
It's about trucks
And I like my women like I like my truck, filthy dirty
I like my women like I like my truck, filthy dirty
Oh, when they're nasty and they ain't cleaned up, oh, they're pretty
I like some good homegrown, I like my beer ice cold
I like to party till the cows come home
