Aye D., you know that song All the Girls Wanna Ride?
Well hell, lets make it a remix
Ha Jawga Boyz, D. Thrash, and Lenny Cooper
All the girls wanna ride with me
All the girls wanna ride with me
They say they like my truck

All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck

Lenny Cooper remix
Been spinnin' tires, boggers, man they diggin' insane
Grips tearin' up shit we be killin' the game
Mud diggin' is a habit you can say that I'm a addict
Three things: girls, trucks, mud, damn I gotta have it
So don't worry It's a party where I go
I got the truck loaded down with beer and they ice cold
I'm the man around the town all rowdy all loud
On the weekends it's a shindig plus a throwdown
Man life is great baked beans and country fried steak
It's okay D. Thrash let them city boys hate
They just mad that we the shit and we know that they fake
That's why we got their girls and we headed to the lake
They don't like them low rides they love to ride high
Hit a dirt road and sling mud straight to the sky
So when them city guys decide to drop by and ask us why
We gonna tell 'em
You might also like
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now

My 49's diggin', lip full of dip
Wench on the front cause my trucks well equipped
I'm in the parking lot I'm pimpin' with my Wranglers on
Leaning on the truck I make the girls moan
My jeans tight and I know I'm looking right
Got so many girls lookin' they about to start a fight
Look I'm tryin' to have some fun when I hop in the truck
You wanna roll sit down hold on shut up
12 gauge on the back glass ready to go
I never know when I'm gonna see a buck or a doe
And if I see a cop girl I ain't worried
A bold po in a mud hole will get buried
See this is what they make these big tires for
Want more? I'm a put the pedal down to the floor
And take you to a place you ain't never been out in the country
I bet I have ya sayin' ya love me
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now

And you know I brought my hunch punch moonshine in my cup
In the truck gettin' stuck in the mud windows rolled up
All 4 wheels diggin' this ain't a game you havin' fun
Ain't you girl bet you glad that you came
Black powder coated wheels Mickey Thompson on the tires
They said 49s wouldn't fit but they liars
We can take a trip to the store and back
You say you want a six pack we need more than that
What you waitin' on girl this the chance of your life
There ain't nothing that them city boys got that you like
You don't know what you missin' just quit talkin' and listen
I can drive over cars while they right there sittin'
Think about it for a minute till I leave in my truck
Then you see your best friend askin' how do I get up
If you "Kuntry" and you love it then you can relate
But all them city boys sure gonna hate
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
Let your hair down said you want a redneck don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride, and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck get stuck
Wanna ride
