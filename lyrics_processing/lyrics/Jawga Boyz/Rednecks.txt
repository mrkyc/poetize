We rednecks, we livin' how we say we livin'
I keep a closet full of guns stacked to the ceilin'
I ain't 'bout killin' I'm just tryin' to keep it real
And if you break into my house you best believe you gonna feel it
'Cause I keep a Glock with a loaded clip hollow tip moonshine I sip
Dirt roads, Mudjugs, Copenhagen for when I dip
I don't lie I speak the truth I'm keepin' you from gettin' loose
If you are true then you will lose did I say I speak the truth

We rednecks
You know how we live we doin' good 'round here drinkin' a cold beer
Yeah we rednecks
Camouflage we wear it we live it and if you cut me I bleed it
Yeah we rednecks
You know how we live we doin' good 'round here drinkin' a cold beer
Yeah we rednecks
Camouflage we wear it we live it and if you cut me I bleed it
Yeah

There's no joke we protect our land
We'll lend a hand to any man we see as a friend
We heal for each other the American way
We work hard to play hard and now it's pay day
So while I buy a case of my favorite brew
Pop the top and get through to you
Time to party time to drink time to tell my brain not to think
I ain't tired let's get wild hit the Black and Mild and get a fire
Time to party time to drink time to tell my brain not to think
