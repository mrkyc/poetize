Jawga Boyz we ridin' high, we back in the jacked up trucks
Ridin' on 44's mud on the doors and our plan is to get stuck
On the phone call up the boys
Let them all know to bring them toys
Got a wench on the front if you need tow
And straight pipes that make some noise, yeah
We comin' from a mile away you can hear them roar
Got knobby tires we ridin' higher than we ever did before
If you wanna a ride then I got to say hop in at your discretion
'Cause some have told me that these seats are in the nose bleed section
Got a 12 gauge on the back glass and it's ready to go
When I am on the road I never know when I'll see a buck or a doe
Dip in my lip, and a cup of spit in the middle console
Still gettin' hunnies and scarin' bunnies you already know (Haha)
So this truck, gonna keep on rollin' down the road
And it ain't no joke, 'cause the Jawga Boyz are good as gold
So take some notes when you hear the flow
And see the mud hangin' on the door
My truck ain't slow and it ain't for show, 'cause

Deep down in the woods (yep) high like the trees (yep)
A bunch of rednecks who don't have no damn degrees
I'm reppin' for the sticks, I'm reppin' for us hicks
I'm talkin' about us folks who ain't never seen rich
My Chevy truck is jacked up, a mud hole make me act up
I snatch it tight and stack up, I'm slingin' mud y'all back up
It's true it ain't no lie, my Chevy's high on 45's
Cruisin' DUI, you know I'm sippin' apple pie
Got that wheelie, rompin' loud, black and camo on my ride
Yeah that Georgia flag flies 'cause I'm known to show my pride
Yeah we creep and we crawl, country clique yellin' "yee haw"
Yeah I've had some slips and falls, due to too much alcohol
Yeah my truck sits tall, sayin' I'm scarin' at the focus
Grippin' mud and climbin' rocks still can't find a way to roll it
Now I'm with these Jawga Boyz and we ridin' tonka toys
With them big trucks, big tires, we jack 'em up and then we

44's, big trucks, camo paint, big bucks
Nuts on my truck hitch, I'm draggin' them in the mud ruts
Just some 'ol country boys, high like the pine trees
And you can bet this be the last of a dying breed
Southern blood, runs through my veins we some rebel boys
Cross the river you ain't heard Bottleneck and them Jawga Boyz
Comin' through on the tonka toys ridin' high and jacked up
Slangin' mud, lock the hubs, we got that mack cuz
Rawdog in the Georgia Clay jacked up is how we play
This is how we do it buck we keep 'em southern raised
Stuck in our southern ways, stayin' in the desperate days
We ridin' high and jack em up they ain't no other way
Better grip that steerin' wheel gonna make that Chevy squeel
True gritty country boys, hick life, you know it real
We on that southern grind, we jacked up all the time
We ridin' in the sky, we jack 'em up and then we
Ridin' high
