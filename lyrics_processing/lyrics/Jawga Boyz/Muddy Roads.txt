Yeah
That's right from the south where I come from
Getting things done, out of towner's want to hit me
Taught to sling some, can you feel it in the air, Smokey yes sir
And the clay been known to ruin a lot of best shirts
But the clay don't lie I love it out here
From the day to the night dog it goes down here
So let me tell you somethin' 'bout the place I was raised up
Cattle keepin' the landscape nice trim and grazed up
A real southern cat stayin' tough like raw hide
I'm on their broad side knockin' folks cross eyed
Hogs died in the moment the world I wanna own it
Dogonit they done hurt my flow and now they wanna clone it
I'm on it so look alive the south is on the rise
Sit behind the wheel of a Chevy and I sport wide eyes
The future's bright now livin' in the bright south
Feelin' good when I lay my head down and lights out
We got the loud music blarin' down these mud roads
And these mud holes taken a toll on good clothes
The question is will it ever stop no one really knows
Skeet runnin' down and comin' around for ever I suppose
Woah

Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
Never stoppin' I suppose
Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
Never stoppin' I suppose

Well it's the good ol' boys and we comin' from the south
Still ridin' down muddy roads that's what I'm 'bout
Takin' time to write a few lines that rhyme
So you can find out what it's like inside of mine
'Cause in time everybody's gonna wanna take a ride
If you want the tour then come holla at your guy
Then I'll show you around and show you how I grew up
In the backyard grillin' all kinds of stuff
And now we're crusin' around with the pedal to the floor
Arm hangin' out the window with mud on the door
And it's just another day here in the ATH
Got my mesh hat on and my ten dollar shades

You know we're country boys and that we're never gonna change
That I told you once and it still remains the same
We're the Jawga Boyz and you better learn the name
We got Georgia blood runnin' in our veins
You know we're country boys and that we're never gonna change
That I told you once and it still remains the same
We're the Jawga Boyz and you better learn the name
We got Georgia blood runnin' in our veins

Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
Never stoppin' I suppose
Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
Never stoppin' I suppose
Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
Never stoppin' I suppose
Loud music muddy roads
Strollin' round in muddy clothes
Where it stops nobody knows
