We just some country boys raised on the dirt roads
I drive a jacked up truck and it rolls coal
I keep a cooler in the back and they ice cold
And when we rap you can say that we got a nice flow
I keep a shotgun I keep a rifle
I keep the pedal to the metal and it might blow
And when we come to your town we throw a night show
Born and raised in the sticks yeah ain't that right bro

Born and raised in the sticks like my ancestors
I keep a tight grip on the Winchester
Yeah you don't really really wanna go and test her
You gon' mess around gon' get yourself hurt
Got a cooler in the back and I fill it with ice
Sittin' up tall and I'm lookin' real nice
So wave at 'em, say how y'all doin'
Hop in the back lets get this thing movin'
Dez on the back and the back of the saddle
Thrash on the beat make the windows rattle
Peddle to the metal and I think I might blow
Ain't nobody really wanna touch my flow
But keep the beat goin' if you will maestro
They tell me that I'm sick and I tell them I know
I roll with my super crew
I'm leavin' tracks on the roof of your Subaru
I got the dust flyin' and I got the mud slingin'
I'ma be out here tonight for all I'm thinkin'
Yeah and I keep it rollin'
Hangin' the corners and drive it like I stole it
Holdin' the pump shotgun out the window
With my left hand, speakers blowin' yeah man
You couldn't meditate to a better state than the peach state
If you was raised here then you can relate
We're proud of where we come from take it to the bank
I'ma grab a cane pole, we gon' take it to the banks of the river
Just chillin' with the fellas
I'm reelin' in a monster makin' them boys jealous
I caught my limit in about an hour or so
I head back to the sticks down that old dirt road
Yeah yes sir we're some country boys
Trucks from all in the south are gonna bump this noise
Come on

Born and raised in the sticks ain't that right bro

Jawga Boys
And we love the south and everything it's all about
Big fields, dirt roads, an accent coming out my mouth
I can't change the way that I live or where I came from just can't be done
I'm the kind of guy that might try to find another place to shoot his gun
We like trucks we like beer and some of us make stuff that's clear
When it comes to shootin' big bucks and deer don't believe everything you hear
Some of these folks like to tell a lie or two man that's how they do
Well I'm the kind of guy that's might try and find it if you really tellin' me the truth
Drivin' down the dirt roads kickin' up dust swerving to miss the ruts
With a country girl by my side who loves to ride in a jacked up truck
It's what I love, it's how I live, and I'm always gonna keep it for real
If you've ever been around me then you know the deal I pop seals on beers
That's right we live our life way back here in the sticks
And you find out it ain't right and it ain't right to come out here and start some shit
'Cause you will end up in a bad situation
No hesitation when I get impatient
But we also look to the sky and pray for the great destination
We just some country boys raised on the dirt roads
I drive a jacked up truck and it rolls coal
I keep a cooler in the back and they ice cold
And when we rap you can say that we got a nice flow
I keep a shotgun I keep a rifle
I keep the pedal to the metal and it might blow
And when we come to your town we throw a night show
