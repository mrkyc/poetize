The sun goes up and it falls back down
And the clock ticks as it starts spinnin' around
A new life's born as another one fades
And one man loves while another one hates

And if you think about it for a minute it don't make sense
Got a lot of rich folks but I still don't make rent
What way is right and what way is wrong
One day I'm weak and one day I'm strong
I open my eyes I hope to see somethin' new
But it's the same ol' things that you see too
But through and through I'm gonna make it out
I make a pack with myself and I make it written down

So I keep headin' down this road
I got my hands on the wheel with the cruise control
I turn the radio up and forget about life
When I start to gain speed then I hit another red light
]
I'm livin' every day worrying about my next step
Livin' every day worrying about my next breath
Will it come will it lie, how low on your slope alive
How can I give it a shot I'm feelin' high
You might also like
I got a feelin' in my body like I wanna to escape
I'm feelin' right, kinda feel like I don't want to debate
So keep your mouth closed better go and keep it that way
I'm gonna do what I want to do and it don't matter what you say
I'ma do a little damage before I manage to quit
I'm really rather kinda calm how women resist
I'm comin' around, now determined to livin' a better life
Man this livin' how I was I really live it how I like

So I keep headin' down this road
I got my hands on the wheel with the cruise control
I turn the radio up and forget about life
When I start to gain speed then I hit another red light
]
Gotta keep my mind right and screwed on tight
And I should not be tossin' and turnin' every single night
Well that's alright I can sleep when I'm gone
I just gotta stay focused keepin' on keepin' on

You better believe I'ma end up on the top of my game
So bring the rain but you still gotta remember the name
And ain't a thing changed Dez still a country boy
Gonna bring the music feelin' up people with country joy
Givin' it up on in it instead I listen to my nonfiction
And they missin' if they choosin' the friction
And I don't play that business on my mind every time
In the middle of my prime now my life is fine
So I keep headin' down this road
I got my hands on the wheel with the cruise control
I turn the radio up and forget about life
When I start to gain speed then I hit another red light
So I keep headin' down this road
I got my hands on the wheel with the cruise control
I turn the radio up and forget about life
