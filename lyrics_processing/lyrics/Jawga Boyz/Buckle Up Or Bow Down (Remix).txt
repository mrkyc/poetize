We ain't here to play around it's your heart we wanna break
Got everybody talkin trash fool meet me on the grass
Then we'll see if you can back up all the comments from the past
I don't hear nothing now, whats wrong you scared
We a bunch of crazy fools and we came prepared
We here to stomp you in the ground and we gonna make you bleed
Then all you see is dust flyin from the stampede
And now it's time that you listen before you made a bad decision
This confliction is causin' a deep disturbance in my system
And now I'm fishin for symptoms that bring me up to new demintions
So I picture your face gettin destroyed by a blender

If you ask me I think you even lied about your gender

Bustin out the gates I'm ready to rock I'm rollin' hot goin' to the top
Ain't nobody really wanna step in the way to get ran over dawg when they try to stop
And they try to top everything I do that's nonsense and they wasting time
They weigh their options but they mess up when they don't weigh mine
Thats fine, 110% when I strap it up and I can back it up
And you out of luck and my victories keep stackin up
And I'm actin up and I apologize but yall folks need to realize
From the left to the right I'm ready to roll I done talked it up so now I gotta rise
I'm out of lies now that's the truth better put it up or shut it up
It's time to go and let me loose time to rough 'em up
My blood rushing comin around I'm bringing addrenalin
And I'm bout right and I'm ragin on and my eyes red like cinnamon
And not 20 men ain't put the blood ain't put the sweat ain't shead no tears
Ain't really come close to puttin in what I put in all these years
I'm focused, and I done called your bluff better rise it up
Are ya tough enough better get it up
We blowin the role and better buckle up
