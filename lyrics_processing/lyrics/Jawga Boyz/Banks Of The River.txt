Sittin' on the banks of the river and I watch it roll down
And I, can't help but think that I wish it'd turn around
Watch it flow back to me then I could change it's path
Sorta like I'm goin' back and I'm changin' the past

Sittin' on the banks of the river and these thoughts goin' through my head
Kinda like I wish I could go back and take back feelin' everything's done and unsaid
Then a lot of bridges that stood tall that I burned and it went up in smoke
I could unburn and then turn around and reverse all them many tight bonds that I broke
And the time is startin' to go and fly by and the days, well they turnin' into years
I said the time is startin' to go and fly by and the hopes, well they turnin' into fears
I don't wanna go back, but I think to myself yo is it really that feasible
Is the ability to turn back the clock just a little bit so unreasonable
Well I know it is but I guess my mind is sittin' in a rider full of trans-steel
And the river's flow has got me hypnotized and my mind is somewhere off in left field
And the birds chirp, and the water flows, and then they go a little bit deeper off
And that serenity with the wind blowin' and I'm on the ground and it's feelin' so soft
And I know I can't turn back the time and if I could, I guess I'd already be done
But if you can't dream of fictitious things, well then somebody tell me what's the fun
So if you don't know exactly where I've gone and you try to think and you draw a blank
You can find me outside in that cool breeze, I'm sittin' down and I'm chillin' on that river bank

Sittin' on the banks of the river and I watch it roll down
And I, can't help but think that I wish it'd turn around
Watch it flow back to me then I could change it's path
Sorta like I'm goin' back and I'm changin' the past

D. Thrash and I'm sittin' on the river banks, I pray to the Lord and I give thanks
For the cool breeze and the green trees, everything is so unique
Man, I love it out here, toes in the water it's crystal clear
And, I'm lookin' straight ahead, but their ain't nothin' goin' on in my head
That's right, not a care in the world, and when I get bored my thumbs twirl
Knowin' I should be fishin', can't even think about what I'm missin'
I pick up a flower, and I hold it up to my nose
It's got me reminiscin' while I'm out here

Sittin' on the banks of the river as I watch it roll down
And I, can't help but think that I wish it'd turn around
Watch it flow back to me then I could change it's path
Sorta like I'm goin' back and I'm changin' the past
