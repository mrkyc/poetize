We out here in the country and we gettin' bored (no)
We tryin' to find a place where we can party more (let's go, let's go)
It's 2 am but we ain't trying to turn it down (never)
Let's hop in the jacked up trucks and take 'em into town (woo)

Country boys in the city now (really wow)
Country boys in the city now (really wow)
Country boys in the city now (really wow)
Country boys in the city now (we in your town)

We up in your town and we are rolling
Diesel smoke is blowing and you choking
Sitting up so high, it's like we floating
This ain't make believe and I ain't joking
D Thrash in a black D-Max gripping on the wheel
With a fat stack of some cash sitting on chill
And you already know that we got a cooler in the back (beer)
Ice cold and we keep it filled with a thirty pack (beer)
Everybody looking funny when we pass
Thinking we just driving through and it won't last
But we brought the party from the countryside
These country boys gon' teach you how to party right

The invasion's begun and them Mickey's are hummin'
And they heard that we comin', them city folks runnin'
The alpine I'm bumpin' I know that we stoned
And these rednecks are stuntin'
When all of a sudden there's a problem
I don't know where to park my ride
Parking that clearance too low but they telling me sorry
But really I'm sittin' too high
So I just went and I turned on my flashers
Parked in the streets and I rolled out the ladder
Started some chatter, heard me some laughter
Heard them say "Well, yeah, I think he's a rapper"
Yuppies just staring and texting their friends
Thinking I'm crazy and having no sense
Hicks in the city is such an event
Listen this diesel cost double your Benz
So turn up your nose now that somebody else
Mind your own business and we'll mind ourselves
I'm sorry that the exhaust smell
Up the whole city I'm saying oh well
We drag in that mud and the stain in the carpet
These hicks are on fire so they're calling it arson
Well sorry you're startled go back to the apartment
I'm begging your pardon, the party has started, yeah
We out here in the country and we getting bored (no)
We tryin' to find a place where we can party more (let's go, let's go)
It's 2 am but we ain't trying to turn it down (never)
