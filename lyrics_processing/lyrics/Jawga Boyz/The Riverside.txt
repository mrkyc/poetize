Everybody knows the place to go
And what we gonna do (Yeah buddy)
It's time to go down to the riverside
And drink till we are through (Yeah buddy)
We know what it is that we want
'Cause we looking for the women too (Yeah buddy)
So bring your truck, put it in four wheel drive
And sling some mud with my crew (Yeah buddy)

Yeah, chops on the grill, smoking a hog leg
Down where I kick back all they corn fed
Holler at my people, tell 'em to shoot a mass text
This ain't upscale life, you ain't gotta dress to impress
Take a shot pop a mud flying sky high
Down south, country folks where we staying country fried
Four wheel drive, blue grass sky
The boy's tipping trees her ridin' riverside
Riverside banging the beats in my rhyme
The garden of Eden on a hot summer night
Paradise pretty pleasing before we all get right
Country boys and girls getting down all night

Riverside wildlife, lifestyle should be a novel
Huckleberry Finn pontoon in every band tomorrow
Just like today, never promise no it's always borrowed
Leave it up buttercup, blazing up and down we got 'em
Rivers run deep splashing through the hills and rolling longer
Got the finest dimes that the antebellum has to offer
Copper still stands drinking beers in both hands
She riding shotgun with me smiling slinging mud every chance
Everybody knows the place where the water meets the land
We can find a good time, crickets chirping in the band
Going fishin' in the dark, nitty gritty with a plan
Partying rocking never stopped them watching lines in her tan

Everybody knows the place to go

We got the tailgates dropped and beer cans popped
Big trucks slingin' mud, you can't stop it (Haha)
Moonshine getting passed around the riverbank
Dropping lines in the water, bumping some old Hank (Hah)
We just redneck boys with some farmer tans (Yeah)
Middle finger up to any regulations (Haha)
Trying to live free and clear of any government (Huh)
Taxing money that I made and money that I spent (Yeah)
When we're out by the river man, we're all free (Haha)
Drinking and smoking and forgetting about the work week
Taking our minds and leaving this reality (Yeah)
Bonfire burning good off of the gasoline (Haha)

Everybody knows the place to go

Let's go, uh
Headin' down to the riverside and I got that cooler packed to the rim
We got the whole county on their way and plus they cousin them and them
Is probably bringin' about forty people with him too
Country boys they can't survive they say but yeah we living proof
Some sit in them inner tubes others dropping Evan moves
The rest up in them 4x4's they boggin' you know how we do
A slew of them there Georgia folks mixing with the Kentuckians
A rubba dubbin' in the mud, these country folks are shufflin'
And bumpin' little bit of Ricky Skaggs, little bit of that George Jones
So many people out here you ain't gonna see that water before long
All of 'em know the place no matter where they reside at
We done when we say we done we the ones that decide that
Everybody knows the place to go
And what we gonna do (Yeah buddy)
It's time to go down to the riverside
And drink till we are through (Yeah buddy)
