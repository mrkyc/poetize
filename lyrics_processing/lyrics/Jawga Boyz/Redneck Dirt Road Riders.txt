The campfire, come on guys, come on
Yeah, hahaha, alright, y'all ready
Yeah
Here we go

D. Thrash here in the state of Georgia
Blowin' up like a hot can of soda
I told ya, they we're 'bout to change the game
A new thing, hick-hop is the name, that's right
I grew up in a small town
Used to play baseball til the sun went down
Yeah, we'd play in the front yard
And some fly balls were known to hit cars
That's when we'd run in the woods
And play dumb, but then we felt like crooks
Yeah we knew what to do, we had to confess
Man it wadn't me, it was you
I can laugh about it now, and think back
There ain't nothing that I did I would take back
Ten years in the past, it went by fast
And now I drink shine from a flask

We just some redneck dirt road riders come on
We do some country with a little hip hop in a song
We like to hunt and fish and do what we can to stay free
(We like to hunt and fish and do what we can to stay free)
There's cow pastures and trees as far as I can see
(As far as I can see, as far as I can see)

All grown up I gotta hold my own
Twenty eight more years 'til I own my home
I don't own the throne, that'd be my wife
And I say these things just to keep it right
Things change when you grow up
Every day you gotta show up
Had a bad day that's tough luck
Ain't nobody gonna dry your tears
Those days are gone, they got lost in the years
Be a man and get up when you fall
And stand tall, that's what I was taught
I try to keep a good head on my shoulders
I feel good things gettin' closer
Friday I just got off work
Make a couple phone calls and I change my shirt
Cornbread said a party at his house
Bonfire in the backyard and I'm out
