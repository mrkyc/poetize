You know we all struggle in life
But we just have to take control of it
And always remember

If you ever feel like time falls and slips away
And you never felt so lost and broken
Hold your head up and you'll see
The sky stays blue when you believe
Even if the rain is far from over

The rain was fallen and I was too
10 months from turning 22
At a point in life when I felt alone
No job no school still lived at home
Tryin' hard to get out and get on my feet
Didn't have any money for a bite to eat
I'd go in the bedroom and close the door
I could tell you first hand when it rains it pours
Knock knock on the door and I said "who is it"
It's your mom and can I visit
She came in and we started to talk
It was during that time tears started to fall
Told her how I felt and what was wrong
She said "you've been holdin' this in for too long"
Gave me a hug sat down the bed
Wiped a tear from my eye and then she said
You might also like
If you ever feel like time falls and slips away
And you never felt so lost and broken
Hold your head up and you'll see
The sky stays blue when you believe
Even if the rain is far from over

We all know that it's a long road that we travel on
Keep your head up 'cause all the joy in your life is far from over

Now I'm feelin' good about where I'm headin'
Where my life is and my direction
Keep the ones close that mean the most
Put my foot down now and take control
The things that were blurry are now real clear
No fear anymore 'cause I know the deal
I got a new life and I'm startin' to heal
But it couldn't prepare me for the story I'd hear
I met this man in the ATL
Talkin' about life and the cards we're dealt
Well 20 years ago he had lost it all
Everything crashed down and he watched it fall
Said his younger brother die from a heart attack
Then his wife and his daughter in a car crash
He said "I'd give anything to have 'em all and hold 'em"
I gave the man a hug and then I told him
If you ever feel like time falls and slips away
And you never felt so lost and broken
Hold your head up and you'll see
The sky stays blue when you believe
Even if the rain is far from over
If you ever feel like time falls and slips away
And you never felt so lost and broken
Hold your head up and you'll see
The sky stays blue when you believe
Even if the rain is far from over

We all know that it's a long road that we travel on
Keep your head up 'cause all the joy in your life is far from over
