Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug man I gotta spit

Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)

One thing that I can't stand when I'm dippin'
When I'm spittin' in a bottle I forget I start to sip it
And I start to get sick (sick) spit out my dip (dip)
Throw away the bottle and say that I'm gonna quit
Then time goes by and I buy another can
Sounds like a good plan man I hope y'all understand
'Cause I need to mellow out (out) get a little buzz (buzz)
Had a rough day like I don't have enough
But this time it's gonna be a little bit different
'Cause I got a cup I can see it before I sip it
So I'm dippin' and spittin' and doin' everything I like
Drivin' home and thinkin' 'bout what I'm gonna do tonight
Get another pinch stick it in my lip
And I go around a curve and my dip cup tips
Spills on my lap (lap), all on my seats (seats)
I think a Mudjug is what I need
Yup
You might also like
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)

Now I got a Mudjug everything's straight
No more bottles no more cups no more makin' mistakes
I'm on a roll as I'm ridin' down the road
Hangin' out the window with a lip full of Skoal
Everybody knows it's me when I'm comin'
The mud grips roar I'm a redneck stuntin'
Got the six twelves bumpin' as I load my lip
Springfield 45 with a hot full clip
Here I come makin' sure nobody needs help
Mudjugs by the dozens like I'm one of Santa's Elves
I think I need a ref, 'cause there's so many fouls
People sittin' on the floor even in their own house
There's gotta be a better way to get the word out
Still got curiosity about what they're all about
Throw away the bottle, and throw away the cup
Yeah if your lips full of dip then you need a Mudjug
Yup
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
I need a Mudjug (yeah yeah)
Dip in my lip, dip in my lip, dip in my lip
And I think I need to spit, I need a Mudjug
