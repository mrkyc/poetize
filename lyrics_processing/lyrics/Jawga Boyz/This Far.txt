Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
Why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
How I got this far
Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
Why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
How I got this far

Now how in the world did I get this far
Down a road this dark, body feelin' this scarred
I'm still confused, as many times I've been bruised
Abused with the blue so I choose to snooze
Been abused with the rear view of what it reflects
Complex as the watts and the muddy flex
On my windshield and my windows sealed
Why the clouds still wild at midnight
It's 'bout ten 'til for real I fulfill the thrill that I need
Until I get to the top of my speed
I missed that point in my life quite yet
Look down at my feet let me hear it get wet
Come up out the woods with many miles on my tires
In the middle of the fire my desires wired
To acquire a little higher before I retire
When I fly why I try so hard to use

Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
I want to know why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
I don't know how I got this far

It's been a long time and I've come so far
Try to stay in line while I'm sippin' the bar
I can't help but sit down and ask myself
Why I try so hard when there's nothing left
I used to say maybe tomorrow I could change
But after five years only I'm to blame
It seems now that everything's the same
And I've been treatin' life like it was a game
But I know, all I gotta do is try
Stop livin' in the past and wondering why
But I tell ya it's a lot easier said than done
And livin' this way ain't fun
Some say it can only go up from here
That it can't get worse but I still feel fear
Not knowing what lies in the road ahead
Will I see tomorrow, will I end up dead

Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
I want to know why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
I don't know how I got this far
You know I try so hard but I can't help but feel
That my life is paused and it's standin' still
But I gotta keep movin' on the road is so long
And I find out where it is that I belong
Yeah I know it's true but it's odd sometimes
When you seein' everything that the world is blind
And I always need a place in my life that starts
But I can never outrun the clock and tick-tocks
Then the days roll by but I hardly know, you know
How far this road I'm goin' on will go
But my hand is gripped on the wheel so tight
So the sun was bright but now it's dark tonight
Another day gone put it in the books and holdin' on
Keep your grip strong holdin' on so long
I know it's all for a reason but still I ask why
With a life this hard why do I try

Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
I want to know why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
I don't know how I got this far
Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
I want to know why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
But I don't know how I got this far
Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
Why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
How I got this far
Oh, I want to know tonight, I want to know
Why I try so hard
Oh, I'm on this road tonight, but I don't know
