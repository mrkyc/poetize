This has been a long hard road for us
But we still keep pressin' forward
So many things have tried to slow us down
So we learn from our mistakes and
Fool me once it's all on you, whoa
But fool me twice and it's all on me

This long dusty road has been tough, it's been a battle
Just dirt and potholes not even gravel
Scratch the car until physically there was nothin' left
And kept movin' when typically I would take a breath
And either slept except I couldn't accept
The depths that I was fallin' into that's why I kept my steps
Well prepped then backup I crept yup
Too many folks doin' this that are so inept
Thinking they are slick while they playin' the game of puppets
When you call 'em out they turn the other way, they sayin' nothin'
Makes me wanna vomit, it's chronic, they're pickin' our pockets
Wallets and wanna demolish the product of prophets I promise
It's catastrophic astonished how they thinkin' we novice
Punks still in their pajamas, still roomin' with their mamas
Said they forgot us then they cop us I'll admit it it's the oddest
Pompous turned modest I bet when they see what we accomplished, watch
Stoppin's not an option, man we keepin' it rockin' and bring it back

Yeah, it's like they hearin' excuses that's a nuisance
You must think we're stupid, false solutions
Your words are pollution, double as useless
Nothin' you can do that'll ever diffuse this
You played your games and had to get a little crafty
Savy I'll admit if you ask me hope you're happy
Sittin' around now that you're conscious hope you're doin' well
And I know that you weren't busy stabbin' folks in the back pursuin' wealth
Oh well that's history swiftly comes the misery
And when the dust settles I'm gonna be the one with the victory
Typically I'm just laid back and paid back as hell
In my mind I play it back but I'm learnin' not to dwell
'Cause I'm still after what I'm after and I'm gonna get it
Livin' and committed to winnin' without the limit the minute
Your business done twisted has shifted on us with the quickness
The parasitic addictions benefited from gimmicks so listen
Yeah
Stoppin's not an option, man we keep it on workin' we'll bring it back
This has been a long hard road for us
But we still keep pressin' forward
So many things have tried to slow us down

Fool me once it's all on you, whoa

But fool me twice and it's all on me

Salesman standin' at the door so I tell him get the hell out my yard
(Get the hell out my yard)
I could tell that he wasn't from around here pullin' up in that car (Where the hell's your truck?)
Then he looked at me strange when I told him get the hell out my yard
And he knew I wasn't playin' 'cause he'd seen the .45 on my side, you know what I'm sayin'

Fool get the hell out my yard (Get the hell out my yard)
Someone get him out my yard (Get the hell out my yard)
You need to get out my yard (Y'all get the hell out my yard)
I'ma get you out my yard (Y'all get the hell out my yard)
You need to get the hell out of my yard (Get the hell out my yard)
You need to get the hell out of my yard (You better get the hell out my yard)
You need to get the hell out of my yard (You better get the hell out my yard)
Son, get the hell out my yard
I was at home chillin'
In the backyard grillin'
Tryna keep it reelin'
Then I started hearin'
Somebody pullin' up in my driveway
That I did not invite and I did not okay
Maybe I'm just hearin' things in the distance
But then I realized it's a guy at my place
Load a Mag in the .45 and I
Put it right there on my side while I
Walk up to the door with a cold fist
Damn this dude was an idiot
I'm thinkin' that I'ma just (What)
Maybe I'm just gonna (Aah)
Either way it won't be a problem
'Cause I know folks that will solve 'em

I'm just tryna to be calm
Get the hell off my yard and be gone
This ain't no place for folks like you
Better run before I shoot

Son, get the hell out my yard

Get the hell out of my yard
Unless you owe me some money
Get the hell out my yard 'cause you already know
That I ain't gonna give you nothin'
Ain't tryna hear what you were sellin'
Ain't tryna hear all the other stupid shit that you wish that you could tell me
Ain't tryna hear nothin' so you better leave
Before I become a felon
I'm tryna live in peace out here
That's why I live way out here
Everybody else around here know this
That's why nobody comes out here
Why nobody comes this far
Turn your GPS back on
Get back in your tiny car
You don't want no problems
Get up out my yard
And when you get back on the main road
Just forget everything that you saw here
'Cause if you come back down my road
They gon' be lookin' for you all year
Call your boss and tell him that
You ain't comin' back around
Finna hear a knock at the door and I'm like hold up wait
