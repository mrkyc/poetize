Song on the radio it sounds so good
Got the windows rolled down this is my town
Home sweet home
Smell the barbecue we gettin' it in
The nights get hotter when the sun sets in
We all around a bonfire hands in the air
Simple livin', world spinnin' and we just don't care
As hard as we work we play harder
All my rowdy friends gettin' down in a holler

Haha
Y'all want to know how we do it round here
Big ol' trucks big cooler full of beer
Tailgates down we chillin' out
Sippin' on shine with a cotton mouth, yeah
Everybody hangin' out and talkin'
Trucks keep pullin' in and they parkin'
Looks like it'll be a long night
Already had to break up two fights
That's cool though, there's no harm done
But now we got folks firin' off guns
That dude is so drunk he's gone
Can anyone here give him a ride home?
Yup, we get a little bit crazy
And the barbecue is amazin'
Country folks we gettin' down good
No cops way out here in the woods
Settin' up beer cans to shoot
Yeah, they empty you really think I'd waste a brew, hah
That's right D-Thrash on the track
With Twang and Round as a matter of fact
Yeah it's a G-A K-Y connection
Don't think I could have made a better selection
Jawaga Boyz we're keepin' it fresh
Yo can I hear the hook again? Yes

All my rowdy friends gettin' down in a holler

Yeah, beer and liquor chicken on the grill
Folks in the country is how I chill
Four by four with the top popped off
Where poppin' off will get you mopped
We chillin' for realin' because we feelin'
We buzzin' a hustlin' and makin' a killin'
Country boy born and raised
Tell it by my southern ways
I can tell the way you act
You ain't from around here
But now you see how we party
Bet you glad you're down here
Heat turned up past city limit sign
Woods lit up by the bonfire shine
Raisin' ruckus, raisin' hell
Gettin' drunk and chasin' tail
Deep in the holler where the bonfire roars
Friends gather round and they bobbin' to the noise
Blastin' out my truck with the windows rolled down
Worked all week now it's time to throw down
Sippin' on some shine on the outskirts of town
Hank on the deck Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound
I ain't ever had too much fun
It's like too many people when we need a beer run
Chicken on the grill know that it's fire
Pig in the ground, mud on my tires
Everywhere I look little hunnies gettin' tipsy
Had enough shine now it's on to the whiskey
Damn this night couldn't get more lovely
All my rowdy friends buzzin' screamin' that they love me
Country Boy Can Survive just came on
Party all night 'til the cows come home
