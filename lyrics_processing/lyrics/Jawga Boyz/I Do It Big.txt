Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
Down here in the country man that's how it is
Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
Down here in the country man that's how it is

I'm spending all day at the parts store
'Cause you know I want more
Chrome smoke stacks, new carpet for the floorboard
Camouflaged wrap, a Bass Pro cap
And five new decals for the back glass
Most the stuff I want, man they don't got
They say it's too big, don't keep it in stock
But I ain't got time, I gotta make mine
The biggest rig underneath the sunshine in no time
So come on and ride wit' me
Tires on the ground but we ridin' in the ceilin'
Some folks say that they get a funny feelin'
Sittin' so high but to me I'm just chillin', just chillin'

We at the party back the truck up, go and fill my cup up
Start the bonfire, get loud till the sun's up
Got a couple boys coming with 10K's
We do it big down here, just like I said
We rolling like some rednecks, camouflage on deck
Trucks don't get stuck so I never get stressed
And I never get tested so I stay rested
If you ain't never seen my record you need to check it
Never settle for second best
I like to see myself way up above the rest
Even if it costs me an arm and a leg
I like to stay ahead spenden' all of my bread, enough said

Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
Down here in the country man that's how it is
Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
Down here in the country man that's how it is
Everything I do big
Trucks and tires and dip up in my lip
Hey, we do it big, what do you do
I'm comin' down the street ridin' with Honey Boo Boo's mama

Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
Down here in the country man that's how it is
Everything I do it big
Ridin' around up in my big ol' rig
I shotgun beers man I don't take sips
