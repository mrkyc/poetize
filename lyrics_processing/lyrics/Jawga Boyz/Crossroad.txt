I've been on a backroad tryin' to find my way back home
But everything has changed 'round here because it's been so long
I've been out chasin' my dreams tryin' keep my soul
Been livin' two lives but I'm at a crossroad

We've been out here mindin' our own business
But we're back to show you who is the shiznit
Some of y'alls egos done blew up like Snapchat
Come at us best believe these boys gon' clap back
Been though just about everything in this rap game
Seen dudes come and go some of them they fact change
Tour bus broke down on the way to sound check
Still we got it done on the way to your town next
You can find us stayin' here in our own lane
And I won't forget how it felt to be no name
Out here workin' late some of y'all just got up
Hard work pays off this here was not luck

I've been on a backroad tryin' to find my way back home
(Way back home)
But everything has changed 'round here 'cause it's been so long
(Been so long)
I've been out chasin' my dreams tryin' keep my soul
(Keep my soul)
Been livin' two lives but I'm at a crossroad
You might also like
Yeah, sittin' right here at this intersection
Got my mind reflectin' on which direction
It's quite perplexin' with the constant questions
I continue guessin' it's a blessin'
I reckon you can even have selection
But it's depressin' and while I want perfection
Man I see the regression and I feel it pressin'
And at the present moment this second effect
Got me obsession with my intellect and I betcha
Anybody want to take a minute and just lend me a hand
And just give me some advice
I'm all ears but I'm hearin' crickets
I don't relate to their slice of life
They don't relate to my world either
They ain't seen these crossroads
They ain't ever tried to chase a dream
But at the same time runnin' from they own shadows
It's a constant battle man I'm lookin' and I'm tryin' find
A way back home where I feel the best
Where the trees sway from that cool breeze
And I'm on the back porch stayin' away from stress
But I feel the tug to chase a dream
You can call it a burden it won't ever leave
And it will never lease I never cease to seize
Best believe I'm gonna work 'til I get relief ('Til I get relief)
I've been on a backroad tryin' to find my way back home
(Way back home)
But everything has changed 'round here 'cause it's been so long
(Been so long)
I've been out chasin' my dreams tryin' keep my soul
(Keep my soul)
Been livin' two lives but I'm at a crossroad
