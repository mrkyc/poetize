Confederate flags flyin' naw we ain't stop that

Welcome to the home of chuckin' home of the watermelons
We got hard hard times and fought with more fellas
We veteran by sellin' our own alcohol
And it's not hate we're nothin' like y'all
When it comes down to it it runs through our blood
Like oxygen nitrogen flyin' through the city
Hit the dirt roads ride slow through the clay
That ditch'll get ya attention and originate quick
We got hospitality and personality too
A pinch of insanity so whatcha wanna do
This is now place to come runnin' your mouth off
Man a couple words will get your head knocked off
That ain't no threat 'cause we sound so easy
More like a warning home boy please believe me
We know how to live despite bein' dirt poor
Cross state lines be on the lookout for

Welcome to the home of the brave
Where we fly our flag with pride in our faces
And we renegades who could say we was born this way
Maybe we could change it but we love it this way
Ain't it crazy how the south been downgraded and picked on
But from now on this our home but don't be on in the wrong zone
No music, right now we celebratin' pop the top of a cold beer
And toast it to the haters it's heritage not hate let's make it straight now
Green's the only color that matters on the ninth cloud
Keep it poppin' suds bubba don't start a war
Be trouble on  be dirty as a puddle of mud
Red and black red and black reppin' where we from
I love wakin' up to the beat of a southern drum
You know how you know you're in the south (how)
You know when you hear things like P.F.E. Jawga Boyz mud juzzin'

I was born in Carolina doin' this shit too long
Now I market that just workin' hard on my grind
Been back and forth between the two a couple of times
So no matter where I go Georgia's on my mind
And this is downrated where there is no race
Us country folks take it slow like a turtles pace
You know our trucks ride high like Urkel's waist
And if you wanna hit some mud this the perfect place
So go and drop a tailgate the grounds free play
You know we get it on we gon' party 'till it's late
Got some muscadine wine, some good moonshine
You know it's all right for the cause of a good time
We on ATV's and we're chillin' by the creek
Different types of folks hang with different types of cliques
We got the black folks, white folks, even Asians
And you know we down south we got a couple of Cajuns
With the

I kick it as I stray to the left to see what you missin'
Up for the sixes is what I clicked you better be listenin'
We light that up like fireflies, burn it down like straight G's
Camouflage ruinin' the skies hidin' up in trees
It's Boondock on the track see me sippin' and grinnin'
My hat cocked to the back I keep the mud grips spinnin'
Call me the redneck dragon I'm burnin' straight from the south
Spittin' fire you feel the heat when I open my mouth
I got that southern hospitality that good ol' boy mentality
Georgia's on my mind all the time that's my reality
See them jackin' 'em up all across the nation
We got the rednecks ridin' higher than the NASA space station
All this paper we chasin' all this time we keep wastin'
And I need to start pacin' 'cause through life I keep racin'
So let the flags fly high from the beaches to the mountains
If you got cert applied lets ride on all them rebels shoutin'
