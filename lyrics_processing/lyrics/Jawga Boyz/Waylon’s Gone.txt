The bottle keeps me warm at night I feel it in my veins
Can't a country boy survive in a world that feels so strange
Everything has changed in the mirror with that shit lies it hurts brings me pain
Will it ever be the same again since Waylon's gone away
He's gone away

They always say this country rap will never work
You'll never sell a shirt
You'll never make it on the radio or make a buck
You're just wastin' your time another loser in line
These words are motivation for me to stay on the grind
So I keep pushin' myself with or without any help
Never complainin' about the sorry ass cards I was dealt
I never had any shame goin' against the grain
Folks tellin' me that I shouldn't be in the rap game
Well I think I was right and I think that they was wrong
And one day they'll realize the true meanin' of this song
Jawga Boyz with Twang And Round we keepin' it right
When country music fought Waylon they lost the fight

The bottle keeps me warm at night I feel it in my veins
Can't a country boy survive in a world that feels so strange
Everything has changed in the mirror with that shit lies it hurts brings me pain
Will it ever be the same again since Waylon's gone away
He's gone away

When Junior told them keep the change
Game will never be the same
Legacy on me outlaw 'cause I feel the same
Waylon showed them all 'bout bein' true 'til his dyin' day
Kristofferson is Whistler kickin' ass on the screen and play
Cash overheard that him and June had to go away
Willie is the last Highwayman on the stage at Farm Aid
Shooter reminds us how great he is every time he sounds off
Free Struggle so he can rap about his papaw
The bottle keeps me warm pour out a little for the balladeer
Let us know the Dukes were on the run come and get you some
Good Ol' Boy's theme had me ready for the season change
Starin' in the mirror takin' shots just to ease the pain

The bottle keeps me warm at night I feel it in my veins
Can't a country boy survive in a world that feels so strange
Everything has changed in the mirror with that shit lies it hurts brings me pain
Will it ever be the same again since Waylon's gone away
