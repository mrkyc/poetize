Push the pedal through the floor
We gotta get this thing faster
So go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Push the pedal through the floor
Come on and give it all it's got
Drop the hammer down
Come on and drop the hammer down

I'm on the interstate running' 'bout a hundred
My goal is to pass all the folks in front of me (Hey)
I can't slow down
I tore my break pedal off and threw it out
I don't need it 'cause I'm flyin' like I robbed a bank
I got the music cranked up swervin' lane to lane
This causing trucks tryna pull off to get out my way
I got the pedal to the metal in this Chevrolet
And I'm goin' so fast everything's a blur
That old man that I passed just shot me a bird
I don't know how long this will last, hope I don't get hurt
All I know is I'm hauling ass like I'm late to work

Push the pedal through the floor
We gotta get this thing faster
So go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Push the pedal through the floor
Come on and give it all it's got
Drop the hammer down
Come on and drop the hammer down
You might also like
Hop in the cab and get ready to ride
And everybody know what's goin' down
When you turn the key on the diesel, 'cause
Everybody wanna catch a glimpse but all
They're gonna be lookin' at is my dust
Tires makin' all kind of racket
Had it goin' 95, I'm a bit of an addict
When it come to the speed man I'm goin' at it
And I guess you could say I'm a little dramatic
But a bad habit what all those goodie two shoes
Bunch of know-it-all's wanna call it
Every time a 2500 see a load
On the side of the road she wants to haul it
Decals peelin' off my window
Means I'm goin' fast, comprendo
Yellin' out Wii like Nintendo
Stereo like straight crescendo
Eeny meeny miny moe tryin' to decide
'Cause everybody sayin' that they want a lift
Got a lotta folks out there that wanna hate
But the bottom of the line is they wantin' this
So they wanna go faster passin' anybody
With the boys in blue and blowin' up their scanners
This diesel stamina's too fast for cameras
Better get up out the way before we drop the hammer
Push the pedal through the floor
We gotta get this thing faster
So go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Push the pedal through the floor
Come on and give it all it's got
Drop the hammer down
Come on and drop the hammer down

I think we just passed the exit we shoulda took
But we've been goin' so fast we didn't look
All I see is cars up in front of me
They better move or they gonna end up under me

Yeah, you better watch it or you'll end up
Like a speed bump layin' underneath my chassis
Better have a diesel on go or some wang
In your ride if you think that you're pass me
Cattywompus swerve sideways
Holdin' on my both hands, drivin' with my knee cap son
Y'all puttin' me to sleep and then tell me the fabricated stories
Got me snoring in this CPAP son
Y'all silly really, y'all think y'all can hang with the Jawga Boyz
Load 'em up, buddy let's go
Comin' at 'em hard and then givin' the pound of how
Anybody rollin' in the middle of the road
Then I drop the hammer like cobalt
You can call it what you want it, I don't need to show off
Livin' like no laws pertain to me
And I don't need to drop the mic so I tote it off
Push the pedal through the floor
We gotta get this thing faster
So go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Push the pedal through the floor
Come on and give it all it's got
Drop the hammer down
