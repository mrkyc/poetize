Hey
It's your boy D. Thrash
I got a little to tell you folks
Man the other day
I pulled up to the country store down the road here
I got out of my truck
This bad little country girl came up to me and said

Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can
Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can

Man let me tell you
That little country girl lookin' so cute
Tight little jeans and cowboy boots
Yeah I ride around town just to show her off
I buy her anything I don't even ask the cost
She's real the kinda girl you need to have
If you get in a barroom brawl shes bad
I seen her crack a bottle over one dudes head
When he said that she should be with him instead
Thats right she knows how to hold her own
Likes pink but camouflage is on her phone
She likes me and loves it when we're all alone
And fights me when I try to take her home
Yeah she never wants to leave my side
And ride put it in four wheel drive slip and slide
I start thinkin' about the time we met
Over at the country store and she said

Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can
Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can
Hey hey
We've been tearin' up the town
When they see me they know she's around
She holds it down keeps everything right
Ain't scared to fight another girl she don't like
But I try to keep all the drama to a minimum
Don't want anyone to go to jail like a criminal
I'mma be there to protect her to
Hey whatever you heard about us is true
Lil mama knows how to keep me in check
Wears my favorite perfume on her neck
She likes to keep the lip gloss on deck
And keep them tools in a makeup kit
You could say that she's my kinda girl
Loves cold beer and keeps her hair in curls
That's why I could never turn her away
On that day when I heard her say

Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can
Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
You know we can
Can I get a ride
You know you can
Can I shoot your gun
You know you can
Can I be your girl
You know you can
Can we park here
