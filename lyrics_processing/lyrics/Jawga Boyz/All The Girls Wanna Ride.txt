Ha Jawga Boyz
Yeah D. Thrash
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me
Yeah they say they like my truck (my truck my truck my truck)

All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

My 49's diggin', lip full of dip
Winch on the front 'cause my truck's well-equipped
I'm in the parkin' lot, I'm pimpin' with my Wranglers on
Leanin' on the truck, I'll make them girls wanna moan
My jeans tight and I know I'm lookin' right
Got so many girls lookin', they about to start a fight
Look I'm tryna have some fun when I hop in the truck
You wanna roll, sit down, hold on, and shut up
12 gauge on the back glass ready to go
I never know when I'm gonna see a buck or a doe
And if I see a cop, girl I ain't worried
A po-po in the mud hole'll get buried
See the is what they make these big tires for
Want more, I'mma put the pedal down to the floor
And take you to a place you ain't never been out in the country
I bet I'll have you sayin' you love me

All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

And you know I'm from the hunch bunch, moonshine in my cup
In the truck, gettin' stuck in the mud, windows rolled up
All four wheels diggin' this ain't the game
You havin' fun, ain't ya girl, bet you glad that you came
Black powder coated wheels, Mickey Thompson on the tires
They said 49's wouldn't fit, but they liars
We can take a trip to the store and back
You say you want a six pack, we need more than that
What you waitin' on girl, this the chance of your life
There ain't nothin' the them city boys got that you like
If you don't know what you missin' just quit talkin' and listen
I can drive over cars while they right there sittin'
Think about it for a minute 'til I leave in my truck
Then you see your best friend askin', "How do I get up?"
If you country and you love it, then you can relate
But those city boys sure gon' hate
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now
All the girls wanna ride and tear stuff up
Hop into my jacked up truck, get stuck wanna ride
Let your hair down, said you want a redneck, don't be scared now

Haha, yeah
Y'all know
Y'all know
Y'all know, aye
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me
Yeah all the girls wanna ride with me, yes
They say they like my truck (my truck my truck my truck)
And that's what's up
Oh Jawga Boyz
We done done it again, man
Man, these rednecks been showin' these boys up
Aye, I got this big ole truck and four wheelers
Shoot man, hey
