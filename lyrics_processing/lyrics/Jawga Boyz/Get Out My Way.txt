My tires roarin', I'm on a back road
It rides rougher when I'm ridin' on a flat road
Get out my way (get out my way)

You see the truck (truck)
I'll run you over boy (I'll run you over boy)
I'm ridin' in a sky scraper with no brake pedal
And while I'm ridin', I'm eatin' on a steak dinner
I got a case of beer, I keep the liquor clear
If you a city boy it's best that you don't come here
And I sit so high that I think I'm flyin'
I'm winnin' truck show trophies without even tryin'
Yes I coulda rode lower and I'd been more legal
But I'd rather hit a mud hole a lot more deeper haha

My truck sits tall, it's got big balls
It's built tough and it's stronger than a brick wall
You know the deal (you know the deal)
We ridin' high (we ridin' high)
Rollin' like a redneck in the sky
I'm gettin' hated on when I'm ridin' through the town
They say I'm sittin' way too high up off the ground
But I don't want it down (no)
I love it how it is (yes)
'Cause I don't need a boat (no)
I use my truck to fish
Got pulled over by the state patrol and he said
There's only one thing that he had to know
He said so tell me what's the point of you ridin' so high
'Cause you know that it's illegal and I'm gonna tell you why
I said
