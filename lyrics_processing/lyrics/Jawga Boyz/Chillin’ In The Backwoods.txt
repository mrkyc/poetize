You know we've been
On the road now for a while
You know, it's been a while
Since we've been home
But we finally came back home

And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh

D. Thrash here on the mic
Gonna tell ya little somethin' 'bout a place I like
Yeah, we grew up in the backwoods
But we been on the road doin' shows
So, it's been a little hard missin' home
Been gone so long that I feel alone
I can't help how I feel, when I miss the place
I used to get a buzz off just a case
But, everything has changed
The Jawga Boyz have made a name
But I can't complain 'cause I love the fans
I love signin' shirts and love shakin' hands
And you hear how a song that I wrote
Helped them in life when nothin' was goin' right
Now it's time for me to go home
Light the bonfire and play this song
You might also like

And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh

Everything's been so hectic since we been gone
But now we're back baby, home sweet home
Back in the land of the brotherhood
With my rednecks and homies and it's all good
Down by the creek, where the water flows cold
Same ol' stuff and it never gets old
Chillin' by the fire while your stories get told
And if we get bored then we hit a dirt road
I know where to go just to find my soul
And ya dig real deep in a big mud hole
Maybe take my son out with a fishin' pole
When ya in the backwoods that's how ya roll
So I'ma take it slow and be a simple man
'Cause at the end of the day, that's all I am
Spendin' time with my fam on all my land
And I'll pop this top and I'll play this jam
And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh

Man I love it here in the sticks
And the sound of a southern rock guitar lick
Raised on country, southern rock
But I always loved a little hip hop
And we throw it down for miles around
Everybody knows when to come
When the bonfire's blazin' high, you can't deny
We're 'bout to have some fun
Got the trucks backed up
With the tailgates down, no cops around
We sippin' shine here, I don't mind
Take a swig of this and lets shoot some signs
Yeah, no place that I'd rather be
Ain't nobody else that I'd rather see
So now it's time for us to unwind
Play that song for me one mo' time

And now we're chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
Chillin' in the backwoods woo-ooh
