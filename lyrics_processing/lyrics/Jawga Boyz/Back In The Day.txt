Hah, it's ya boy D-Thrash
I just wanna let y'all know a little bit
About how I grew up

I used to trade baseball cards back in the day
Camp out in the backyard back in the day
Cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
And did things that they never said I could
I used to make prank calls back in the day
Try to race my dogs back in the day
Play tackle football back in the day
And I'll always be that kid y'all

Grew up out in Jackson County
Jefferson River Road is where ya found me
Yeah we used to ride up and down that road like we owned it
'Cause we really did back then
And my friends used to stop by all the time
If they see me in the yard outside
Never had a reason really just came to kick it
And talk about how the cops gave us tickets
I miss it, everybody does I guess
'Cause there was less stress in the life I lived
And now people wanna know more about me
'Cause they see me on TV, well

Seventeen years old, I graduated high school as a young soul
But still lived at home, I might as well have been kicked out
'Cause high school never taught me about
How this world is gonna step all over your face
And crush every dream that you try to put in place
They need to teach a new class
And call it how the real world is gonna kick your ass
And then maybe I coulda been more prepared
And aware that everyday life ain't fair
'Cause there was a time that I didn't even know
And life was slow, yeah when

I used to trade baseball cards back in the day
Camp out in the backyard back in the day
Cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
And did things that they never said I could
I used to make prank calls back in the day
Try to race my dogs back in the day
Play tackle football back in the day
And I'll always be that kid y'all
Yeah everything's changed
My life as a kid's gone with the wind
And most of my friends never seen 'em again
And that street that I used to live on is dead
I still visit there and drive through real slow
Thinking bout my grandma living up the road
Fixing me and all my friends ice cream cones
And nobody had a damn cell phone
We could do what we wanted and stay out late
Didn't have to worry like kids do today
Used to ride my bike all over the place
Making noise on the spokes with styrofoam plates
Yeah, it was all good
Jackson County treated me good too
I still press rewind in my mind
And go back in time when

I used to trade baseball cards back in the day
Camp out in the backyard back in the day
Cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
And did things that they never said I could
I used to make prank calls back in the day
Try to race my dogs back in the day
Play tackle football back in the day
