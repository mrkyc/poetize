I've been chasing my dreams, been so long
I never thought about the risk
Of living my life through these songs
And moving out from the sticks
And all these dreams that I have
Deep in my heart, will go away, or leave today
As long as you stay

From the time I was five years old
Music was in my soul and it was where I could go
To get away from the things that were bothering me
Yeah, I'd be laying there humming songs falling asleep
But it was always just a hobby, not making no money from it
I done it through all the times they was making fun of me from it
In front of my friends and kin and knowing how it felt
Hearing the hate but all I did was motivate myself
Then years go by and I'm still on the grind
I'm finally getting some love, I got a piece of the pie
But then I look in your eyes and I can tell that you're worried
Because it's not a dream now, it's becoming a story, but girl

I've been chasing my dreams, been so long
I never thought about the risk
Of living my life through these songs
And moving out from the sticks
And all these dreams that I have
Deep in my heart, will go away, or leave today
As long as you stay
You might also like
Yeah, I know it's becoming a burden
You have to sit there and watch girls come at me flirting
But you ain't ever pulled the curtain on what we have built
Because you're certain when I tell you that I'll always be here
And it will always be me and you against the world
I'm gonna ride it out with ya and then some more
We gonna take this road all the way to the end
Yeah, we've had a lotta bumps but we always win
And I done been to Nashville and turned down the deals
'Cause I ain't gotta make a mil just to pay my bills
The only thing I really need is you 'cause I could lose it all
The day and I would still be cool, and that's true girl

I've been chasing my dreams, been so long
I never thought about the risk
Of living my life through these songs
And moving out from the sticks
And all these dreams that I have
Deep in my heart, will go away, or leave today
As long as you stay
I've been chasing my dreams, been so long
I never thought about the risk
Of living my life through these songs
And moving out from the sticks
And all these dreams that I have
Deep in my heart, will go away, or leave today
