You know what it is, you know what it is, you know what it is
We gon' tell y'all a little somethin' 'bout somethin' 'bout somethin' 'bout
How we live how, how we live, how we live
Welcome to Jawga, welcome to Jawga, welcome to Jawga

Camouflage church clothes rebel hat cocked back
Confederate flags flyin' naw we ain't gonna stop that
And this here ain't hate or nothin' to do with race
But now we got G's from the woods, joinin' the paper chase
Welcome to Jawga

Country folks know it's our turn when they gonna learn
We had a little slow but we 'bout to let it burn
Jawga Boyz Demun Jones a deadly combo
Sell out to myself and a little Berrata that's in the console
Yeah, now let me ride you on this Jon boat
And let this Georgia landscape until your eyes slow
'Cause in the red clay, yes, very nice
If you're askin' me well I call it paradise
Every night on this tailgate on this fresh bailed hay
Lovin' that I'm in the south every day
Shirt on my back ran me about two dollars
Son, even Georgia is surrounded by blue collars (Blue collars)
Let me set the cast right now
Make 'em take notice of the folks in my ground
Trucks in the yard can't fit in the garage
Sunday mornin' on the pew sportin' camouflage
Yeah

Welcome to Jawga

Yes, I'm gonna show you around my hometown
Where we get down mud by the pound
We shootin' off rounds East Bound And Down the movie
Smokey and the Bandit speaks to me
I keep real in between these trees and drink these
Cold Bud Lights under the full moonlight
Cool breeze flowin' through the woods
And out to the fields where the corn stood
We do it good as we livin' our life out here in the south
We love fast cars and big trucks that drive out
Of any mud pit that would give you a fit
If you didn't come equipped with real mud grips
I don't know too many people around this way
That don't carry a gun or forget to pray
And if you're ever passin' through my neck of the woods
On a Sunday mornin' you can be sure that I'm good in my

Welcome to Jawga
Welcome to the red clay ,daddy work all day
And you better damn sure do what mama say
If you wanna keep your teeth in your mouth
You better learn to respect folks in the south
Welcome to Georgia, mud trucks make noise
40 inch plus sittin' under these toys
Real talk homie, blood in the mud
Won't break out I got my guns in the truck
Rifle in the rack, it's all under the seat
Banana clip pop lock put it on a beat
Ain't worried about the law shot deer with the deputy
Sheriff live right there so they ain't sweatin' me
'Cause we ain't hurtin' nothin' but our feet
Dancin' in Georgia boots barrel to the beat
If you ain't tuned in you need to change the channel
When we say bucks and we don't mean Atlanta
