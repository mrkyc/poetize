I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up

What's up everybody come along let's ride
On the way from the troubles and the worries in life
'Cause everybody's got something that is on they mind
When they are sittin' around happiness is hard to find
Gotta get up get out and get on your way
It's such a beautiful day and it won't pay to stay
The depression will find you if the decision is wrong
So you know what you got to do when it's time to move on
Let's ride, and take another trip with me
I got some Mountain Dew so take another sip with me
And lean back in the seat put on a CD
Of the Jawga Boyz and we'll put it on repeat
And then we'll turn it up, and roll the windows on down
These crazy boy's got us smilin' while we're ridin' around
And while we're singin' along to every song being played
It came to my attention that my bills are late

I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up

And now I'm sittin' back and thinkin' 'bout the times I lost didn't win
I ain't gettin' paranoid are my emotions in a spin
Wonderin' how much more confusion can I take
'Cause with every comin' second it feels like I'm gonna break
Well I just push it all down hopin' it won't come back
I still can feel it inside sticking me like a thumb tack
Bump that 'cause I think it's time to let it all out
If I don't release the pressure then I'm gonna fall out
And I got so many things that I came here to do
If I hit another speed bump then I'll be through
I just knew if I ignored all the consequences
My brain would remain stuck on the wrong frequence
And now I know that it's time to move on
'Cause today's a new day and yesterday is gone
So if the future ahead it's not bright but off white
Think about what you got and realize it's alright
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
Wind blowin' in my air while we're livin' it up
I said now it's alright 'cause we're goin' for a ride
Gonna cruise around town and forget about life
We got the windows rolled down and the music turned up
