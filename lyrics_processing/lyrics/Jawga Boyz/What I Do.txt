You can find me in the south
With a case of wheat hangin' in my mouth
A Bud Light beer in my hand
And a ring in my pants from a dip can
I'm a real country boy that's right
Talk with an accent on the mic
But I still got me a nine to five
Waiting on a paycheck to survive
It's tough working for the rich man
But right now I don't have a better plan
So I make that money make that dough
Get my truck fixed and make that show
Bottleneck says he's waitin' on me
A sold out crowd and it's on the beach
There's a whole bunch of my redneck freaks
And I might have a chance to be on TV
Now I got to get me a day off
Come up with somethin' to tell my boss
Same ol' stories same ol' thang
I ain't nothin' but a simple man
It's about that time for all of us to unwind
I put on a beat so get on your feet
And crank out the moonshine
Damn there's folks in the front row
That know every word I know
And I'm gettin' all kinds of love
Because we all like to play in the mud
Yeah these are my kinda people
And I wanna come back for a sequeal
But until then it's time to leave
And as we pull away I sing
You might also like
Yes I'm workin' for the rich man
All day every day
And I'm trying hard to make it through
One day at a time, yeah
So I sing these songs about the southland
Yeah yeah yeah
'Cause it's where I'm from and it's what I do
It's what I do, that's right
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
In the state of GA, yeah
And I made friends with a can of brew
Yeah Bud Light
And now we hang out all the time
All the time, that's right, yeah
'Cause that's who I am and it's what I do
It's what I do, yeah

I am the southern man workin' hard to pay the bills
Blood sweat and tears all fell at the steel mill
I put my life on the line to make a couple bucks
But it don't matter how much you grind you can not make enough
You run like a dog to live high on a hog
You get caught up in livin' you don't do what you are called
You gotta do what you dream
You gotta dream what you sing
You gotta be who you are
You can not buy everything
Take one day at a time
I work 'em hour by hour
I woke up still tired
Go to sleep in the shower
I pull up my boots yeah I did what I do
I get off real late and get deep in the brew
I sing songs about the southland
Hell yeah
And the hell with a bossman
Hell yeah
I'm tryin' real hard without punchin' a clock
But Bottleneck is doing fine
Bott-Bott-Bottleneck is doing fine, yeah
Yes I'm workin' for the rich man
All day every day
And I'm trying hard to make it through
One day at a time, yeah
So I sing these songs about the southland
Yeah yeah yeah
'Cause it's where I'm from and it's what I do
It's what I do, that's right
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
In the state of GA, yeah
And I made friends with a can of brew
Yeah Bud Light
And now we hang out all the time
All the time, that's right, yeah
'Cause that's who I am and it's what I do
