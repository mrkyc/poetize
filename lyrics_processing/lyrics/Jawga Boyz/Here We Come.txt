We got the tailgates down and we're hangin' out
Now everybody sing loud now help me out 'cause

Here we come we got your movin' once again
Hear it turnin' and we'll all just watch it spin
Just like an wheel we keep it on the real
Close you're eyes and you'll feel everything is alright

Here I come everything's all good
All up in the mud everything's all good
We got a hot track and I know you'll like that
It's time to get down stop standin' in the back
It's a whole new revolution everyone's usin'
Except us though if you with us do this
I think everybody knows what we about
But if you don't know you're about to find out
It's the Jawga Boyz from ATH
Makin' all the noise in the big Peach State
We can do it all to a slow, ayy get your krunk
So don't keep it low underground stuff
That's right and we keep you up all night
With the bass up loud because the track is tight
You might also like
We got the tailgates down and we're hangin' out
Now everybody sing loud now help help help me out 'cause

Here we come we got your movin' once again
Hear it turnin' and we'll all just watch it spin
Just like an wheel we keep it on the real
Close you're eyes and you'll feel everything is alright, that's right

Now I can already tell I'm feelin' good tonight
I grip the wheel turn on the key and flip on the lights
A tight flow with a little bit of arrogance
You put the headphones on and that's the evidence
And every now and then I'm goin' out of my mind
I might battle my mind when I rattle my rhyme
But we them Jawga Boyz heads bobbin' up and down
All around to the ground with an underground sound
Keepin' it goin' 'til they sick of us won't come in meticulous
We'll do it how we do it down south so ridiculous
And we're movin' again, send the news to your friend
Payin' dividends to the DJ when he spins
Put us on, and let it play all night
Put your hands in the air if you're feelin' alright
We got the tailgates down and we're hangin' out
Now everybody sing loud now help help help me out 'cause

Here we come we got your movin' once again
Hear it turnin' and we'll all just watch it spin
Just like an wheel we keep it on the real
Close you're eyes and you'll feel everything is alright, that's right

Everything's alright let's ride out to the beach
So we can feel the sand, it's all under my feet
And now I feel so far away from it all
Like a bird in the winter flyin' south for a while
Like there's nothin' to lose, no decision to chose
Flyin' high with the truck in "Drive", ready to cruise
Now I'm not lookin' back and all my clothes are still packed
I wake up, it was a dream, now I face the facts

Here we come we got your movin' once again
Hear it turnin' and we'll all just watch it spin
Just like an wheel we keep it on the real
Close you're eyes and you'll feel everything is alright, that's right
Here we come we got your movin' once again
Hear it turnin' and we'll all just watch it spin
Just like an wheel we keep it on the real
