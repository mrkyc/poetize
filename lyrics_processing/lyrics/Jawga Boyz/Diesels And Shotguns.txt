Strong as the whiskey being run down by the creek
Just some wired up country boys that barely go to sleep
We got them diesels (diesels) that make the cops run (cops run)
I'm with my people (people) we got them shotguns (shotguns)

Yeah, back on a bush hog Dez chopping
Everybody embody karate redneck cutting
On the same with ripped jeans, a lotta people try
But the fact they ain't tempting me with nothing
Here in the Boondocks, just the life we about
Never gonna take my feet up out the creek
And they mad 'cause they can't really live it how we live it
Tryna get up in the kitchen but they can't stand they heat
Suddenly backup, moonwalk from us
They don't know what it's like to slang them square bells
They ain't ever nailed two by fours on a white oak
Two foot apart when they needed a stairwell
Y'all know what's up, we them Jawga Boyz
Set it off and now we taking everybody for the ride
But you can't be scared of a little attitude
In this altitude, it'll make you widen your eyes
Showing up in that flannel shirt
Need to buckle up or grab the handle first
Running and gunning the window cracked just a little bit
But better watch out, our road's made of dirt
Yeah I lurk in the holler everybody know
To holler if they need me and I'll come with the quickness
But when they riding around with me for a little bit
Again Disturbed, d-down with the sickness
Heads out the window, upchuck and a fuss
And it's a common scene I need dramamine
They say I'm a little wild behind the wheel now
But it's how it's gonna be if they gon' ride with me
I'm a southern dude, I come from proud folks
And do right, ain't worried about too much else
Trapping on a beat and I'm killing it, feel me?
Might as well go and say I'm collecting pelts
