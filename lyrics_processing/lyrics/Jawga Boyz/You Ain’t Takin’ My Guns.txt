You ain't takin' my guns
You ain't takin' my rights
And if you think you're gonna tread on me son
You gonna get a fight
I've been here too long
Watch it all go down
I'm only tellin' you once
You ain't takin' my guns

Crooked politicians up in DC
Whose ultimate goal is to control you and me
All we got at the end of the day is each other
But we too worried about each other's color
Puppets on a string while they do their thing
Chem trails in the skies behind plane wings
Prescription pain pills filling the streets
Leaving talented folks with empty dreams
It's a mess and I ain't really sure where it's headed
But I ain't scared because I stay ready
And it don't matter if you're left or right
'Cause there's a lot of greed on both sides, cuz
Some of you are saying you got a favorite
But you elect 'em and then you get played with
They all the same it's a big old game
And they can keep everything, but
You might also like
You ain't takin' my guns
You ain't takin' my rights
And if you think you're gonna tread on me son
You gonna get a fight
I've been here too long
Watch it all go down
I'm only tellin' you once
You ain't takin' my guns

But now these times we living in they challenging to put it lightly
And if you don't see this world unraveling care to enlighten me
A bit about your thought process and what you witnessing
It's getting to the point it's running ravage, it's a sickness
Men and women risk their lives every day putting on that uniform
But half the country act like they don't exist, like a unicorn
I don't see how they do it but God bless 'em
I say a prayer for 'em hoping that they burden is less than
Protecting folks that burn the same flag
That's stitched up on their shoulder
Thought the world was pretty cold
But now it seems to be getting colder
Hold up, am I the only that's thinking something wrong with this
They on a separate mission and nobody wants to listen
Everything is so offensive all these folks they get they feelings hurt
Everybody got excuses talking about they feeling cursed
All this whining and complaining, I don't really know what for
But I got that Browning A5 staring out my front door come on
You ain't takin' my guns
You ain't takin' my rights
And if you think you're gonna tread on me son
You gonna get a fight
I've been here too long
Watch it all go down
I'm only tellin' you once
You ain't takin' my guns

Yeah, yeah
Baptize us in the blood of the innocent and it's imminent
Supreme Court extending our sentences, forget the minimum
Fighting foreign battles, our only option is militant
Yet we forget about the world we're currently living in
They turn us on each other, we murdering for the benefit
They hide us from the truth, when we call 'em on it they censor it
We all are immigrants yet we point our fingers
See prescriptions for addiction, it's funny we're still addicted
I said it's sickening, the people we love the most are the victims here
Protected by amendments that are slowly starting to disappear
They say to speak your mind, we murder for opinions
They never pull the trigger, I'm guessing that's for appealing
I'll make it simple, this my house and these my children in it
Don't care if you like it I'll do anything to defend it
And you could try to intervene or you could try to stop me
And you could take my gun over my dead body
You ain't taking my guns
You ain't taking my rights
And if you think you're gonna tread on me son
You gonna get a fight
I've been here too long
Watch it all go down
I'm only telling you once
