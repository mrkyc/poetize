Yeah, woo
Jawga Boyz

Feet hangin' off the dock, flip flops with no socks
A little Johnny Cash singin' out from the box
Lovin' life, sittin' up in the Georgia sun
A straw hat with jeans man I'm gettin' it done
With a bamboo pole and my Dixie cup
Lean back feelin' good just livin' it up
So everybody gather round, gather round get down
I said we droppin' tailgates many miles from the town
Throwin' old trees on the bonfire blaze
I said I worn the same jeans for about three days
I had them rolled up, halfway up my shins
So to my next of kin, you can call me Hick Finn
Odelay, odelay, skippin' around the field
I'm lovin' the aroma comin' up from the grills
Said we country folks, doin' country thangs, slow slang
So kick your feet up, now e'rybody sang

Get out your truck and lets go for a ride
Down the dirt roads where the mudpits hide
Call up the boys and tell 'em that it's on
They better come quick before the beers all gone
There's trucks gettin' stuck mud up to the door
The girls in the back screamin' give it some more
Got the pedal to the floor steppin' on with both feet
And when we get done it stays dirty for weeks
You might also like
Yeah, when we get done it stays dirty for weeks
I don't wash the mud off cause I want you to see
How it be in the HEH and J-Town
We jack up the trucks then it's time to get down
Madison County, Basset County, Banks Country too
Tie a rope from the hitch, and go in it in a tube
For the mud, we don't need no lake to have fun
Give us some Bud Light, duct tape, and a gun
Seal this dream, baby a couple bottle rockets
Lightin' the fuse, stick it out the window, and watch it
Okay, well maybe not, nevermind
Let's be responsible, where's the moonshine
We gettin' crazy, it's insane
Blame it on the alcohol in my brain
Next week, same time, same plan
I'mma call you up and we gon' do it again so

Get out your truck and lets go for a ride
Down the dirt roads where the mudpits hide
Call up the boys and tell 'em that it's on
They better come quick before the beers all gone
There's trucks gettin' stuck mud up to the door
The girls in the back screamin' give it some more
Got the pedal to the floor steppin' on with both feet
And when we get done it stays dirty for weeks
Get out your truck and lets go for a ride
Down the dirt roads where the mudpits hide

Yeah, haha, it stays dirty for weeks
That's right man, that's how we do it
