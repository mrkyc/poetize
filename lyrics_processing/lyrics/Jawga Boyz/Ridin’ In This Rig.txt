We slingin' mud up in the air, while we ridin' in this rig
Blowin' smoke up in the air, while we ridin' in this rig

Pissin' old folks off (yeah), while we ridin' in this rig
Makin' old folks cough (I think it's about time we show them folks how we do it around here you know what I'm sayin'), while we ridin' in this rig

I'm ridin' in my rig I blow smoke with no cig
I'm talkin' 'bout those stacks right behind and they're big
Yeah we roll and we ride, country folks we get high
Call my truck Jimi Hendrix 'cause you're 'bout to kiss the sky
I don't like, I ain't fake, and I ain't ever been late
I feel sorry for you if you end up standing in my way
Everyday I ride high, you say hey I say bye
You say wait but I fly right by you in the sky
Y'all know I do it big not just talkin' 'bout my rig
Also talkin' 'bout the dip that's in my lip when I spit
Never quit what I start, never been super smart
Never tried to be that guy that is not inside my heart

We slingin' mud up in the air, while we ridin' in this rig

Put the pedal to the bottom of the floor man
While I'm revin' it up and you know that I'm lettin' 'em have it
Blowin' smoke like a freight train with the music up
And I keep pissin' off these geriatrics let 'em move in traffic
I don't really wanna put 'em in a ditch but I reckon that's my reputation
Hi-hit 'em with a brush guard movin' 'em over cave in the tailgate with no hesitation
Co-comin' down the road with a vengeance (yeah) better believe you can hear me hummin'
Bu-burn a tank of fuel in about a minute
Better get out the way of this Cummins
Man is there really anything better than a truck full of rednecks
Rollin' around and just goin' nuts
Wanna hit the late night drive through
But I really really don't think that I'm low enough
Can't slow it up, I got lead in the bottom of my right foot and I can't get it out
I got people ridin' shotgun grabin' the handle, while they close their eyes yeah they're flippin' out
They pissed at us 'cause it's spittin' dust
And it don't really matter how we livin' it up
I roll it up with these KC bulbs
Now everybody gonna see it slingin' mud
