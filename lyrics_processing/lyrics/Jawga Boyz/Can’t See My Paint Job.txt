Haha Jawga Boyz, yeah
Yea buddy, rollin' like a redneck
Chevy jacked up with the straight pipe smoke stacks
Fresh paint job, (Check) fresh inside (Check)
Is it in two-wheel or four-wheel drive
Are the tires big? (Big) Do it ride rough? (Rough)
Lean back in the seat like you real tough!

Clean on the inside, mud on the outside
Clean on the inside, mud on the outside
Clean on the inside, mud on the outside
I can't I-I can't see my paint job
Clean on the inside, mud on the outside

Got a handle on the dash you can hang on with
So you don't hit your face hard (Haha)
Yea I'm livin' like that (Like that like that)
And I'm ridin' like that (Like that like that)
Boy I'm ridin' like that truck stays jacked up even if I get fat
Just like my boy said, we ready
Don't matter if your in a Ford or a Chevy
2500 or an F-250
Sippin' on a cold brew of grandmamma's sweet tea
Crank my truck, CB hummin'
Tires so loud you can hear me comin'
Redneck clique, we get hunnie's
Slingin' up mud and we scarin' off bunnies

Snorkle thru the hood lookin' like a snake head
That right thurr see, see I like
Got the Super Swamper tires for a dirt cheap price! (I'll take 'em)
Press one button truck automatic start
Hit the gas too hard and the tires might bark like
Woof woof woof, too hard
Look what you done now, messed up the school yard!
