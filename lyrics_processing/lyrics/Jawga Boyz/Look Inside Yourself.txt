Take a deep look down inside yourself
Are you really that strong when you scream for help
Are you really that strong when you need some help
Just to get you through your days and
When you look down deep inside yourself
And you find all the secrets that you kept
To provide all the good things that you left
'Cause you got in your own way and
Take a deep look down inside yourself
Are you really that strong when you scream for help
Are you really that strong when you need some help
Just to get you through your days and
When you look down deep inside yourself
And you find all the secrets that you kept
To provide all the good things that you left
'Cause you got in your own way

So I take a deep look down inside myself
I see I'm not so strong when I need some help
Oh well, I guess it's back to the drawing board
I'm gonna start deep down inside my core
And I find so many things that I see that I did just to entertain
Why I don't understand what I did
I had to be somebody else to get accepted

And now I take a step back to see what is going on with me
What do I see when I look into my own eyes
Is it something that I wanna be why do I seem surprised
Like I never knew myself and all the things that I did
'Cause I was being someone else from the time I was a kid
I didn't understand the pain that I was puttin' you through
Until you opened up my eyes showed and me what I had to do
But I couldn't make a change and I could not be myself
Until I looked deep down inside and realized I needed help
I've been keepin' everything from you and I still don't know why
I'm just glad that you know it all 'cause I'm done with the lies
