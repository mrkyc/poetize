Wow, Christy, do you see that truck?
I mean gross, that is so tacky
That must be one of those rednecks I've heard about!

Hop in the truck, come on lets roll
Just bought a case of beer
Now we headin' for a mud hole (haha)
County boys and we do it right
Got the bill of my hat pointing strait to the sky (yeah man)
Carhartt and Wranglers on
Bass Pro hat, camouflage on my phone (look)
Got the Browning decal on the back
Right next to a G
What you know about that
I'm country and that's how we live
If ya got moonshine then I'm takin' a sip (haha, there you go)
Some folks call me a redneck
I smile and take it as a compliment (hah)
I live life the only way I know how
Walk with a swagger and I rep the south (yea)
And if you see me as I'm riding through the crowd
I'm hangin' out the window screamin' it loud

Yeah buddy, rollin' like a redneck
Trucks jacked up I got a smoke stacks
Nuts hanging off the hitch
And a system in the back that'll make your nose itch (haha)
Yeah I'm living that right (that right, that right)
And I'm ridin' that tight (that tight, that tight)
Son I'm ridin' so tight that my tires sound like a damn bull dog bite

Wakin' people up as I ride through at night
And don't forget about the skyjacker lift kit

Six twelves in the back helpin' out with the sound (nope)
And I got a train horn if you too slow
Speed up or I'm lettin' it blow (haha)
If your ridin' to close from behind
I got spotlights that will turn you blind (ooh)
Yeah, so back off you don't want none
Hangin' on the back glass ain't a BB gun fool (ooh)

You know when we see a buck we don't miss (no)
You know that we love (yeah) to play in the mud (yeah)
And when we get trucks we jack them up (yeah)
And when we get stuck we don't get mad (what man)
We drop the tailgate and have a party in the back (haha)
That's right, we live so tight
Open the cooler and grab you a Bud Light (I got twenty)
