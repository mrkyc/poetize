Jim was just an average guy
Growing up in a middle class world
He got bored, 'bout the time when he turned sixteen
He decided to try a few things, some bad things
Hanging out with a different crowd
Living the fast life and nothing to care about
There was a plastic bottle getting passed around
He learned quick this is how they got down
Soon everyone had done got something out
They put it in their mouth and they washed it down
Told Jim it was his turn and hurry up
He took one out and they gave him a cup
Then he closed his eyes and did what they said
It didn't take long to feel the effects
He felt a rush that he could never explain
He thought it was good but it would never be the same
And he sang

This plastic bottle oh it has what I need (Has what I need)
To take away all of those bad memories (Those bad memories)
All of those times it used to make me feel sad (Make me feel sad)
It makes me feel better than I ever have (Than I ever have)
This plastic bottle oh it's been good to me (It's been good to me)
Takes me away where I can finally be free (Finally be free)
I hope that one day I won't need what's inside (Need what's inside)
So I can feel how I felt before the first time

Fast forward about ten years
Now Jim has his own plastic bottle of pills
He can't go one day without one
And spends every last dime just to get some
It was a mistake that he can never get back
He'd give anything to get back on track
The feeling that he gets now ain't the same
It don't fight off rain and don't cure the pain
But now it's a new day and it's time
To walk into a new place and rewind
Take control of the light that he has
Take mistakes and leave them in the past
He knows it's gonna take help and lots of it
To take a disease head on and just crush it
And to think it all started on that night
And innocent decision that changed his whole life
When he sang

This plastic bottle oh it has what I need (Has what I need)
To take away all of those bad memories (Those bad memories)
All of those times it used to make me feel sad (Make me feel sad)
It makes me feel better than I ever have (Than I ever have)
This plastic bottle oh it's been good to me (It's been good to me)
Takes me away where I can finally be free (Finally be free)
I hope that one day I won't need what's inside (Need what's inside)
