Well I can't help it cause it's in my blood
I make no secret it's plain to see
I'll jump on anything that's lookin' good to me
I can't quit it. I can't quit it
Cause it comes to me naturally
Well I like this one over here. And I like that over there
Bring me a dozen. Boy I just don't care
And when I'm finished and I'm all out of breath
Bring me a honey and I'll love her to death
I can't quit it. I can't quit it
Cause it comes to me naturally
Well open the door and I'll walk right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreamin' of
LjqiooI tell you the truth I ain't got time to lie
Well I spend my love around the neighborhood
There's no need to ask me 'cause it's understood
It's just my style and one more thing
Give me your number and I'll give you a ring
You might also likeI can't quit it. I can't quit it
Cause it comes to me naturally
Well open up the door and I will stroll right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreaming of
LjqiooI tell you the truth I ain't got time to lie
Well I like this one over here. I like that one over there
Bring me a dozen. Boy I just don't care
And when I'm finished and I'm all out of breath
Bring me a honey and I'll love her to death
Well open the door and I'll walk right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreamin' of
LjqiooI tell you the truth I ain't got time to lie
Well open the door and I'll walk right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreamin' of
