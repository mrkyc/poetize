When I saw some old friends that I knew
So I stopped for a couple cervezas
But I swear I was thinkin of you
I put on my hat for my exit
When who would walk in through the door
A man you might call a bandito
And he told us to lay on the floor
Well he took what he could from the cash bo
And he took all my pay from this week
Just when I thought that it was all over
He said, "Hey boy you're comin with me"
Well your love is one in a million
And I'm sorry for what they have done
They all try to come in between us
Now our love's a million to one
Well you asked me to meet you at the movies
I knew we'd have such a good time
Meryl Streep in a part with an accent
It sounds like a favorite of mine
But I came on an elderly woman
Her child had been taken away
She said by a pack of wild dingos
Well what would you do in my place
You might also likeI followed that trail of the dingos
One they put up a terrible fight
But I finally retrieved her baby
And we drank to the end of her plight
Well your love is one in a million
And I'm sorry for what they have done
They all try to come in between us
Now our love's a million to one
Well you called me the very next mornin
And you said that we needed to talk
But my car wouldn't start on that evening
So to your house I started to walk
On a moonlit dark sketch of highway
Something quite strange happened there
For above all these lights started flashing
And they pulled me straight in the air
The aliens were not what I expected
But their problem was perfectly clear
Some dingos had stolen their babies
