Well, when I was young, my mama read me nursery rhymes beside my bed
And though they sounded mighty fine, they made no sense to me
But now that I am all grown up, it seems my nights have changed and such
So I went out and made me up a nursery rhyme for me

It goes bar light, bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may, wish I might
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle, a man with a fiddle
And the girls sing along with the tune
Just a one more dance 'til you turn off the lights
And you can shut down this saloon

You know, I never understood how a big ol' gal could raise no kids in a shoe
And any old Jack goes jumping a candle needs to find something better to do
And a rub a dub dub, three men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky-tonk nursery rhyme and it's the only one I'll sing

It goes bar light, bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may, wish I might
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle, a man with a fiddle
And the girls sing along with the tune
Just a one more dance 'til you turn out the lights
And you can shut down this saloon
