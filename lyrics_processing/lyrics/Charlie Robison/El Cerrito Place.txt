I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you
All the places you would go, all the people that you know
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you
And all them pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all think they're goin' far
Chorus:
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
As you danced over the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
There's a Joshua Tree grows that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people they ain't got too much to say
And if they might have seen you they ain't givin' you away
Now it's been two days
You might also likeMe I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
I think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
