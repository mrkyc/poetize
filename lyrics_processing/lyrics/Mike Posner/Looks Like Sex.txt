Forget them other boys, baby
Forget them other guys
Yeah, I see your nose ring

Used to pull girls like you, nope!
Not in 09'
You ain't a mixtape chick baby
Had to sell a million for your time

Say ayo
Can you hear me? Uh, can you hear me?
One more time, say ayo
Can you hear me?
I can make it rain, make it soak all night
You just give me a chance, make it feel alright

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
