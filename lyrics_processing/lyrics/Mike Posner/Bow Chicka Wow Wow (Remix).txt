Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl

I hear you knock, knock, knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in your cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready

You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do?

Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
You might also like
I'ma make it sound like

Are you tryna make me wait, wait, wait 'til the second date?
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, let me jump in it
I bought you flowers and a teddy

You've been playin' hard-to-get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?

Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

Yeah, I can make it sound like
Uh, I got a leather couch, and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right (Ha)
You say you can't, but that's unfair
Gotta give something, somethings gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we layin' up, ha, cigarettes

Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
(Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa)
(Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, oh)
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
(Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa)
(Oh, whoa, whoa, oh)

Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
Yeah, I'ma, yeah, I'ma make it

Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
