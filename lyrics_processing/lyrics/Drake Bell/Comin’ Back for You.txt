Tank God

Fuck did I do last night?
Basically I'm still high
Think I'm 'bout to crash my car
Fuck it only live one life
Said I was on my way
Swear that my phone just died
Gotta get my shit together
Fuck it I'ma live one life

Cocaine clouds on the ceiling
While Coltrane drowns all the feelings
Every night fuck for the weekend
Am I alright? I'm not alright

I'm coming back for you, I'm coming back for you
I thought that I lost you; that's just paranoia
Could say that I'm sorry, but it's never enough
I follow the money, but that shit is enough
I'm coming back for you

I know I've been down this road
I'm swervin', I'm out of control
I'm forward, I'm backwards, I'm sober, relapse
I love and that's all I know
That's all that I know
Just don't let me go
Forward I'm backwards, I'm sober, relapse
And I love and I'm ready to go

I just wanna lay here
Got a show tonight (Yeah, yeah)
I could spend all day here
Got hair and make-up waiting on me
Still I gotta prepare
Wearing my 
I don't need to stay here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My mind is tripping I'm wishing that I could spend every minute
And with this life that I'm living I'll be surrounded by women
And men that love me 'cause I'm winning, yeah, yeah
They only love me cause I'm spending, yeah, yeah

Cocaine clouds on the ceiling
While Coltrane drowns all the feeling
Every night fuck for the weekend
Am I alright? I'm not alright
I'm coming back for you, I'm coming back for you
I thought that I lost you; that's just paranoia
Could say that I'm sorry, but it's never enough
I follow the money, but that shit is enough
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you, I'm coming back for you
I thought that I lost you; that's just paranoia
Could say that I'm sorry, but it's never enough
Yeah, I follow the money, no that shit isn't love
