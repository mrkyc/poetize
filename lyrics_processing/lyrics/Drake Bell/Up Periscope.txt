I'd only wish I'd never miss it when you wake up and smile
It makes me happy when you steal a little kiss
Before you wake me up to listen to the news for a while
And when you're creeping outta bed
I sneak a peak to see just what you were wearing last night
What was left of ripping off your clothes
I checked to see the door was closed as you were turning off the light
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can show you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love you
(I do)
My life is like a bowl of cherries
Not so very ordinary, overflowing with love
And I could never want four more unless our two becomes a four
Or maybe three if we practice it enough
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can show you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love you
(I love you)
You might also likeWell I know that life is hard
I know that love can break your heart
That's just the way that it is
Well baby, that's a load of smack
And don't you know I've got your back and what's important is the way that we live
And like the way you love this song
Because it makes you hum along and tap your foot to the beat
That's the way you make me feel
When we're doing it for real
I can feel it from my head to my feet
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can give you
One more chance to believe
And hopefully see
That I still want you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine
Up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love you
