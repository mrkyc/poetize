You were so clever
You kept it together today
By the way
I'll no longer ignore you
I wanted to show you again
I'm your friend
Sometimes we just pretend

And all I can say is you saved me
Changed all the things that have made me
Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall

It's all okay
When I say
You and I
Take your time
I can't wait
To see you fly

You don't have to wander
I've finally discovered tonight
We're all right
This is just the beginning
It's all that I'm tryin' to say
If I may
You're never in my way
You might also like
And all I can say is you saved me
Changed all the things that have made me
Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall

It's all okay
When I say
You and I
Take your time
I can't wait
To see you fly
All day long little Backhouse plays guitar

Why do you have to blame me? Why? Why? She says aw shit
Gimme some sweat the only interest make your mind this'll also make your mind numb
(Those who have not developed the awakening mind
Cannot enter into the secret practice of tantra)
Access to the tantric teachings
Is restricted to those who receive
Their initiation
