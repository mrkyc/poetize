Right in front of me
A couple makes what could melt the snow
Making fun of me
A single look never cut me so

And I know
To save the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world

Walk away from me
I see the change in the atmosphere
What a way to be
To turn the page
Just to make it clear

And I know
To change the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world
You might also like
To fear
Or to disappear
What a waste a time

What a troubled mind
A fortune find for another day
As you're passing by
You look behind to see what I would say

And I know
To change the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me

So I go
To change the conversation
I know
A deep contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me
If I could fool
The world
I can't survive another day in the life
Without a day in the sun
Before you touch me
Here's a word of advice
If I were you I would
Come get it
Come get it
Come get it

So won't you tell me why
That every corner of my head is a home
But every fool is the same
It would be tragic if you left me alone
But left me no one to blame
Well don't it make you wonder what got us here
The covers that were under could disappear
Promises keep us in chains my dear
(If I could fool the world then no one would know where I've been)
What am I feeling
