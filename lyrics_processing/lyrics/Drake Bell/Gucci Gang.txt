Spend ten racks on a new chain
My bit' love do cocaine
I fuck a bit', I forgot her name
I can't buy a bit' no wedding ring
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang

Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Spend ten racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring
Rather go and buy Balmains (Ayy)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang

My lean cost more than your rent (It do)
Your momma still live in a tent (She do)
I still slangin' dope in the 'jects
Me and my grandma take meds
None of this shit be new to me (No)
Fuckin' my teacher, call it tutoring (Yeah)
I bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs
Fuck your airline, fuck your company
Bitch, your breath smell like some cigarettes (Cigarettes)
I'd rather fuck a bitch from the projects
They kicked me out a plane off a Percocet
Now Lil Pump flyin' private jet
Everybody scream, "Fuck WestJet" (Fuck 'em)
Lil Pump still sell that meth
Hunnid on my wrist, sippin' on Tech
Fuck a lil' bitch and make her pussy wet
