We did the thing last night
Now I'm waking by your side
Without cruise on the edge of the bed
And both fonts dead watching the sunrise
Something about this prey
'Cause baby by now I've been saying
That we have the hell of a time
And you're so fine but I can't be saying

It only took one night
Suddenly now I'm addicted
Only no one wanna fix it

First thing in the morning
Girl all I want is you
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning
Your body upon me
And me,I love you
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning

Baby your body's so tasteful
I kiss every inch I'm that wasteful
We can get it tomorrow on the bed,on the floor
On the counter or under the table

Only no one wanna fix it

First thing in the morning
Girl all I want is you
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning
Your body upon me

First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning

Girl ya hips are the nicest
The way you move girl so priceless yeah
There are no others one like this
'Cause baby you  got these spices yeah

It only took one night
Suddenly now I'm addicted
Only no one wanna fix it
First thing in the morning
