From the second he drops you off
That's when you stopped blowing me up
Telling me to come over
Acting like you've got controller
Just when I thought that I had enough
That's when I remembered your touch
After the weekend in Florida
How could I ever ignore you

Know that when it goes hot (You)
Can always hit my phone up (Oh, oh, oh)
Know it's only luck
Only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely

Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely (Yeah), baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely (Yeah), baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

Wasting no time girl you're on my body
You're trembling, I bet you want me
Baby, you can't resist it
I back up put you insist it
You told me that it's alright
So I take you into the night
But it hurts me touch ya
'Cause I know he loves you
You might also like
Know that when it goes hot (You)
Can always hit my phone up (Oh, oh, oh)
Know it's only luck
Only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely

Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely (Yeah), baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely (Yeah), baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

What-what-what-what is you delusional
Take the time that I put into loving you
Can never be me just using you
My body waved like an ocean when I'm cruising you
To the Isley Brothers, "Groove With You", what's up
Triangle in love and I'm craving in love
And I'm sorry if I'm angry in love, but this is dangerous love
Another dilemma be tearing me up
I know enough is enough but I can't get enough, call me
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

Know that when it goes hot (You)
Can always hit my phone up (Oh, oh, oh)
Know it's only luck
Only call me when you're lonely
