Cure again
Come to give you more again
Yeah, hey-ya, hey-ya

You'll never find
No one in this lifetime to love you like I do
So never mind
Things that people say that I'll never hurt you
You'll never find
No one in this lifetime
So never mind
Let time unwind, baby

Lay your head to rest, baby (Baby)
Let us put love to the test, baby
And let love lead the way
If we believe (If we believe)
Join our hearts of mind and souls
Keep us together

You'll never find
No one in this lifetime to love you like I do
So never mind
Things that people say that I'll never hurt you
You'll never find
No one in this lifetime
So never mind
Let time unwind (Let time unwind), baby

When time comes around
And no one's around
I'll be there with you girl
In silence your sound (Time after time)
Time after time tings
Burden you down
But I will still love you (Love you)

Our friends say that you are not sincere
Your friend said proceed with care
But you see and feel the realness in me
Our love is meant to be
Our friends say that you're not sincere
Your friend said proceed with care
But you see and feel the realness in me
Love was meant to be
You'll never find
No one in this lifetime to love you like I do
So never mind
Things that people say that I'll never hurt you
You'll never find
No one in this lifetime
So never mind
Let time unwind, (Let time unwind) baby

I'm for you
You for me
It's meant to be (It's meant to be)
Exactly how it is
When you are here (When you are here) with me
Nothing exists
True love is what it is

You'll never find
No one in this lifetime to love you like I do
So never mind
Things that people say that I'll never hurt you
You'll never find
No one in this lifetime
So never mind
Let time unwind
