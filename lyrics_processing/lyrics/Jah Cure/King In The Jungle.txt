Sizzla Kalonji and Jah Cure once more
Yeah
Yeah

To divide and rule, is their only plan, their only plan
But I anuh fool to let them overcome
'Cause I and I a king in this jungle
Seated up so high, and so humble
I've seen so many fall, and they stumble
Along the way
Aye
Along the way
Aye

Well then, well!
We lock off Babylon heartbeat
I run every stoplight at every street
So ghetto youths stop beg pon them, 'cause a long time me see it
You diss the Trinity, you ago fall from your feet
House of Parliament, me know this yah one a get you weak
The youth dem nuh haffi beg before the ghetto youths them eat

I and I are kings in this jungle
Seated up so high, and so humble
I've seen so many fall, and they stumble
Along the way
Aye
Along the way
Aye
Along the way
The way

Well, well
To Queen Eliz-, the wretch of England
Tell your police, no more molestation
Unuh diss King Selassie, and a pure bangarang (blackness!)
Remember, Emmanuel a the crowned champion
Me tell you, this a reach all United Nations
All now we a chant fi repatriation
Check how the youths dem live, inna bere pollution
I tell you, Jamaica inna bere corruption

To divide and rule, is their whole plan, their whole plan
But I anuh fool to let them overcome
I and I are king in this jungle
Seated up so high, and so humble
I've seen so many fall, and they stumble
Along the way
Aye
Along the way
Aye

Well then, you see it
Me no come descent from east end
I man no greet no wolf, you see, no matter how dem deep
From you sight the Bobo man, take off your tams and do it
You sight the turban, take off your caps dem and do it
Sight Emmanuel, every empress must be neat
You sight King Selassie, Babylon gone beneath
I standing at Zion gate
And watchin' all the flex and move that you make
So I and I are kings in this jungle
Seated up so high, and so humble
I've seen so many fall, and they stumble
Along the way
Aye
Along the way
Aye

We tell dem, we tell dem say
Lock off Babylon heartbeat
Emmanuel run every stoplight at every street
So, ghetto youths stop beg from dem, a long time me see it
Me nah tell you again, say a Bobo Hill a do it
House of Parliament me know, dem yah one yah get you weak
The youths dem nuh haffi beg before the ghetto youths dem eat
