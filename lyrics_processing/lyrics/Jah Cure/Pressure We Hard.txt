Rastafari rules
Yeah, for the poor and desperate youth
Who feels it, knows it
We've be through the struggles
And we know 'bout the struggle dem
Tell poor people we love them
We never put no one above them
Nooo
Selah!

Dem a pressure we hard, hard
Nothing nah gwan, poor people a suffer real bad, bad
Anywhere dem see di loophole dem a go fah
Mad, mad, people deserve a chance fi live better
When you hear di baby bawl
Babylon you're bound fi fall

Dem a talk bout price increase
Babylon a really di beast
School fee, bus fare, light bill, food and soap
Cyaa buy out a five grand a week
Dem waan we fi a suffer inna gutter, inna famine
While di whole a dem up deh and a feast
If wi no get our equal right's and justice
Dem naw go have no peace

Farmer cyaa get di chance pon di mountain
A bay helicaptor a rade
Man a try juggle likkle things pon di corner
Jeep load a Babylon come a invade
Don't forget seh a di sweet Reggae music put Jamaica up pon di front page
How yuh fi lock off di people dem show before di big artist come pon di stage

Dem a pressure we hard, hard
Nothing nah gwan, poor people a suffer real bad, bad
Anywhere dem see di loophole dem a go fah
Mad, mad, people deserve a chance fi live better

High cost of living, yes wi haffi live through it
I cyaa depend pon Babylon promise
Seh yuh would a fix di road, yuh never do it
Seh yuh would a full di pot hole, yuh never full it
All wi a knock pon yo door yuh no pull it
All weh yuh give to di poor is bullet
Government corrupt and di leaders screwing
Fire haffi bun people just true few in
Dem a pressure we hard, hard
Nothing nah gwan, poor people a suffer real bad, bad
Anywhere dem see di loophole dem a go fah
Mad, mad, people deserve a chance fi live better
When you hear di baby bawl
Babylon you're bound fi fall

Let dem know this is the takeover
Go let dem know, oh
