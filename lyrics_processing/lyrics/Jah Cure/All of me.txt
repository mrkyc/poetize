What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out?
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's going on in your beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm outta my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me, yeah
You give me all of you, yeah

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mode
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, this ringing in my head for you
You might also like
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm outta my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me, yeah, yes
You give me all of you, yeah
Give me all you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

All of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I'm lose I'm winning
I give you all of me, yeah
You give me all, all of you, ooh girl, yeah
I give you all of me, ooh baby
