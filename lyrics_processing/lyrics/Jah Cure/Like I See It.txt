Jamaica, stand up!
Yeah!
To all rude boys in the capital
Cure again
Ye-e-eh
Jah Cure:
Meet me up in Kingston
Put me on your radar
I'd be out there hustlin'
Gettin' to the paper
Come to my neighborhood
Be on your best behavior
You don't wanna test
We put the G in the Gangsta
Original mangler
I can rearrange ya
Giving you ordinarily to the danger
I own the block, bitch
Acting like a stranger
Boy, I'm a major
Shots callin' like I see it
Shots callin' like I see it
Mavado:
See me
I was caught up in the fast lane
Hustle till morning
Never stop until the cash came
Really "Mister Make It" is my last name
Life is like a poker, but I never played my last game
You see me
Now they wish they coulda be me
Was born in the gully, now I'm big in every city
(Ha ha)
Now I'm gaining every penny
Send me to this world again and I'm a make it pretty
Heathen best agonize when we rise
Smoking kush and have a girl by my side
Peeping Tom with them eye open wide
Nah tell you something, I ah snide

Jah Cure:
We don't need no visas
To come through your speakers
See me in a video
Cleaner than a preacher
Turn to pay-per-view five nights and me feature
You give me respect
In return, I'm a treat ya
Youth, I'm a reach her
Message, I'm a teach her
That we go on, we have no time for the leisure
Music, we be smuggle in a room for the seizure
Pass me a reason
Jah Cure:
Shots callin' like I see it
Shots callin; like I see it
Shots callin' like I see it
Shots callin' like I see it

Every lane
Jah Cure:
Don't bring trouble on my way
Unless you wanna pay

Coming from the Bossman Almighty
This one for the streets
For the youth in them in the hot of tha city
We ah huslte dis hit to everywhere yes hear me
Cure to the World
