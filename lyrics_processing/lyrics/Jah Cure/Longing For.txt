Yeah, you know
Only you
Only you
Mmm

Only you can make me feel just like a king
Love you give to me, so real
Makes me give in

Girl, just like magnet to steel, your love keeps pulling me in
If it's a battle, I'll fight for you, I have to win
To prove to you my love is so deep within
It's even getting deeper since I reach prison

Longing for
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon, release the Cure
What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
