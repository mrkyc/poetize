Hey!
Dada dada dye
Jah who I and I
Baby, only for you
Lady, only for you

What will it take, my love, to show you I'm still in love with you?
What will it take, my love, to show you how much my love is true?
Feeling she gave to me, makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there is no other like you

Baby, I know I hurt you twice
Promise I'll never hurt you no more
Although I know it's not nice
Promise I'll never go back through that door
Although you've got your choice
Please make sure the first is the cure
I'll make my sacrifice
Only you, no one before!

What will it take, my love, to show you I'm still in love with you?
What will it take, my love, to show you how much my love is true?
Feeling she gave to me, makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there is no other like you
You might also like
Baby
No one but you
Mmm

Many of times I've tried it
Baby, I can't deny it
I just can't live my live a day in this world without you

What will it take, my love, to show you I'm still in love with you?
What will it take, my love, to show you how much my love is true?
Feeling she gave to me, makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there is no other like you

You
Nana nana, nana nana
EH Eh
This is so special
I'll tell you girl
For someone special living in my world
It's only for you
The things that I do-o, baby
Girl, open your heart and let your love through
Like ever ocean shores, where the rivers run through
Back to the arms of the Cure, where she wanna run to
Let me tell you for sure, you're welcome back too
Baby, anytime you want too
Lady, my love is gonna haunt you
Mmm
Yeah!
What will it take, my love, to show you I'm still in love with you?
