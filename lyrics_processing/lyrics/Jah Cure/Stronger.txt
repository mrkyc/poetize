Cure again
Come to give you more...
More of my time
Don Corleone... again
Gotcha

I've tried a lifetime to find you
Give me a moment just to remind you
Of the love we've not made before
The reason you can't close this door
I see confusion in your eye
And maybe you're a little surprise
The way we make love under the moon light
Tomorrow you use to the new life

Come away in a dream
This world is not what it seems
There be no gold at the end ah the rainbow
Birds don't fly anywhere that the wind blow
Come away in a dream
Life is not what is seem
Happily don't always live forever
But my love is getting stronger everyday
Stronger everyday
You might also like
They tell me that diamonds are your friends
But diamonds won't be there in the end
I give you my love to remember
I keep you happier, happier, more happier
You should be mi bonefy
Nothing in this world can justify
Love inna you heart for I and I
It's You and I, You and I, baby
Maybe it's just faith
A time will simply be waiting
Is a chance to practice together
We can go in search of forever

Come away in a dream
This world is not what it seems
There be no gold at the end ah the rainbow
Birds don't fly anywhere that the wind blow
Come away in a dream
Life is not what is seem
Happily don't always live forever
But my love is getting stronger everyday

Woooooooooy
See the future in your eyes
Yeah, yeah
Stronger yeah, stronger yeah, stronger everyday
My love keep growing yeah, getting yeah
Stronger each day
Come away in a dream
This world is not what it seems
There be no gold at the end ah the rainbow
Birds don't fly anywhere that the wind blow
Come away in a dream
Life is not what is seem
Happily don't always live forever
But my love is getting stronger everyday
