Yeah e Yeah
Ooh o Ooh
Ooh o Ooh
Cure again, yeah
Eyyyyy

Every corner I turn, I see your face
Everywhere that you go, I'm at that place
I just can't escape you, no coincidence
When I think that it's over, you'll see me again
See me again

I don't know your name or where you come from but it seems like we met before
'cause ever since that day I see you at that place I've been coming back to see you some more
I've been talking to myself, tryna figure out if you put a spell on me
Is this a sign, yeah, you keep running through my mind, ehh
When I close my eyes at night when I sleep, you meet me in my dreams
Try to pinch myself so I can wake up but I see you on my plasma screen
When I go outside and the sun shine's on I see you shine now on the wall
Is this a sign, am I running out of time?
'cause every corner I turn
You might also like
Every corner I turn, I see your face
Everywhere that you go, I'm at that place
I just can't escape you, no coincidence
When I think that it's over, you'll see me again
See me again

Imma call you Faith, 'cause I can run away and catch back up to you You're hot like the sun, gotta find a shade so I can get away from you
When I go to eat food, you're at the restaurant working at the register
Is this a sign, eh, am I going out my mind? Hey
Well it's something I can't over girl
How I keep running in to you girl
Got my heart so confused girl
I don't wanna play around and lose girl
There's no explaination to how much I know you
Is this a sign, yeah, you keep running through my mind
Every corner that I turn

I just can't escape you, no coincidence
When I think that it's over, you'll see me again
See me again
