One puff one draw
Frees the mind
Mmmmm mmm

Feeling irie
Take a pull an' fill my lungs
Every worries inside me
I turn them into little clouds
I'm so grateful to nature for this sweet euphoria
Feeling irie
Mmm I'm feeling good
Bob Marley know it all along
And Willie know it all along
They even try to say it's wrong
But I knew it all along

That the marijuana (Frees the mind)
Yes the marijuana (Gets me high)
So put your lighters in the sky
Tell the Government legalise
Marijuana, marijuana

Jah cured these herbs and they're good for me
I'm floating on a hill so stony
I'm glad to know I'm not alone because
Rastafari's my custodian
We represent the herbs on the podium
The Indicas are short like Napolean
Sativas don't like too much sodium
The seeds can replace your petroleum
The leaves have a skunky aroma scent
THC make you feel like it's heaven-sent
CBD is to me like a medicine
Do some research and you'll be pleased by the evidence
Perhaps you cultivate some trees in your residence
And agree to disagree with the Presidents
Tell the Prime Ministers please don't be hesitant
To let the herbs grow and be free!

So many legal drugs are killing us
Illness they're giving us
Yet still they criticise the marijuana, yeah

Marijuana, marijuana
Frees the mind, yeah (frees the mind)
Ooh yeah
Gets me high (gets me high)

Marijuana frees the mind (put your lighters in the sky)
Tell the Government legalise
Marijuana, marijuana
Frees the mind

Ooh oh oh
Oh my marijuana
