People try to seperate our love
But they couldn't penetrate our trust
They try to pull the curtain down on us
But we're still here
Baby said they try to break us up
Tell them haters just to give it up
All I know is in the name of love
This ain't no game
I was born to just stand beside you, ooh ooh

Risk it all for you
Go to war for you
Tell me that you'll never ever leave me
This is what them haters said we'll never be
Do it all for you

They can talk about our business all they want
Won't stop me from giving you this good love
You deserve it all nothing to prove
I'm here doing it all for you
Not concerned with things that aren't 'bout us
Tell them haters just to give it up
Gonna love you long time
All of my life
There is no end
You might also like
I was born to just stand beside you (I'll stand by you)
Woah oh oh oh oh

Risk it all for you
Go to war for you
Tell me that you'll never ever leave me
This is what them haters said we'll never be
Do it all for you

If they ever try to get at you
They will have to get through me too
I don't care what they try to do
I'm here doing it all for you
Baby they see that we're still in love
Tell them haters please to give it up
Loving you until my time is up
I'll never leave you (I'll never leave yeah)

I was born to just stand beside you (I will stand by you)
Woah oh oh oh oh

Risk it all for you
Go to war for you
Tell me that you'll never ever leave me
This is what them haters said we'll never be
Do it all for you
Risk it all for you
Go to war for you
Tell me that you'll never ever leave me
This is what them haters said we'll never be
