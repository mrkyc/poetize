(VERSE 1)
Every time I stop and make a look back as I reflect on my life, my life
Every time I stop and make a look back at the struggles in my life, my life
In my life I've seen many things
In my life I've seen paupers turn to kings
Some people come and go
Yet their memories never fade
Not everybody knows, that the good things that you do, will be remembered for
Remembered for
(CHORUS 1)
I've seen it all
The rising and the falling of many kings
And the bird that tries to fly away with broken wings
Yeah yeah
I've seen it all
And wicked people stand aside and do their thing
I pray to Jah, meditate and strum my guitar strings
Woo ooh woow yeaah
