Drive-In Theatre

Bought it this mornin', drive it like I stole it
Park it, left it runnin' like I really don't want it
Weavin' bendin' corners, been like, bent like
Elbows, been being anywhere that cash go
Bought it this mornin', drive it like I stole it
Park it, left it runnin' like I really don't want it
Weavin' bendin' corners, been like, bent like
Elbows, been being anywhere that cash go

Checkin' my mirror for them suckers
Coast clear, turn up that music, light another
This that, mink coat flow, I wrote this in the summer
Poolside, high-school, you, motherfucker
To the rules we abide by on this side, members-only
Like the jacket, I grew up amongst some criminals
Check their jackets, known for action with them ratchets
While I was just coolin', writin' raps, eatin' snacks and shit
300 racks I spent just to sit in back and get
Higher than a mother, lookin' down to them scrubs
How could you hate your brother when I'm just like you?
Except I did what I said that I would do
Erase the hate and let the sun shine through
Apply yourself, fool, you can live out your dreams, too
Imagination can create the truth
Every brick that built my mansion will provide the proof
Recognize he ridin' Bentleys when he comin', fool
Like a set of Forgiatos on the livin' room
Luxury shit, fuck with me, bitch
Capital G, the weather nice out, I'm hittin' the switch
I'm in the streets, thirteen-inch, triple gold Ds
Strike a pose, a picture worth a thousand words
I suppose, picture me rollin' with your golden
Chosen who you thought would hold it, down for ya
But she clowned ya, you're under pressure, so unprofessional
High beyond measure, sharin' her treasure with my fellows
Oh she down for the jets, bro, no trickin', no financial
Strictly finesse, bruh, onto to the next, bruh
Find her where I left her

Bought it this mornin', drive it like I stole it

Sollozzo: I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in cash. I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes
Don Corleone: I said that I would see you because I heard that you were a serious man, to be treated with respect. But I must say no to you and let me give you my reasons
