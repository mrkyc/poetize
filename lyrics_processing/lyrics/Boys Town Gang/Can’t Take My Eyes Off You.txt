You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There're no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Oh, then let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say
You might also like
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say

Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
I love you, baby and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say

Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
Oh, pretty baby, trust in me when I say

I love you, baby and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
