I'm full of love, I've got so much to give
Come, let me show you how to live
Open up your heart, it's the door to your soul
Let my good lovin' just flow

I'm gonna love you
Love you till the very last drop
The very last drop
I'm gonna love you
Love you till the very last drop
The very last drop, hey baby...

I am your coffee, you are my cup
Let all this lovin' fill you up
When love comes down, and you feel the need
Girl, you can always count on me

I'm gonna love you
Love you till the very last drop
The very last drop
I'm gonna love you
Love you till the very last drop
The very last drop, oh baby, yeah...
