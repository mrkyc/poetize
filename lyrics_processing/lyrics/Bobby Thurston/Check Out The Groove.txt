People, let's dance, get on your feet
Don't worry 'bout steps, just follow the beat
It's not so hard to get in the groove
Let yourself relax, I'll bet you you'll move
When you check out this groove
I'll bet you you'll move
When you check out this groove

(Check out this, check out the groove
I bet you're gonna, gonna move)
Get on down, get on down
Oh, little girl, won't you get on down?

Feet on the floor, holler for more, oh
(Check out the groove
I bet you're gonna, gonna move)

Hear those drums, they keep the time
Dance to the punch of those thumpin' bass lines
The music's good, you can't leave the floor
The groove is so hot, you're just beggin' for more
When you check out this groove
I, I bet you you'll move
When you check out this groove
