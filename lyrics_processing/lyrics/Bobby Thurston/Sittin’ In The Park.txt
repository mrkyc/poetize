Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Ya-ya-ya-ya

Yes, I'm sitting right here
Waiting for you, my dear
Wondering if you ever gonna show up
I don't know you're gonna show
My darlin', I got to go
But nevertheless I say you gotta be waiting

Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Ya-ya-ya-ya

Sitting here on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wonderin' if I have any sense, girl
Something tells me I'm a fool
To let you treat me so cruel
But nevertheless I say again you gotta be waiting

Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Ya-ya-ya-ya

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why...
(Tell me why)
Won't you tell me why?
(I wanna know why)
Oh, my darlin', I'm sittin' right now
Little girl, I wanna know why, why
Why... ya-ya-ya-ya

Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Ya-ya-ya-ya

Sittin' here on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wonderin' if I have any sense, girl
Something tells me I'm a fool
To let you treat me so cruel
But nevertheless I say you gotta be waiting

Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Ya-ya-ya-ya
