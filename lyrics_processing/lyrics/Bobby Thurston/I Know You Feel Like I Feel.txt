I know you feel like I, I, I feel
I know you feel like I, I, I feel
I know you feel like I, I, I feel
I know you feel like I, I, I feel

Girl, I tell you I can feel it
So don't try to conceal it
If you love me don't you be afraid
To say "yes", to say "no", just let your feelings flow
Girl, I got this little notion
That you're afraid of your emotions
Just relax and don't you hold aback
I am free, can't you see, come be a part of me

I know you feel like I, I, I feel (say it again)
I know you feel like I, I, I feel (say it again)
I know you feel like I, I, I feel (I know how you feel)
I know you feel like I, I, I feel

Girl, your smile gives you a way
It says more than words can say
Don't be shy, come on and try
To release your love, it's good for both of us
Girl, you know it's hard to hide
All the things you feel inside
Deep within your soul is sayin':
"Girl, be real, come show him how you feel"
