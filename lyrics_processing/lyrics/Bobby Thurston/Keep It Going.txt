So you work all week, livin' from day to day
Now it's time to enjoy yourself, you deserve a break
So get up, go out and have yourself some fun
We're gonna dance to the music, until we see the sun

If you're the kind who lives your life for real...
Then don't stop dancing, if you feel like I feel
Like I feel

Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (keep it moving)
Keep it going (keep it grooving)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going

So the madness of the world has surely got you down
(Got you down) But hold on to what you believe
Don't let it spin you around, and around, and around
When the pressures are mounting, you need some kind of relief
(Come on, baby) Come on and ride the boogie
(Ride to the boogie) Come on and follow me, follow me
You might also like
If you're the kind who lives your life for real...
Then don't stop dancing, if you feel like I feel
Like I feel

Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (keep on moving on)
Keep it going (don't stop grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (keep it moving on)
Keep it going (don't stop grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going

Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going, keep it going
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (so keep moving on)
Keep it going (got to keep on grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (so keep moving, y'all)
Keep it going (just keep grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (so keep moving on)
Keep it going (gotta keep grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (so keep moving on)
Keep it going (gotta keep grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going (keep moving on)
Keep it going (gotta keep grooving on)
Keep your body flowing, keep it going
Keep it going, keep it going
