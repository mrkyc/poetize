I think you got some problems
And I sure hope that you can solve them
I'm sick and tired of you
And your nasty attitude
You walk around with a chip on your shoulder
You don't care about nobody else
The world don't owe you nothing
You got to get yours like everyone else

You stand around, pointing your finger
Condemning everything
But when the going gets tough, the tough get going
But all you do is complain
Climb down off that high horse you're riding
(That you're riding) And face reality!
Well, stop acting like some kind of fool
We all got troubles, you see
