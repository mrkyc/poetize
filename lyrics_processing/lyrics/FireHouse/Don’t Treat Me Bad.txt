That when you're playin' with fire, you're bound to get burned
Oh, I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face, still I come back for more
But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad
I gave it everything, but you threw it all away
I can't take any more of these games that you play
I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way
But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more
