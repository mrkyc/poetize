You personal philosophy reflects your high I.Q
And I am impressed by the way you think everything through
Baby you're so smart I know that I could really learn a lot from you
Well you've got quite a brain but I've got half a mind
To show you what I want to do to you
With all respect your intellect takes a back seat this time
It's the physical attraction that turns me on
There's just somethin' 'bout you body
That makes me want you all the time
Oo I want your body but all I get from you is
A piece of your mind (there's just somethin' 'bout your body)
And your body talk don't take no genius to see
The intelligent approach is gonna be most likely to succeed
I'm thinkin' about you, do you think about me
I really feel I could fulfill your full mental capacity
Well you've got quite a brain but I've got half a mind
To show you what I want to do to you
With all respect your intellect takes a back seat this time
It's the physical attraction that turns me on
There's just somethin' 'bout you body
That makes me want you all the time
Oo I want your body but all I get from you is
A piece of your mind (there's just somethin' 'bout your body)
