I thought love was a fantasy
But Honey you made a believer in me
Now I know it's true
Now they say that this will last forever
Just as long as we stay together
So now we can see just what love means to me and to you
Well I tried to find the answer in the 'Book of Love'
But that didn't give me a clue
What I found a definition it wasn't anyone
It was you

Well I never knew the meaning of love
Now I just can't get enough
And I never knew the meaning of love
'Till I met you
I never knew the meaning of love
Well I never ever quite understood
How could love make you feel so good?
When I looked at you it was then that I knew it was true
Now it all makes sense to me
You've got to take love seriously
Only you made it clear that the meaning of love
Is you
