She drives me crazy, oh, she drives me wild
But when she tries to satisfy me when I'm drivin'
We do need to stop somewhere for a while
Oh, gettin' ready, I feel the need for speed
Can't slow down 'til she gives me what I need
I know just the place that we can go (we can go)
Hop in the back, we can be all alone (all alone)
Lock the doors and hold on tight (hold on tight)
We're gonna have a good time tonight
We're going down, down, down to Lover's Lane
That's where she drives, drives, drives me insane
I'll take her down to, down to Lover's Lane
We're going down, down, down to Lover's Lane
Yeah
My motor's runnin', yeah, it's gettin' hot
I get overloaded, overheated, could explode
Can't believe it, we just gotta stop
I know just the place that we can go (we can go)
Hop in the back, we can be all alone (all alone)
Lock the doors and hold on tight (hold on tight)
We're gonna have a good time tonight
