I could've given up without a fight
But when I first saw you, from that moment
You changed my life
Didn't even know I had it in me
To care for somebody that much
And it scares me to think
How this could be dangerous
Pre-chorus:
Now it's too late to turn back I've fallen for you
There's nothing I wouldn't do
I believe I could walk on your water
I would drown in your river of love
And I know I could walk through the fire
I would burn in the flames of your heart
If I get too close to you I might hurt myself
Like a moth that flies too close to the flame
I can't help it, 'cause for your love I'd do anything
I would walk for a million miles
Just to get one step closer to you
I'd give everything that I own
Just to spend time alone with you
