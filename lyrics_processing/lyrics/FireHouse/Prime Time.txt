Not gonna wait it's Prime Time
Bring it on honey I'm a real go getter
Time was never better than Prime Time
I've had enough just wasting my time
I gotta get down to the real nitty gritty
While I'm in my prime
I'm gonna for broke I got a sure fire plan
This time I'm gonna go all the way
And I don't give a damn

Go back to the beginning and start all over again
Its my life and I'm a gonna live it
Take it to the limit it's Prime Time
Never too late better late than never
Nothing last forever it's Prime time
Can't hesitate, procrastinate
Not gonna wait it's Prime Time
Bring it on honey I'm a real go getter
