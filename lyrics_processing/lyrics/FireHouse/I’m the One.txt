When my life was so easy
Ran into a woman who needed love
She never wanted to release me
You fall for me more and more
I turn you away
How am I to know that you're in pain ?
Down that long face your tears will flow
The more you keep telling yourself
That no one will ever know
'Cause I'm the one that your hide
I'm the secret that you keep inside
You live with a knife in your heart
I'm the One that you hide
I'm the reason that you cry
I never wanted to be the one
No where to run no where to hide
You always know how you can reach me
You made up a fantasy you made up your mind
You made up excuses just to see me
You fall for me more and more
I turn you away
How am I to know that you're in pain ?
Down that long face your tears will flow
The more you keep telling yourself
That no one will ever know
'Cause I'm the one that your hide
I'm the secret that you keep inside
You live with a knife in your heart
I'm the One that you hide
I'm the reason that you cry
I never wanted to be the one
No. I never wanted to be the one
How can I understand your emotions
Why can't I feel the heat from the flame
Why should I even care
When there's nothing really there
Why do I get the blame
When there's gonna be hell to pay 'cause I'm the One
'Cause I'm the one that your hide
I'm the secret that you keep inside
You live with a knife in your heart
Yeah I'm the One that you hide
I'm the reason that you cry
I never wanted to be the one
No i never wanted
No I never wanted to be the one
I never needed
I never wanted to be the one
And i never treated you wrong
