Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
That was all she wrote

I got home late though Saturday night
And I knew right away something wasn't right
I knew she was gone
She took all I had, but left a hole in my heart
Should've known it'd go bad right from the start
What did I do wrong?

I can't understand how she could leave me this way
With nothing to say
Then I found the note on the door
It said goodbye and she don't want me no more

Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye, she said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote

I called on the phone, but she wasn't there
Should've know all along that she just didn't care
Why did she have to go? Oh, no
And now I look at her picture and I wonder why
She left me this way, why did she say goodbye?
I guess I'll never know

Oh, whoa, still, I can't understand how she could leave me this way
With nothing to say
I remember the note on the door
It said goodbye and she don't want me no more

Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye, she said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote


Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye, she said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote
Baby, bye-bye, she said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote

(All she wrote)
Baby, bye-bye

All she said in her letter
