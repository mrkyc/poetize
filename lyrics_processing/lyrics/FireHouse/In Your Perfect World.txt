I could never win your love
Why should I try
When you never share your feelings?
How could I be so na've?
Is it so hard to believe
That you excel in emotional concealing?
No matter what I do
I never measure up for you
But you just keep that smile on your face
No matter how much I try
You're never really satisfied
Until you run away and hide
In your perfect world
Where there's no one to blame
No one can hurt your feelings
And you don't feel no pain
Everybody loves you
And nobody gets burned
As long as you are living
In your perfect world
It seems like everyone gets screened
On your answering machine
Can't take the call
And let down your defenses
You can't let anybody see
Your real personality
Is it pride, or just your false pretenses?

Because you keep it all inside
But still you wear that smile on your face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you
In your perfect world
Where nothing can go wrong
You're always in control
And we all get along
And everything is beautiful
No need for concern
As long as you are living
