I make my living on the run
My life is lonely
But I was born to need no one
Always on my own
Oh?
My gun is loaded
I'm a six-shot heart attack
I pull the trigger
So you better watch your back
Looking out for number one so you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Well it's a show down
This is what I do for fun
I got a reputation
Yeah I'm the fastest gun
I'm livin' on the highway
Movin' on from town to town
You better do it my way
Or I will shoot you down
