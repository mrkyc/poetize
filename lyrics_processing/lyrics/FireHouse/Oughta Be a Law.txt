It's time to pull over and pull 'em all down
Ooh, the lady in red, well, she's driving me mad
Her very first offense was just lookin' at me
But that second glance was a felony
Ooh, the lady's so fine, but I think it's a crime
She's just too much for a man like me
They'd better lock her away and throw out the key
(There oughta be a law)
Against a girl like you
(Oughta be a law)
Against the things you do
(Oughta be a law)
For breakin' hearts in two
(There oughta be a law)
Against a girl like you
Against a girl like you, baby
Ooh, the lady is cruel and she's breakin' the rules
If only looks could kill, she'd be killing me
Guilty, murder one in the first degree
Ooh, the lady's unkind, she's got me doin' time
She's just too much for a man like me
They'd better lock her away and throw out the key
