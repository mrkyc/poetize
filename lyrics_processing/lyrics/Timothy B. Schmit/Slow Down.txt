There's a cool breeze in the air
I'd like to go outside 'cuz it feels so right
But, somehow I don't dare
From my point of view I've got things to do
There's so much n my mind
The committee inside my head, it says
I simply don't have time
I'm in motion
But I can't say if it's good
And I keep pushing
Though a voice inside my head says that I should
Slow down
Take a deep breath in and look around
It's prime time
And it won't last all that long
You gotta say no
To many things that do not matter
Draw that line
You're gonna miss out if you don't slow down
You can have the best intentions
You can practice self control
But if your only pace is to win the race
Then all you get is old
You might also likeIt's the bitter without the sweetness
It's a candle with no flame
If your glass is half empty it's hard to see
So easy to feel pain
I'm running ragged
Always on a quest
In isolation
And it's bound to stay the same unless you
Slow down
Take a deep breath in and look around
It's prime time
And it won't last all that long
You gotta say no
Too many things that do not matter
Draw that line
You're gonna miss out if you don't slow down
I need to feed my senses
Every day
Don't want to go too fast 'cuz
My life might  slip away
If tomorrow rains and it thunders
And chain lightning streaks the air
If it shakes the earth for all I'm worth
I hope I won't despair
'Cuz I need to seize the moment
I want to hear it call my name
I gotta fill up my heart with this state of art
Then stash it in my brain
But I go on
I just can't stand still
It's my obsession
And I know nothing can change until I
Slow down
Take a deep breath in and look around
It's prime time
And it won't last all that long
You gotta say no
To many things that do not matter
Draw that line
