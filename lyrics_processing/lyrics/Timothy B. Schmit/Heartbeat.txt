When we first held hands
Seems like it's been such a long time
It felt like a poem
With a perfect rhyme
It was more than crazy good
We stoked that fire
As the night rolled on
There was nothing else that mattered
We were on a mission
Right into the dawn
Hungry for love
Now the years have gone by
And we still survive
What others only try
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
Right up close to mine
Pounding out that rhythm
Time after time
Who says love can't be lasting?
I know it isn't so
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
Everywhere I go
You might also likeSometimes I'm working
And it takes me far away
It's a life that I have chosen
You're not always with me
Sometimes you'd rather stay
And it's all good
'Cause you don't own me
And I don't own you
All we do is love one another
Two lucky people
Who know how to work things through
Yes we do
When I'm out on my own
So far from home
I don't feel so alone
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
Right up close to mine
Pounding out that rhythm
Time after time
Who says love can't be lasting?
I know it isn't so
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
Everywhere I go
Could I be dreaming, could this all be true?
I can't be certain when I'm with you
'Cause you're an angel whose love is so strong
And I feel that drumming going all night long
It's quite a story
You and I we've had some fun
In between the shadows baby
Now we gotta pay attention
'Cause time is on the run
And it won't wait
Though the years have gone by
We continue to fly
While other only try
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
Right up close to mine
Pounding out that rhythm
Time after time
Who says love can't be lasting?
I know it isn't so
'Cause I can feel your heartbeat
