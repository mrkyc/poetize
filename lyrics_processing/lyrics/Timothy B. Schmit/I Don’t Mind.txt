How come you threaten that you just might go?
Why do you want to pick a fight?
What makes you tick, I swear I don't know
I bet you can't sleep at night
I never know who you're gonna be today
I always take time to check it out
I only need to get a good look at your face
To see what it's all about
Sometimes without warning
You strike with all your glory
But I'm able to take a step back
And look around, get on the right track, 'cause
I don't mind
Go ahead and be that way
I don't mind
I'm happy at the end of the day
Well, it's too bad you live with such misery
'Cause everybody knows it loves company
But count me out... I'm doing just fine 'cause
I don't mind
You might also likeI haven't had a dream for a long, long time
But last night took me by surprise
Out of the shadows you walked right up to me
Wiping the tears from your eyes
I didn't know what to do so I asked you, "Why?"
You opened up your mouth to try to speak
But you changed your mind and you passed right by
Then I woke up from my troubled sleep
So heavy, the drama
Your self-inflicted trauma
I hope you get a little rest
Meanwhile, I wish you my best 'cause
I don't mind
Everybody does what they like
I don't mind
Nobody's always right
When you make a big scene and you wanna shout
I will take anything that you're giving out
I can jump through hoops, you can cross that line, still
I don't mind
Everybody's got a little edge that's rough
Everybody needs to piss and moan
There's not a single human that I can think of
Who doesn't need some time alone
So, when I see you coming and it's looking bad
When I feel you heating up the room
I'll turn the other cheek and I'll be so glad
To avoid the impending doom
I'm lucky... my plate's full
Don't mean to sound ungrateful
Any which way that wind blows
You'll be my friend, 'cause you know
I don't mind
Go ahead and be that way
I don't mind
I'm happy at the end of the day
Well, it's too bad you live with such misery
Everybody knows it loves company
But count me out... I'm doing just fine 'cause
I don't mind
