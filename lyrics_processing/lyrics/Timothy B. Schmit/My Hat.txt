It was time for me to reach out for the door
I didn't then what I know now, and it is just a fact
My behavior was just this side of poor
Well I can't really tell you what was going through my mind
But I try my best never to be rude
If my heart is not open then I start to fall behind
And you'll see one of my off color moods
Don't know when it might end
Maybe I should make my amends
So I buckle up tight
And try to stay on this roller coaster ride
I go up, I go down
And I keep spinning around
Well I wake up each morning, I get ready for my day
And I'm all set to conquer all my fears
But I tend to let all these little things get in my way
It's been happening a lot these past few years
Sometimes I think too much then nothing happens way too fast
I might stare out the window but not see
I need to capture the moment 'cuz I know it may not last
It's a matter of letting things just be
You might also likeSometimes I'm on fire
Too much pent up desire
So I buckle up tight
And try to stay on this roller coaster ride
I go up, I go down
And I keep spinning around
It's so much later than I'd like
And there's so far to go
Tonight is such an endless night
And I can't sleep now
It seems I'm on a roll
I have moments of greatness when I feel I'm on a quest
There are times when I dangle by a thread
In the sweetness of glory I feel raging tenderness
I prefer it to when I hang my head
Such a puzzle to me
Seems I've misplaced my key
So I buckle up tight
And try to stay on this roller coaster ride
I go up, I go down
