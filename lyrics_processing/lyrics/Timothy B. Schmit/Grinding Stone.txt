Way beyond the meadow wide
Standing underneath the azure sky
In a state of harmony
Feel the breeze while the tall grass sways
To the music of ancient ways
It's a dance that can last for days
Like the deepest memory
Put on your boots and them let's go
I'll take you down to the sacred grove
Here's a thing or two you ought to know
There's a world we cannot see
We are walking on hollowed ground
Where the native spirits abound
This is where the Chumash found
Life and destiny
Oh, and it's bitter sweet
On one hand it's a sad old story
And on the other it's a field of dreams
It's pain and glory
Why is it me that gets to reap what's been sown?
By the sweat and blood of all those before me
I am so grateful now to call this my home
And I'll take good care of that 'ol grinding stone

The creek is running, it's at full speed
And everywhere there's a luscious green
But many did get lost
The first people used to gather here
One with nature, without fear
Then they all began to disappear
In the shadows of the cross
Oh, it makes you wanna cry
This is something that should never happen
I wish I could make it right
And I often wonder why
Why is it me that gets to reap what's been sown?
By the sweat and blood of all those before me
I am so grateful now to call this my home
And I'll take good care of that 'ol grinding stone
In the name of righteousness a race proud and free
Was slowly gathered up and taken
Becoming slaves for something threy could not see
Such a mournful fate to be forsaken
It's a wonder this field remains
As it was in former days
The bulldozer couldn't find it's way
It's a miracle to me
Oh, in a thousand years
Will the earth be strong and healthy?
Can the hills persevere?
Will the spirits still be here?
Why is it me that gets to reap what's been sown?
By the sweat and blood of all those before me
I am so grateful now to call this my home
