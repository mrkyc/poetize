Smashing on the dry ground
It's like the earth's letting off a little steam
Staying in the here and now
It reminds me to be present tense
In any given situation
I gotta try to always do my best
Such a quaint affirmation
It seems so simple:
Follow the good path
Sometimes we trip and stumble
It's just a wake up call to stay on track
Deep in the night when the shadows hide
And the crickets are singing
I feel the pull of a great divide
Between hatred and healing
And I can't be sure how it will be
Come the next time we meet up
If I practice my philosophy
Maybe I'll call your bluff
I'll draw a line
I'm not looking to save you
Your shit is not mine
I need to stand my ground and keep my cool
You might also likeSooner or later you're gonna find out
But until then I'm gonna have to say 'no'
You can't lose if you're willing to stand tall
Your life is all you own
I refuse to be part of your downfall
You'll have to go it alone
I can see that fire there in your eyes
You seem to use it like a weapon
And I wonder if it's worth the pain you hide
Just to make a strong impression
And I don't know what makes you so mad
Or why you think you gotta play rough
You  keep trying to make me feel bad
But it's a habit you should give up
I'm doin' all right
Today is a good day
Though nothing's air tight
I am willing to face you come what may
I feel good so
Don't try to bug me
But if you do I'm gonna have to say 'no'
You can't lose if you're willing to stand tall
Your life is all you own
I refuse to be part of your downfall
You'll have to go it alone
Sooner or later you're gonna find out
But until then I'm gonna have to say 'no'
You can't lose if you're willing to stand tall
Your life is all you own
I refuse to be part of your downfall
You'll have to go it alone
You can't lose if you're willing to stand tall
Your life is all you own
I refuse to be part of your downfall
