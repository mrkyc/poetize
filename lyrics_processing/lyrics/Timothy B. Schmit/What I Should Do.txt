I get crazy, I feel blue
I get distracted and then I find
I can barely keep a hold of my mind
Don't you know I've got to shoot from the heart
Or my world might fall apart
Happiness is not a guarantee
I need to find what works for me
I came upon a friend of mine
Just the other day
I told him I can't seem to compromise
And I think I've lost my way... He said
"Don't be mad, don't be confused
Everybody needs to find a muse"
It's such a mystery, but true
'Cuz when I am not doing what I should do
I get crazy, I feel blue
I get distracted and then I find
I can barely keep a hold of my mind
Don't you know you've got to shoot from the heart
Or your world might fall apart
Happiness is not an absolute
You need to find what works for you
You might also likeI don't want to hang around
Wasting precious time
I need to get myself up off the ground
And leave my past behind
Time to stand and shout out loud
So you can hear my voice above the clouds
There's no better time than now
I've been around the world and then some
Searching for my peace of mind
But I don't need to look any longer
'Cuz it's all right here inside
But when I am not doing what I should do
I get crazy, I feel blue
I get distracted and then I find
I can barely keep a hold of my mind
Don't you know you've got to shoot from the heart
Or your world might fall apart
Happiness is not an absolute
You need to find what works for you
When I am not doing what I should do
I get crazy, I feel blue
I get distracted and then I find
I can barely keep a hold of my mind
Don't you know I've got to shoot from the heart
Or your world might fall apart
Happiness is not an absolute
You need to work to find the truth
