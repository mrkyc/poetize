Or if I'm just feeling blue
Everyone says, 'Keep your chin up real high'
But I don't know what to do
I've been told there's a lesson to be learned
In everything good and bad
But sometimes it's hard not to feel you've been burned
And it makes you feel way too sad
Some fall to their knees
I'm prone to endlessly pacing
I'm a tree that's losing it's leaves
Guess we'll see what the future might bring
I've been lost, no wind in my sails
And it's all based on faithless fear
But you're like a flower, and your sweetness prevails
And it washes away my tears
So this is how it feels
You can't take one moment for granted
It's a large dose of what's real
And I'm longing to sing once again
Why don't you
Come close to me and let's dance to this waltz
Let's take to the floor and give it our all
Your patience is grand, my spirits are low
Let's whirl all around the unknown
You might also likeWhere to turn, I wish I knew
There is no place to run
I gotta roll up my sleeves, do what I need to do
But it's easier said than done
So I'll keep swimming upstream
I am no different from others
Who have hopes, demons, and dreams
I guess I'll see what the future might bring
Why don't you
Come close to me and let's dance to this waltz
Let's take to the floor and give it our all
Your love is so strong, and I'm not alone
Let's float straight on through the unknown
Why don't you
Some close to me and let's dance to this waltz
Let's take to the floor and give it our all
Your patience is grand, my spirits are low
