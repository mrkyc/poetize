Yesterday I walked a mean street
Looking for a long lost heart beat
Came upon a poor music man just singing
God brought it all together
How we used to play forever
I felt every song I've sung come ringing
You know it's been so long since I felt it in my soul
But from this day on my life is on a roll
If someone stands up just to let the spirit flow
Then a better day is coming
I came home and shared my feeling
You said there's a new world stealing
Open up and let the light just fill us
You know it's been so long since we felt it in our soul
But from this day on our life is on a roll
If we all stand up just to let the spirit flow
Then a better day is coming
There's a world unseen though we know it very well
Where there's harmony that no one can buy and sell
When our voices rise in the innocence of song
Then a better day is coming
You might also likeWe held on through some awful years
We can wait 'til our day appears
You know it's been so long since we felt it in our soul
But from this day on our life is on a roll
If we all stand up just to let the spirit flow
Then a better day is coming
And in this broken world where we have so much to grieve
We must try so hard to believe what we believe
If we keep a dream of how good it all can be
Then a better day is coming
You know it's been so long since I felt it in my soul
But from this day on my life is on a roll
If someone stands up just to let the spirit flow
Then a better day is coming
And in this world of grieving
We must try believing
If we keep our dreams
Then a better day is coming
A better day is coming
Brighter world is dawning
