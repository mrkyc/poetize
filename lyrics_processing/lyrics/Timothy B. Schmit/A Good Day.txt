Don't say a word 'cause I just woke up
I need a little time while I fill my cup
Ain't no use you know I won't engage
But you can try anyway
Later on when I'm feeling right
At the outer edge of the morning light
We can talk about anything you like
Then we can be on our way
I don't know what is in store
But let's just walk right on out that door
When the sun creeps in and the fog rolls out
And the trees stretch up beyond a shadow's doubt
Some make a wish and some like to pray
But everybody just wants to have a good day
The creek outside is an open book
Maybe we should go down and have a look
We could learn the secrets of the universe
And get wet while we try
In the afternoon when we just can't wait
We'll go back inside through the private gate
We'll make love 'til we can't see straight
Then we'll rest our eyes
You might also likeDon't tell me 'cause I don't want to know
Let's just get on with the show
When the sun creeps in and the fog rolls out
And the trees stretch up beyond a shadow's doubt
Some make a wish and some like to pray
But everybody just wants to have a good day
When we're rested up and it's supper time
We can go downstairs, see what we can find
Maybe sip a little table wine
And watch the sunlight fade
So far, so good, it seems to me
I don't think anyone could disagree
Too bad it isn't always this easy
But things don't work that way
Who knows how it's gonna be?
I guess we'll just wait and see
When the sun creeps in and the fog rolls out
And the trees stretch up beyond a shadow's doubt
Some make a wish and some like to pray
But everybody just wants to have a good day
When the sun creeps in and the fog rolls out
And the trees stretch up beyond a shadow's doubt
Some make a wish and some like to pray
But everybody just wants to have a good day
A good day
