I like rolling down the highway and flying on a plane
I've been doing this a while, ever since I don't know when
And I think I'm gonna do it all over again
Well I know it must be hard when I turn around and wave
But it's in my blood and baby I can't stay
Gotta sing another song, gotta pay my dues
I do these things for me and you
Goodbye, my love
Au revoir, so long
I'll be back, I'm here to tell
Adios, fare thee well
You know my heart feels heavy 'cuz this is what I do
But it's light as a feather floating down on you
Goodbye... Bye bye
This living from a suitcase is okay, still
Every now and then it tries to break my will
It's another show tonight, it's another shade of blue
And I can't keep from thinking 'bout you
Goodbye, my love
Au revoir, so long
I'll be back, I'm here to tell
Adios, fare thee well
That 'ol road, it beckons and I feel brand new
Got a first class ticket with a bird's eye view
Goodbye... Bye bye
You might also likeI like the feel of wind and rain right up against my face
As I move on down that road
And I wonder how you are and if you're warm and safe
It won't be ltoo long 'til
I'll be back home
I wanna do my best, wanna be a good man
And keep on goin', gotta do it while I can
But baby don't you worry, be back another day
But until then you'll hear me say
Goodbye, my love
Au revoir, so long
I'll be back, I'm here to tell
Adios, fare thee well
It's a big wide world, and I'm an open book
Gotta pack my things for another look
