I could never tell you how to make your next move
But, sometimes I forget and try
Leaving myself open to your alibis
There ain't nothin' that I can do or say
But, it's so hard to stay out of your way
I wish I could sleep the whole night through
And never be disturbed with all these thoughts about you
I know it's crazy, this hope that you might find
Another way of living just for my peace of mind
I don't want to play God and proclaim what is right
But I still wonder where you are tonight
'Cuz you're so wild
You're on fire... like a Devil
I must let go
'Cuz I can't change your world
I think I'll go sit under a tree
Take a good look at myself and try to let things be
Just know that my love for you is here
It's wrapped around my heart and sealed up with a tear
It's time that we put an end to this fight
And I need to step back, I just hope you're all right
You might also like'Cuz you're so wild
You're on fire... like a Devil
I'm so tired out
But I can't change your world
Once it was hard just to get through a day
I was a sight to behold
But now I can live in a dignified way
You might even see me smile
Even though you're so wild
I've got things I have to do
You could never tell me how to make my next move
So I wonder, how could I be so bold
As to ever think that I might have one ounce of control?
There ain't nothin' that I can do or say
But, it's so hard to stay out of your way
'Cuz you're so wild
You're on fire
And I need to let go
You're so wild
You're on fire... like a Devil
And I'm so tired out
