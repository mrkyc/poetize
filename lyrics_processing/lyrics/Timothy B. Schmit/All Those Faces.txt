I've been around the block
I meet people, all those faces
But someday I'll stop
Not that I want to, but I see now
All things do change
Father time, he marches onward
And nothing stays the same
I have seen a magic carpet
I have taken flight
I just hang on to the edges
And sail through the night
It's so easy with a tailwind
But it's not always so
Comes a storm then crash landing
That's the way it goes
I'm glad I'm not alone
Dealing with these mysteries
It's a constant ebb and flow
A struggle to be free
Kick your boots off
Take a leap of faith
Let's be on our way
Don't forget to wave
I'm in training
Living out my life
It is quite a ride
I like you by my side...
Please stay
You might also likeHave you ever seen a baby
Look into your yes
There is nothing quite like it
So young, so wise
In the distance there's a meadow
So green and fine
It takes a while to finally get there
But it's worth the time
See that rising moon
Longing to touch the sky
In the endless rendezvous
You can almost hear a sigh
Kick you boots off
Take a leap of faith
Let's be on our way
Don't forget to wave
I'm in training
Living out my life
It is quite a ride
I like you by my side...
Please stay
Lay it all out on the table
I'll stand my ground
Then lift me up to higher places
And I won't look down
We are all in this together
But we forget
In this world with all those faces
So much regret
It's time to plant the seeds
No use in turning back
Love's a simple, basic need
And we all need to know that
Kick your boots off
Take a leap of faith
Let's be on our way
Don't forget to wave
I'm in training
Living out my life
It is quite a ride
I like you by my side...
