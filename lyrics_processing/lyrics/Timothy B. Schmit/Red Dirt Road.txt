Not long ago
When we could just up and fly away?
Now things are different
Now we must plan
We do our work before we play
That clear, blue green water
Will soon be in sight
We'll take as long as it may take
'Cuz we have each other
And it's only right
That we persevere for goodness sake
Right now we sow those seeds
But oh my, just wait and see (When we)
Get on down that mountain side
Take the red dirt road
When you reach that water then you'll know
You don't need no diamond ring
You don't need no clothes
When you walk on down that red dirt road
You might also likeI'm only human
I'm just a man
I seek contentment when I can
So when I am weary
Head in my hand
I think about my earthly promise land
I'd like to cut to the chase
But I know we've got to wait ('till we)
Get on down that mountain side
Take the red dirt road
When you reach that water then you'll know
You don't need no diamond ring
You don't need no clothes
When you walk on down that red dirt road
It won't be quite the same
Once we were young and wild
But one thing will never change
It's that burning in our hearts
You know it's been there from the start
Right now we sow those seeds
But oh my, just wait and see (til' we)
Get on down that mountain side
Take the red dirt road
When you reach that water then you'll know
You don't need no diamond ring
You don't need no clothes
When you walk on down that red dirt road
You don't need a single thing
Just get up and go
There's a rainbow down that red dirt road
When you walk on down that red dirt road
