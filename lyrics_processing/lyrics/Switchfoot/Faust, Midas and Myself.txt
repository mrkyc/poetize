This one's about a dream I had last night
How an old man tracked me home and stepped inside
Put his foot inside the door and gave a crooked smile
Something in his eyes, something in his laugh
Something in his voice that made my skin crawl off
He said, "I've seen you here before
I know your name
Yeah, you could have your pick of pretty things
You could have it all, everything at once
Everything you've seen
Everything you'll need
Everything you've ever had in fantasies"

You've one life, you've one life
You've one life left to leave
You've one life, you've one life
You've one life left to leave

I woke up from my dream as a golden man
With a girl I've never seen with golden skin
I jumped up to my feet, and she asked me what was wrong
And I began to scream, "I don't think this is me
Is this just a dream or really happening?"

What direction, what direction?
What direction, what direction?
I'm splitting up, I'm splitting up
This is my personal disaffection
What direction, what direction?
What direction now?

I looked outside the glass at golden shores
With golden ships and masts with golden cords
As my reflection passed, I hated what I saw
My golden eyes were dead
And a thought passed through my head
A heart that's made of gold can't really beat at all

I wanted to wake up again
I wanted to wake up again
Without a touch of gold
Without a touch of gold
What direction, what direction, what direction?
What direction, what direction, what direction?
Death or action
Life begins at the intersection
What direction, what direction?
What direction now?

I woke up as before, but the gold was gone
My wife was at the door with her night robe on
My heart beat once or twice, and life flooded my veins
Everything had changed
My lungs had found their voice
And what was once routine was now the perfect joy

You've one life, you've one life
You've one life left to lead
You've one life, you've one life
