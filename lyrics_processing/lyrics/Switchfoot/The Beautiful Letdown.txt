It was a beautiful letdown
When I crashed and burned
When I found myself alone unknown and hurt
It was a beautiful letdown
The day I knew
That all the riches this world had to offer me
Would never do

In a world full of bitter pain and bitter doubts
I was trying so hard to fit in, fit in
Until I found out

That I don't belong here (I don't belong)
I don't belong here (I don't belong)
I will carry a cross and a song where I don't belong (I don't belong)
I don't belong

It was a beautiful letdown
When you found me here
Yeah, for once in a rare blue moon
I see everything clear
I'll be a beautiful let down
That's what I'll forever be
And though it may cost my soul
I'll sing for free

We're still chasing our tails and the rising sun
And our dark water planet's
Still spinning in a race
Where no one wins and no one's won

See, I don't belong here (I don't belong)
I don't belong here (I don't belong)
I will carry a cross and a song where I don't belong (I don't belong)
I don't belong
I don't belong here (I don't belong)
I don't belong here (I don't belong)

I'm gonna set sight and set sail for the kingdom come
Kingdom come
Your kingdom come (I don't belong)
Won't you let me down yeah
Let my foolish pride
Forever let me down

Easy living, you're not much like your name
Easy dying
Hey, you look just about the same
Won't you please take me off your list
Easy living, please come on and let me down
We are a beautiful letdown
Painfully uncool
The church of the dropouts
The losers, the sinners, the failures and the fools
Oh, what a beautiful letdown
Are we salt in the wound?
Hey, let us sing one true tune
Yeah

I don't belong here (I don't belong)
No, I don't belong here (I don't belong)
No, I don't belong here (I don't belong)
Feels like I don't belong here, yeah (I don't belong)
I don't belong here (I don't belong)
Goes like I don't belong here (I don't belong)
No, I don't belong-long-long-long (I don't belong, I don't belong)
Would you let me down (I don't belong)
Come on and let me down (I don't belong)
You always let me down (I don't belong)
So glad that I'm let down, yeah (I don't belong, I don't belong)
Come on and let me down (I don't belong)
'Cause I don't belong here
