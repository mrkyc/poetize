I don't like to admit
When I'm wrong and need gifts
Of forgiveness instead of applause
I was dying to prove to myself I could make it alone
Hah, yeah
It took years to confess
That Your love was the best
At unraveling all of my pride
Had to laugh at myself when I realized that You were my home

Give me the strength to let go
Give me the strength to surrender
Give me the strength to stop holding on
I've been holding on so long
Give me the strength to let go
And show me the way to come home
And show me the way to come home

Yeah, I'm stubborn and bold
But sometimes it gets old
Fighting voices inside of my brain
I was trying to pretend I was fine when inside it was war
With the stumbling beat
Of my heart and my feet
And the faults of my failures and pains
To think all of this time, I had wings that were ready to soar

Give me the strength to let go
Give me the strength to surrender
Give me the strength to stop holding on
I've been holding on so long
Give me the strength to let go
And show me the way to come home
And show me the way to come home

Oh Love, light the way home
Light up my soul, I choose mercy instead of control
My life is on loan, forgive and let go
I embrace a belief I don't know
What a beautiful sound, to lay your life down
Your forgiveness is where I am found
Here in Your arms, I finally let down
I am lightning and You are the ground
I am lightning and You are the ground

Give me the strength to let go
Won't You give me the faith to surrender?
Come on, give me the strength to stop holding on
I've been holding on so long
Won't You give me the strength to let go?
And show me the way to come home
(I am lightning and You are the ground)
Won't you show me the way to come home?
(I am lightning and You are the ground)
