In the cold she would hold him and sing a song
Sweet little Anna, singing her sad, sad song
To her beautiful boy that giggled so sweet
The days went by until one little night
With this one little moon hanging in its black
Sweet little Anna, whispered her goodnight song
In the ear of the boy who giggled so sweet
"My baby, my beauty, my boy, my baby
What is your favourite song of all songs?
Sweet baby, my love, my darling, my baby
Forever your rosy little lips won't turn blue
I won't let nights hurt you, I won't let them take you
Take my hand and we'll run up that tree
I won't let days hurt you, I won't let them break you
If so, my little heart will die
If so, my tears will freeze and turn grey"
He just stared in her hardworking arms
His rosy little lips had turned blue
Sweet little Anna, chanted her goodnight song
For her beautiful boy that giggled so sweet
"My baby, my beauty, my boy, my baby
What is your favourite song of all songs?
Sweet baby, my love, my darling, my baby
Forever your rosy little lips won't turn blue"

Frozen grey tears glanced on her cheek
And the goodnight song she never stopped singing
Danced from her lips down the dark grey street
"My baby, my beauty, my boy, my baby
What is your favourite song of all songs?
Sweet baby, my love, my darling, my baby
Forever your rosy little lips won't turn blue
I won't let nights hurt you, I won't let them take you
Take my hand and we'll run up that tree
I won't let days hurt you, I won't let them break you
If so, my little heart will die
