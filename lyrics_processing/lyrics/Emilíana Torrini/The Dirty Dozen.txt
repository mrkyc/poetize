And shake yo shimmy like i'm shakin' mine
You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast
If you can't shake the shimmy, shake it yes yes yes
And you'sa dirty mistreatin' robber and a-cheatin'
Strip you in a desert and you pop ain't yo cousin
And you mama do the lordylord
You're to go with pop and runnin' round the field
Slippin' and a-slidin' like an automobile
I hollared at poppa and told him to wait
He slipped away from me just like a cadillac snake
'Cause he's a rotten mistreater, robber and a cheater
Slip you with a dozen, yo pop ain't yo cousin'
And you mama do the lordylord!
Now i liked yo uncle, liked yo brother too
I did like yo papa but yo papa wouldn't do
I met yo' daddy on the carn the other day
You know about that 'cause he was funny that way
'Cause he's a funny mistreater, robber and a cheater
Strip you in a dozen, yo pop is yo cousin
Yo mama do the lordylord!

Wasn't satisfied until he made him a snout
Made him a snout just as long as a rail
Wasn't satisfied until he made him a tail
Made him a tail just to find the flies
Wasn't satisfied until he made him some eyes
Made him some eyes just to look on the grass
He wasn't satisfied until he made his yes-yes
Made his yes-yes-yes, did he get fixed
He wasn't satisfied until he made him sick
He made him sick, oh lord, he made him well
You know about that 'cause the elephant cried out
He's a funny mistreater, robber and a cheater
Strip you in a dozen, yo pop is yo cousin
Yo maaaaaama do the loooooordylooooord!
