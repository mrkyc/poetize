Hey, I'm in love
My fingers keep on clickin' to the beatin' of my heart
Hey, I can't stop my feet
Ebony and ivory and dancin' in the street
Hey, it's 'cause of you
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue

My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
But a doong ka doong ka doong doong doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka do ka do goong ka do ka roo ka doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum

Man, you got me burnin'
I'm the moment between the strikin' and the fire
Hey, read my lips
Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
No, it will never stop
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love

My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka doong ka doong ka do ka do ka doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka do ka do ko koo ka do ka do ka do ka doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rrrrroong doong do rroong koong koong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
