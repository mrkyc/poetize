Conrad Murray: I don't feel guilty, because I did not do anything wrong,I am very very sorry for the loss of Michael, Michael is a personal friend, I.. It is heartfelt, this has been painful

He's a mad man
Where the fuck did you get your license son
Dr. Murray how could you, the King of Pop
What is wrong with you son
Now your life is done
Now your 
That's right four years
He didn't really have your back
All he wanted was your money everybody knew that 
He didn't even have your best interest
All he wanted was your money to build up his interest 
A careless doctor 
A doctor who could care less when your body is lifeless 
No matter how big or small
Ended by drowning in Propofol 
Now the King of Pop is gone 
Because he ended up in hands that was wrong
Dr. Murray I hope your time is long
Bend over and get this open get the ding dong 
That is what happens to people where you are at
Ding dongs come skinny and fat 
Dr. Murray what if your heart stopped
Just like the King of Pop
You might also like
Yo Mike we miss you G
It all stopped when your heart stopped
Yo Mike we miss you G
It all stopped when your heart stopped
I don't know where you got your license kid 
Did you get it on the back of the box 
I wonder how it feels Dr. Murray listening to them jail locks 
Who gave you permission to practice
The mistakes you made adds up to 
Michael Jackson was a flower 
Came in to full bloom and came into power ]
He became bigger than The Beatles 
Then Conrad comes poking him with needles 
Knowing that the man was weak
Michael Jackson didn't know he was getting a geek 
As a motherfucking doctor
All this guy had was needles and a knife
So Conrad Murray I just want to know how is your life
Now motherfucker

Yo Mike we miss you G
Yo Mike we miss you G
It all stopped when your heart stopped
Yo Mike we miss you G
It all stopped when your heart stopped
Going out to the King of Pop, yo Michael Jackson we miss you G
But that is alright you know what I am saying
But you know what, we know you still here, the King of Pop is always going to always be here
You know what I am saying Michael Jackson G
