Who tends to indulge a little
While on their coffee break
(Intro Verse)
Ok my coffee break is me time, basically that's weed time
My co-worker man she's fine, walks by I beeline
In pursuit with no deny I'm on that ass like Levi's
I told my boss to fuck off, middle finger no peace sign (bitch)
(Verse 1)
Break time, so break that down
Roll it up go head pass that around
Light it up till they passing out
Flow is rough, go head ask about
Rip up tracks, lap around
Laugh about how we macking now
My herbals out here by the pound
Are loud as fuck bitch how that sound?
Drugs out here like gold
I'm representing my home
Marietta I am so blown
So don't let me get in my zone
She's reluctant of my brand, you know these dudes in bands
I like my women like my coffee though, sweet and tan
Shawty, ugh, yup she's falling for it
Jumped on train yup all aboard
I Spit slick like olive oil
But she don't spit she swallow all
She got me
Heart is beating like Rocky
And I fell in love just stop me
Wait that's probably all of this molly
I need some water; I think I took too much
So somebody call a doctor, I think my heart just stop
But check out my roster, and no this isn't luck
I like my woman like my coffee, hot as fuck

Break time, so break it down
Make time, make you bounce
Take mine, go head make my rounds
Cake time lets make these pounds
Shake down, get you out
Fuck that skirt, loose that blouse
8 times, I think it went down
Wait 9... I lost count
Ok, ill admit I'm in a daze
When the last couple days been a haze
When I blazed everything in my way
Like a rat in a maze and I made it out now bitch I'm amazed
Often baked on my coffee break
Often late when I contemplate
Your talk is great but it's awkwardly
Marvin Gaye, no chardonnay
I'm Back at it with a flow so sick
Sick as fuck they don't hope I live
Wordsmith you better hope I miss
I'm high as fuck ayo co pilot
Woodstock like Joan Biaz
Count me out well they so biased
Sleeping on me how dope I is
Fuck all ya'll (Hold My Dick)
Run and tell yo how I kill these beats
They love me up in languages that I don't even speak
Ok she was so intrigued I think she's form Belize
So yes you can believe she was screaming (hi papi)
And though it was intense I ain't spoken to her sense
She even told her friends around me to watch her step
But yo
I'm dressed up to the 9's and She's looking like a 10
