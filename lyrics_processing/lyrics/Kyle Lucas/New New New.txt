Whatever
It's the new new new... new, new
Yeah
Okay now just give me a moment
Gimme a second, I think I'm zonin'
And I reckon that this record I've been wreckin's takin' motion
See I'm reckless with this rappin' shit, I leave 'em so devoted
But it seems I've been demoted, they ain't checkin' for me? Hold up
Really no opposition, when I killed the competition
And I should charge admission but let's face it
Costs have risen through the roof so subsequently making CDs obsolete
And they settle for MP3's, that I give 'em out for free
In return, I hope they show up to my shows, I charge a fee
Cause shit I gotta eat, and yo that rent is due next week
Life gets frustratin', I vent up on these beats
And I'm prayin' to God he's listening, and if not I keep on bitchin'
And I got a lot of problems, and I spell 'em all out
I've been to hell and back and I don't think I'm settlin' down
I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm runnin' through this money
And lately I've been fuckin' chicks who only show up on the runway
Okay that's not a problem I just thought that would be funny
If it's on my list of problems, then the rest of them are mundane
My liver fuckin' hates me, my kidneys do too
I've been eatin' pharmaceuticals like fuckin' Fruit Loops
And I find it hard to sleep at night because my heart hurts
Not figuratively, literally it's been beatin' out my shirt
They tell me to be original when originally I was ridiculed
Problems seem so minuscule when you're little now they tend to grow
Rappers, they ain't askin' me to jump up on their songs
Probably cause I murder every feature that I'm on
Or probably cause I beat the beat into a bloody pulp
I just write down what I'm thinkin' and just watch it all unfold
Some MC's kept on dissin' me so instead I took the high road
Rolled a couple trees and burned 'em down like a pyro
How's it feel to be a hater?
And I hope you think about me every single day you wake up
And prayin' I get dropped, suffer a pay cut
You hopin' we don't pop, and Vonnegutt breaks up
Well Biggie's got our back
And I know it gets you mad
While you just sittin' there
Actin' all sad, crossin' your fingers
Hopin' we pass
Purple Ribbon, I've been sittin'
Killin' a flow, breakin' a mold
And Sugar Tongue inducted me so now I'm shoutin' "Go"
Favorite gentleman, see I've been a threat
My penmanship's like venom
I just chew on beats like medicine
I'm a self-made, I'mma stress 'em in
Want an upgrade? well I'll help you then
You must say, fuck you then
I don't give a fuck I guess it's us against them
And that's the way that I prefer
I'm comin' out my show, no longer spittin' reserve
Got 'em hangin' from the rafters
Leavin' chandelier in shambles
I dismantle what you handle
I'm like cannabis in a cannibal
You might also likeI just fucked up, hold on lemme bring it back
Okay I'm finna blackout on the track it's like I'm Pacquiao
And I pull my pen and I leave 'em dead like I'm finna take the trash out
I'm way too versatile, too agile
Just gimme a beat, I chew it up, and need to spit it back out
And you can find me weedin' see that's needed just to pass out
If that shit's a secret, then I leaked it, guess the cat's out
The bag, my bad, I mean I'm finna lash out
On anybody that's comin' for me
I take out their whole company
Cause my regime, that's somethin' to me
It's like undefeated to some degree
I'm hot like summer, it's gonna be
GA South, it runs in me
I'm way too thirsty, and too parched
Got a Purple Ribbon, and a purple heart
I'd die for my team, who tryna start?
Set my scope on my mark
No more hope, it's time to part
We thinkin', need a green light
Just to murder all these beats right
And I'm silenced and my rivals know my mic is like a rifle
