(Hook)
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
Lord I feel like it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world
(Verse 1)
Yo, I'm sitting sipping beer that's imported, appears that's important
To me that's still the finer things its weird if I forced it
I'm really not that fancy, got some wine up in my pantry
I'd rather be out camping with my friends sipping vodka from canteen
That's what u can't see, they only think its screaming fans by the stampede
If this rapping doesn't pan out I need a plan B
Man I should probably finish school and get this damn degree
I got like 3 more classes; I think I'm putting off
Subconsciously it's my way of never growing up
I'm hoping that my dreams come true, I'm holding out
But then, well my little sister just bought a house
Don't get me wrong, I more than proud
Life isn't a race, we just at a different pace
And I'm even on the fence of going letting this song out
So if your hearing it now I tore that fence down, I guess
(Hook)

Yo I made a promise to myself that if I ever saw fame
I'd never let it change me, I would never stray
From who I was and what I love, treat my friends the same
The irony came though they start to act strange
My best friend Kahle stopped returning my calls
I mean it's been like 10 months dog I don't know the cause
Keep on reaching out but he just never responds
I guess people grow up grow apart and move on
But I've known him since 3rd grade, back when we were yay tall
Afternoon after school everyday play ball
I wish I could rewind time and press pause
Appreciate the moments more before they all gone
If you ever hear this song, I hope you don't take it wrong
It's really just a letter to let u know you not alone
Brother from another, man we damn near clones
And if you going through some shit well homie pick up the phone
Because I'm here
(Hook)
(Verse 3)
Ya, so go and listen to the rainfall, maybe it'll save all
Wash away our sins, when we plagued by these thoughts
And it drowns all the evil modern day Noah's ark
See my mind tends to roam down some dark roads
Like why Rapists getting 8yrs be out up in 5?
Meanwhile drug dealers getting damn near life
All this Injustice in the system, but fuck it I can't fix it
I'ma sit up on a porch light a blunt an' get lifted
If its not one thing its another
I start to see success yet upsetting my mother
She says its so disgusting all the topics I'm discussing
And these tales of ex lover's and these songs with no substance
Except for these excerpts of all my substance abuse
Says she's so worried and she can't get through
I love Mom; I promise I'm ok
We all got our problems but mine they on display
With these issues of my generation deals on a daily basis
I'ma be the one to help them breathe ventilation
This song ain't got no concept, its really just stream of conscience
Finding out my path in life somebody pass the compass
