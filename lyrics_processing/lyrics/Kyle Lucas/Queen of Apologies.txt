So honestly, is this how it's gonna be?
Tell me who's the enemy
I want a hot little emo chick with gauged ears
Tattoos on her wrists, dyed jet black hair
I wanna do shit to her and it would probably be wrong
If I even talked about it in a song, oh, fuck it
I wanna tie her up, get a scarf and blindfold her up
Light the candle and watch as the wax drips up and down her back, yeah
It's no secret to me that she's my equal and she's my match
When I untie her, she escapes
It's like an animal how she attacks
Show her brown eyes, bring that back
Fuck that shit man I'm over that
These are the chicks, man, they can't fuck
Compared to you, ain't no lookin' back
It's like a track and I've been racin' for the finish line
Sometimes I've been racin' out my mind
And then I found her and my heartbeat louder
I surrendered all power, fell in love within the hour
See, she hates rap like rock 'n' roll
That's how I rock for sho'
Suicide girl ride a shotgun baby
Girl go 'head and lock 'n' load

I'm the Queen of Apologies
And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling
Will it ever stop, ever stop?
I keep trying
Yo, hear I go again
I'm tryna get over her
I'm tryna stomach all the thoughts of seein' her with someone else
Tryna pick up all the parts, tryna glue 'em back together
Just to see if they resemble what we share together
And that is all, now it seem she only call
When she's tryna buy some Adderall
No problems get resolved
Now it seems all our memories dissolve like salt
And I'm sittin' tryna recall these thoughts that I've lost
But I'm gone, I'm faded, somebody please save me
See, I thought I fell in love, I just tripped on the pavement
And now I'm sittin' in the midst of piled dishes and beer bottles
Attemptin' to mask the fact it seems I appear hollow, and yeah
I got other problems, but she's the source of my sorrow
She's El Diablo with the body of a model
And tomorrow she'll appear at my door with a bottle of Chard'
And an apology, I'll take her back, obviously
How'd you knock me off my feet?
I'm the Queen of Apologies
And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling
Will it ever stop, ever stop?
I keep trying
And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling
