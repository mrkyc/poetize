And i feel the same way, babe i'm with that
So i bought her a drink, she laughed
That's when her smile went and hit me like a kickback
5'5" with my brown eyes
Dark brown hair and some faded highlights
Sucker for brunettes so I'm thinkin' oh my
That this is the finest girl that I've seen in my life
Bar to the car, car to the hotel
Hotel lobby, way too social
Lobby to the room, key to the door
Open the door, clothes to the floor
Floor to the shower, shower to the bed
Her boyfriend called so i made an exit
Left my jacket but i ain't stressed that
Besides, relationships are set backs
I'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry it's like this
I'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry we do this
(x2)

It seems she's had enough of me
Wonderin' how she got stuck with me
Then she goes and breaks up with me
And i stress gain weight like Queen Latif'
I know i said i'd never fall in love again
I can't help it, it's like a daily event
See a girl walk by, eyein' her set
Say my name, "Hi!", off to the bed
My name's Kyle, i'm a Sagittarius
I got a smile you can barely miss
And i'm single baby, never marriage
I got enough problems, ask my therapist
This is how things often start
My conversation's probably best in the dark
Or how quick words can turn to bite barks
I walk out the door, took a piece of her heart
I'm sorry
You might also likeI'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry it's like this
I'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry we do this

Life's lookin' like a party and i'm not on the list
At a glimpse, i'm the shit
Underneath, i'm a mess
I'm my own worst enemy and she keeps tellin' me
These pocketful of felonies is gon' get the best of me
Fallin' in love is basic
Fallin' out's so overrated
Now i go and then i pick and choose
When i break shit off
Makeshift relationships have taken a toll
Not on my mind, more on my soul
More on my rhyme, probably 'cause
Every time that i go and write a line, i fold
Drunk dialin's my worst feature
Now she thinks that i need her
My music's coming through her speakers
All this reverb is gon' deceive her
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry it's like this
I'm sorry, too sorry
I'm sorry we do this
