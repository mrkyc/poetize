(Hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo, hoo-hoo)

Hey girl
Now I know you've been waitin' for me
Much too long
But I got caught up in traffic
One turn I made was wrong
You see the DJ on the radio
Was playin' our song
And I was reminiscing
Of the day that passed and gone

Oh, I just
Baby, I got carried away
(Carried away) Mmmhmm
(Carried away)

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
My mind was filled with thoughts
Sweet thoughts of yesterday
Of a time when you took my hand
And made me feel just like a man
Of a time when you took a-hold
And thrilled my very soul
You might also like
Oh, I just
Baby, I got carried away
(Carried away) Mmmhmm
(Carried away)

Two-ninety-four
Said the highway sign
I should be home by now
Home just in time
To lay her down to sleep
And pray to the Lord her soul to keep
'Cause I love her, love her
Love her, mmhmm

By the time I got started
In the right direction
The DJ on the radio
Was playin' another selection
But our song
Was still on my mind
Memories lingered on
Of how you have been so kind
Oh, I just
Baby, I
I got carried away
(Carried away) Mmmhmm
(Carried away)

Thinkin' about the times
When you were so good to me

Oh, I just
Baby, I got carried away
(Carried away) Sweet baby
(Carried away)
(Carried away) And before I knew it
(Carried away)

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
And I was wonderin'
Would you believe me when I say

Oh, I just
Baby, I got carried away
(Carried away) Mmmhmm
(Carried away)
(Carried away) Baby
(Carried away) I got carried away
(Carried away) I couldn't help it
(Carried away) Oh, I just, mmm
