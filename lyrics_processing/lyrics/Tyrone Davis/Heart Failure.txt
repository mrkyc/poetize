Seems your love for me
Has depreciated
And a distance between the two of us
Somehow has been created
But I've been lovin' you too long now
To love somebody new
And it would take more than I got, girl
To say that we are through

It's just (Heart failure)
Oh, can't you see?
It's just (Heart failure)
But I've got the real McGee
It's just heart failure
All I need is you
All you need is me

Now in most cases
This could prove to be fatal
And it's merely a sign that our love is dying
But all we gotta do
Is put more faith in each other
And through times and bad times
We gotta keep on tryin'
You might also like
It's just (Heart failure)
Woo-wee
It's just (Heart failure)
But I've got the real McGee
It's just heart failure
All I need is you
All you need is me

(What does) What does it take?
(It take) To make you see
(To make you see) Woah, baby
(That I) That I
(Need you) Really need you
Just as much as you need me
Oh-ho

It's just (Heart failure)
Woo-wee
It's just (Heart failure)
But I've got the real McGee
It's just heart failure
All I need is you
All you need is me, yeah
Baby
(All I need is you) All I need
(All you need is me) All I need is you
(All I need is you) And all you need is me
(All you need is me) Baby
Oh, baby
It ain't nothin' but a heart failure
(All I need is you) All I need
(All you need is me) Is you, baby
(All I need is you) I need you, you need me
Can't you see? (All you need is me)
We could be in ectasy, ha
(All I need is you) Say you will, but you won't
Say you do, and then you don't (All you need is me)
Need you, baby
Oh, baby (All I need is you)
Let's stay together
(All you need is me) All I need is you
(All I need is you) Well
(All you need is me) All you need is me
(All I need is you) Well, baby
(All you need is me) It ain't nothin' but a heart failure
(All I need is you) Can't you see?
(All you need is me) Oh, baby
(All I need is you) All you need is me
(All you need is me) And all I need is you
(All I need is you) So let's stay together
(All you need is me)
