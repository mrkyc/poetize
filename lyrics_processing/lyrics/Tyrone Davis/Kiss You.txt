Hey baby, I know I'm gonna miss you
But don't worry 'bout it
I'll be back soon
And when I get back

I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' squeeze you, girl and tease you

Oh, when I go on my business trips
And leave you lyin' there all alone (I don't like it)
The only thing I can think of, baby
Is comin' back home, ooh-wee
I can see you standin' there, yeah
And that pretty pink negligee (Lookin' good)
I start to smile, 'cause i know right then
It's gonna be a lovely day, yeah

I wish I could be home twenty-four hours a day
We both know the bills have got to be paid
Now when I get home, there won't be much talkin'
I'm gonna let my tongue do the walkin'
You might also like
I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' squeeze you, girl, and tease you
I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' hold you and console you
Well

Oh, sometime when the ladies approach me
I notice that they soon turn away
All I do is talk about you, baby
They don't have have much to say, no (Stop talkin')
I got all the woman I need in you
I don't have to search no more
But keep on lovin' me like you doin', baby
And I'll never-never-never get bored, no

I wish I could be home twenty-four hours a day
We both know the bills have got to be paid
Now when I get home, there won't be much talkin'
I'm gonna let my tongue do the walkin'

I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' squeeze you, girl, and tease you
I'm gon' kiss you where I miss you
I'm gon' hold you and console you, mmm
(Kiss you where I miss you)
I might kiss you behind your ear
(Squeeze you, girl, and tease you)
Ooh, I might bend over and kiss you right here
(Kiss you where I miss you)
I'm gonna kiss you behind your neck
(Hold you and console you)
Ooh, I might bend over and kiss you right between your
(Kiss you where I miss you)
I'm gon' kiss you where i miss you
(Squeeze you, girl, and tease you)
Kiss you here, kiss you there
(Kiss you where I miss you)
Oh, I'm gon' kiss you everywhere
(Hold you and console you)
Miss you, baby, miss you, baby
(Kiss you where I miss you)
(Squeeze you, girl, and tease you)
(Kiss you where I miss you)
