Hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo

You better
Turn it loose
You better
Turn it loose

I went downtown the other day
I heard a woman say
"I do all I can for that man
At home, he still won't stay"
I could tell the way
That woman spoke
Her heart was truly broke
She said
"If a man can't treat his woman right
Give her good lovin' day and night
He sure oughta"

Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
You might also like
When you need your man to be satisfied
But he tells you "No"
With no reason why
You will finally find out for yourself
There ain't no love
Between the two of you left

Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)

When you try as hard as you can
To do what you think is right
And still, you get that same old cold shoulder
Ooh, that same old shoulder
Late at night, night, late at night
Here's what you do

Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
When you've done all you can do
Give it up
When you see it just ain't no use
Turn it loose

Way late at night
When you layin' down
And you need some huggin'
But no one's around
You'll walk around all day long
With love on your mind
You're thinking about the love
That you just get sometimes

Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)

When you have someone
Sitting there by your side
And there ain't no company at all
All you need is a little lovin' touch
And when you don't get it
Ooh, it hurts you so much
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)
Give it up
Turn it loose (Turn it a-loose)

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up, baby
