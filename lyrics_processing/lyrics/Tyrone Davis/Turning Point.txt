Ha-ha

Sure lover, sweet thing
I've reached the I've reached the turning point in my life
I've reached the turning point
Lord-Lord-Lord, in my life

I used to stay out all night long
Used to do a whole lot of wrong
And I don't know where I would a-end up
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said that sweet thing hadn't come along

No more running around for me
Finally settling down
I've reached the I've reached the turning point
(I've reached the turning point) In my life
(Mmmhmm-mmmhmm-mmmhmm)
I've reached the turning point
Lord-Lord-Lord, in my life (Mmmhmm-mmmhmm)

I met a girl
She's one out of a hundred and ten
And she don't get exited, no-no
By those slick talking men
She's a wiz around the house
Neat as a pin
If I got a hole in my sock, got a hole in my shirt
Sweet thing, she'll mend
You might also like
No more staying out late for me
No more narrow escapes
I've reached the turning point
(I've reached the turning point) In my life
(Mmmhmm-mmmhmm-mmmhmm)
I've reached the turning point
(I've reached the turning point)
Lord-Lord-Lord, in my life (Mmmhmm-mmmhmm)
Listen to you

(Do-do-doop) Yeah
(Do-do-doop) Sure lover
(Do-do-doop) Sweet thing
(Do-do-doop) Oh, I love you
No more running around for me
Finally settling down

I've reached the turning point
(I've reached the turning point) In my life
(Mmmhmm-mmmhmm-mmmhmm)
I've reached the turning point
Lord-Lord-Lord, in my life (Mmmhmm-mmmhmm)
Said I don't know where I would end up
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said that sweet thing hadn't come along
That I might have been locked up, yeah
(I've reached the turning point in my life)
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said I might have been insane out of my mind
(I've reached the turning point in my life)
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said that sweet thing, and come along, look
(I've reached the turning point in my life)
Said I might have been have been down
On skid row, I don't know
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
(I've reached the turning point)

(Do-do-doop) Yeah
(Do-do-doop) Sure lover
(Do-do-doop) Sweet thing

Said I might have been in jail, y'all
(I've reached the turning point)
If that sweet thing hadn't come along
Said that sweet thing hadn't come along
