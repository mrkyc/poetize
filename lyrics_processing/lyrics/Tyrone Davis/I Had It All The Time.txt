There must be something that I'm missin'
But is it something that she's got, oh baby
Ladies and gentlemen, flying in to Chicago's
O'Hare airport, please fasten your seatbelts
And observe the "no smoking" signal
Until you all inside the terminal, thank you
(Flight 101, to Burcheskburg or Pittsburgh)
Hello, huh?
Yes, this is Tryone
Now please, don't hang up the phone
You see, I came all the way back here
To say to you baby, I'm sorry
And if my lovin' mean anything at all to you
I just wanna tell you I've change
I mean, I'm a brand new me, oh baby yeah
I'm ready to crawl
You see, I don't know what it is you got
But whatever it is, without it, I'm a lonely man
You see baby, ever since I've been away
I've had a lot of time to think
A lot of time to reminisce
About all the good things about you
Oh yeah, I had date or two
But what do that mean, you know?
They could never take the place of you
And you see baby, what I was tryin' to find
You had it in you all the time
But baby, listen I'm gonna say goodbye, but not for long
Just for the time to take a cab to get me home
You might also like
Here they go, the same two feet
Walkin' back down that one way street
Here goes this heart of mine
It say "you've got to get her back one more time"
I keep tellin' myself that I don't want you no more
But everyday of my life, I have to knock up on your door
And that's let's me know what I've been tryin' to find
I had it all the time

You see, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, baby
Oh, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe

Oh, here goes these two eyes of mine
They long to see you one more time
My lips wants to kiss you
My arms can't resist you
I swallow my pride to tell you how much I miss you, you see

I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe
I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe
And what I was out there tryin' to find
I had it all the time
I said what I was out there tryin' to find
Oh baby, I had it all the time

(I can't stop feeling this way about you)
(I can't stop feeling this way about you)

Oh, I went out on other dates
And I found I made a mistake
You see, somethin' was missin'
It wasn't you that I was kissin'
Right in another's arms, I found myself reminiscin'
And that let me know what I was tryin' to find
I had it all the time
I said that let me know what I was tryin' to find
Oh baby, I had it all the time

You see, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, baby
I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe
Girl, I'm comin' on home
(I can't stop feeling this way about you)
I've got to see you one more time, baby
(I can't stop feeling this way about you)
I'm comin', I'm comin', oh baby
(I can't stop feeling this way about you)

I've got to love you, come on
(I can't stop feeling this way about you)
