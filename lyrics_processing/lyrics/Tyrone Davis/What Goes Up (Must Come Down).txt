I left you, oh have mercy
Without a saying or dime
With five little hungry babies
All in one room, cryin'
I thought I was so hip (A big man)
A big man out in the world, yeah
I thought there was only two things in life to live for
A new car, and big, fine girl
But I've had them both
Ooh Lord, that's no joke
I had plenty of money in my pocket
Lord, when I used to always be broke

But I can't forget words my baby said

She said what goes up
I know one day has got to come down
Then she said what goes around sure comes around, mmm
(What goes around sure comes around)
What goes up (One day sure 'nuff gonna come)
I know, one day has got to come down
Lord, have mercy
You might also like
Now bad luck has turned on me
I lost everything I had
No one has no sympathy for me
Ooh, they all glad to see me doin' bad
I'm right back where I started (Oh, in my pocket)
In my pocket, I don't have a dime
Girl, I know I failed that day
When I left you and the babies
In that one room, cryin'
A voice came to me
It came out of nowhere
It said "Go on, go on back home, boy"
I know there's somewhere there, that she'll care

But I can't forget the words my baby said

She said what goes up
I know, one day has got to come down
Then she said what goes around sure comes around, she said
What goes up (One day sure 'nuff gonna come)
I know one day it's got to come down
Then she said, what goes around sure comes around, mmm
What goes up, you just watch and see
Don't it come back down?
You got to reap just what you sow
What goes up
Lord have mercy, it's got to come back down

What goes around, sure comes around
