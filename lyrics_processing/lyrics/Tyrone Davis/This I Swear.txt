If you can't depend
On no one else
And you're trying to make it through life
All by yourself

I'll come to your aid, no matter where
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good lovin' always, this I swear
Feel so good about it

Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh

Said if life's ups and downs
Are too much for you to stand
And you search so long in vain
For that helpin' hand

Look to me, I'm the one
'Cause life without love sure ain't no fun
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good lovin' always, this I swear
Feel so good about it
