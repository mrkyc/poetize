Mm-mm
Mm-mm, yeah

If I could write one song to right all wrongs, I would, if I could
But in retrospect a little bad is good, mm-mm
We all need what we want and don't want what we need, mm-mm
Life is bittersweet, bittersweet indeed, mm-mm
Well, I'm so human, it is a goddamn shame, I'm your thing
And I make sure that I always keep me some pain, yes, sir
To remind me that I survived somehow, oh
Lord, please don't let nothing steal me away right now
'Cause I wanna live

'Cause I wanna hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?
Live (Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Live (Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Now hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for? (Get up)
Live (Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Just live (Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Well, I've struggled so hard that I survived (Oh)
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive (Oh)

Said stand up, everybody, uh, this is your life
You gotta get it when you can, y'all
Half rich for months is your knife, huh
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters, the lovers who ain't here, huh
You only got one life, y'all and I repeat the point, it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going?
Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
'Cause ignorance is bliss and ignorance is just so fucking ignorant
You may even be ignorant of this
If you say, so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin' still fuckin', so fools don't make a dish
Light a candle for love, blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish
