Oh yeah
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
Yeah yeah

I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
You might also like
I feel like runnin' wild (running wild)
Like angels and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year) Oh

Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet Silent Night
Fill a tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
We go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

And all these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh, all these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh, all these things to me, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means, Christmas means to me
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love) Whee

My baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, yeah
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh baby, all these things and more
(Baby, baby, baby)
Oh baby, that's what Christmas
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
(Baby, baby, baby)
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
