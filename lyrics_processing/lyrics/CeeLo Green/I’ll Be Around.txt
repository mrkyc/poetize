Oh, Cee-Lo
You ready to rock with Timbo?
Oh, let's go, boy
ATL, talk to 'em, 'Lo

How could I possibly, be inconspicuous
When my flow is fuckin' ridiculous?
"That's quite an accent," see, I'm from the South
But some of the most beautiful things come out my mouth
And I'm on stage just as soon as I come out the house
So I might as well give them something to talk about
I bust a rap to make a blind man believe in the boogie
And if you came here to move with Cee, then boogie on

When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come, yeah, woo, holler
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)

Here comes Timbaland, I'm also from the South
I like them girls with big butts and golds in they mouth
I come from the back road and a dirty house
If you leave the door open, moms'll cuss you out
I got a big dog in the front yard
Best believe that bitch bite hard
I got a grandaddy who think he Joe Clark
And that's how we do around these parts, oh
You might also like
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come, yeah, woo, holler
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)

You see, I do what they won't do and can't do
But gon' wish they did when I'm done
And with a smile on my face, give the trophy for second place rite after I won
Shake his hand, firm like a man but talk to him like a son
And this way I can still be a little somethin' to everyone
And with that elegance, I rock climb to reach hints from God of relevance
Poise, position, and the plush of a relevance
And I'm outstandin', outspoken, which is the unequivocal evidence
It is then instant vintage as it has been, ever since, ah

When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come, yeah, woo, holler
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come, yeah, woo, holler
When you want me to come (Holler)
When you want me to come (Call me)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
