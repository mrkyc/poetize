Oh what a night, oh what a night, tears in my eyes, staring up at the sky in disbelief
"I've got a voice in my head, voice in my head"; that's what it said, all we really need is some comic relief

But I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore (Oh)
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
Laugh the pain away

I think don't make Philip Seymour Hoffman often, now he's one of the things we lost in the fire (Lord, yes)

But I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore (Oh)
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
