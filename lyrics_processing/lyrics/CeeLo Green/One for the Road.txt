Yeah, mm, mm, mm
Yeah that show feel good
Hello, I go by the name of simply CeeLo Green
How do you do?
Welcome, I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you a lil' bit more about myself if you don't mind
This is my vision
You know what I'm sayin'? Check me out now, uh

I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm
An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in
Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace
Trapped inside my silhouette, I have to speak to release
Demanding more from the pen than a whore from the pen
The line between playing to win and sin is thin
But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste
I am that raw, simply put, and I rest my case
It's elementary, yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me
Everything that I've done is divine
Ask God, he'll tell you
Yeah, he mine
So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me
That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP
But I'ma go slip into something more comfortable and continue the lesson
No inconvenience at all, I insist on leavin' an impression
You might also like
So relax and ride out (Mm, yeah)
Relax, it's okay, and ride out
Just relax and ride out (Mm)
Players, relax and ride out

I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit
Intensely exquisite artism inquire all, who is it?
It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist
Oh, his way with those words, I want seconds and thirds
Oh, hush, that's awful kind of you, you're making me blush
I could use some competition, but they not making me much
Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust
Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing
But you like every other rapper, cornrows and a bandana
But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check
Every three months off Santana
Don't you fuck up, though, my family is the whole side of Atlanta
Now, how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way
If anyone ever contests my conquest my gun bless
Yo son just, takes one time to be one less (Yes)
Yeah, you run and tell the rest that I'm the best
I sang sweet, but brang heat to bang meat
We all on the same street (Street)
And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise
I am not one of these thug rapper guys
But this one would help you realize, and use both eyes to recognize
The type of action that this amount of money buys
Now listen, son, let me drop some shit on you, man
I can just, do-do-do-do-do-do-do and put a hit on you, man
With hot heat that will make your heartbeat quit on you, man
And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit on you, man
So relax and ride out
Just relax, young man, ride out
Hey, you better relax and ride out
Okay, just relax and ride out

I could take that shit all day
But if I only had sixteen more bars to live
I'd get high, and hopefully O.D. on an alternative
I'd give a dim lit dream, a color scheme
And I'd swim to the sun (For fun)
No matter how impossible that may seem
I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest
Becoming one with everything there
I would belong, I would be right and wrong, but I'd be rare
And then I would pretend I didn't care, use my fear
And pray that my forever would be fair
And I love you all, unconditional
I get misty, already missin' y'all
And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time
While mine cultivate the consciousness and
Chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime

Ride out
Relax and ride out
Relax and ride out
Relax and ride out
This is one for the road
Yeah, one time for your motherfucking mind
I told you I don't motherfucking play
D.F., y'all, believe this, yeah
Shouts out to OutKast, Goodie Mob, yeah (Haha)
Backbone, where you at, brother? (Hey)
Hahaha, alright (Speak easy, y'all)
Hahaha, yeah, can't nobody stop me now
No, sir, yeah, I'm gone, y'all
Oh, man, it's lovely, ahahah, yeah
Somebody better stop mem hahaha, 'cause I'm good
Hahaha, yeah, hahaha
Alright now, hahaha, yeah, hahaha
Alright, we gon' relax, 'cause it feels so good
