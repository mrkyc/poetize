It's the real (It's the real)
Hip-hop (Hip-Hop), hey-hey (Hey-hey)

As I lay motionless, wondering why we so emotionally emotionless (Scrap metal)
My focus is not to be the brunt of the joke in this (Scrap metal)
Still played, I'm not a toy
You real afraid, so I'm still a boy (Something for you haters)
But is my soul this? (Something for you haters)
Seen many-a solstices and plenty equinoxes
Some, if any, think we equal not 'cause God does, but 'cause laws force them
But what are laws if you don't enforce 'em?
Unless you get it on tape
It's more suspense and mystery than a Presidio tape
Investigation more cartoon than a kid video tape
It's civil liberties rape in Statue of Liberty shape
The American offense make you watch for the head fake
Well, down with Sam, I ain't
Three seconds in this paint will make any outside shooter faint
Wait for you to blink
So when you wake up and can't wake up, you know exactly who to thank

Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with
I'll run a box cutter 'cross your face
I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

Having dealings with skill (My skill), kill if I have to kill (Kill)
Buck, dead 'em in your grill, yeah, fuck nigga for real
With a posse, I'm standin' alone, me and my nina, all-chrome
Buckin' straight at your dome, ain't stoppin' 'til the bullets gone
No, never cross no killer, lay no shit 'round no stealer
Mine, touch it, my nigga, I'll kill ya and Jesus can't even hear ya
Thrill ya like Michael Jackson, acting when the time for action
Chamdon clique out my back and Cee-Lo, he strapped with a MAC-10

Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with

See my words would be believable, believable but brief
I would even show you my teeth
You wouldn't even know that you had any beef
But, actually, I'm angry about it and I haven't had any sleep
Because of one little disrespect, it ultimately do the domino effect
Boy, don't you know that I could sit with my back to you
And still have my gat to you, so natural
Close my eyes and breathe in, do that to you
And as far as anyone that's after you, huh
The same goes for anyone that run up in your name, yes, I hate ya (I hate ya)

Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore

I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

From the feet, the beat, the gat on the seat
And that shouldn't surprise you, oh, I've sold some pies to
Each any every stone, since I'm obviously on
It says fifty to six-five thousand's been blown
I am something to see, yet I'm nothing to touch
I'll kill ya 'bout nothing, 'cause nothing's too much
I'll put the barrel to your baby mama belly and squeeze off two
So the world won't have to deal with another fuck nigga like you, yes, I hate ya (I hate ya)
Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
