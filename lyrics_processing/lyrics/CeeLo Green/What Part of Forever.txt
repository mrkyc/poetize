Run, run, run away
So lost, lost, never comin' home
Rollin', rollin' down a track
No, no, I'm never comin' back
Pump, pump, pumpin' in my veins
Our love, I hope it's not too late
That's the road, that's the load, that's the road
I've been down, I've been down, I've been down

What part of forever
Don't you understand?

And I would stay, stay, stay (I would stay)
If that's what you want, want, want (If that's what you want)
I'd give it to you, you, you (I'd give it to you)
If I had a hea-hea-heart (If I had a heart)
And we could go, go, go (Go, go, go)
And never look back on now (Back on now)
I'd give it to you, you, you (I'd give it to you)
If I had a hea-hea-heart (If I had a heart)

Ooh, imagine eternity
It doesn't seem that hard
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong
