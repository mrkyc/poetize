Ladies and gentlemen
May I introduce to you
Who?
Ceeeeee-Lo!
Green! (haha)
What's up guys, how you doin'?
What do you want for Christmas, Cee-Lo?
For Christmas?

All I need is love
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Aw, yeah
(Do-do-do-do)
All I need is love, yeah
(Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
All I need is la-la-love!

Colour-coordinated Bentleys
Watches, car, the agent sent me
A sixty-inch in every room
But all I wanna see is you
Got the cash to take vacations
To a beach in every nation
I don't wanna be a Scrooge
But I'm not going without you!

Santa don't know what to get me
I just wanna see my baby!

All I need is love

All I need is la-la-love!
Diamonds on my mistletoe
But that can't buy you love, you know
Yeah, I'd give it all away
For just the chance to see your face
I'd take a jet or hop a train
Or maybe Rudolph knows the way?
I don't know
To where you are this Christmas Eve
'Cause just one kiss is all I need!

Santa, won't you come and get me
And take me where I'll find my baby?

All I need is love

All I need is la-la-love!

Come on Mr. Santa, if you could
Steamed, baked, or or fried, I'm always good!
I only stole one little heart this year
But it was from a shrimp, who really cares?
It's time to make his list and check it twice
So I hope he likes his seafood naughty and spiced
You got something bad to say about this crustacean?
You'd better clam up 'til after Christmas vacation!

Santa, won't you come and get me
(I'm ready for my presents!)
And take me where I'll find my baby?
 (3x)
All I need is la-la-love!

I think the Muppets hit a new low!
Yeah, and his first name is Cee!
