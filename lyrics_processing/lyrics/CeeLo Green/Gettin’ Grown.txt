Oh, mm
Well, well
Mm, mm
Hey-hey

Little boy, you're not allowed to stay
You have to evolve inevitably
And I've sure come a long way
Hey, the road up ahead was so unclear
Backslidin' down a bottle of beer
Nobody knew if I would make it here
And hey, sweet music set me free
From the statistic that I started to be
I wish my mama was alive to see
Mm, the memories of the pain have scarred
And when I fall it's usually hard
But I get up and keep followin' God, hey

I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
Mm, gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown, hey
Ah-ha-ha, ha-ha
You might also like
And I remember the good ol' days
Broads and boxes of blunts to blaze
But I got three children to raise
I-I-I, I-I'm never gon' be perfect, I know
But workin' on it is worth it, I know
Life is just learnin' as you go
Mm, been selfish once or twice
I had to learn how to sacrifice
To live to my late nineties be nice
Ooh, mm, and every day that goes by is divine
Resentment just robs you blind
God, I owe you this life of mine

I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Gettin' grown

And, ooh, time's changed, but it feels the same
There's no tellin' what tomorrow will bring
Even if I could, I wouldn't change a thing
And hey, Lord, I know I'm not here to stay
But thanks for wakin' me up today
Preparin' me for what may come my way
And hey, as a young man, there's no need to cry
'Cause I know you will get by
Look your destiny in the eye
And, oh-oh, every day my heart burns to try
You've got to walk before you learn to fly
And we all got to earn to die
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown, (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
