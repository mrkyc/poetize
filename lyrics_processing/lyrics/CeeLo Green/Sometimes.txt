Ladies and gentlemen, CeeLo
Peace, how y'all feel out there?
That's cool, alright
You know, sometimes I wanna rap
Sometimes I wanna sing, you know what I mean?
Sometimes all it calls for is a nice mellow groove
Hit of rimshot, you know?
Just get, you know? Get you open
But, I wanna do a piece for y'all tonight, it's called "Sometimes"
Alright, so check it out

Sometimes a stranger can be your best friend
Sometimes bein' angry is the best mood
Sometimes seein' you feel good makes me feel even better
Sometimes hunger is the best food
Sometimes good just ain't good enough
And other times evil will get you even
Sometimes faith is not knowin' any better
Sometimes nothin' is what you believe in, woah

Sometimes I don't even have a hook
Sometimes you fail tryin', hm
And sometimes happiness hurts worse
Sometimes people live dyin'
Sometimes it's the last person that makes you first
Sometimes you'll keep what you don't want
And other times you'll give away what you really need
Sometimes a rich man won't have a dollar
And all a poor man has is greed, woah

Sometimes
Sometimes I just wanna listen, hm
Sound good to me, yeah
Ayy, yo, Lock, put them strings right here, hm, yeah

Sometimes I don't think people know I'm as good as I really am
Now my recitings are writing over rhythm's
Regularly reenacts facts of my existence
So what proof of my expertise, many emcees know of me
Usin' unrequested serious infested poetry
To provoke what persistence
For instance, I don't let the TV screen come in between my daily routine
At a spot where me and my boy went
Someone interrupted our enjoyment, hm
What do you know, an out of work emcee looking for employment
But I'm still courteous with my greeting, brother I'm eating
And his style sounded similar to someone elses, so evidently he's been cheating
But I couldn't question the destiny in which we meet
So, you guessed it, I suggested that he just have a seat
And then I explained to him that I remained in the mean time
Masterin' mysterious methods of writing
Finding my piece of mind with soft music and moonlighting
Then supernaturally I forsee the beginning stages
And then eventually pages get filled completely, huh
You see, I dive into the depths of my soul
Seeking to explore the hidden treasure of a pure literature
While these others are unsure
Bein' that the deepness makes them doubtful, deliberately delayin'
Saying they'll settle for whatever washes toward the shore, hm
Delirious from delusion
My feelings were no more direct so the conclusion is seclusion
Because mixed belief create confusion, hm
To remain plain and simplistic, realistic
Accurate, articulate and absolutely artistic
Uninhibited, unadulterated, unstoppable
Unfuckwittable and unforgettable
But since I've been granted the power of choice
Let God bet the voice he is
So all the credibility be his
So let these be words of wisdom and in the same breath be warnin'
God I shine like Sunday mornin', woah
Sometimes
