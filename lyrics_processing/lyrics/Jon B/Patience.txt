But go ahead and show it to your friends
Huh, holla

Don't be mad, I'm not tryin' to offend
Your shape is captivatin'
But I'ma be patient if I have to
I'ma just fall back ain't no need to press the fact that I'm open off your style
Your sexy when you walk, I ain't even heard you talk yet, yeah
If your voice is as fly as your skin tone
Then I already know just what you sound like when you moan

I don't wanna be patient, don't wanna jump the gun
But I don't want somebody else to scoop you up
But I'ma be patient
Maybe I wanna see if you're feelin' me, baby

If it takes me a minute
It's only 'cause it's lookin' like my dream and you in it
You messed around and gave me the eye and now you did it
But I don't wanna see you give somebody else your digits
But, baby, your body is like a sexy nine, pearl handle design
Thought she was shy, she fly, pull me from behind
Baby kinda bona fide, cool relax type, pleasures I like
