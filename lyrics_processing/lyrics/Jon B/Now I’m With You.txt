It's been seven years since I've known you, girl
Lovin' you's been my whole wide world
That still hasn't changed for me
There's sunshine when you come around
You're gone away, it just brings me down
What do I do, baby

Girl, you take me high
Girl, you are my sunshine

Now I'm with you, need only say it once
And, girl, I'll be right there for you
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Now I'm with you, we've been through everything
Now anything I'll give to you
'Cause I wanna make you happy, girl

There's no me if there's no you
We can live, Baby too
That's what's in my dreams for me (hey yeah)
You think I'm playing when I say let's not delay
When it comes to having children
I want my seeds with you
All I wanna be with you
You might also like
High in the sky
Girl, let's make it forever, baby

Now I'm with you, need only say it once
And, girl, I'll be right there for you
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Now I'm with you, we've been through everything
Now anything I'll give to you
'Cause I wanna make you happy, girl
Now I'm with you, need only say it once
And, girl, I'll be right there for you
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Now I'm with you, we've been through everything
Now anything I'll give to you
'Cause I wanna make you happy, girl

Girl, you take me high
Gonna give you my life
You and me, it's so right
Girl, you are my sunshine

Now I'm with you, need only say it once
And, girl, I'll be right there for you
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Now I'm with you, we've been through everything
Now anything I'll give to you
'Cause I wanna make you happy, girl
Now I'm with you, need only say it once
And, girl, I'll be right there for you
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Now I'm with you, we've been through everything
Now anything I'll give to you
