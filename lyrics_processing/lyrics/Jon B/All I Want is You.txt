Hey, they're playing our song again
I like it when you make it bounce your healthy body
Sticky wet, when you do that thing (do that thing)
Love, they give you lines full of game supreme
Trying too hard to get you on they team
That's when you tell em that you came with me, babe
 (Cuban Link)
I know what you like babe, I know how to make you (I know what you like), ooh oh
You dont have to cry ever again, no no, keep me satisfied babe
No pigeons on my mind babe, no one can love me the way you do babe
All I want is you, (all I want is you)
Baby, all I want is you, (all I want is you)
Mami you got me now, right next to you
Mami all I want is you
 (Cuban Link)
Hey, you know you are thing to me
Thats why I love you, cause you know you the baddest baby I ever seen
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, just ask it will be yours
And I know that you, really like it too
I know what you like babe, I know how to make you (I know what you like), ooh oh
You dont have to cry every again, no no, keep me satisfied babe
No pigeons on my mind babe, I'll stay real with the way that I feel, woahhh
You might also like
Yo mami all I want is you
Dont know what to do when im not with you
You got me going crazy, baby boo thats the honest truth
Promise the monogamy, only if you ride with me
The sky's the limit if you witit, you can come and fly with me
As long as you don't lie to me, and show me true love
Represent and stand beside me, just like my crew does
Keep the shit we do in privacy, between the two of us
You can write it in ya diary, dont keep it a grudge
Now is that askin for too much, cuz you packin that good stuff
This attractions more than lust, you feel my passion when we crush
And plus you got the sweetest touch got a man i'll beat him up
I need ya love, got a hot-hand, I dont believe in luck
See me york, in the stretched limo next to my primo Jon B
Mami please listen to my demo, HELLO!
I keep it ghetto like a sour armavedo
If you like flowers then follow my trail of rose pedals
 (Cuban Link)
All I want is you, all that I want (mami, ven con migo)
Baby, all I want is you, all I want is you (te necesito)
Mami you got me now, right next to you, you got me right next to you
Mami all I want is you, all that I want (all I do is want you)
 (Jon B & Cuban Link)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
(come on, is you, I love to dance with you)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
(come on, do you ride with me, oh yeah..)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
(somebody like you, you got me now)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
(mami, all I want... I need somebody like you in my corner baby)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
(These fake ass bitches, I need somebody to keep it real with ME!, feel me)
All that I want, is you baby, All that I want, is you baby
