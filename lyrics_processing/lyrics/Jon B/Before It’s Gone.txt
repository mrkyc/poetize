There's really no need for friends to call tonight
So I'm gonna gladly keep the phone off the hook tonight
I hope you like the ebony satin on your skin tonight
The dinner I made was good but my appetite is for you tonight
It all started with sangria on your lips with a kiss tonight
Got a do not disturb sign on the door tonight
I had a few so the love's gonna be extra long tonight
It really don't matter if you sweat your hair out tonight, oh you said

You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
Gotta get love before it's gone
You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
Gotta get love before it's gone

There's gonna be a lot of rubbing on you, I got the oil tonight
I got a bottle of that act right juice you can sip tonight
Fireplace in the view, candlelight, me and you tonight
Can't wait to get all soggy, kind of nasty tonight
You might also like
You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
Gotta get love before it's gone
You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
Gotta get love before it's gone

Silhouettes of you dancing on the walls
Sunrises anew but there's no worries at all
Trying to find my mind, I'm so lost inside of you
The best of me you got, take control and don't let go

You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
Gotta get love before it's gone
You said sing me a love song
So I did and wrote it for you all night long
Probably not show up to work in the mornin'
