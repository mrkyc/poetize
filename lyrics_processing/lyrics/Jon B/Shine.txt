Look at you shine, baby, watch you shine
Look at you shine, baby, look at you shine
Look at you shine, baby, look at you shine
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, love
All love

Girl, why do you got that look on your face?
Time is now, girl, I don't want to waste
You shocked my eye when you stepped in the place
I wanna get with that, baby

Now there's no way I can let
(There's no way I can let)
Let you get passed me now, baby
(You get passed me now, baby)
I've scoped you, girl, now you're mine
(And now you're mine)
It's time to let, let you shine (All night, baby)

Love (Love), girl, let me take you out (Take you out)
Show you around my town
Look at them starin' at you, baby
Tonight, girl, you deserve some wine (Some wine)
Here's to you being so fly (So fly)
Let me just let you shine now, lady

I can't stand to look your way, baby

Now there's no way I can let

Let you get passed me now, baby

Let me just let you shine now, lady

Tip the cup back, long legs, bare-breasted
The type of body that got my mind manifested
Lyrical potion took me at the glance when I seen you dance
Highlight from the light, from the back
I like the way you make me feel
Got that sex appeal
So swing it over this way
Tonight I wanna make a long stay
Love, girl, let me take you out
Show you around my town
Look at them starin' at you, baby
Tonight, girl, you deserve some wine (So fly)
Here's to you being so fly
Let me just let you shine now, lady

Just let you shine
Just let you shine
