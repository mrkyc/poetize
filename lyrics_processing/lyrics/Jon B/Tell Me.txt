These days I don't know what to do with myself
I ain't even concerned about my health
And I can't even seem to eat
I haven't got a good sleep since the other day
When you went away
These times hurt my soul so bad
Cause you can't seem to let yourself just bounce back
We think too much about the things we said in the past
When we both wasn't thinkin'
And the words came out too fast

If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl
(My angel why do we fight so much)
If you can't decide right now
Do you need some time
(Do you miss the way we used to kiss
The way we used to touch)
Lately all we do is live in limbo
In and out
(Lately I just don't know)
If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl
You might also likeBaby please don't hang up I really need you

But I can't be your man if you cut me down
If you say I'm just a fool
Am I suppose to stick around
And I know I also say hurtful things
Like I don't want you no more
But the truth is I don't know where to go if I walk through that door
And this time
It hurt my soul so bad
Cause I can't let myself just bounce right back
We think way too much 'bout them times in the past
Now I don't know why we can't make the good times last

I learn too much about the way I feel
When you're gone away
And I can't see you
(Ooh you're all I really want)
But I don't want to fight no more

If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl
(My angel why do we fight so much)
If you can't decide right now
Do you need some time
(Do you miss the way we used to kiss
The way we used to touch)
Lately all we do is live in limbo
In and out
(Lately I just don't know)
If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl (Tell me what you want)
If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl
(My angel why do we fight so much)
If you can't decide right now
Do you need some time
(Do you miss the way we used to kiss
The way we used to touch)
Lately all we do is live in limbo
In and out
(Lately I just don't know)
If this isn't what you want then
Tell me girl
Just tell me what you want

I know we said a lot of things we didn't mean
But I need you to tell me
What you want
If this isn't what you want girl
If it's not what you want
