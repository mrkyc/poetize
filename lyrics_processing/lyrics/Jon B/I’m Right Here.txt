Alright, Jon B, Michael Angelo
Ooh, you make me feel so good, baby

Baby, I got something I have to tell you
'Bout me, addicted to this feeling here
Now I know we've known each other for a while
Now it's time I get this off my chest right now

Girl, you need to be with me
I can give you what you need
I'm right here, I got just what you want
(What you want, baby)
You ain't never been in love
No more wasting time 'cause I'm right here
I got just what you want

Ooh, just wanna be with you, riding together on 22's
Lay back in love, lay back with you
Now I know you're my friend
But I'm tired of pretending everything is cool
When I'm just tryna get with you
