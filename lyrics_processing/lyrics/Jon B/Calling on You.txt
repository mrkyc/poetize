Callin' on, callin' on you
No, no, no
I been callin' on, callin' on you

Baby, I've been a crazy, crazy, crazy man
Leavin' you all alone, ain't talked for the past week and it's something that I know you don't understand
Well, lady, lately I've been stressin' and
I think I need a remedy, I'm needin' you close to me and you're soundin' like you really miss your man
Oh, so here I am, here I am, oh

Ooh, finally got you right here
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Oh, oh)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Callin' on, callin' on you)
And, ooh, soft, you're love's desire (Ooh, ooh)
It's hard to stay away (So hard to stay away)
You keep me callin' on you (On and on you)

I could be callin' on you in the afternoon, you could be at work, I'll sneak you out the back
Say you have an emergency, gotta tend to me, baby, you know that I don't know how to act
Sometimes things you do are the special thing, yeah, always make my stresses go away
Even though I ain't called you, baby, think it's time to me that we communicate
Oh, say, say, baby, baby
