I think about the clever lines to spill to you baby
The time it's gonna take for me and you to get out of here
Lead you to my ride and back to my house
So we can do what we want to do

All that I want
(And all that I need)
For you to give me
(Just one night to please you)
Girl, you will be
(Girl, you will be the one)
The one I want to leave tonight with baby
You can be my bad girl

Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby (My bad, bad girl)
For you to be a bad girl, baby

Don't wanna pressure you and make you to think I'm wrong, baby
Just wanna turn you on to something that you're looking like
You will see exactly why you dressed up looking like that for me, baby
All flyed up for me
You might also like
All that I want
(All that I need)
For you to give me one night to please you
(Give me, one night to please you)
Girl, you will be
(Girl, you will see)
The one I want to leave tonight with baby
You can be my bad girl

Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby

All that I want
(All that I want)
(All that I want is one night)
For you to give me (For you to give me)
One night to please (One night to please)
Girl, you will be
The one I wanna leave tonight with
You can be my bad girl
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
For you to be a bad girl, baby
Tell me what I have to do tonight
For you to be a bad girl, baby
