Sweetheart
What's up with your boy?
Come on

Your so-called man's got you stressin' out on a regular
Seems all you do is just fight about nothin' baby
Out with his friends he comes home late night
(He's got more important things to do)
You see the signs makin' love
He don't take his time
All in a daze someone else must be on his mind
Plans for engagement change to another day
(There slipping far away)

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and place it on your hand
(Star out the sky and I place it on your hand)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants your love babe)
You might also likeHe don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man
(He is not a man)

I can't sit by and watch a man just mistreat a dime
He's got a jewel in his pocket that he can't find
Feel like your loyalty is wasted girl
Why do you chase it girl
(You might as well face it girl)
Is it worth it girl I know it's getting old to you
He's giving dough to you
But he's so cold to you

I'ma stop second guessing myself
And step up straight to you
Want to relate to you and I got the taste for you

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and I place it on your hand
(On your hand)
He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messing around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants but I know I do girl)
He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messing around
Cause the boy is not man

He don't understand your problems
So how's he ever gonna solve them
Baby you know I want your love
When he's sexting does your spin get chills girl
New positions every time, I will girl
You need a change of plans
The boy is not a man
(The boy is not a man)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants but I know I do)
He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man

Your problems
Does he ever try to solve them
(He's not a man)
Baby you know I want your love

When he's sexin' you does you spin get chills girl
New positions everytime, I will girl
You need a change of plans
The boy is not a man
