Let me talk to you for a minute, baby
You see, a man has many ways
He tries to show his love for his woman
And my best way of showing you is right here

You're always there for me
Whenever I fall
Whenever I'm in need
You always know when to call
When I've come to my ends
I know I can depend on your loving me
Your touching me
Constant faith and trust in me

And how can I tell you
How I love you so
Oh darling, I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
(Pride and joy)

You've been right there for me
Through thick and the thin
You were the strength for me
You wouldn't let me give in
At the end of the road
Somehow I have always known
That your trust in me
Your love in me
Got me to believe in me
You might also like
And how can I tell you
How I love you so
(I love you)
Oh darling, I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy

You are my first and last thought of the day
You are my heartbeat
Without you I can't breathe
I can't imagine me without you in my life
You are my one soul inspiration
Without you, I'll just die

How can I tell you
How I love you so
(That I really love you baby)
Oh darling, I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
How can I tell you
How I love you so
(I really do, really do love you baby)
Oh darling, I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
(You're my pride, my pride and joy)
That you're my pride and joy
(You're my pride and joy)
