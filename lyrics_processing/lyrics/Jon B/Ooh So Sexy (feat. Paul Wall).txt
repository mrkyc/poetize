Oh, so sexy, you got that natural
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
So amazin', I'm gettin' faded
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
Oh, so sexy, you got that natural
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
So amazin', I'm gettin' faded
Off you, so intoxicatin'

Pretty feet with open toes
Scent of your neck is like a fresh red rose
X-ray vision passin' through your clothes
But I really can't wait to see you naked though
The way your body move and you dip it slow
I try to play it cool but gotta let you know
The way you lookin', I can tell you wanna go
Skip the preview and let's get to the show

My baby she kick it, she cool with all the fellas
She hood like Timmy Chan's but classy like Cinderella
She down like four flats, my baby girl is real
She done weathered the storm and baby down with me still

Now we at home and were all alone
With no interruptions, just turn off your phone
Daddy's little girl but now that your all grown
Birthday suit is all you got on
Got the radio on and it's playing your song
Touchin' on your body all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong
Sexual healin' coming on strong

Them curves like a coke bottle, can't be beat
Pedicure every week on them cute little feet
She a freak under the covers but she keep it discrete
She's my midnight treat, baby, for real that's why I remain
Oh, so sexy, you got that natural
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
So amazin', I'm gettin' faded
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
Oh, so sexy, you got that natural
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
So amazin', I'm gettin' faded
Off you, so intoxicatin'

She shaped like an hour glass
Slyer than a mockingbird
Baby got that smooth skin softer than some fox fur
We go together like sweaters in cold weather
Nobody can do it better, baby, down for whatever
She gangsta like Lil' Kim, sexy like Alicia Keys
Funny like Sommore, baby cooler than a summer breeze
Man, I swear my baby cuter than a teddy bear, nobody compares
Lil mama, that's why I am your man

Oh, so sexy, you got that natural
The way you movin', ooh, that's crazy
So amazin', I'm gettin' faded
