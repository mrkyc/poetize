Are you ready for love?
Ohh, girl

I don't know what you been through
I can't imagine the pain, boo
Whatever it is, it's all over now
Was it waves crashin' over?
Like the sand on the shore, I got so close to someone
But just like you I had to let them go
'Cause your heart's way too precious
But we still look for treasure
Gettin' in places where we might only find fool's gold
Now we're both getting older
As our love start to show us
Why playin' around with our love just might do
'Cause you know I'm waitin'

'Cause lately I've been gettin' too deep girl
I can't get no sleep 'til I get closer to you
(Hey, girl)
Hey, girl
My love is talkin' to you
You can come and see me
My love is too deep
(Too deep, oh, too deep)
You might also like
I don't know what you been through
But I know that we sinkin'
Can you feel the water?
I imagine the bath as it overflows
When your mind starts to wonder
I'ma take it a little further
Where you think I might not likely go
But you know
It's on tonight (It's on tonight)
You need to relax yourself (Just relax yourself, girl)
It's on tonight (It's on tonight)
You need to relax alone (Just relax alone)

'Cause lately I've been gettin' too deep girl
I can't get no sleep 'til I get closer to you
(Closer to you, baby)
Hey, girl
My love is talkin' to you (It's talkin' to you)
You can come and see me (See me, baby)
My love is too deep (Too deep, yeah)

We can go all night long
(All night long, I just wanna chill, waitin' for you to come home)
I just want you to come home
(Baby, I just wanna see if you been feelin' as lonely as me)
As me
(Ohh, like a dream come true)
Like a dream come true
(All I got is me, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(Ohh, we will have a good time)
This is for all the times you cried
'Cause lately I've been gettin' too deep girl
I can't get no sleep 'til I get closer to you
(Do you feel me? Do you feel me feelin' you?)
Hey, girl (Ohh)
My love is talkin' to you (Your love is talkin' to me)
You can come and see me (You come to see me)
My love is too deep
(Love is too deep)

We can go all night long
(All night long, I just wanna chill, waitin' for you to come home)
I just want you to come home
(Baby, I just wanna see if you been feelin' as lonely as me)
As me
(Ohh, like a dream come true)
Like a dream come true
(All I got is me, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(Ohh, we will have a good time)
This is for all the times you cried

All the times you cried, girl
I am gonna make it up tonight, girl, yeah
Oh, oh, yes
All the times you cried, girl
I'm gonna make it up tonight, girl
