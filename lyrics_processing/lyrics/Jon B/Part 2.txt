Part 2 Are you still down?
This is for all the homeboys that couldn't get their happy home
Know we had to do it again
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Johnny J
Let's do it again
Happy home
Stay down for me, hold on

Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both (Won't you tell me, are you still down?) and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away, girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrelevant
'Cause I'm still here thinkin' about the love that's gone
Mornin', cookin' breakfast back at home

I never meant for this to end (I got love for you)
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember our happy home
Wanna know if you with me
(Home, home)
You might also like
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role
Just to keep your faith in God knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we die
Why question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, eh
(Now we're happy)

I never meant for this to end (I never meant for this to end)
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember our happy home
(I know what time is it)
(Home, home)
I never meant for this to end (I never meant for this to end)
But we couldn't just let it go again (Couldn't just let it go again)
We broke up (So we broke up), it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember our happy home
(Home, home)
I wonder what you must feel like
Now you know that I'm havin' a seed with someone else (Hahaha, that's right)
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody, baby
Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility (Then handle it)
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby, I can't say enough that I'm sorry (I know, I know)
Oh (Believe it), I never meant

I never meant for this to end (Oh, no)
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember our happy home
(Our happy home)
(Home, home)
I never meant for this to end (Before the did the things I did)
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember our happy home
(Home, home)
