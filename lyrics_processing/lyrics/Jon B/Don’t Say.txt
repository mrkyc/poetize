Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, yes, you will
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, go on through

I know you mean well
But looking at you one can't tell
You've got changes to make
'Cause the why you treat me, girl
Just ain't right, no
Always fronting on someone
But never think about the damage you've done
To me and it's about damn time I talk about it
Every time I do for you
You turn around and make me feel like a fool
With your actions
So much for the words
Baby, I love you, yes

'Cause now I've wised up, girl
It's time for me to go
You better think about it
'Cause I'm hear to let you know
You might also like
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, yes, you will
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, go on through

I wanna make good love to you
I wanna do the things you wouldn't do
But you're forcing me to look the other way, baby
I'm seeing things that I really shouldn't see
Girl, you better hurry 'cause you're running out of time
And this is the last chance for you to be mine
And I'm asking you what you gonna do?
Tell me what you gonna do?

'Cause now I've wised up, girl
It's time for me to go
You better think about it
'Cause I'm hear to let you know

Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, yes, you will
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, go on through
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through, yes, you will
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
