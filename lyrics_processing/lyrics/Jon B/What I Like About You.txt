You have this way about you that's so adorable

You have this way about you that's so adorable
Ain't nothing fake about you, girl, you're so approachable
You probably never done a bad thing in your life
The type of girl that make a player wanna do right
And I wanna let you know, it ain't just 'cause you're beautiful
But I don't mind the physical but we go so much deeper, yo
And I ain't never thought I would say no shit like that
But as a matter of fact

You're the reason why I always come home early, girl
'Cause I know you'll be there waiting for me
And I got no reason for me to second guess you, girl
I know you're crazy 'bout me

That's what I like about you
(I love it when you dance with me)
What I adore about you
(I love it when you lay up with me)
That's what I like about you
(How we be liking the same song)
That's what I like about, what I adore about
That's what I like about you
(I love it how you chill me out)
What I adore about you
(And somehow never put me down)
That's what I like about you
(You know how to make a player proud)
Yeah, that's what I like about
That's what I like about you
You might also like
You're so incredible, it's understandable
That's why I'm always trying to floss you, you're so bankable
Girl, do you even know the damage that you cause?
I'll do just 'bout anything for you, even damn near break the law
And if the world was ending I know just where I would wanna go
Just one day left what to do, spend my last minutes with you
And I ain't never thought I would say no shit like that to you, boo
But as a matter of fact

You're the reason why I always come home early, girl
'Cause I know you'll be there waiting for me
Ain't no reason for me to second guess you, girl
I know you're crazy 'bout me

First, I wanna tell you how much I like
That thing you do when I do it to you
We be makin' our ride bump up and down
Bounce, bounce, we gon' take it to the house
We can go another round
You know I like to wear it out, girl
I like it when you shout my name from our up and down game
Tell me, baby, who's playing?
That's my word, you got the thang
Good enough to eat your lovin' like a home cooked plate, yeah

You're the reason why I always come home early, girl
