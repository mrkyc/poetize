Picture me knocking on the door, you haven't dressed yet
Back in the days, yeah, baby, when we just met
Picture us naked from top to toe, go straight to kissing, mhmm
I got you head over heels and you grant my wishes, ohhh
Just imagine, girl, reality is so different and so deep
How you made me wait and dissipate all this love you give to me

From the very first glance, I've been on that ass
Wantin' that right in front of me
So you always feel the point sinks in
The reasons why you can always count on me

Call my name when you need me
You know why there's only one me
Who can satisfy beginning until the end
You already know there's only one me
What nobody else can do you like
You know I can be your everything you need
You always wait so patiently
You know why there's only one of me
One
You know why there's only one of me
One
There's only one
You might also like
You feel the real talk, and I now I'm speaking to the core
Wanna make her sing from inside
Wanna make you want me so much more
Ooh, oooh, wanna put you on top of the world
Turn a glacier to a waterfall, fall
Wanna warm you up like a fireplace
Your silhouette on the wall, wooo, ooh
Not just imaginin' 'cause reality is I creep into your dreams
But you let it marinate, you anticipate
All this love you gon' receive

From the very first glance, I was on that ass
Wantin' that right in front of me
I wanna always get to always make the point  clear
The reasons why
It's better than good what you'll get from me

Call my name when you need me
You know why there's only one me
Who can satisfy beginning until the end
You already know there's only one me
What nobody else can do you like
You know I can be your everything you need
You always wait so patiently
You know why there's only one of me
You know why there's only one of me
Baby
You know (Only one)
Call my name when you need me
You know why there's only one me
Who can satisfy beginning until the end
You already know there's only one me (When you need a does of me)
What nobody else can do you like
You know I can be your everything you need
You always wait so patiently
You know why there's only one of me
I'ma show you why (There's only me)
