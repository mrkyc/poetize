Girl I knew the first tme that I seen your pretty eyes
It was gonna take a damn good line to make a girl like you surprised
I knew you were a woman with class but way down to earth
I could tell by the way you let them down easy
When the other guys try to flirt and I'd do

I would do anything for your love (I would do anything)
I would go anywhere for you touch (Do most anything)
And I would do anything for your love (Go anywhere)
I would go anywhere-anywhere with you

Just let me know the deal
(Could you fall in love?)
Just let me know for real

On, on, on, and on
To the break of dawn, baby
