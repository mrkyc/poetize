They're calling me up what's the move
What time am I linking up with the crew
It's supposed to be lined up the place is packed
But I got something holding me back
See my baby's got some arrangements
So I might have to miss y'alls engagements
Yes I'm sorry but I ain't going out like that yeah

'Cause tonight see it's on
There ain't nothing going on but love
Yes, tonight I'd rather be getting down
In the bedroom instead of the town

Fellas, I ain't going out
'Cause my ol' lady's showing me how
She likes to keep me in the house
To do my homework
She's speakin' that we can make love
And won't stop until we get enough
So that sure as hell means
That I ain't going nowhere

So baby what's cooking up in your pot
Got something heating up getting hot
And if my boys knew what I know about her
They'd be calling up sick to work
Yeah 'cause she's the kind of woman
Who loves to please her man
Try to get some every chance I can
Yes I'm sorry but I ain't going out like that yeah

Yeah it don't take a lot of convincing
To keep me home with her
'Cause the love she gives is so damn good
I don't want to go nowhere
Ooh I can't leave tonight
'Cause my baby she does it right

Fellas, I ain't going out
'Cause my ol' lady's showing me how
