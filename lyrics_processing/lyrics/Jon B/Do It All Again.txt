Took a good look at my face
And all I guess that I can say
Is I'm just a man trying to find his way
It's been a long and windy road
But at least I got you to hold
And I've become the man I am
Cause all our troubles made me understand
It's been all of our lives
All of our lives I wanna stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you
Ever since we went through with the plan
I'm feeling like I've become a better man
Cause I'm giving up that part of me
That held me back from being free
And now when we kiss I feel your soul
I'm putting back the pieces others stole
And now nobody can hurt
My baby cause we make it work
You might also likeI can't hold the rain back when it starts to storms
(Just let it rain)
You don't have to fight your feelings anymore
(We can learn from the pain)
When I'm all alone I count the reasons why
Just till you think girl, you'll be alright
You just take your time
All of your live
All of our lives I wanna stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you
All of our lives I wanna stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you
I'm not going away girl
Love is just a thought away
When I go away girl
How much I love you
How much I do love you baby
All of our lives I wanna stay, stay this way
I'm gonna make, make it through yeah
That's why all of our lives, ooh ooh
We are gonna make it through, make it through baby
