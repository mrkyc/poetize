It's Jon B and Donell Jones, baby

It's no doubt that I've gone through some ups and downs
What sense would it make to you if I never, ever be the man (Hah)
To make a stand?
I'm in a different place, changed so many ways
Landing on a different stage
I just need you to help me turn the page
I really just wanna show you my way
I'll make it see that you

I know you think you've seen the best I had
I'll do everything to make you understand
Down to do whatever to prove it
To make you understand
You ain't seen nothin' yet (You ain't seen nothin' yet)
You ain't seen nothin' yet (You ain't seen nothin' yet)
You ain't seen nothin' yet (Nothin' yet)
But I promise that I'm gonna make you understand

Anticipate. I'm gonna give you all that I can
What else is left to do?
I feel that you deserve more than you have endured
So I will do anything that you ever ask of me
So am I just crazy to please you?
Girl, I'm just sayin' it's long overdue
I can be the man, show you what's in my plan
I'm gonna do this again
You might also like
I know you think you've seen the best I had
I'll do everything to make you understand
Down to do whatever to prove it
To make you understand
You ain't seen nothin' yet (Nothin' yet)
You ain't seen nothin' yet (Nothin' yet)
You ain't seen nothin' yet
But I promise that I'm gonna make you understand

I know you see the difference now
I put those young boy ways down
For you, baby
Ooh, girl
It's so real, your love has changed me
Let's fool around 'til midnight
And there's nothing that I'd rather do more
Than reignite that old flame
My heart is like an open door
So, baby, take my hand, let's move on

I know you think you've seen the best I had
I'll do everything to make you understand
Down to do whatever to prove it (Whatever, baby)
To make you understand
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You ain't seen nothin' yet (Nothin' yet)
But I promise that I'm gonna make you understand
I know you think you've seen the best I had
I'll do everything to make you understand
Down to do whatever to prove it (Whatever, baby)
To make you understand
You ain't seen nothin' yet (You've been waitin' for D and Jon)
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You ain't seen nothin' yet
But I promise that I'm gonna make you understand
Oooh, ooh, baby
You ain't see nothin' yet
You ain't seen best of me
I ain't ashamed of tricks up my sleeve
Baby, oooh
I know you ain't the best of me, babe
Me, babe
Me, babe
Ohh, oh, oh
Just a little better, baby
Better than before
I want some more
