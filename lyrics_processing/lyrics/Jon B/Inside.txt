Whatcha cookin', baby
Smells so good, lady
Girl, you got me craving
For your love
Baby, you are crazy
It never ceases to amaze me
What I'm about to be tasting
But I'ma take my time
Girl, tonight

Your body gets warm
Freaky conversations
No touching just talk
Thinking about the things we're gonna do
Tonight we'll make it rain
Down inside when I kiss you goodnight
We can go for a long time
You might also like
Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside
Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside

Baby, put your glass down
Let me kiss all around
I like the way you make the sound
When I touch the spot, baby
Over to the bedroom
Only light is the moon
The small of your back is shiny, too
You're so sexy when you sweat, boo

Your body gets warm
Freaky conversations
No touching just talk
Thinking about the things we're gonna do
(What I'm bout to do in a couple seconds, boo)
Tonight we'll make it rain
Down inside when I kiss you goodnight
We can go for a long time
Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside
Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside

Feels so amazing
That's why I'm pacin'
Myself with you
Cause you are beautiful
When we come together
We will see the flight to heaven
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside
Promise you to pace
Myself not to waste
I like to see your face
This is your place
(I like it when it's all the way inside)
All the way inside

Come on, come on
I like it when it's all the way inside
