Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So bad, so bad, baby
Listen
Time after time, you be thinking of me
Wondering if these things could have been, baby
I think back to us the way that we were
I wouldn't change a single thing, baby
And know I'm not with you
Nothing to reap but losing you
For a love that's true
Would I give everything I gave again
Just to get back
What we felt way back when
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
More than if we didn't love
I would do it all again
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
Oh yes, you know
I'm so glad we fell in love
My, oh my, how you've grown up so girl
Sound of your voice
It made me think about the choice I make
Now, that I'm here all alone
Thinking of where to go
Just to call you on the phone
And know I'm not with you
Nothing to reap but losing you
For a love that's true
Would I give everything I gave again
Just to get back
What we felt way back when
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
More than if we didn't love
I would do it all again
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
Oh yes, you know
I'm so glad we fell in love
See life reveals itself
Through all the moves we make it
Everything we feel and things that
We say the things we say
My life revealed to me
The best thing about you and me
Was spending all my time with you
Baby, baby, with you
Are my lady, my love, my one and only girl
Just come back to my world
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
More than if we didn't love
I would do it all again
Girl, I'm glad that we loved
Oh yes, you know
