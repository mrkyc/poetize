They said it wasn't gonna last
They said we're gonna split up fast
They told you I was a player and I would play you
Nobody wanted us to be this way

Could never touch us 'cause the truth is, lady
That I'm still with you

We've been together for some time
Gotta tell you what's been on my mind
Since we've been spending every night the way we do
You see I never wanna leave
And if I asked you would you believe
I never want to spend the night with anyone but you, baby?
