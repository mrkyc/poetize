La da da da da da
I just came here to chill
Oh

We been kickin' it for quite some time
Lots of private parties where we're wined and dined
Tonight I'm in a different mood
Just want to get close to you
(No RSVP necessary)
Tonight it's me and you, girl

Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
(Oh, you know)
I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
(No other VIP)
The party's only you and me
(Ah yeah, ah yeah)
I just came here to chill
(Yeah, yeah)

You're a special lady
The world can see
Nobody makes a room shine
Like you and me (Nobody, nobody)
You always know just what to wear
Nails just right, lovely hair
No need to put your makeup on
I'm not Mr. Biggs, 'cause tonight I'm just Ronald Isley

Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
(You know, you know)
I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
(No other VI)
The party's only you and me
See I, I just came here to chill

I don't mind a little champagne
But no private chefs or restaurants
Just a little home cookin' on the spot, yeah
No invitations with our names
No shakin' hands with all the you-know-whos
My focus is on you

Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
See I, I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
The party's only you and me
See I, I just came here to chill
Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
See I, I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
The party's only you and me
See I, I just came here to chill
No Escalades parked in the valet
(Parked in the valet)
No red-eye flights, I'm stayin' in LA
No movie stars with fancy cars
No backstage passes to the latest show
Tell R. Kelly we ain't coming no
No relatives, no friends we know
'Cause I just came here to chill

Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
The party's only you and me
