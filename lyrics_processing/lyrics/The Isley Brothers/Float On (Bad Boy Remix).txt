Jigs, Mr. Biggs

Don't wanna stop this groove
Just wanna keep goin on
The way your body moves
Oh girl I can't let you go
Just let me come inside
Until you can't take no more
You're body wrapped on mine
Now baby, let me explode
Mr. Biggs, you
You gotta give me some more
I love the way it feels
The way you caress me
Take me to ecstasy
Oh baby, up and down
Just hit it all around
This love it feels so right
Bring it and hold me too

Lil' Kim, you don't know what type of chick this is
Number one ballette of the mistresses
Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Even though it might mean stealing chips from kids (Say what!)
You know I sail the coast, too hot for mink coats
Get C-notes every time I deep throats
Ya losing it, acting like ya new to this
Get true to this, make it shift in my uterus
Sexing in the Aston Martin
When wifey comes home, get the dough and I'm departing
I wanna see if you can make me scream I hate ya
Give me back shots and sweat out my cream of nature

Don't you stop (Don't stop)
Just give it to me (Give to me)
I need release (I need release, whoa)
Love me here, touch me there
This love is ours, something to share
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
And you don't stop, and we won't stop, remix
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
