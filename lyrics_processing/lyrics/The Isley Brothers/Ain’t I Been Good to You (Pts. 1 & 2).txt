One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
After all these years
You still treat me wrong
Why do you wanna wear me down?
No, don't tear me down

Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Say, baby (So good)
Now, didn't I give it all to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)

I gave it all, baby, and I trusted you
Though there have been times you haven't been true
You don't have to hide from me
And ah, don't lie to me

Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)
Didn't I run it all down to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)
You might also like
I will go on, baby, loving you
Because you're all I am used to
I haven't the strength to fight
So don't you wanna do me right?
