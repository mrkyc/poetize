I'm taking care of business, woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, and I've gotta make it for me
Oh, sometimes it may seem, girl, I'm neglecting you
Well, I'd love to spend more time --
But I got so many things to do

Oh, I - I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do! (I got work to do)
Said, I got work to do! (I got work to do)

Well, I'm out here trying to make it, woman, can't you see?
Oh, it takes a lot of money to make, let's talk truthfully
So keep your love lights burning
And a little food hot in my plate
You might as well get used to
Me coming home a little late

Oh, I - I got work to do
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
Wha Ha Ha!
