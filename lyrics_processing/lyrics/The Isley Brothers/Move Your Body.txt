'Cause it's your hips, your thighs, your lips, your eyes
Girl, would you be my private dancer
You're all I need, you've got the answer
Girl, you're my heat, you're my fire
'Cause it's your hips, your thighs, your lips, your eyes

Inside my head, I see you strippin'
Pop it just right and I'll be tippin'
Your hips, your thighs, your lips, your eyes

Girl, can we go half on a baby?
You got me wondering who's that lady (Who's that lady?)
Your hips, your thighs, your lips, your eyes
