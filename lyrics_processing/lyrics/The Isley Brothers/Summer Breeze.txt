Oh, ha ha, yeah
Summer breeze, all in my mind
Ah ha, yeah
Summer breeze, all in my mind
No, no, no, no
It's all in my mind
No, no, no, no
It's all in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
All in my mind

See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evenin' on a Friday night
A little light shinin' through the window
Lets me know every, everything's alright
Oh, summer

Summer breeze, you make me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine my mind
All in my mind
You might also like
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing a tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile waitin' in the kitchen
Food cookin' on a plate for two
Feel the arms reachin' out to hold me
In the evenin' when the day is through
Oh, summer

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Oh, summer
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Oh, summer breeze
