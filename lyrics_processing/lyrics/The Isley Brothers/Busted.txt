Busted, It's 2 o' damn clock in the morning, where you been?

And they were both at home

Well, they're the only friends I know
Girl you better
Wait before you get all upset here's the truth
Talk to me
I was with my girl when she got some bad news
And...?
Her man cheated, had her upset and confused
But, baby what's that got to do with you coming in at 2?
I'm telling you, now she was so upset
She asked me to stay with her
Well, why didn't your ass just pick up the phone and call me?
I was gonna do that but it slipped my mind, I'm sorry
But I'm telling you the truth
