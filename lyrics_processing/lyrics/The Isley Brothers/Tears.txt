Thank you, baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you, sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good, through the bad
You were always by my side

I never thought I'd meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved
And sacrificed for me

I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not supposed to cry, baby)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You've given so much to my life)

Thank you, lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you, honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love would mean
Now I know that I didn't know much
'Cause you taught me everything
You might also like
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not supposed to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You've given so much to my life)

Oh, God so loved the world
That He blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart
Now I'm giving it to you, baby
And these tears I cry are tears of joy
My happiness, I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me

I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not supposed to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You, you, you've given so much to my life)
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not supposed to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(Oh, you've given so much, so much, so much to my life, baby)
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Oh, let me cry, baby)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(Oh, don't let me, don't, don't, don't let me)
I can't hold back these tears
