Can't you see the soldiers
I seen them marching
Whole lotta soldiers
I seen them marching
I seen tin soldiers, I hear them coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio (Yah!)

Soldiers, I hear them marching
Soldiers, I hear them marching
Soldiers, I see them come
I seen tin soldiers with guns, they are coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down, Lord
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How could you run when you know?
When you know, how could you run?
When you know, how could you run?
Yah!

Tin soldiers with guns, they're coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago now
What if you knew that girl
And found her dead on the ground
How could you run when you know?
Tell me how could you run
Run when you know?
How could you run, run when you know?
You gotta tell me, tell me
How could you run?

Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio (Tell me why)
Four dead in Ohio (You gotta tell me)
Four dead in Ohio (Tell me why)
Four dead in Ohio (You gotta tell me)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
Four dead in Ohio (Tell me why)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)

Machine guns, bullets flying
Children run, mothers screaming (Father, forgive them)
Machine guns (for they know not)
Bullets flying (what they do)
Machine gun, bullets flying (blessed are)
Children scream (the pure in heart)
(For they) The fellas run (shall see God)
Mothers mourn (blessed are, the meek)
(For they) Machine gun (shall inherit the Earth)
Carry my body (Lord, have mercy, forgive them), machine gun
(For they know not, what they do) Carry my body
(Forgive them, they know not what they do)
Jimi Hendrix would say
Machine gun, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me
Machine gun, machine gun, don't, don't
Tell me why, you gotta tell me
I wanna know why, you gotta tell me
Somebody take the time to explain
Why the machine gun bullets are flying flying like rain

Four dead, Ohio
