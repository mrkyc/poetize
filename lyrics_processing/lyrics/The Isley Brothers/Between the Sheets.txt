Hey girl, ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me
Sharing our love between the sheets

Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
I feel your love surrounding me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh baby, baby
Making love between the sheets

Ooh girl, let me hold you tight
And you know I'll make you feel alright
Oh, baby girl just cling to me and let your mind be free
While making love between the sheets
Oh girl, I'll love you all night long
And I know you felt it coming on
Ooh darling, just taste my love
Ooh, you taste so sweet
Sharing our love between the sheets

Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
I feel your love surrounding me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh, baby, baby
We're making love between the sheets
You might also like
Hey girl, what's your fantasy?
I'll take you there to that ecstasy
Ooh girl, you blow my mind
I'll always be your freak
Let's make sweet love between the sheets

Ooh, baby, baby
I feel your love surrounding me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, baby, baby
Making love between the sheets
Ooh, baby, baby
Feel your love surrounding me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, baby, baby
Making love between the sheets

Enough of this singing, let's make love
In between the sheets
Oh, I like the way you receive me (Receive me, receive me)
Girl, I love the way you release me
I'm coming, coming on strong (Coming on strong, sweet darling)
In between the sheets
Oh, I like the way you receive me (Receive me, receive me)
Girl, I love the way you release me
I'm coming, coming on strong (Coming on strong, sweet darling)
In between the sheets
Oh, I like the way you receive me (Receive me, receive me)
Girl, I love the way you release me
Coming, coming on strong (Coming on strong, sweet darling)
In between the sheets
You got me moaning
Girl, you got me groaning
I'm coming, coming on strong (Sweet darling)
In between the sheets
Let's get all the way down
Turn it over
I'm coming, coming, coming, coming, coming on strong (Sweet darling)
In between the sheets
Dadada-dadadada-da-da
Dadadadada-dada
Dadada-dadadada-da-da
