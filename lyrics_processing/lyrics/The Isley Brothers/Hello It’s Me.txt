Hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, girl
Hello, hello, oh
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, ooh

Hello, it's me, it's me, baby
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
I can't help it, baby
Seeing you, yeah, seeing anyone as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through, baby
You know why, ah yeah

It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe
You might also like
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
But one thing I want you to do is

Think of me, think of me, baby
You know I'd be with you if I could
Come around and see you once in a while
If you ever need a reason to smile
I'd spend the night if you think I should
Well

It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change

Don't change, baby
Oh, keep everything the same, baby
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
Girl, don't you move too far, girl
I'll come around, come around and see you every once in a while
If you ever need, ah, if you ever need a reason to smile, baby
Just don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ah, oh
(Don't change, don't change)
Keep everything the same, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Think about me, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Don't change, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep every, everything the same
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Well, well, well, well, well
