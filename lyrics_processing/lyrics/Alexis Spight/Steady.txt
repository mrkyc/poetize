Wondering how to take the next big jump
Don't know how to get over it
I think I need to sit before I have a bigger man
I just can't quit, going out of my mind
My God, I need to chill before I'm left behind
When you crack the sky I wanna be ready
Not stressing over this, Lord keep it steady
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
Lord keep me steady, I need You to keep me steady
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
Lord keep me steady, keep me steady
Keep me grounded
Oh, so brokenhearted and confused
Been hurt within the church, all beaten and bruised
Don't wanna be alive
I just can't make it, oh Lord, give me strength
Help me make it
I'm contemplating, I'm running away
Caught up in the world I need the faith to pray
I choose today, I wanna be saved
Tired of playing games, Lord have your way
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
Keep me steady, I need You to keep me steady
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
Keep me steady, keep me steady
Keep me rooted and grounded
Just wanna be in Your will
Lord, keep me steady
Oh, God, oh God
I just wanna be steady
Like a tree planted by the rivers of water
Keep me steady, keep me steady
Don't move me
Don't take Your hands off of me
Keep me steady, keep me steady
I wanna be grounded, wanna be grounded in You, God
Just wanna be steady, so much is going on
But I wanna be in Your will, wanna be in Your way
I wanna be steady, Oh yeah
Cover me
I wanna be steadfast, I wanna be unmovable
Not easily broken no matter what comes my way
I wanna be steady, keep me in Your will God
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
Keep me steady, I need You to keep me steady
Like a tree, planted by the rivers of water
