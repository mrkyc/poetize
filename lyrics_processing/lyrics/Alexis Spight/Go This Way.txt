Don't matter how you feel
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Seems everybody wanna
They wanna do their own thing
They're living with no compass
So how they gone go the right way
Please somebody tell me
When did it become wrong to pray?
Seems all of our values and all of our morals are getting flushed down the drain
Something deep inside me
Keeps telling me to go and run my race
Keep moving my feet, oh I gotta do it, don't change my perspective
I can't do it cause everybody around me
Keeps telling me follow and go that way
But I ain't gonna go, no, I can't do it, You can tell me what you want, oh oo woah oh oh oh
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel, no no no
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
What used to be ups now downs downs
What used to be ins now outs outs
I don't know how we got so turned around
Eventhough it may look attractive
It don't mean you ain't goin backwards
You can go but I'm gone stand my ground
Something deep inside me
Keeps telling me to go on and run my race
Keep moving my feet, oh I gotta do it, don't change my perspective
I can't do it cause everybody around me
Keeps telling me follow and go that way
But I ain't gonna go, no, I can't do it, You can tell me what you want, woah oh woah oh oh
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel, nooo
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Theres so much pressure to be status quo
But my heart just lets me know that im heading the right direction
Even though I know the goal is to mislead, I must proceed, so I follow what I believe
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter how you feel, nooo
Don't matter how you try
I done made up my mind that I'm gonna go this way
I don't care what you say
I don't care how you feel
