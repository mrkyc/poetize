Imagine me
Loving what I see when the mirror looks at me cause I
I imagine me
In a place of no insecurities and
I'm finally happy cause
I imagine me
Letting go of all of the ones who hurt me
Cause they never did deserve me
Can you imagine me?
Saying no to thoughts that try to control me
Remembering all you told me
Lord, can you imagine me?
Over what my mama said
And healed from what my daddy did and
I wanna live and not read that page again
Oh, oh...
(Imagine me) Imagine me, (being free) being free
Trusting (trusting) you (you) totally (totally, finally)
I can... (I can imagine me)
I will admit it was hard to see
You being in love with someone like me.. yeah
Finally I can...
Imagine me
Being strong
And not letting people break me down
You won't get that joy this time around
Imagine me
In a world where nobody has to live afraid
Because of your love, fear's gone away
Can you imagine me?
Letting go of my past and
I'm glad I have another chance and
My heart will dance
'Cause I don't have to read that page again
Ooh
(Imagine me, being free) Oh, I can change myself, (trusting you totally) oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah. (Finally, I can...imagine me)
(Rap)
I used to beat myself up all the time
Always been strange so I thought I'd never shine
Trying to be accepted, always was rejected
But the Lord held me in his hand
Kept me in his plan
I thought I would go astray
But he kept me by his grace
It's only by his grace that I'm standing here today
I can smile at you and say that I'm free, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh can you imagine me? (Bye bye) Oh... (So long)
So long (Bye bye)
Look at your problems (So long) and tell 'em bye bye (Bye bye)
My fears, (So long) my insecurities, (Bye bye) You have no place here (So long)
It's all gone. (Bye bye) All gone. (So long) Bye bye. (Bye bye) Bye bye. (So long)
You have no place here. (Bye bye) Bye bye. (So long)
Can you imagine me?
