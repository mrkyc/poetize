Every Friday night this old town comes alive
And paints a neon scene
One by one, they're lining up
To fill their cups and cash in all their dreams
Well I'll stop by for just one round and then I'm out of town
To the place I need to be
And when I get up here, I like to kick the headlights off so I can see
Sometimes it's hard to think with all the bright lights and the bars
So here I am, six-pack in hand, just staring at the stars

And laid back on this faded hood, filling my cup
All systems good for launch
I pour it up and burn it down
Get so high above this town, I'm gone
And I wish that I could stay up here and far away
From gravity

Looking down on that broken town
All the what-ifs and I-coulda-beens
The same old story every day
That I just can't stand to hear again
See, I been down there all my life
And somehow it's never felt like home
But up here in the stars
I think I found a place where all my dreams belong
Someday I know I'm going to find a way to blow this town
But until then, I'll drive up here so it don't pull me down
You might also like
And laid back on this faded hood, filling my cup
All systems good for launch
I pour it up and burn it down
Get so high above this town, I'm gone
And I wish that I could stay up here and far away
From gravity

Just laid back on this faded hood, filled my cup
All systems good for launch
I pour it up and burn it down
Get so high above this town, I'm gone
And I wish that I could stay up here and far away
