We were the drifters, jokers
Somebody you just saw in the hallway
Got our kicks between class
Spittin' dip, talkin' trash, breaking rules and making bad grades
And taking the long way home
With the 3-6 up and the windows down
We didn't know back then but I sure know now

We were the lucky ones raised up to be fighters
Swinging at everything that we could see through hungry eyes
We were the lucky ones, hellbent and full of fire
And giving it everything we had to keep our dreams alive
We were poor and we were wild and we were young
And we were the lucky ones

Between the blood and the sweat, calloused hands
You can bet working hard is all we've ever known
And all of the girls and the cars, busted lips, broken hearts
Came alive out on those back roads
Just a bunch of small town kids
Looking for trouble when the sun went down
The best nights of our lives was all we found
You might also like
We were the lucky ones raised up to be fighters
Swinging at everything that we could see through hungry eyes
We were the lucky ones, hellbent and full of fire
And giving it everything we had to keep our dreams alive
We were the lucky ones

We were poor and we were wild and we were young
And it made me into the man I have become
'Cause I was a lucky one
Raised up to be a fighter
Swinging at everything that I could see through hungry eyes

We were the lucky ones, hellbent and full of fire
And giving it everything we had to keep our dreams alive
We were poor and we were wild and we were young
We were the lucky ones
We were the lucky ones
