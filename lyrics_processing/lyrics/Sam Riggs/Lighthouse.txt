You might say I'm just a never was
I'm a little bit of both now and then
Never really stood to fight for much
But something happened when your eyes met mine
I became a different man
Heard a whisper screaming deep inside
You better ask that girl to dance
So when the lights went down
The band cranked up
We stepped out on that floor
Started out with one slow dance
I got something worth fighting for
Never been the kind to turn around
Shots fired I won't hit the ground
When your back's against the wall you know exactly where I'll be
I'll be standing tall against the waves
Just like a lighthouse in a hurricane
I'd have everything to lose and nothing left to gain
If I had you
I drink my liquor from the bottom shelf
Smoke it if it burns
Know I'm gunna have the devil to pay
When it comes my turn
But I wouldn't ever do you wrong
I got everything to prove
Never wanted someone so strong
Until I saw you

The band tears down
I'll be the one to take you home
And when the night winds blow
You're never gunna be alone
Never been the kind to turn around
Shots fired I won't hit the ground
When your back's against the wall you know exactly where I'll be
I'll be standing tall against the waves
Just like a lighthouse in a hurricane
I'd have everything to lose and nothing left to gain
If I had you
Never been the kind to turn around
Shots fired I won't hit the ground
When your back's against the wall you know exactly where I'll be
I'll be standing tall against the waves
Just like a lighthouse in a hurricane
I'd have everything to lose and nothing left to gain
I'd have everything to lose and nothing left to gain
