Look at you
You captivate 'em across the room
Draw 'em closer with every move
You got 'em buzzin' like neon
And there you are
A silhouette inside a smoky bar
You string 'em up just like an old guitar
And then you play 'em like a sad song
And they don't need to pay to keep you talking
Do you lead them all on one drink at a time

I'm going to sit back and watch this show unwind
Though the breakdown's coming, it's a matter of time
The clock strikes midnight, you'll have them out on the floor
Heart on the line and love on your lips
You're locking them down with a swing of your hips
They're falling for you, I've seen this all before
Oh they'd give anything in this world
But they just don't know that you can't break the heartbreak girl

It's no surprise and honey I can see it in your eyes
With every double shot of 90-proof lies
You're dancing closer to the edge
The way you're on this tightrope line you're walking
You don't seem to give a damn about the fall
You might also like
I'm going to sit back and watch this show unwind
Though the breakdown's coming, it's a matter of time
The clock strikes midnight, you'll have them out on the floor
Heart on the line and love on your lips
You're locking them down with a swing of your hips
They're falling for you, I've seen this all before
Oh they'd give anything in this world
But they just don't know that you can't break the heartbreak girl

Sugar there you go in your black dress, black dress
I'm doing what I can to make the best out of this
Took me a while to see, it's got nothing to do with me
You set 'em up, set 'em up, knock 'em down
I should've known better when you came around
I guess that I was hoping that I would prove 'em wrong
You were breaking hearts all along

I'm going to sit back and watch this show unwind
Though the breakdown's coming, it's a matter of time
The clock strikes midnight, you'll have them out on the floor
Heart on the line and love on your lips
You're locking them down with a swing of your hips
They're falling for you, I've seen this all before
Oh they'd give anything in this world
But they just don't know that you can't break the heartbreak girl
Oh you can't break the heartbreak girl
