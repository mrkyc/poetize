You never had a clue
I stood in the doorway
And you simply walked right through me
Just like that
Never knew that I was back
It didn't take you long at all to realize I was there
I picked up my picture and I held in the air
For you to see
That feeling in the room was me
Feel that rush
Just remember my touch on your skin
Baby, take it in
Let it take you back again
Every moment you ever wanted is right there in your hands
Just remember that you can have me back when the lights go out
You can feel the cold come in
No matter where you stand
The feeling that someone is there
About to take your hand is too much
It's close enough to touch
I can be your shadow
Drive you crazy all day long
Have you out of your mind by the time that you get home
Can't you see that's right where I want you to be
You might also likeFeel that rush
Just remember my touch on your skin
Baby, take it in
Let it take you back again
Every moment you ever wanted is right there in your hands
Just remember that you can have me back when the lights go out
Close your eyes to feel me run my fingers through your hair
In the darkness of the night
I'll always be right there next to you
There's nothing you can do
Cause in your arms I always found
The things I love the most
That remains the same even though I am a ghost
It's True
I'm still in love with you
Feel that rush
Just remember my touch on your skin
Baby, take it in
Let it take you back again
Every moment you ever wanted is right there in your hands
