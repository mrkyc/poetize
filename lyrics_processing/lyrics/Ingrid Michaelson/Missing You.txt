He's got his hands in all the right places
But the wrong face is in front of me
I close my eyes and see you so clearly
But you're not here and it's killing me

And I don't wanna be dramatic
But your, but your lips are like a drug and I'm an addict
And I can feel you through the static
We're electric, don't you get it? We're so automatic

You're in my head again
I can't get you out
I try but you just never move
I'm in his bed again
Feeling like a stranger
When he's kissing me, I'm missing you
Kissing me, I'm missing you

He's kissing me, I'm missing you
Kissing me, I'm missing you

You lay beside me in my bedroom
Never made a move but I wanted to
You sleep and I stare at the ceiling
Counting my feelings, they were all for you
You might also like
And I can feel you through the static
We're electric, don't you get it? We're so automatic

You're in my head again
I can't get you out
I try but you just never move
I'm in his bed again
Feeling like a stranger
When he's kissing me, I'm missing you
Kissing me, I'm missing you

He's kissing me, I'm missing you
Kissing me, I'm missing you

So take me in your arms
Tell me all your secrets in the dark
I don't wanna fake it anymore
And I don't wanna be dramatic

You're in my head again
I can't get you out
I try but you just never move
I'm in his bed again
Feeling like a stranger
When he's kissing me, I'm missing you
Kissing me, I'm missing you
(You're in my head)
He's kissing me, I'm missing you
(In my head again)
Kissing me, I'm missing you
(You're in my head)
He's kissing me, I'm missing you
(In my head again)
Kissing me, I'm missing you
