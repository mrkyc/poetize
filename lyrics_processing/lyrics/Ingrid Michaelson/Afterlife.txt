Taking everything that you know
What you didn't know
Is that we can go forever if we want to
We can live inside of a moment
The one that we own
You and me we got this
You and me we're beautiful, beautiful
We all, we all, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
We all, we all, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife
Living like you're dying isn't living at all
Give me your cold hands put them on my heart
Raise a glass to everyone who thinks
They'll never make it through this life
To live a brand-new start
You and me we got this
You and me we're beautiful, beautiful
We all, we all, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
We all, we all, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife

Telling me not to run, not to worry anymore
I can hold on tight to nothing better than the rest
So it's now or never more
We all, we all, we're gonna be alright
We got the fight in us
We all, we all, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife
We all, we all, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
We all, we all, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife
We all, we all, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
We all, we all, we're gonna live tonight
