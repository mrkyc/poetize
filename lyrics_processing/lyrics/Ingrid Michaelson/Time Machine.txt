You lit the fire, then drank the water
You slammed that door, and left me standing all alone
We wrote the story, we turned the pages
You changed the end like everybody said you would

I should've seen it coming
It should've sent me running
That's what I get for loving you

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me, "run!"
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me, "run!"
"Run!"

I got your letters, I got your words (your words)
I stacked them high and lit 'em all and let 'em burn
Your broken sorry's don't mean a thing
You made that bed, good luck falling back asleep
You might also like
I should've seen it coming
It should've sent me running
That's what I get for loving you

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me, "run!"
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me, "run!"
"Run!"

Oh, your love, it got me higher
Then it drove me up the wall
But the higher up you go
The further you will fall
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Run!

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me, "run!"
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me, "run!"
If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me, "run!"
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me, "run!"
