And take one long look
At page after page
I took the left stage
Never taking the time to age
(child at the cent.)
I float like a butterfly
Never touch the ground
Wearing caps
These crazy hats
They all stare
In my company
They want a piece of me
I'm the little man that flaunts the big man
(from the bottom)
Big beats
For the kids
And looking for the wrong man
We know
These egocentric cities gonna' break down
And if the girl's too pretty
It's a shakedown
She's got a smile so sweet
Oh Feet don't fail me now
...
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
You might also likeRecollect the second we step from my daddy's pad
Make the most with the clothes that we had
So hard to bark
If the boss do together
Tell me you little lunatics would ever do it better
Play another Custom King thing and I'll step
Just like the Rodney
I get no respect
I'm begging you to take me where nobody stares
Nobody look at me and nobody cares
We know
These egocentric cities gonna' break down
And if the girl's too pretty
It's a shakedown
She's got a smile too sweet
Oh Feet don't fail me now
...
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Up late tonight
I got it right here
In my hands is the key to my plan to see
I know the clock said quarter to three
But I can't go to sleep
'till I got what I need
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
All alone if I'm 'a get right
Sweetheart gonna' stay up late tonight
