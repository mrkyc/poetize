Seems like everybody here
Is speaking different languages (Ha, ha, ha)
With that green prescription fog
Blowing out their faces (Ha, ha, ha)

And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sunrise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson (Ha)
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

'Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (Just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

Twenty-seven blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye (Ha, ha, ha)
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright (Ha, ha, ha)
You might also like
And they're sending pictures, kissing on each other, like wasted
And on top of that, they're sending videos of them naked
But you know I don't judge what's on your tongue
Yeah, I know you're having fun (Ha)
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (Just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

(Hell no's and headphones)
Hell no's and headphones

'Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (Ooh)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone (I just wanna be alone)
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home (Home, home)
