You're unresponsive by nature
Heartbeat as cold as a glacier
You told me I was your savior
We used to burn up like paper

So don't let this fire burn out yet
'Cause we've got a lot to burn
Don't let this fire burn out yet

Oh, when the morning comes, can we change our minds?
So we don't have to say that at least we tried
Ooh, and I won't have to find out, baby
How much does it take for a heart to break?
How much does it take for a heart to break?

I know that it can get crazy
Love me and sometimes you hate me
But you're not a god to me either
We've never felt nothin' deeper

So don't let this fire burn out yet
'Cause we've got a lot to burn
Don't let this fire burn out yet
