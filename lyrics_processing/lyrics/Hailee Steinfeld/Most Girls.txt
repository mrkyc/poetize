(Staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)

Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothing but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day
No two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

(Staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
(Staying out late 'cause they just celebrating)
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
