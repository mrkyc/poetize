Wakin' up, wakin' up
In a T-shirt that says, I'm
Too busy doin' nothing
Rollin' up, oh, I'm rollin' up
To the kitchen to get some
Froot Loops in the morning'
And all I want, baby, all I want
Yeah, all I wanna be
Is sprawled out on the mattress, uh
But now you're takin' up, oh, you're takin' up
Yeah, you're takin' up the space
Layin' where my chest is

And I'm used to doin'
What I want, when I want
And now you're occupyin' my brain a lot, yeah
And I'm used to doin'
What I want, when I want
And now you're occupyin' me

And I could get used to this
Oh, I could get used to this
Lips on my lips like this
Pulse on my skin like this
I could get used to this
Oh, I could get used to this
Body on mine like this
All of the time like this
You might also like
Move your seat, the driver's seat
Back to me and breathe
Readjust my mirrors
I keep you safe, yeah, I keep you safe
When you're drinkin' that red cup
Red cup, all clear, yeah

And I'm used to doin'
What I want, when I want
Now you're occupyin' my brain a lot, yeah
And I'm used to doin'
What I want, when I want
Now you're occupyin' me

And I could get used to this
Oh, I could get used to this
Back from a night like this
Hand on my chest like this
Oh, I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Hands on the floor like this
Us here alone like this
You know I didn't realize that it could be this good
I underestimated it, mated it
You know I didn't think that it would take this long
Just to get acclimated to it, but it did

And I could get used to this
Oh, I could get used to this
Back from a night like this
Makin' it last like this
Oh, I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Body on mine like this
