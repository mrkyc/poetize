(Hey)
Yeah

When I get chills at night, I feel it deep inside
Without you, yeah
Know how to satisfy, keepin' that tempo right
Without you, yeah

Pictures in my mind on replay
I'm gonna touch the pain away
I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name

I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
I love me
You might also like
I take it nice and slow, feeling good on my own
Without you, yeah (Hey)
Got me speakin' in tongues, the beautiful it comes
Without you, yeah (Hey)

I'm gonna put my body first
And love me so hard 'til it hurts
I know how to scream out the words
Scream the words

I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
