Da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaaa-daaa-da-da-da-da
I need you, yeah

You can't doubt the rainfall
When you see the ground is wet
Just like that, girl, you can't forget
How I feel about you, baby
So you can't doubt that I would call
Right in the nick of time
You can't doubt you on my mind, I'm thinking 'bout you, girl
We've been down this road before (This road before)
But if you're doubtful let me reassure

I need you like the air
I need to breathe (To breathe), made just for me (For me)
And I need you like the skies needs sun to shine (To shine)
Glad you are mine (Are mine)
'Cause I need you, I need you

Singing oh, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you
You might also like
You can't doubt that I will be the answer to what you need
I won't freeze (Girl, when you need me), I won't leave
And you can't doubt that I'll ease all your worry and all your fears
In a hurry, oh, I'll be here, I'll be here
We've been down this road before (This road before)
But if you're doubtful let me, let me reassure

I need you like the air
I need to breathe (To breathe), made just for me (For me)
And I need you like the skies needs sun to shine (To shine)
Glad you are mine (Are mine)
'Cause I need you, I need you

Singing oh, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you

Like the entry way (Way) into Heaven's gate
(I need you to) open up
(I need to be) inside your love
Lying face to face (Face)
What more can I say
Except I need you more than ever
I need you in every way
I need you like the air
I need to breathe (To breathe), made just for me (For me)
And I need you like the skies needs sun to shine (To shine)
Glad you are mine (are mine)
'Cause I need you, I need you

Singing oh, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you
Singing oh, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you

Singing oh yeah, oh yeah
