Mister Ron Isley

Ain't no need to fear 'cause I got this here
Victory my final destination

What you want me to roll? Seven? Eleven? (Double down)
Any time I'm starting a game, it's automatic, I'm gonna win it all
Give me the ball, the game is on the line, we a few points behind
Pump it, fake it, shake it, bake it (Swish), and watch it fall

(Put your money on me) Put it on me, baby

Ay, it's a win-win, you can bet the whole house
Pimpin' always stayed down, he ain't never sold out
Same way I came in, that's the way I'm going out
On my own two, still doing numbers in the drought
Shawty, what you know about five-deuce-four-trey
A thousand say a four or better, drop my money, okay?
If you trust me with your heart, I'll make it better, never worse
Let's be clear, listen here, I'm here to help, not hurt
I'll upgrade your shoes, Gucci, Louis, Jimmy Choos
Step your bag game up, I'll upgrade them, too
All the Giuseppe, Marc Jacobs, Valentino, Vera Wang
I can fit inside a Range - here's the keys, do your thang
Say goodbye to the pain and hello to the king
Everything you used to hate about your life is 'bout to change
I ain't a genie but I can your dreams come true
Tell the truth, lose only thing that I can't do

(Put your money on me) I can't lose
(If you wanna win, if you wanna win, if you wanna win, oh)
Put your money
(Put your money on me) All your money
(Put your money on me) I'm gonna hit a home run
('Cause you're gonna win, 'cause you're gonna win, 'cause you're gonna win, oh)
