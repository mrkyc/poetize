It was a day that I'm sure I'll never forget
She had a smile that Mona Lisa could not touch
She was looking over my way
I had to introduce myself, didn't want nobody else
She's not something you see every day
Got close and smelled the sweet perfume
I didn't have nothing to lose
She was so surprised when I walked up to her hands
Hello, hello, girl what's your name
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Girl don't say no if you feel the same
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
As I stood there hoping she would tell me yes
I was already thinking where I take her next yeah
Making reservation deep inside my head
For the night that she will never forget
So I had to introduce myself, didn't want nobody else
She's not something you see every day
Got close and smelled the sweet perfume
I didn't have nothing to lose
She was so surprised when I walked up to her hands
Hello, hello, girl what's your name
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Girl don't say no if you feel the same
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
'Cause your so amazing to me girl (Amazing)
I need to have you here in my world
No second best for me won't do
That's why I just got to be with you, hello
Hello, hello girl what's your name
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Girl don't say no if you feel the same
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Oh, hello
How about dinner and a movie
Don't say no
Hello, hello (Dinner and a movie)
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
(Dinner and a movie)
