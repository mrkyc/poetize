My baby won't talk to me
She givin' me the third degree
The peace is sho' nuff disturbed
I know I'm just gettin' on her nerve
She's the only one I need
We we're truly meant to be
Can't nobody keep it real like my girl
Nobody in the whole wide world

Come home to me, girl
I need you
I know it's hard to see, yeah (No, no-no, no, no, no)
Your love will always be my favorite thing (Oh yeah)

So if you meet her on Facebook, Tweet me (Tweet me)
My baby is the only one I freak, see (Yeah)
She can give it up for so long
Got a brother waitin' by the phone
And I love her like sweet potato pie (Yeah)
Her forever put a twinkle in my eye (Hey, girl)
Cold-blooded but I can't get enough (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, I love that girl so much
You might also like
Come home to me, girl (Come on home, babe)
I need you (Oh, I need you)
I know it's hard to see, yeah (I know, I know, I know, I know)
Your love will always be my favorite thing (Always, always)

Lil' mama is my favorite thing (Yeah)
She the kinda girl that make your heart sing
Like a fountain of love that you can't understand (Oh)
I know her body like the back of my hands
So know I'm her strength from way down south (Oh yeah)
Tenderoni take the words out your mouth
And the power of her love make you feel so good (Well, well, well)
That's why I love her like a grown man should

There goes my baby girl (My baby girl)
She is my favorite thing (There goes)
There goes my whole wide world (My whole world)
I love her always, my favorite thing

Yeah (My favorite thing, my-my-my, my)
Favorite thing, oh, I (My favorite, ooh)
My favorite thing, oh yeah (She's my whole world)
