How could we wreck this happy home?
How could we wreck this happy home?

Before everything fell to pieces
We was on some "you and me" shit
We was on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Ended up Jekyll and Hyde shit
You got me going through a midlife crisis
Even before I even hit my midlife crisis
I never thought that we would end up like this
A fairy tale gone wrong

Oh-oh-oh (How could we? How could we?)
How could we stray so far?
(How could we? How could we?)

How could we wreck this happy home? (Whoa-oh-oh)
How could we wreck this happy home? (Whoa-oh-oh)
How did we end up all alone? (Whoa-oh-oh)
How could we wreck this happy home? (Whoa-oh-oh)

Before everything got so psycho
We was on some Pippen and Michael
I told you, "Wherever you go, I go"
We turn up, watching everything spiral
But now I wonder, how'd it get so ugly?
That anyone could ever get so ugly
Can't believe you made me call the police
Where did we go wrong?

How could we wreck this happy home? (Whoa-oh-oh)
How did we end up all alone? (Whoa-oh-oh)

Don't let this slip away
Don't let this slip away
Don't let this slip away
