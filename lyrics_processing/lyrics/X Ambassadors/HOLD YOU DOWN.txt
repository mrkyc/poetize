We'll be the last ones dancing when the lights go out
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
We'll be the last ones dancing in the faceless crowd
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
I will still hold you down

Don't talk, but you speak so loudly
You smile, but your eyes look cloudy
You say someone left you broken
But I'm here with the door wide open

No matter what, no matter what, I'm yours
Lows and the highs, highs and the lows for sure
If you go to war, I go to war for you, for you

We'll be the last ones dancing when the lights go out
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
We'll be the last ones dancing in the faceless crowd
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
I will still hold you down

I'll hold you down (Ooh-ooh, down, ooh-ooh)
I'll hold you down (Ooh-ooh)
I'll hold you down
You might also like
Find me when the party's over
Ride home with your head on my shoulder
Last night's in the rear view mirror
Wake up and I'm still right here

No matter what, no matter what, I'm yours
Lows and the highs, highs and the lows for sure
If you go to war, I go to war for you, for you

We'll be the last ones dancing when the lights go out
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
We'll be the last ones dancing in the faceless crowd
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
I will still hold you down

I'll hold you down (Ooh-ooh, down, ooh-ooh)
I'll hold you down (Ooh-ooh, down)
I'll hold you down

And I'll hold you down (Ooh-ooh)
Anytime that you will fall (Ooh-ooh)
I'll be there to pick you up (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, I'll hold you down
We'll be the last ones dancing when the lights go out
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
We'll be the last ones dancing in the faceless crowd
When there's no one to hold you, I will still hold you down
