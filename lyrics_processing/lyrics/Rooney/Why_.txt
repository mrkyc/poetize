Baby, were you ever happy
Is it just lately
You seem like you just hate me
And last night
I keep on thinking about last night
It felt like we were over
You brushed me off your shoulder
You might also like
No, I don't want to lose you
If I stay, I lose you
Any way it goes
It all goes bad
Don't hold it all against me
Baby, I'm so sorry
And I don't, I don't know why

I want to throw it all away
Sabotage it, say goodbye, bye
I want to cry all night with you
But my heart is running dry
(I don't know why)
And I don't know why
(I don't know why, why, why, why)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Baby, why you wanna do this
I don't wanna keep on
Keep on going nowhere
It's not you
It doesn't seem like you
Maybe we're the wrong match
Maybe it's just timing

Why, why you wanna stay here
If there's no more love here
You know it's not the last time
You say you need changing
But are you rearranging
Your broken heart

I want to throw it all away
Sabotage it, say goodbye, bye
I want to cry all night with you
But my heart is running dry
(I don't know why)
And I don't know why
(I don't know why, why why, why)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(Let's see what you get)
(Let's see what you get, baby)

No, I don't wanna lose you
If I stay, I lose you
Any way it goes
It all goes bad
Don't hold it all against me
Baby, I'm so sorry
And I don't, don't know why

I want to throw it all away
Sabotage it, say goodbye, bye
I want to cry all night with you
But my heart is running dry
(I don't know why)
And I don't know why
(Running dry)
I don't know why, why why
Yeah, I can stay and say I do
I don't even wanna try, try
I could tell you want you want to hear
But I don't want to lie
(I don't know why)
And I don't know why
(I don't know why, why, why, why)

(Let's see what you get
Let's see what, what you get, baby
I don't know why
