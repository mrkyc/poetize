I like what you wear
And I like how you move
If I was starin'
It's because I'm in the mood
I'm down with your love
Come on, hold out your hand
I'll take you where I'm goin'
You wanna see the promised land

I tell you yes but you tell me no
I ask you why you never let me know
You close your eyes, I hold you tight
But it's no surprise, I got nowhere to go
Even if I try, try, if I lie
You're never gonna leave, leave me alone
I'm goin' home, you call my bluff
I can't get enough, can't get enough
(S-oh-oh)
I can't get enough
(S-oh-oh)

Give me a little time
Take my mind anywhere
Put on somethin' special
Anything, I don't care
Just don't tell your friends
There's nothing left to see
'cause if it gets around, it gets around
It's the end of me
You might also like
I tell you yes but you tell me no
I ask you why you never let me know
You close your eyes, I hold you tight
But it's no surprise, I got nowhere to go
Even if I try, try, if I lie
You're never gonna leave, leave me alone
I'm goin' home, you call my bluff
I can't get enough, can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
(No-no)

Don't blame yourself
Maybe I had too much to drink
One less margarita
One more trip to the shrink
(C'mon)
I tell you yes but you tell me no
I ask you why you never let me know
You close your eyes, I hold you tight
But it's no surprise, I got nowhere to go
Even if I try, try, if I lie
You're never gonna leave, leave me alone
I'm goin' home, you call my bluff
I can't get enough, can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
(S-oh-oh) Can't get enough
I can't get enough
