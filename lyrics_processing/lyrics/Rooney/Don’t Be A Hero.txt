Every time I look at you
I don't know what I should do
'Cause I don't speak your body language
When I'm on the rescue
I know why you're not coming over
You're holding out for someone better
Looking around for good men 
You're not getting any younger

Corona, tequila
A little marijuana's all
I need to help me
Bahama, Tijuana
Take me where you wanna go
Don't be a hero tonight

Don't be a hero tonight
Don't be a hero
Don't be a hero tonight
You gotta let it go
Don't be a hero tonight

Every time I try to speak
The last chance is calling me
Standing all alone and
Decomposing in the headlights
Another day I'll get it right
I'll save you on another night
But I got my hopes up
That this was my moment
You might also like
Corona, tequila
A little marijuana's all
I need to help me
Bahama, Tijuana
Take me where you wanna go
Don't be a hero tonight

(Don't be a hero tonight)
Don't be a hero
Don't be a hero tonight
(Don't be a hero tonight)
You gotta let it go
No, don't be a hero tonight

Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
Don't be a hero tonight
(Don't be a hero tonight)
Don't be a hero
Don't be a hero tonight
(Don't be a hero tonight)
You gotta let her go
No, don't be a hero tonight
Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
(Don't be a hero tonight)
Yesterday's fool won't live to fight
You'll be a hero another night
