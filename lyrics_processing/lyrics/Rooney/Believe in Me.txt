I can never win with you
I try but you don't let me through
What's the point in fighting when we're down?
I know I've been actin' strange
But wait, don't leave, I know I'll change
We're wasting all our time together now

Well I don't know what to say
Every word just makes you turn away
And I don't know what to do
Every day I wanna be with you
Well I've lost the battle and I'm losin' the war
And I keep on askin' myself what for
If you believe in fate, in destiny
Well then open your eyes and believe in me
Believe in me!
Believe in me!

I call you up and apologize
But you just think its one big lie
Well don't you know you're pushing me away?
You might also likeWe've been through so much together
You can't tell me the past will never
Mean a thing, it's more than a memory

I don't know what to say
Every word just makes you turn away
And I don't know what to do
Every day I wanna be with you
Well I've lost the battle and I'm losin' the war
And I keep on askin' myself what for
If you believe in fate, in destiny
Well then open your eyes and believe in me

Cause everyone I see around
Tells me that I'm such a fool
For makin' you my punchin' bag
When things really weren't that bad
I've lost you now
I've lost you now
(I've lost you now)
But I don't know how to get you back
I'm not myself
I'm not myself
I've gotta get us back on track
Well I don't know what to say
Every word just makes you turn away
And I don't know what to do
Every day I wanna be with you
Well I've lost the battle and I'm losin' the war
And I keep on askin' myself what for
If you believe in fate, in destiny
Well then open your eyes and believe in me
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
Believe in me!
