Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh

It comes around but never goes around
Pull the trigger but it doesn't make a sound
So strange how they never change
Over the 
It's always something, it's always nothing
Always find a way to get in the way
They can tell us that we don't know right from wrong
When they never ever heard us sing our song
But they don't know how the chorus goes
All they know is Barry Manilow
It's always something, it's always nothing
Sometimes you gotta just get up and run away

We burn a little brighter
We fly a little higher
We move a little faster, closer to disaster
My heart, my heart beats for you
You might also like
We hijacked our rapid honeymoon
Played along 'till we sounded out of tune
Can't believe what they see
They can't see what they can't believe
This pitter-patter, it don't matter
Sometimes you gotta throw your hands up in the air

We burn a little brighter
We fly a little higher
We move a little faster
Closer to disaster
My heart, my heart beats for you
We sing a little louder
We dance a little longer
We feel a little younger
We love a little stronger
My heart, my heart beats for you

Woah, oh (x4)
Woah, oh (x4)
Someday I'll find a way to be with you, to be with you (x2)
Someday
We burn a little brighter
We fly a little higher
We move a little faster
Closer to disaster
My heart, my heart beats for you
We sing a little louder
We dance a little longer
We feel a little younger
We love a little stronger
My heart, my heart beats for you
We burn a little brighter
We fly a little higher
We move a little faster
Closer to disaster
My heart, my heart beats for you
We sing a little louder
We dance a little longer
We feel a little younger
We love a little stronger
My heart, my heart beats for you
