And it's feelin' like old times
Standin' in line in the front of the club
You're drivin' around town
Blasting your mixes
Singin' along to the words you don't know
But it makes no difference
What I do, think, or say
There's no way to convince you, girls
That just ain't how you play
You set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
I should've been after you
I can tell by your shakin' hands that you want me
So baby don't hold back, go with the flow
I know it looks bad 'cause I kissed all your girlfriends
But that's what you get when you live in a small world
It's hard to look at me
When you know where my lips have been
Forgetting makes things easier
Forgive me and let me in
You might also likeYou set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
I should've been after you
You're gonna have to choose
Is it me or them?
That's the way it goes
Leave it all behind
All the baggage and dreams
I liked you from the start
I'll admit it now
Girl, I gotta have you
We don't have to tell anyone about our
Little secret
I know you feel it too
'Cause you're the only one who understands
You're wastin' all your time with someone else
You need another man
I could've been after you
But it makes no difference
What I do, think, or say
There's no way to convince you, girls
That just ain't how you play
You set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
But after last night we're through
Run along with your new boy
Don't be a sex toy
