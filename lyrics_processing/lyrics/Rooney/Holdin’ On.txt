I was young, I'd seen it all
A cemetery in the middle of a supermall
I went to school, I never learned
How it feels, how everything you love can burn
And it never stops, it's all I got
And I never know when to turn
Like a merry-go-round
It all comes around again

And I don't know why I'm here
I don't know where I'm going
If I don't give it time
How can this garden grow
I don't know what I've lost
And I don't know how to get it back
But I'm holdin' on
Yes, I'm holdin' on
For as long as I can

I moved away, I left the band
I saw it coming, it was written on the back of my hand
And every day, I could feel
Something missing, I went home to get a record deal

To them, it's just another meal"
Now I'm fat with regret
I'm placing my bet on me

And I don't know why I'm here
I don't know where I'm going
If I don't give it time
How can this garden grow
I don't know what I've lost
And I don't know how to get it back
But I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
Yes, I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
For as long as I can

It's not over yet, no
It's not even close
My heart is younger, stronger than
One hundred cowards' in a row
And all my curiosity will keep me
Asking what went wrong
When it's all done, when it's gone
No, it won't be long
'Til I'm traveling back in time
To a place when I was mine
Oh!


I don't know why I'm here
I don't know where I'm going
If I don't give it time
How can this garden grow
I don't know what I've lost
And I don't know how to get it back
But I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'm holdin' on
For as long as I can
For as long as I can
(Holdin' on, holdin' on)
(Holdin' on, holdin' on)
For as long as I can
(Holdin' on, holdin' on)
(Holdin' on, holdin' on)
