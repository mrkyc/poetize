And there you are
The mother sways her shins
Here comes the footstep of the man who'll make your dreams
The tube is fitted in
And there you are
The tepid sedative
Then a scream
Hold your placard up
Cold and coffee cup
After go to a bar
Hand your flier out
Must admire how
Dedicated you are
I don't wanna know
If you're havin fun
Or your maddens are on sale
I don't wanna know
If you've got a gun
Or a new stepson
Or you think you're gonna bail
Chris Hougan
She had to run
Last night been a lot of fun
But now it's French
A little tense
She hadn't done the reading
There she sat
Hoped to pass
Didn't think to face the fact that
Oh by gosh
Alas alack
Columbia is bleeding
Walkin down
Off the bus
Vickie Lucas crossed campus
Was thinkin how
She's made it now
That successful feelin
Walked by fast
Hailed a cab
No clue that she'd passed a lab
And while she's sittin in lit class
Columbia is bleeding
You might also likeThe surgeon is in town
And there you are
The clamp is comin down
Then a scream
Everybody knows
Protestors are those
Schmoes who don't have a life
See these scientists
Seekin differences
Have to suffer such strife
I don't wanna know
If you're havin fun
Or your maddens are on sale
I don't wanna know
If you've got a gun
Or a new stepson
Or you think you're gonna bail
Generalize
Proselytize
Words were spillin out their sides
As Charles Eise
Buys his supplies
Gets ready for a feedin
Tried for track
Hit the mat
Didn't think to face the fact
That while he's thinking
Man that's wack
Columbia is bleeding
Quite a snob
He didn't tip
Nice guy Rob watched the eclipse
Then looked around
I've made it now
I'm just so glad to be here
Made a pass
Got hand slapped
Didn't think to face the fact
That while he's mackin on that ass
Columbia is bleeding
You don't have a religion
But you have fingers ten
They clutch at your incision
You roll them up and
Then a scream
They're just animals
Make good edibles
Fester filth and disease
Check the bible son
We got dominion
We can do as we please
I don't wanna know
If you're havin fun
Or your maddens are on sale
I don't wanna know
If you've got a gun
Or a new stepson
Or you think you're gonna bail
Tee Tee Green
Mezzanine
Ended up beside the team
Then gave a cheer
Got some beers
With friends who started streakin
Back with Zach
Said "I look fat"
Didn't think to face the fact
That while she's under self attack
Columbia is bleeding
Rodney J
Began to pray
His momma lost her life that day
Had been a year
It wasn't clear
If he was safe or screamin
As he jabbed the bible flap
He didn't think to face the fact
That barbarism killed the cat
Columbia is bleeding
This is the Ivy League
Columbia is bleeding...
