I know we seek and we shall find
Somewhere to go
Mother please
I'm feelin low as can be
When will they see
Do you know you're always in my thoughts
I know protection can't be bought
Somewhere to hide
Mother please
I wanna cry
What a tease
When will they see
Come on
Now you got some time
I wanna hear it
Cuz I need an answer
I know youth dies young
But our youth's just begun
And ain't it a beautiful day
Cuz it's true
Baby
I need you
And damned if I say I do
Gertrude would approve
You might also likeI need you
In the mornin
I need you
In the silent afterglow
Won't you let my lovin show
Baby
Oh
Anyone can tow the line
Except for me
Cuz I'm a disco dancer
All my life I've been
A gopher with a grin
My smile is fadin' away
Cuz it's true
Baby
I need you
To shatter the status q
Truman would approve
I need you
In the mornin'
I need you
In the sunshine
Rain
Or snow
Won't you let my lovin' show
Baby
Otherwise I don't want to hear it
You got me talkin talkin talkin
Well it's better than you
Cuz I say
I don't wanna fear it
That look that says
Exactly what you think of me
Cuz that's when you would be free
From my love
My love
Baby baay-bee
Come on
Honey
Stop denyin
Or I'm forever gonna be a bachelor
Leave the steps of your house
Get down to the courthouse
Gimme a g and an a
Y
Cuz it's true
Baby
I need you
I'm damned if I say I do
Jesus would approve
I need you
In the morning
I need you
In the scarlet afterglow
Won't you let my lovin show
Baby
I need you
I need you
To sustain my sorry soul
Won't you let my lovin' show
Baby
I need you...

You got me talkin talkin talkin
Well it's better than you

To get over the rainbow...
