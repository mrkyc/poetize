You look funny
You're a retard dummy
A retarded dummy
Yeah you suck out of luck
You're no Playboy bunny
Hee hee
So you laugh, it's a gas
They're right on the money
They're just being funny, hysterically funny
Yeah I'm stupid it's true
Now can we be chummy?
Maybe
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you turn the other cheek
Don't wanna think about the schools in Bosnia
Don't wanna sing about food in Somalia
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
Graduate but too late
College will just hurt you
Soon they'll all desert you
Get your just desserts you
All essays MLA format they'll convert you
Could they?
So you try it's like pie
Get just more alert you
They'll not try to hurt you
Only you can hurt you
So you say, so you play
They would not subvert you
Would they?
You might also likeBut then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you get on through the week
Don't wanna think about the new armed forces
Don't wanna sing about no carriage horses
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
You pretend it's the end
Ah yes I'm all grown now
Uh-huh I'm at home now
Fool, you're never home now
Even this laugh'll pass
Go answer your phone now
You'll see
See I told you you're old
Now you're all alone now
Look ma how I've grown now
Ain't you proud I'm grown now
Look this head is all dead
See how much you've done now
You pussy
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you find the "om" you seek
Don't wanna think about the fall elections
Don't wanna sing about no vivisection
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
