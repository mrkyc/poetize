Cindy Lauper :
Sewed everything you said
Together in a thread
Repeating in my mind
Each word like a rhyme
Like a penny serenade
Looking through his song
He said the record's overplayed
But where did I go wrong
Nellie McKay :
You never stayed at first
Could not commit the time
Ignored all the quirks
But he still did the crime
And when he goes away
I know you'll call and cry
Cindy Lauper :
And when he calls up to tell
Now I'm gonna cry
Nellie McKay :
But I know you're mine
When you're on the line

Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Would you let him walk away
Cindy Lauper :
Got it stuck in my head
Nellie McKay :
Don't you hear a word I say
Cindy Lauper :
Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Every night the same old moan
It's ahhh, I'm waiting till my Joe comes home
Everytime he asks me how I feel
When I tell him, the phone goes dead
Nellie McKay :
I'm the queen of QVC
You're leaning on my ear
You mean the world to me
Though the connection isn't clear
Like my Ink Spots 78's
Convenient when you're low
Cindy Lauper :
Feel like an antelope on a nature show
Oh no!
I guess I gotta go
Nellie McKay :
But I know you're mine
When you're on the line

Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Would you let him walk away

Cindy Lauper :
Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Everytime we're on the phone
It's ahhh, I'm waiting till my Joe comes home
Cindy Lauper :
Hey !
Nellie McKay :
Cast away romance
Cindy Lauper :
What's it gonna take
Nellie McKay :
No knights with shiny armor
Cindy Lauper :
Hey !
Nellie McKay :
Try a different dance
Oh, I'm a real bee charmer
Cindy Lauper :
Well I scold and I scratched to make him stay
But he don't wanna know from me
Why that old alley cat, he runs away
Nellie McKay :
Lock the door and lose the key
Cindy Lauper :
Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Would you let him walk away
Cindy Lauper :
I got it stuck in my head
Nellie McKay :
Don't you hear a word I say
Cindy Lauper :
Is it something I said
Nellie McKay :
Every night the same trombone
It's ahhh, I'm waiting till my Joe comes home
Cindy Lauper :
Hey !
Nellie McKay :
Let's forget romance
Let's correct romance
With knights in shiny armor
What's it gonna take
Try a different dance
