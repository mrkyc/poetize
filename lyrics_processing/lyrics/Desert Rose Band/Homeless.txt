She started out a rodeo queen
Future looked just fine
Fell in love with a boy in school
Married an assembly line
They were huntin' down the american dream
Wonderin' where it'd gone
When they found themselves
To be fair game lost their home
He was laid off on a friday night went out
Drinkin' with his friends
She stayed in the car with the kids all night
He never came back again
Oh what was she to do
Where was she to go
Is home really were the heart is
When the heart can't feel at home
Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes
You might also likeHer time is now so precious
She hunts for work and food
Their clothes are torn and tattered
So her kids stay out of school
She looks for hope under every can
"at the sound of the tone
Just leave a message. we'll call you back"
But they know she's not at home
Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes
In this land of milk and honey
We share with all who need
Except the ones outside our door
The ones we cannot see
It's the proud, the true
The faithful left out in the cold
It's people just like you and me
At the end of the road
Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes
