My home town is filled with broken dreams
Folks back there are running from life it seems
I left as a young man running from a memory
I'm still running, i'll always be running
My father died a broken man by his own hand
One of life's casualities lost in the sand
He showed us a way to love a way to understand
He's finally stopped running, oh he's finally stopped running
I can still see the fire in his eyes when he held my mom tight
The love in his heart when he made it all right
Race in his mind that was never won
So if you're gonna run, what you running from
The years flew by like a runaway train
I never caught up i never got used to change
'cause change is the only thing that i've ever known
I'm still running, yeah, and i'm still running
I can still see the fire in his eyes when he held my mom tight
The love in his heart when he made it all right
Race in his mind that was never won
So if you're gonna run, what you running from
You might also likeWith my face to the wind i stand all alone
Scattered memories taking all i own
A families love can help you along
But i'll always be running
Yeah, i'll always be running
I can still see the fire in his eyes when he held my mom tight
The love in his heart when he made it all right
Race in his mind that was never won
So if you're gonna run, what you running from
The fire in his eyes when he held my mom tight
The love in his heart when he made it all right
Race in his mind that was never won
