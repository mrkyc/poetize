She walked into the frame, she moved like water
Before I knew her name I knew I wanted her there
Now every other night we spend together
And all I wanna do is give her pleasure, yeah

But when I'm on her heart, she's coming down
When I'm showing up, she's not around
That makes the days when you're not at home
Shouldn't have opened up my heart

Gotta let me know if you feel the same
A girl like you shouldn't be playin' those games
Wanna show you more, give you all I got
She loves me so, she loves me not
Gotta let me know if you feel the same
A girl like you shouldn't be playin' those games
Wanna show you more, give you all I got
She loves me so, she loves me not

She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
You might also like
I watch her sleep just like an angel
But when she wakes she leaves right out of there
I know I'm playn in the danger
But I like the things she does to me, yeah

But when I'm on her heart, she's coming down
When I'm showing up, she's not around
That makes the days when you're not at home
Should have not opened up my heart

Gotta let me know if you feel the same
A girl like you shouldn't be playin' those games
Wanna show you more, give you all I got
She loves me so, she loves me not
Gotta let me know if you feel the same
A girl like you shouldn't be playin' those games
Wanna show you more, give you all I got
She loves me so, she loves me not

She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
But when I'm on her heart, she's coming down
She loves me not
But when I'm on her heart, she's coming down
She loves me not

Gotta let me know if you feel the same
A girl like you shouldn't be playin' those games
Wanna show you more, give you all I got
She loves me so, she loves me not

She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not
She loves me so, she loves me not

She loves me not
She loves me not
She loves me not
