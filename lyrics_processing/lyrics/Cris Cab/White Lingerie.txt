She screamed her love from the balcony
That's how she was, so young and free
She wanted to believe
I told her "wait at the corner store"
She's lightning quick, when it rains, it pours
A kind of love cash can't afford
I wanted to believe
She's got the voice of harmony
And the mind of Socrates
When we meet, it's in a Jeep
It's only you and me
While we sleep on scared grounds
We talk about this love we found
I feel the Earth and it's spinning round
Now we both believe
She's so young, yet so old
When she heard the wedding bells, she fell in love
With the fairy tale
She's so young, yet so old
When her father said "That even castles turn to sand someday"
Castles turn to sand someday
Even castles turn to sand someday
White flowers and white lingerie
The marching band with the red berets
The parents showed on wedding day
They wanted to believe
She's walking in just like the queen
But when she falls, there was no king
The bastard said she never wanted to believe
She's so young, yet so old
When she heard the wedding bells, she fell in love
With the fairy tale
She's so young, yet so old
When her father said "That even castles turn to sand someday"
Castles turn to sand someday
Even castles someday
Oh no, this isn't how it's all supposed to be
Things can change so easily
Oh no, all that remains has washed into the sea
So she'll just take her sweet time
She's so young, yet so old
When she heard the wedding bells, she fell in love
With the fairy tale
She's so young, yet so old
When her father said "That even castles turn to sand someday"
Castles turn to sand someday
Castles turn to sand someday
