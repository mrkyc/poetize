Once a caterpillar, now a butterfly
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
With them wings shes so fine
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
Everywhere we goes people stop and look
They love the girl, man she looking so fly
When the broken wings got clipped she learns to fly again
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
When the broken wings got clipped she learns to fly again
Shes so fly
Shes the perfect 10
Maybe up to 11
Look closer, shoes so new
Like the mattress of a movie scene
She knows shes the star
Shes so fly
Well undo it and itll make a bum
When she smile just turn me on
Like the worst in my favorite love song
Shes something like a phenomenon
Shes so fly
She said I never kissed a stranger
I said I never kissed an angel
I got this feeling that I wanna share
Youre the only one that can take me there
Once a caterpillar, now a butterfly
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
With them wings shes so fine
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
Everywhere we goes people stop and look
They love the girl, man she looking so fly
When the broken wings got clipped she learns to fly again
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
She will only stay if you let her fly away
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes got me dancing stupid
Guess all my words are useless
She knows just how to use it
Shakes her hips, get sushi choose it
And I hope its me
Girl you are all I see
The way you move in front of me
Shes so fly
So set your body free
And girl come close to me
She said I never kissed a stranger
I said I never kissed an angel
I got this feeling that I wanna share
Youre the only one that can take me there
Once a caterpillar, now a butterfly
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
With them wings shes so fine
Ive seen her fly fly fly fly
Everywhere we goes people stop and look
They love the girl, man she looking so fly
When the broken wings got clipped she learns to fly again
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
She will only stay if you let her fly away
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
When she catwalks just drive
Brazilian babies, she has more colors than the beeka
Shes so hot, baby the hell follows
Cuz they do it too tight, Marilyn Monroe
Seein Tenna, black magic woman
Ancient Cuban, European, middle eastern
All American but then in on the fantasy
Even girls are like dreams to me
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
When the broken wings got clipped she learns to fly again
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
She will only stay if you let her fly away
Shes so fly
Shes so fly
