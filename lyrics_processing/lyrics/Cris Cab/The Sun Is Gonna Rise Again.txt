Sun is gonna rise again...
No certainty no history, you've been here before
There's happiness and misery, there's martyrs and war
Like all your insecurities are coming to show, tell me how you gonna beat it
How do you feel about, watching the sun come out, alright
You're working and you're hurting 'cause they're pushing you down
The darkness gonna turn into the light
(Chorus)
I know that sometimes, the clouds are falling on your head, oh....
I know that sometimes. you're feeling like the rain won't end
The sun is gonna rise again...
The sun is gonna rise again...
So live and love tonight my friend
The sun is gonna rise again, ooh...
You know, there's one life, so life it to the fullest in the moonlight
I feel good, whenever you shine, that's when everything is alright
You got me asking asking, what's your passion passion, tell me what's your great escape, ooh...
You know you're smashing smashing, when you're laughing laughing, so show 'em there's a better way
(Chorus)
I know that sometimes, the clouds are falling on your head, oh....
I know that sometimes. you're feeling like the rain won't end
The sun is gonna rise again...
The sun is gonna rise again...
So live and love tonight my friend
The sun is gonna rise again, ooh...
There's no time for worry, no time for sorrow
(No time for sorrow yeah)
So let's take this night right into tomorrow, ooh
Sun is gonna rise again...
The sun is gonna rise!
Sun is gonna rise again...
Yeah, ooh!
