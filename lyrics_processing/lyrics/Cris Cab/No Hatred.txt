I would lose my way
I'd stumble through the darkness
To live another day
If only they could hear me
I'd have some words to say
Tell them all to go out and stop this game to play
Oh, told me that I'd never be found (I'd never be found)
Oh, and I'm nervous when I come around (yeah)
Oh, and I know because I'm standing my ground (standing here)
Oh, so I told them that I'd never fall down
We don't need your hatred
We only have one life
We don't need your progress
We see a different light
We only want our voices to let the truth be known
When the world is silent our brilliance will be shown
If someone took my breath out
How could I survive
The world would grow so lonely
As I laid down to die
If only they could help me
As my last chance to right
I'd give them all the wisdom
That the dying man provide
You might also likeOh, I told them not to stray away
Oh, but they all had some words to say (tell me something)
Oh, and I know because I'm standing my ground (standing here)
Oh, so I told them that I'd never fall down
We don't need your hatred
We only have one life
We don't need your progress
We see a different light
We only want our voices to let the truth be known
When the world is silent our brilliance will be shown
Say hey it will be okay
Round and round and round we go
Someday, you will see one day
That round and round and round we go
It's okay, you know that we don't play
So, round and round and round we go
Some say don't care what they say
So, round and round and round we go
We don't need your hatred
We only have one life
We don't need your progress
We see a different light
We only want our voices to let the truth be known
