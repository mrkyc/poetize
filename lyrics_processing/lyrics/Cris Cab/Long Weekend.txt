(Alright)
I was walking out the door on a friday, I couldn't make up my mind
And just when I pulled out of the driveway, I saw you as you walk right by
You have the light blue eyes and the red hot sun, you smiled right back and the party begun, now we're blasting the gun and the blues having fun, and we ain't going nowhere!
(Chorus)
When the night is almost over but everybody's jamming away, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
'Cause your drink's not getting colder but we're still getting older and say, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
(Woohoohoo, a long weekend yeah)
We watched the sun rise in the morning, shining bright in the (?)
Now you're swimming outside in the ocean, all day yeah you by my side
You have the light blond hair and the red hot sun when you smiled right back yeah the party is fun now we're blasting the gun and the blues having fun, and we ain't going nowhere!
(Chorus)
When the night is almost over but everybody's jamming away, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
'Cause your drink's not getting colder but we're still getting older and say, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
If I ever make it, all the way back home
I know you and I will never be alone
We'll go dancing in the moon, all night, long
Ain't nobody going, anywhere
(Slowly into the chorus)
When the night is almost over but everybody's jamming away, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
'Cause your drink's not getting colder but we're still getting older and say, you know it's gonna be a long weekend
(Woohoohoo, you know it's gonna be along weekend)
You know it's gonna be along weekend
(Woohoohoo)
You know it's gonna be along weekend
