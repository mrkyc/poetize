Whenever you need me, I'll come back to you
She's coming up on the corner
She had the light blue eyes with the yellow dress
That kind of girl that you wanted
Back when Biggie was alive and Obama smoke cigarettes
And every time she saw me I felt the chemical deep inside
And now she got to know me, I told her every word on my mind
I told you I won't waist your time
I'll give you all the stars that shine
Now is something that you know

Whenever you need me, I'll come back to you
I've got everything I want right now
Bur all I need is you
All I need is you

Get that freaky in the morning
I love the way you put it on me so I won't forget
And all day you know I wanted
Got me speeding right back in another day
I love the way you love me, you're the only one
And you don't got to worry cuz I got you forever
You might also like
Whenever you need me, I'll come back to you
I've got everything I want right now
But all I need is you

So let me tell you what I wanna do
I could take this higher than the mountain
Build the shelter of above up the falling rain
And every time you lead in my lovin'
I could put you in position that you can't explain
I wanna say you're the reason that the sun rise each and every season
Just call my name and I'll be there

Whenever you need me, I'll come back to you
I've got everything I want right now
But all I need is you
Whenever you need me, I'll come back to you
I've got everything I want right now
But all I need is you
But all I need is you
You're everything I ever needed
All I need is you
You're everything I ever wanted
All I need is you
I look into you're your eyes, I need that
Cuz all I need is you
You're everything I ever wanted
All I need is you
All I need is you
