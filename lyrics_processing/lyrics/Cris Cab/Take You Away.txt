I couldn't remember where we went wrong
I made my peace, and then I moved on
I picked up my notebook and wrote this song
Loving you is like a summer's day
You take all of my pain and my stress away
And for all of that, I feel I must say
You are truly beautiful in every single way
And hey, just know that I meant all I said
And though the thought of you comes to my head
See, I take with me all these dreams to my bed
'Cause I would have gone any place that you lead, so
I'll be here for a long time
Yeah I'll be making sure that you're feeling fine
And if you ever feel like it's just not your day
Yeah, I'll be waiting in the morning just to take you away
Like I said, it's been too long
You said your words, and then you were gone
And when there's nothing left to say
I only wanted you to go your way
Girl, you're like the sweetest thing I've ever known
And in your arms is a place I'd like to call home
You're always there even when I feel so alone
And the times when I feel like
I just feel like the time has never been this right
I could go out tonight, and we could take flight
If you feel me, come on
'Cause it's really too long
I'll be here for a long time
Yeah, I'll be making sure that you're feeling fine
And if you ever feel like it's just not your day
Yeah, I'll be waiting in the morning just to take you away
Girl, I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting for my breath to be taken away
You, you've got that something that I can't understand
But if I could be your man I would say
I'll be here for a long time
Yeah, I'll be making sure that you're feeling fine
And if you ever feel like it's just not your day
