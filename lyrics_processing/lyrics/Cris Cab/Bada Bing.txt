Friday night went on way too long
(Shit, I just don't remember)
I woke up in a stranger's home
(I had some other agenda)
After six shots of DeLeon
(More like thirteen but...)
You know that girl really turned me on (turned me on)

We were on the floor, and so much more
Kept moving that way
And we left the club and fell in love
And then I heard her say
"Let's go back to mine for a smoke and wine
If you want to you can stay."
But after all, I can't recall, I can't recall one thing
It's time for some action
Pure satisfaction
Who's the wild girl with turnt-up Jackson?
Loving with passion
Splishing and splashing
Up until the morning had to make a mad dash, and

Hey now, hey now
What a way to get it started
Hey now, hey now
I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Hey now, hey now
What a way to join the party
Hey now, hey now
I'm on the run, I'm on the run

Bada bing, bada boom, bada boom boom boom

Friday night went way too long
(It's all coming back to me, yeah)
Couple tokes and she was done
(And she kissin' on me, yeah)
She laid her head on the sofa bed
(I never felt so crazy)
And you know what happened then (what happened then)

We were on the floor, and so much more
Kept moving that way
And we left the club and fell in love
And then I heard her say
"Let's go back to mine for a smoke and wine
If you want to you can stay."
But after all, I can't recall, I can't recall one thing
