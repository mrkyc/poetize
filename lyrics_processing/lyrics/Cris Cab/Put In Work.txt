We in the stu stu studio
Uh, uh, stu stu studio
With Cris Cab in the stu stu put in work
Come on, uh

You know, summertime's comin'
Time for some action
So I pulled up on the block
Said hello to a girl with a very pretty accent
Could be spanish or italian
She was raised in Manhattan
Parents been in the Caribean
She's got a Miami back end

She's tryin' keep a guard up
But I'm tryin' to get the guard down
She's been hurt so many times
She don't wanan take her chance now
I would gladly risk it all
Climb mount Everest knowin' I might fall
Hold my breath 'till I get to Mars
Jump in front of a speeding car
Anything you want girl
Cause we living in a young world
You gotta put your back in
When everybody else is acting
Girls are you ready?
You might also like
You gotta put in work
Till your hands fall off
You gotta put in work
Till the clock runs out

You know 40 days and 40 nights
Since we first started talking
When I tried to turn the lights off
She said you got the crawl before you start walking
You said patience is a virtue
I can't wait any longer
Cause I've been sitting in your room
Tryna get a boom boom
And my feelings going stronger

She's tryin' keep a guard up
But I'm tryin' to get the guard down
She's been hurt so many times
She don't wanan take her chance now
I would gladly risk it all
Climb mount Everest knowin' I might fall
Hold my breath 'till I get to Mars
Jump in front of a speeding car
Anything you want girl
Cause we living in a young world
You gotta put your back in
When everybody else is acting
Girls are you ready?
You gotta put in work
Till your hands fall off
You gotta put in work
Till the clock runs out

Ain't no hocus pocus, ain't no abracadabra
If you want that girl, man
Gotta go head and grab her
Ain't no Centuria
Ain't no Ave Maria
If you want Maria gotta go and seek her

You gotta put in work
Till your hands fall off
You gotta put in work
Till the clock runs out
You gotta put in work
Till your hands fall off
You gotta put in work
Till the clock runs out

Turn up the guitar, Wyclef's 
Cris Cab, ladies all hands on deck, come on
