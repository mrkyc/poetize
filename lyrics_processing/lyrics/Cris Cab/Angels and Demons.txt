As I wake up from my sleep
I was dreaming I was in the North Pole
Ice beneath my feet
So beautiful it seemed
Then I realized I would never be warm
Without you next to me
I heard voices in my head
Wake up, you wake up and you run to her
After all the time we spent
I messed up, but I can't take anymore

Ooh she's like an open book
I sat and read it all
And understand that when I slip I fall
And ooh she's like an open book
I passed the pages through
And in the end I'm always back with you

A chill runs down my spine
Oh I can't take it
Memories when you used to be mine
The angel on my left shoulder
He's singing sad songs to me
Sad songs to me, sad songs to me
The demon on the right screamed over
He said you'll be just fine
Why can't you see, why can't you see
You might also like
Ooh she's like an open book
I sat and read it all
And understand that when I slip I fall
And ooh she's like an open book
I passed the pages through
And in the end I'm always back with you
You're all I see
You know I mean it
I'll be there when you need me
I wanted to say I want you to stay
So please take me back
Don't go away

Oohh, I should have never let you go
Oohh

Ooh she's like an open book
I sat and read it all
And understand that when I slip I fall
And ooh she's like an open book
I passed the pages through
And in the end I'm always back with you
You're all I see
You know I mean it
I'll be there when you need me
I wanted to say I want you to stay
So please take me back
Don't go away
You're all I see
You know I mean it
I'll be there when you need me
I wanted to say I want you to stay
So please take me back
