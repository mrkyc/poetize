It's been a couple years since I've been running
I've grown so far away out on my own
The air is full of ice and my path is haunted
The harder it's become to walk alone
And all these people bring me down
And I've been stuck here on the ground
So I pack up all my things and leave tonight

And I know when I make it there I'll leave it all behind
I'll take it slow, out in the open air
I'll find my peace of mind
I'm going home, I'm going home
Said I'm going home my friend
I'm going home, I'm going home
So I can't start this life again

It's harder to escape when you're still hurtin'
And every other step you take is pain
But I'll never turn around
Or I'll be stuck there in the ground
So I pack up all my things and leave tonight

And I know when I make it there I'll leave it all behind
I'll take it slow, out in the open air
I'll find my peace of mind
I'm going home, I'm going home
Said I'm going home my friend
I'm going home, I'm going home
So I can't start this life again
You might also like
You said that I could go back home
No matter how far how long from
I'm going home, I'm going home tonight, alright
You get a feeling when you can't resist
Kinds of bring you back into a world like this
When you were gone, gone gone
Ohh all I wanna do is gonna go back home
Some are waiting for me right behind the door
Looking for a body that can call it home
It's just 

And I know when I make it there I'll leave it all behind
I'll take it slow, out in the open air
I'll find my peace of mind
I'm going home, I'm going home
Said I'm going home my friend
I'm going home, I'm going home
