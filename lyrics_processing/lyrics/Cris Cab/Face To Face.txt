Staring at the crowd when you caught my eye
Time slowly ticking as I keep on standing by
Baby, If our eyes meet you already know
I'm already thinking of another place to go

There's a lot of people in a trance tonight
Playing all your games trying to make you mine
Getting even closer to the finish line
Looking over here, I can give you a sign

Yeah, I'm going to take you to another place
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, so you and I can meet face to face
Yeah, yeah
There won't be no problems, you, me and the comets
Nobody will find us, yeah, Yeah
Yeah, so you and I can meet face to face
Yeah, yeah

People see you staring thinking falling in love
They're always watching and eyes just can't get enough
Walking over here tryna get me alone
Your friends keep on calling but you just won't pick up the phone

Fingers intertwine, we both turn into one
