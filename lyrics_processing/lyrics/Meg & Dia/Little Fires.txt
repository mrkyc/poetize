We were haze
We were lost for days and feel forever gone
Stuck in a frame wash and melt away as winter hurried on
Built like a blade craving quietly at every dying pine
Dance in the flames siphoning your summers into mine

I still have a dream to sing of a kerosene
Cause you lit up my soul, took it fast burned real slow
You don't see the little fires when you're breathing in the smoke
I was buzzing off your words, woke up sober in your shirt
You don't see the little fires when you're not the one whose burned

Cut like a cold
And every memory was too heavy to hold
And tingled your words
They made no sense to me because you hurt me first

I still have a dream to sing of a kerosene
Cause you lit up my soul, took it fast burned real slow
You don't see the little fires when you're breathing in the smoke
I was buzzing off your words, woke up sober in your shirt
You don't see the little fires when you're not the one whose burned
You might also like
Can you hear me now
Can you see me now
Brightest just before we burn out
Can you hear me now
Can you see me now
Brightest just before we burn out

Cause you lit up my soul, took it fast burned real slow
You don't see the little fires when you're breathing in the smoke
I was buzzing off your words, woke up sober in your shirt
You don't see the little fires when you're not the one whose burned
Cause you lit up my soul, took it fast burned real slow
You don't see the little fires when you're breathing in the smoke
I was buzzing off your words, woke up sober in your shirt
