Your zippers are the cherry, but I don't feel anything
Your mind is stranded down now, I am closing you in my arms
And I prefer overweight than plastic any day
Hug me 'til you drug me, honey, hug me anyway
Your eyes are dusty, dirt porn magazines
You're lazy, selfish, but you were raised that way
It's a whore that here was bred
I'll take your pants, you take my hair, and let us dance
And cheers to happy and depressed
Hug me 'til you drug me, honey, hug me
Drug me 'til you love me, honey, love me any...
Wait. Wait
I swear I've seen that face somewhere
It's the very face I fell for in the human race
I can't lie, I was brainwashed to be honest
In this brave new world that slowly passes by
I'm just a girl learning to act as planned
I was programmed to be Catholic but I ran
I changed my race, I changed my name
I prayed to them, "Please, what is brave?"
I am loyal because I was simply raised that way
You might also likeHug me till you drug me, honey, hug me
Hug me till you suffocate me, honey, hug me any...
Wait. Wait
I swear I've seen that face somewhere
It's the very face I fell for in the human race
I can't lie, I was brainwashed to be honest
In this brave new world that slowly passes...
By the way, I never really liked your hands on me
Never liked your ideas of what is beautiful or real or truly holy
And I must say, you've thrown your apathy away
Grown back into your diapers, will you die first
Before admit the truth?
Wait. Wait
I swear I've seen that face somewhere
It's the very face I fell for in the human race
I can't lie, I was been brainwashed to be honest
In this brave new world that slowly passes by
I can't lie, I was brainwashed to be honest
In this brave new world that slowly passes by
I can't lie, I was brainwashed to be honest
In this brave new world that slowly passes by
Wait. Wait
I swear I've seen that face somewhere
It's the very face I fell for in the human race
I can't lie, I was brainwashed to be honest
