Don't tell me you're done for
I don't need to hear you're done for
You can tell me what you are running from
I need you more than you need you
I can see you're really, really running
May I ask you where you're gonna run to?
And you think you're living as a ghost now
Not quite heaven's ugly angel

We all feel like we're breaking sometimes
But I won't let you go tonight

Stay awake, stay awake, survive
I've got nineteen stars that I
Gave your name tonight
I wanna scream, wanna scream your name
Starlight, my life can save
You're my wish tonight

Don't tell me nothing matters
I'll tell you what, what matters
Bare feet in the summer
Open windows at night
You think that no one needs you
You have nothing to see through
Well, I need you, I need you
Don't I count in this fight?
You might also like
It's morning now, time to suffer again
A safety that drunk can't find

Stay awake, stay awake, survive
I've got nineteen stars that I
Gave your name tonight
I wanna scream, wanna scream your name
Starlight, my life can save
You're my wish tonight

No one can catch me
The way that you catch me
The way that you keep me when I'm out of time
What if I need you
When I can't see you?
I'm running out of life
No one can catch me
The way that you catch me
The way that you keep me when I'm out of time
What if I need you
When I can't see you?
I'm running out of life
Life
Life
Life
Yeah

Stay awake, stay awake, survive
I've got nineteen stars that I
Stay awake, stay awake, survive
Stay awake, stay awake, survive
Wanna scream, wanna scream your name
Starlight, my life can save
You're my wish (You're my wish)
Oh, you're my wish, my wish (You're my wish)
