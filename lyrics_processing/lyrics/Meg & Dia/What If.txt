Stand tall
Head and shoulders down
They don't make'm like us anymore
You failed to see that I am not your shadow
I can be more
You said the world is hard to face
I am your umbrella, Megan
But I can keep up with it's pace
If you let me go

What if I see you down the line
What if I've built up what was mine
What if I didn't forget passion like you did
(What if you)
What if I find my purpose first
What if I fulfill my life's work
What if you counting on my failure made me live
(What if you)

Not scared
I know you thought I was shaking fast in my own two shoes
But these soles could fight the ocean waves
Dirty laundry, and World War II
Finally I see past my front hands
Not a coward's pissed-stained pants
Thank you for telling me I can't
Without you, I wouldn't be where I am
You might also like
What if I see you down the line
What I took back my lost time
What if I didn't forget passion like you did
(What if you)
What if I find my purpose first
What if I fulfill my life's work
What if you counting on my failure made me live
(What if you)

If you see me again
You won't know my face
But you'll recall my hurt
Inside of me, a side of you is placed
When I see you again
I won't be bitter
You, you're so far to blame
You're part of this change
I have so much of you
I won't ever be the same

What if I see you down the line
What I took back what was mine
What if I didn't forget passion like you did
(What if you)
What if I find my purpose first
What if I fulfill my life's work
What if you counting on my failure made me live
What if you counting on my failure made me live
