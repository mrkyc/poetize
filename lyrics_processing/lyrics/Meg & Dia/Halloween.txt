Not used to losing someone
If I lost fate, was no choice I made
Except the excuse of no one
Your careful silence
Can't replace your stupid smiles
Casseroles and handshakes can't restore
Twelve damn years of ours, you stole me
I don't dare to try again
They said time will heal and time will mend
And on Halloween, the last time you left
If I knew you were never coming back
I would've held on to that last day
Instead of here's your keys
The last thing I'd say would be I love you
Just in case I'm only myself when I'm with you baby
I'll be with you someday
Take down my mirror
My pictures of costumes and you
Put aside posters and books and aged fortunes
And all this reminds me of you
You might also likeWith a pat on the back they say
Honey, it's time to move on
And sure we can find you a hobby
Now that he's gone, I stole you
I don't dare to try again
They said time will heal and time will mend
And on Halloween, the last time you left
If I knew you were never coming back
I would've held on to that last day
Instead of here's your keys
The last thing I'd say would be I love you
Just in case I'm only myself when I'm with you baby
They don't understand
We were like this since the first time we met
We were born holding hands
Give me flowers and cards
I'll smile all they want
If they give me what I want
Give me what I want
I don't dare to try again
They said time will heal and time will mend
And on Halloween, the last time you left
If I knew you were never coming back
I would've held on to that last day
Instead of here's your keys
The last thing I'd say would be I love you
Just in case I'm only myself when I'm with you baby
