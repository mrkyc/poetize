Frozen up north, far from the sun
Where the heart of winter is one
Cold winds, they blow, all frost and snow
Shadows creep in forests old
Unending realm waiting fires end
All light from worlds disappear
I lurk the path where grimly woods near
Frozen gates call me from there

Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds, they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar

Mighty Ravendark
Mighty Ravendark

Forests climb to mountains, cold winds, they blow
Thunders and twilight and snow
Frost, wind and fog, snow deep and cold
Realm that is hidden from all
Mindless voices speak through the heart of the gods
From the wintery woods winds, they call
Caught in the shadows of thy ravenrealm
Kingdom that blackened my soul
You might also like
Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar

Throne of the north, mountains of might
Blashyrkh by name, Blashyrkh by fire
Towers of ice, shadows of gods
Tales of the one frozen kingdom

Kingdom of north, throne of them all
Tales of the one, mountaineous sons
Blashyrkh by fire, Blashyrkh by name
The throne of North, mighty be thy law

Frozen gates call me from there
