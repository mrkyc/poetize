Especially for you
I wanna let you know what I was going through
All the time we were apart I thought of you
You were in my heart, my love never changed
I still feel the same

Especially for you
I wanna tell you I was feeling that way too
And if dreams were wings, you know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are, no matter how far
And now that I'm next to you
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've gotta say it's all because of you

And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you

Especially for you
I wanna tell you, you mean all the world to me
How I'm certain that our love was meant to be
You changed my life, you showed me the way
And now that I'm next to you
I've waited long enough to find you
I wanna put all the hurt behind you
Oh, and I wanna bring out all the love inside you, oh
You might also like
And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you

You were in my heart, my love never changed
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've gotta say, it's all because of you

And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you
Together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you
Together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
