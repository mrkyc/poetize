A river you say'll never run dry
I'd rather hear you say forever
Instead of a smile, I'd rather see you cry
Don't use that magical, mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love that I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time
(4 all time)
Baby, take a real good look at my face
'Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe you should've played an ace, instead you played the queen
You'd be better off cheatin' than tryin' 2 read my mind
Don't use that magical, mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love that I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar
(2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time
(4 all time)
Love me 2 the 9's
Stay awake 4 14 hours

Yo, check this out
Would you hug me on a crowded street?
Could you keep your cool if I washed your feet?
And yo soul a bath?
What if I gave it? Your body I ask
How long would you save it?
Could you lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink your ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other
Instead of smilin', would you cry?
Huh, could you kiss 3 times with your dress upside down
Strokin' and laughin'?
Or would you stay awake 4 14 hours
Listenin' 2 the grass grow?
