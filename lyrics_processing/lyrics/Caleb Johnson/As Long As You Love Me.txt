Infected with the same disease
In a room full of cats with handsome faces
You couldn't find a moment to see
I always wanted you to notice me, to notice me
I guess that's just the way it goes
I was looking for the answer
When all the time it was right here under my nose
For As Long as You Love Me
You don't have to do the things I do
As Long as You Love Me
You don't always have to be so cruel
As Long as You Love Me
We don't have to be together 24/7
As Long as You Love Me
I'm in heaven
We were looking for love, hearts trailing in our wake
Took any love that we could get
Sure, it wasn't easy
But you know you gotta take your chance no matter who you upset
Tell me, baby, did I pique your curiosity?
I don't know if I disappoint
You were looking for the answer
When all the time it was right here under your nose
But As Long as You Love Me
You don't have to do the things I do
As Long as You Love Me
You don't always have to be so cruel
As Long as You Love Me
We don't have to be together 24/7
As Long as You Love Me
I'm in heaven
You will never have a reason to tell me that we're through
I will never ask you not to do what you wanna do
Even if you never show me what I mean to you
And As Long as You Love Me
You don't have to do the things I do
As Long as You Love Me
You don't always have to be so cruel
As Long as You Love Me
We don't have to be together 24/7
As Long as You Love Me
I'm in heaven
As long as you love me
