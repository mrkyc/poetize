Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin'
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken

Somebody else
I think you're out there with someone else
Somebody else
I think you might be with someone else

I left all the lights on
I been out here sleepin' with no clothes on
Every bit of me stuck on you
And when it's you and me split in two
Sugar, tell me why

You've been dancin' with somebody
On the streets with somebody
Wasn't me, was somebody
Two nights in a row, two nights in a row
Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin'
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
You might also like
Somebody else
I think you out there with someone else
Somebody else
I think you might be with someone else

I left all the lights on
I been out here sleepin' with no clothes on
Every bit of me stuck on you
And when it's you and me split in two
Sugar, tell me why

You've been dancin' with somebody
On the streets with somebody
Wasn't me, was somebody
Two nights in a row, two nights in a row
Where'd you go?

Your call has been forwarded

Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin'
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
I left all the lights on
Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I been out here sleepin' with no clothes on
I've been smokin'
Every bit of me stuck on you
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
And when it's you and me split in two
Sugar, tell me why

You've been dancin' with somebody
On the streets with somebody
Wasn't me, was somebody
Two nights in a row, two nights in a row

Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
