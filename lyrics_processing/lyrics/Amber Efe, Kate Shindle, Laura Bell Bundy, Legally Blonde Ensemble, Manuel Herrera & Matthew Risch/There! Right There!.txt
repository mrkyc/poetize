There! Right there!
Look at that tanned, well tended skin
Look at the killer shape he's in
Look at that slightly stubbly chin
Oh, please, he's gay
Totally gay!

I'm not about to celebrate
Every trait could indicate
A totally straight expatriate
This guy's not gay
I say not gay

That is the elephant in the room
Well, is it relevant to assume
That a man who wears perfume
Is automatically, radically fae?

But look at his coiffed and crispy locks

Look at his silk translucent socks
You might also like
There's the eternal paradox
Look what we're seein'

What are we seein'?

Is he gay?

Of course he's gay!

Or European?

Ohhhh
Gay or European?
It's hard to guarantee
Is he gay or European?

Well, hey, don't look at me!

You see they bring their boys up different
In those charming foreign ports
They play peculiar sports
In shiny shirts and tiny shorts
Gay or foreign fella?
The answer could take weeks
They both say things like "Ciao, Bella"
While they kiss you on both cheeks

Oh, please

Gay or European?
So many shades of gray

Depending on the time of day
The French go either way

Is he gay or European, or--?

There, right there!
Look at that condescending smirk
Seen it on every guy at work
That is a metro, hetero jerk
That guy's not gay, I say, no way
That is the elephant in the room
Well is it relevant to presume
That a hottie in that costume

Is automatically, radically

Ironically, chronically

Certainly, flirtingly

Genetically, medically

Gay, offically gay
Swishily gay, gay, gay, gay...
Damn it!
Gay or European?

So stylish and relaxed

Is he gay or European?

I think his chest is waxed

But they bring their boys up different there
It's culturally diverse
It's not a fashion curse

If he wears a kilt or bears a purse
Gay or just exotic?
I still can't crack the code

Yeah, his accent is hypnotic
But his shoes are pointy toed

Huh
Gay or European?
So many shades of gray

But if he turns out straight
I'm free at eight on Saturday

Is he gay or European?
Gay or European?
Gay or Euro--

Wait a minute
Give me a chance to crack this guy
I have an idea I'd like to try

The floor is yours

So, Mr Argitakos
This alleged affair with Ms. Wyndham has been going on for...?

Two years

And your first name again is...?

Nikos

And your boyfriend's name is...?

Carlos
I-I, sorry!
I misunderstand!
You say "boyfriend"
I thought you say "best friend"
Carlos is my best friend

You bastard!
You lying bastard!
That's it, I no cover for you no more!
Peoples, I have a big announcement
This man is gay and European!

Whoa!

And neither is disgrace
You gotta stop your bein'
A completely closet case
It's me, not her he's seein'
No matter what he say
I swear he never, ever, ever swing the other way
You are so gay, you big parfait
You flaming one man cabaret

I'm straight!

You were not yesterday
So if I may, I'm proud to say
He's gay!

And European!

He's gay!

And European!

He's gay!

And European
And gay

Fine, okay, I'm gay!
