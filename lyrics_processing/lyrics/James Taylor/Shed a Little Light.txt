And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women living on the Earth
Ties of hope and love, sister- and brotherhood
That we are bound together
In our desire to see the world become
A place in which our children
Can grow free and strong
We are bound together
By the task that stands before us
And the road that lies ahead
We are bound and we are bound
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest
Shed a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
So that we can see (oh now)
Just a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
I want to stand it on up (stand it on up, oh Lord)
Stand it on up, oh Lord (yeah now)
I want to walk it on down (oh shed a little light)
Shed a little light, oh Lord

Don't give me no light from a TV screen (no, no, no, no)
When I open my eyes
I wanna drink my fill
From the well on the hill (I know ya know what I mean)
Shed a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
So that we can see (ah ah yeah)
Just a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord, oh now)
I want to stand it on up (stand it on up)
Stand it on up, oh Lord (yeah now)
I want to walk it on down (oh shed a little light)
Shed a little light, oh Lord
Shed a little light, o Lord
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest
Oh, let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women living on the Earth
