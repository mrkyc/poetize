Just the same as on a birth
The way it shines on everything
That happens here on Earth
It rolls across the Western sky
And back into the sea
And spends the day's last rays
Upon this fucked-up family
So long old pal
The last time I saw Alice
She was leaving Santa Fe
With a bunch of round-eyed Buddhists
In a killer Chevrolet
Said they turned her out of Texas
Yeah she burned them down back home
Now she's wild with expectation
On the edge of the unknown
Singing oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on

Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
They brought her back on a Friday night
Same day I was born
We sent her up the smokestack
Yes and back into the storm
She blew up over the San Juan Mountains
She spent herself at last
The threat of heavy weather
That was what she knew the best
Oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough just to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on
Home, better build it behind your eyes
Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
It woke me up on a Sunday
An hour before the sun
It had me watching them headlights
Out on Highway 591
Till I stepped into my trousers
Till I pulled my big boots on
I walked out on the Mesa
And I stumbled on this song
Oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on
Home, boy, build it behind your eyes
Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
