And the final scene at the White House door
And the staff lined up to say good-bye
Tiny tear in his shifty little eye
He said, "Nobody knows me
Nobody understands
These little people were good to me
Oh I'm gonna shake some hands
Somebody line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up"
Ah at that time my heart was all broke
I looked like ashes and smelled like smoke
And I turned away from my loving kind
Tried to leave my body and live in my mind
But it's much too much emotion
To hold it in your hand
They've got waves out on the ocean
They gonna wear away the land
I say line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up ah

And I've seen picket fences
And certain cowboy dances
I've gone lining up for shows
I've been safely placed in rows
Sure I know how it goes
Another day goes by, little time machine
I'm raking my brain over what it might mean
Just to claim the time and to turn away
Make today today
Who waits for you, lonely tired old toad?
It's your life laid out before you
Like the broken white line
Down the center of the doggone road
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Easy just to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Yeah, big moon landing
People all standing up
Smile for the loved ones
They go walking on down the aisles
Each re-engages
Stepping into the sun
I watch them turn like pages
One by one by one
Somebody line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Easy just to line 'em all up
It works when you line 'em up, line 'em all up
