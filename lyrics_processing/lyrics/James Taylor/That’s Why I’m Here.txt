And man to man
I'm back in touch
With my long lost friend
Listen to reason
And understand
And think of me
From way back when
He said: "Me and Melissa
Well we fell out of love
We ran out of luck
Seems like lightning struck
I've been thinking of leaving
But I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering
Could I borrow your truck?
I said: "That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Got no better reason
That's why I'm standing before you (that's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here"
John's gone
Found dead
He dies high
He's brown bread

After the laughter
The wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead
It seems "learn not to burn"
Means to turn on a dime
And walk on if you're walking
Even if it's an uphill climb
And try to remember
That working's no crime
Just don't let them take
And waste your time
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
There'll be no more messes tonight
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here
This is an IOU
I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria
This'll be better tomorrow
Fortune and fame's
Such a curious game
Perfect strangers
Can call you by name
Pay good money
To hear Fire and Rain
Again and again
And again
Some are like summer
Coming back every year
Got your baby
Got your blanket
Got your bucket of beer
I break into a grin
From ear to ear
And suddenly
It's perfectly clear
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Sing it tonight, tomorrow and everyday
That's why I'm standing (that's why I'm here)
Oh that's why I'm here
This is the part
About Kitty and Bim
He loved her
And she loved him
Wake them up
Shake them up
The middle of the night
Got to tell me everything's alright
Sayin, that's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
You got me walking and talking like a natural man
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here
