In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Karin, she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway call
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
And signs that might be omens say I'm going, going
Gone to Carolina in my mind

Now with a holy host of others standing 'round me, no no
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it looks like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If I'm up and

Gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
