I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Had I listened to the grapevine
I might have had my doubts
But I did my level best
Just to block them out
Cause love is so unwise
And love has no eyes
And it took a while for a fool to see
What his friends were on about
Well I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care yeah
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Imagining your face
It almost fills the empty space before me
I can see you eyes
And almost hear your lovely lies oh yeah

And love was through with me
I wish I was a baby
On my mama's knee
I wish I was a freight train
Moving down the line
Just to keep in track of time
Without all these memories
Well I was a fool to care
Well I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care hey
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Baby, yes, I am
I could have opened my eyes
I could have seen through your lies
I could have stood for no more
I could have walked out the door
But I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
Well I was a fool to care
And I was a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
