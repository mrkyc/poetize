Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
I've got two long legs like to carry me
Two sharp eyes to look for the light
Two strong arms to hold on tight
Two good friends on my left and right
But only one only one
And you are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now, now you're my only one
Now there's only one road before me
Too many turns in the way
Thousands of things to do today
Millions of moments, I must admit
But only one only one
And you are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
Taken for granted and pushed aside
All that it wanted was a place to run and hide
Missing message in a hollow tree
Hidden deep inside a memory
And the memory seems like dreams
Hundreds of hopes in the past
Nevertheless it was never the last
Hold on strong or you fade out fast
And only one only one
