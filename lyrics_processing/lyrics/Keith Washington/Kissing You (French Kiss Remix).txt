When you're not here
I long to hold you near
Baby, this time
Together we must bare (Together)
Holdin' you close
Takin' time to let you know
Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights, come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need
Tell me it's not just a dream (Just a dream)
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine and this is real, oh...oh...
(Kissing you)
Lovin' you all through the night

It will be all right
What's better than
A love that's made for two
