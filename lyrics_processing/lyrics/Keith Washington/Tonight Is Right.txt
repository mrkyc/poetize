Tonight is right
Let's take our time
Tonight is mine and yours

I got my candles, I got my fire
Everything's set, set to your heart's desire
I got sweet music, turn the lights down low
So damn romantic, what more can one ask for?

Ain't no hurry, we can't take it slow
'Cause we know what we're doing
And we know where we're gonna go
I've got plans for you and you've got plans for me
So let's get it on, let's kick it off
Do what we gotta do, oh

Don't you know tonight is right
Let's take our time
Tonight is right
(And it's right for makin' love)
Tonight is right
Tonight is right, let's take our time
Tonight is mine and yours

I got this champagne, and the table's set
Have a nice little dinner before we get down to sex
And when you get ready, we can have foreplay
We can play all night long before we go all the way

Ain't no hurry, we can take our time
'Cause you know where we're headed
And you know what's on my mind
I've got a thing for you and you've gotta thing for me
So let's get it on, let's kick it off
Do what we gotta do, baby

Don't you know tonight is right
Let's take our time (Oh, feels so sweet)
Tonight is right (The way you touch me, baby)

So bad I can taste your love

So hold on, hold on, hold on, baby
