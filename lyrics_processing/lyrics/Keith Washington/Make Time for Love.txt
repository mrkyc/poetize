I'm coming home early today
I've been going crazy, no, I just can't wait
I'm gonna love you 'til you cannot take no more
Tonight I'm yours
And I'm ready to explore
Lately I've been working overtime, hmm
So when it comes to money, we'll be alright
I make more than enough, let's make time for love
Ooh, for love, ooh

A card to say that I love you so
For no special reason, just to let you know
And maybe I could find a little band of gold
I'm coming home, gonna love you all night long
I got your favorite flowers by my side, lady, hmm
I even got a bottle of our favorite wine
Tonight is for us
Let's make time for love, yeah
For love, ooh, for love
Make time, fine time, mmm, mmm

Seems like we're always in a hurry
Love's always the sacrifice, oh-oh
Tonight ain't nothing gonna tear us apart
I'm ready to start, and I ain't gonna stop, hey hey
It may get crazy, the times may get rough, yeah
We've got a lot of love, so don't let it go
Tonight I'm gonna take you into overload
You never know, we just might explode
Tonight the stars speak of love
And since we love each other
I think that's reason enough
To make time for love
You might also like
Ooh, love me, baby
I said all I wanna do is make sweet love to you
Come here, baby
I'm willing and I'm able
To love you the way you need to loved, oh
Come on, baby, take your flowers
Let's wine and dine one another
Love each other and make time for love
Right here and now
Right here and now
Baby, can we make time, spend time for love?
