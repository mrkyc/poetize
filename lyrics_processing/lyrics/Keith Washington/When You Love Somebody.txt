Some predicted we will not last
'Cause our personalities often clash
I would rather be left alone
Let us work it out on our own
And if it don't turn out like we thought
Then we both can say that it was our fault
And can we go our separate ways
Content with decisions we made, lady

Sometimes a person outgrows the lover they chose
Who failed to keep love new
And there's a part of me that wants to be free
And there's a part that will always believe, yeah

When you love somebody (Somebody), somebody loves you back (Oh)
(Can't never let nobody ever come between that)
When you love somebody and somebody loves you back
(Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody)

Maybe we got involved too fast
Anything but making love was too much to ask
This has to be more than sexual
So you and I have to try to talk and take it slow
Now do we have a common dream
Something we can show that can prove we're a team?
We both wanna prove them wrong
But now the thought is not strong, hey, hey
You might also like
So, girl, we got to let go, I love you, I know
We managed to not be brave enough
To weather the storm as others we've known have chose to do
There's no changing my point of view, no

When you love somebody (Somebody), somebody loves you back (Hey)
(You can never let nobody ever come between that)
When you love somebody (No, no), somebody loves you back
(Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody, somebody)
When you love somebody (Somebody loves you), somebody loves you back
(When somebody loves you back, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey)
When you love somebody (Somebody), somebody loves you back
(Oh, I wanna love you back, wanna love you back)

Sometimes a person outgrows the lover they chose
Who failed to keep love new
And there's a part of me that wants to be free
And there's a part that will always believe

When you love somebody (Yeah), somebody loves you back
(Can't let nobody ever come between that)
When you love somebody (Nobody), somebody loves you back
(Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody, hey, yeah)
When you love somebody (Oh), somebody loves you back
(I wanna love somebody, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
When you love somebody (Someone), somebody loves you back (Woo)
(Somebody loves you, somebody love you, somebody loves you
I need to be loved)
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
(But not just by anybody, somebody special, haha
Somebody unique, ha, that loves the hell out of me)
