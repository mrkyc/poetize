La la la la la la la, la-la-la-la

We may not have the finest things
But what we have is worth so much more
Fancy cars and diamond rings
Just can't compare to the love we share

Whenever I look in your eyes
To me it seems that loving you was meant to be
Each time I hold you in my arms
I can feel the passion burning inside, mmm

When it comes to you, hey
Nothin' in the world is good enough
That's the way I feel 'cause I love you too much
When it comes to you
There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do

Some people said we'd never last
Thought that in time our love was bound to fall
But we held on tight and we proved them wrong
We showed them all that our love was strong
You might also like
No matter what stands in our way
We will survive, and girl, our love will never die
True love will always see us through
Just as long as you and I believe, oh baby, yeah

When it comes to you, hey
Nothin' in the world is good enough
That's the way I feel 'cause I love you too much
When it comes to you
There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do, oh

So just lay back, let's enjoy each other
Take this time to reward one another
Now is the time to feed our minds
Come on, let's go, right now
La la la la la la la, la-la-la-la
My love

When it comes to you, mhm
Nothin' in the world is good enough
That's the way I feel 'cause I love you too much, lady
When it comes to you
There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do, hey, hey, mmm
When it comes to you, mhm
Nothin' in the world is good enough
That's the way I feel 'cause I love you too much
When it comes to you, my baby
There ain't nothin' I won't ever, won't ever do for you
When it comes to you, no lady
