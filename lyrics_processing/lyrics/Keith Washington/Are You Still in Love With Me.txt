Something's wrong, oh, I can tell
Is it that someone new came alone and broke the spell?
There's a doubt that I can shake
Emptiness in your kiss, I'm finding hard to take

If you're having second thoughts
If you think we should let go
After all we've been through, I should be the first to know
See, this insecurity, oh, it's slowly killing me
I've got to know, baby, tell me how you feel

Are you still in love with me
Like the way you used to be
Or did it all fade away
And the pain I feel, is it here to stay?
Are you still in love with me
Like the way you used to be
Or did it all just tumble down
And the pain I feel is here to stay?

In my heart, I won't accept
What my mind knows to be true, that I'm slowly losing you
I can only try to bring love back in line
But something in your eyes says I'm running out of time
You might also like
I would call you on the phone just to hear you say
"Honey, I love you always" (Always)
Oh, I miss those days
Now I feel so all alone
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me that love is here, no, it hasn't disappeared

Are you still in love with me
Like the way you used to be
Or did it all fade away
And the hurt I feel, is it here to stay?
Are you still in love with me (With me)
Like the way you used to be
Or did it all tumble down
And the pain I feel is here to stay?
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Now I feel so all alone
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me now, baby, do you love me?
Tell me now, lady, do you love me?
'Cause I need to know, and I wanna know
Hey hey, don't make me wait no more, baby
(Are you still in love)
Woo, like the way you used to be
Or did it all fade away
And the hurt I feel, is it here to stay?
Are you still in love with me (With me)
Like the way you used to be
Or did it all tumble down
And the pain I feel, is it here to stay?

(Are you still in love)
I wanna know, love (Like the way you used to be?)
I got to feel love the way it was, baby
Woo, tell me that you love me, lady
(Are you still in love) Are you still love, baby? (With me)
Are you in love with me, baby?
Don't make me wait, not another, not another, not another day
(Are you still in love)
I can't wait, baby (Like the way you used to be?)
Hey, yeah yeah yeah, no no no no no no no, no no no no no no no
