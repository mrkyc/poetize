Sit back, relax your mind
Just let my love flow through you
'Cause all this time my love is with you
And you never have to worry
'Cause I wanna spend my life with you
You changed my world
My dreams have come true

There's something about you, baby, can't explain
And it's driving my crazy, now I'm goin' insane
Something about the way you hold me, babe
I love you
There's something inside you that keeps calling me
And it's taking me places that I've never seen
I'm not afraid to learn from memories
I love you

I never contemplated, that's why it feels so right
A heaven sent love, a match made for two
Don't take your love for granted
'Cause love won't wait for you, no, baby
Hold on to love, your heart is telling you
Crying at night when you're not by my side
Thinking 'bout you (Thinking about you)
Let's take a chance
Take my life and romance
Let my love flow through you
Promise live and fulfill all your dreams
Don't let it slip away, no, no, no
'Cause my love's here for you
Baby, come face the truth
Don't run away just hold on to my love

There's something about you, baby, can't explain
And it's driving my crazy, now I'm goin' insane
Something about the way you hold me, babe
Oh, I love you
There's something inside you that keeps calling me
And it's taking me places that I've never seen
I'm not afraid to learn from memories
I love you

Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
Baby, I love you
Holding you tight
Throught the night
Feels so right baby
Baby, I love you
Missing the way you kiss me
Baby, I need
Don't you ever leave
Baby, I love you
Something 'bout the way you love me
Holding you tight
Through the night
Feels so right, babe
There's something about you, baby, can't explain
And it's driving my crazy, now I'm goin' insane
Something about the way you hold me, babe
I love you
There's something inside you that keeps calling me
And it's taking me places that I've never seen
I'm not afraid to learn from memories
