Where your soul is your best friend
Searching for a reason
To go astray
Wild dreams turn to nightmares
Silver clouds turn to golden stairs
And everything that you used to know
Is slipping away
Here I've got my puzzle-piece
Only got it for a short term lease
No time for asking
No going back to get hurt
I take a little from the mixture
Try to fit it into the picture
Got a place where you're standing
Dig your shoes into the dirt
Trying hard to get back
Runnin' on the stones
Put you on my shoulders
We can be the only one
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look
There's a reason to be home
There's a feeling when you smile
But it feels like it might take over
This feeling deep inside
And there's a distance down the line
Far away from the station
We can leave it all behind
On a rolling creation
You might also likeSit away from the window
And lock the door
Can't you learn from the last time
And the time before
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look
Got to leave town
To see the yellow flowers bloom
Sun going down
It's gonna be rising soon
On the banks of the deep end
Twisted as a riverbend
Searching for a reason to go astray
You couldn't hire twenty-five men
To do what the man could do
Just the sound of his walking
Could split the whole damn town in two
Into the night full of shadows
He still walks when the thunder rolls
This river ain't shallow
Reminds us that the bell still tolls
Bears in the kitchen
Tigers on TV
The singer's pretending
That this song's for me
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look
You took a wrong turn
Down by the waterline
I heard they had to drag you off the sand
Find a dune and the wind will miss you
Hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land
On the banks of the deep end
Where I lost my best friend
