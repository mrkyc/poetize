There's some things I want to get off my chest
Some things are starting real nice
They say as we get older
We get wiser and I
I don't know if that's true
But I know a fog's been lifted from my eyes
You see it seems that sometimes
When someone wins
Someone has to lose
I'm afraid I've been the winner too much
But when it comes to me and you, baby
Oh you've always been there
There was times that I was gone
You needed my touch
But you know I love you
I know you do
So tell me you never gave up on me
I can be everything those people see
Everything
I can't be the man I want to be
I refuse to listen, baby
You try to tell me so many times
I was headed down the wrong, weird street
I got this one way ticket, baby
I think I might have to cash it in
Maybe coming home would be the best thing for me
You might also likeYou see I don't want to lose you
If I do, nobody wins
Well I know it's up to me to make it right this time
So give me one more chance, baby
I swear I won't let you down
Take my hand
Let me say what's on my mind
I'm here today
For so many things I want to say
Some things I finally realize
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder
I don't know if that's really true
But I know I dried a thousand tears from my eyes
And you know I love you
I know you do
So tell me you never gave up on me
I can be everything those people see
Everything
I can't be the man I want to be
Oh
Oh, I hear you, baby
Oh, yeah
You know I love you
I know you do
So tell me you never gave up on me
I can be everything those people see
Everything
I can't be the man I want to be
Oh
I can't be the man I want to be
I can't be the man I want to be
I can't be the man I want to be
I can't be the man I want to be
Tell me now
You know I love you
I know you do
