That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And you fill like you've lost you're way
When the candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say
He used to say soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Hey now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
But life can take the strongest man
And make him feel so alone
Now and then I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my achin' bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said "Boy, in the darkness before the dawn?"
You might also likeLet your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control
Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day
Oh, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
