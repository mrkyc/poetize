Mr. 9 on that ass, 504!
Blaxuede...
Man these niggas wanna battle Blaxuede
What fuckin' sense that make?
Know what I'm sayin'?
Best to show some skills or somethin', on the real or somethin'
Chorus :
Don't ever battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Don't Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Battle Blaxuede, Battle Blaxuede
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Don't Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion
Battle Blaxuede, battle Blaxuede
First Verse :
I bring the ruckus
Wit a clique of raw muthafuckas
You can't duck us
Or like Hammer you can't touch us
These sap suckas, they wanna rain like me
See I ain't Method Man, but no one bring the pain like me
Now instantly I move the crowd like Eric B., and Rakim
Keep my squad Def like Keith Murray and them
I'm burying them
Wack ass, jackass niggas
Them can't react fast when I blast ass niggas
Boy welcome to the nation of Xuede
Where we kick shit for days like Blade
Can't nobody be saved
And that's foreal Wootay
Don't act Sporty
The Navy and the Army couldn't hold me
They phony
Not a word from you in seven days like Toni
I make ya surrender, your rhymes tender like Roni
Number one nigga, Blaxuede one and only
It's lonely at the top, cuz the shit you drop, got nothin' on me
I play emcees like a Sony
Playstation
Breath-taking, and my lyrics can stay Jason
I ain't fakin'
It was Friday the 13th
I'm so wicked Freddy havin' nightmares on Elm Street
Now he too frightened to go to sleep
I bring the heat
You remind me of the Son of Samson cuz you weak
You can't defeat, we'll refuse to lose
I'm bad news cuz I damage all these fools and crews
WHAT??!!

Second Verse 

Is you bout that action?
Yes I'm bout that action
Don't be slackin' I could damage you with my rappin' nigga
Don't get mad cuz your bitch chose me nigga
Don't get mad cuz your pocket's on "E" nigga

I know these hard rhymes scarin' ya
You started runnin' cuz you know I'm comin' when the black clouds fill the
Area
Deadly like a twenty missile aircraft carrier
Droppin' them quickly, I'm an emcee buryer
Rainin' on your parade
Cuz I could kick it for many days in many hardcore different ways
Murder emcees in different ways, no specific phrase
Blaxuede, rhymes shine with fatal explicit rays
Better pray for mankind, cuz last time
I unloaded and they exploded just like a landmine
Plus I'm able to kill, niggas at will with the skill
Can't prevent what's bout to happen with a shield, on the real
It won't change until I'm deceased in peace
Even then, my heart and soul still remain in the beats
Can you stop that?  Nah Black, I doubt that
Smokin' all these bitches like Nickels and dime sacks
Beware of contact, and flames from combat
If they don't get stomped, our approach, they fall flat
What'cha sayin' brah?
If you ain't scared, then what'cha prayin' for?
Guess you finally figured I'm real, and I ain't playin', ha?
Chorus
Third Verse :
I'm comin' harder than a virgin on a prom night
Just get the fuck, don't come back until your rhymes tight
Verbal assassin pluggin' these bitches up like targets
Don't cry now, just bow down you got me started
Whinin' bout I'm too cold-hearted
Lyrics too vicious
Man I'm just handlin' business, makin' emcees diminish
Even if it's just a scrimmage
I'm in this to finish
All of my competition
Soul taker that's my position, listen
How many artists, sorry they met me?
I know I'm cold as the fuck, but some high is sweatin' me
Already I'm legendary, I just won't fade
You'll be buried in the cemetary fuckin' with Xuede
Is it your fantasy?  To be victorious when you battle me?
Or can it be?  You better snap back into reality
SON, I thought I told you I'm the chosen one
I be the Golden child
Smoke your ass like Black & Mild
Since I'm wild
Wild like Wayne
Wild like the cars that make the color change in little games
Plus I'm wild like some bees protectin' a beehive
Even wild like that station 98.5
Nigga I'm real
YOU DON'T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON'T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON'T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON'T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
Chorus

And we out baby....
What?
Got my nigga big Mac, my nigga Shorty
Bam Bam, my nigga Tank here with me
Fa sho, 99
Not only are we 99, but we shine for 99, ya heard me?
Yeah, what?
Don't fuck with us
We ain't gonna fuck with you, so don't fuck with us
Cuz when you fuck with us, we gone fuck with us
So don't fuck with us
And we won't fuck with you
Fuck you pay me
What, what?
Don't battle Blaxuede I thought I told ya
