Swimmin' holes and slippin' slides
Watermelon and lemonade ice
Dancin' kids and dancin' wives
Dancin' girls, they're all so fine
Lots of folks a-pickin', grinnin'
In between the DJ spinnin'
Every song reminds me of
How it feels to fall in love
Happy people
Hangin' out in harmony
Got a lot of that good time energy
Always a smile for everyone to see
Hey, how you doin'?
Happy people
Hey, hey, hey
Happy people
Every day you pray for a minute, let the world slow down
'Cause right now I'm really livin' in it and it spins me 'round
Too fast and I get so dizzy, gotta hold on tight
What a day, didn't we get jiggy, and oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night

Hangin' out in harmony
Got a lot of that good time energy
Always a smile for everyone to see
Hey, how you doin'?
Happy people
Help each other 'long the way
And thank the good Lord every day
Yeah, it feels so good to say
Hey, hey, hey
Happy people
Hey, hey, hey
Happy people
Hey, yay, hey
Happy people
Hey, hey, hey
Happy people
Just a buncha happy people
So you're flyin' through the sky with a twinkle in your eye
And you really wanna taste a little happy cherry pie
You make another move on a Martian cutie
Jumpin' John on a Jupiter booty
Spaceship screamin', guitar freakin'
Navigatin', levitatin', no complainin'
Why don't we just keep 'em movin', groovin', gettin' down
Until we feel so really good
All we wanna do is scream and yell
Happy
Well, can we all be happy?
'Round the universe, be happy
Ha ha, happy
Let's all be happy
Everybody be happy
'Round the universe, be happy
Ha ha, happy
