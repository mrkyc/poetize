As I drive down this highway alone
Too much time on my hands
Sometimes my mind starts to roam
And it tears at my heart
Like a nightmare I pray won't come true
The thought of me ever
Having to live without you
And I break out in a sweat
And a tightness comes over my chest
And a chill runs through me
That's darker and colder than death
And I can't dam the river of tears
'Cause I'm facing my very worst fears
If I lost your love what am I thinkin' of
I'm just thinkin' too much
Oh I'm thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
As you lay asleep in my arms
And praying to heaven
To save you and keep you from harm
And it's not just for you
That I offer my humble respect
'Cause my reason to love would be gone
If you were not here
You might also likeAnd I break out in a sweat
And a tightness comes over my chest
And a chill runs through me
That's darker and colder than death
And I can't dam the river of tears
'Cause I'm facing my very worst fears
If I lost your love what am I thinkin' of
I'm just thinkin' too much
I know that it's foolish
You'll always be with me
In his master plan I must trust
It's just that I love you so much
And I break out in a sweat
And a tightness comes over my chest
And a chill runs through me
That's darker and colder than death
And I can't dam the river of tears
'Cause I'm facing my very worst fears
If I lost your love what am I thinkin' of
I'm just thinkin' too much
I'm thinkin' too much
Oh I'm thinkin' too much
