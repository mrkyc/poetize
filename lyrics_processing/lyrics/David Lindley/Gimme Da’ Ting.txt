Audrey you want to be nice
You won't take the doctor's advice
You know I'm sufferin' with the flu
The doctor tell ya what ya have to do
And now you tell me that you don't agree
With what the doctor tell you to give me

Audrey girl I want to know
Why you have me sufferin' so
Can't you see that I'm very sick
I really must get better quick
Now you stop your foolin' about
And throw that medicine down inside me mouth

And this is my only choice

Just a little bit to ease the strain
The only thing to make me sing again
