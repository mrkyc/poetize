It could be a sign
Two toned truths make black and white so hard to find
Why'd she have to change her mind?
Ooh, she wants to get away
One-way ticket to a holiday
To get with the times

Tell me what am I doing here?
When I go to my homeboy crib
Why I always feel blue in here?
Why I always feel ruined here?
Why I feel like, every time I'm proud of something I did
I can't tell you and hear?
Yeah, buddy, I can tell you in fear
Being inferior
You'd rather walk to the store than get in my car
You jealous of the interior
I wish we all had one
I'm bein' so sincer-ior
Why is it you think I work hard?
I get up, we get up
Prayers up, Jesus up
Raise us up, we need ya
These are just some things I think about often
Some stand in line for Supreme, but
Some stand in line 'cuz they starving for food
Can't get no medicine and they can't stop the coughin'
You think you down on your luck when it's hard for you to find parking
I'm guilty just as much
I can't say shit and make a fuss
I always want the new shit and money like I'm on angel dust
Thankfully, all the angels was watching me
This shit dangerous
Wrestlin' with demons in red, white and blue like Kurt Angle
'Cuz this country always target me subtly
Making me wonder, what am I doing here?
God Bless America
None of y'all love me
But your children, they love my culture
My kicks and my rugbies
But the parents get afraid when they see images of me
You might also likeAmerica says, "Save your money"
Mama, I wanna buy Nike
Grandma says start a family
Try to get you a wifey
But I wanna drive Porsche
And my wrist to be icy

Could be a sign
That we're fading away
Welcome to the place where nothing's for ya, ooh
Such a pretty face
Had to go to waste
So you could have it all
Now there's nothing left at all

Take me away
To a place that makes me feel like California, ooh
Just a little taste
Takes the pain away
So we could live a lie
Before it takes our life
So get with the times, ooh, ooh, aah, ha

Grab your pistol and get in the ride
I ain't messin' with you, you ain't pickin' a side
Need a new liver, no liquor in mind
I know I'm drunk off of sipping my pride
Why can't we let it go?
Do we need to show our destiny?
This sound like when skulls crack and leave the gray matter
Standing next to me
My mind, bulletproof glass, boy, can't shatter my soul
Get with the times
Sworn to a code, but it ain't data
My body made me leave my soulmate if that thing fatter
A voice told me
Could be a sign
Two toned truths make black and white so hard to find
Why'd she have to change her mind?
Ooh, she wants to get away
One-way ticket to a holiday
To get with the times

Yeah, we're fading away
Welcome to the place where nothing's for ya, ooh
Such a pretty face
Had to go to waste
So you could have it all
Now there's nothing left at all

Take me away
To a place that makes me feel like California, ooh
Just a little taste
Takes the pain away
So we could live a lie
Before it takes our life
