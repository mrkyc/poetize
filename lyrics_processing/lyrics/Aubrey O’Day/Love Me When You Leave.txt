Already awaiting your call
I never know quite where I stand
Until we're both here alone
Why am I a secret?
When our love can speak so loud
Am I in denial?
Is my heart the only sound?
Love me when you leave
Love me when you go
When you're here we're everything
When you're gone I never know
When your go
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Don you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Don you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
The door slams
And the fear sets in
Already awaiting your call
I never know quite where I stand
Until we're both here alone
Why am I a secret?
When our love can speak so loud
Am I in denial?
Is my heart the only sound?
Love Me when you leave
Love me when your go
When you're your here we're everything
When you're gone I never know
When you're go
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Now turn it up
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Don you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Don you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
Do you really love me?
Love me, love me
