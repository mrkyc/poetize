When I'm on a dance floor
When, when I'm on a dance floor

Look at my body, it's so official
Every time they see me
They shoot over like a missile
Just wanna party, don't mean no issues
If that's your girlfriend over there
I think she miss you
(When I'm on)
When I'm on the dance floor
Tell the DJ give me more
Up so loud, the speakers blow
The beat makes my body go

Beggin' for it now (Uh-huh)
Spinning 'round and 'round (Uh-huh)
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
Automatic (Automatic)
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
Automatic (Automatic)
You might also like
They crowd around me, every time I enter
You could see their heartbeat pumping louder than a speaker
So get up off me, with all them whispers
'Cause I'm the type of girl that's gonna hurt your feelings
(When I'm on)
So, when I'm on the dance floor
Tell the DJ give me more
Up so loud, the speakers blow
The beat makes my body go

Beggin' for it now (Uh-huh)
Spinning 'round and 'round (Uh-huh)
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
Automatic (Automatic)
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
Automatic (Automatic)

When I'm on the dance floor
Tell the DJ give me more
Up so loud, the speakers blow
The beat makes my body go
When I'm on the dance floor
Tell the DJ give me more
Up so loud, the speakers blow
The beat makes my body go
Beggin' for it now (Uh-huh)
Spinning 'round and 'round (Uh-huh)
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it (I can't control it)

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (My body goes, automatic)
Automatic (Automatic)
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room (When I hit the room)
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
Automatic (Automatic, ooh)
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room (The beat goes boom)
My body goes on automatic (Automatic, it makes me move)

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room
My body goes on automatic (Automatic)
