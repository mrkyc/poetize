For your kills
For your crimes against my love
That you steal, why'd you steal
When you don't know what you want
If you kiss me, I won't feel the knife cut
Touch me right and I won't fight, I'll give up
You, you're the shit
But you ain't shit
And I still can't get enough
Call when you want me, it hurts so good
Deny you love me, it hurts so good
You take off running, it hurts so good
Break my heart you know it hurts so good
How much you got cause I can take it boy
The way you love me hurts so good
I'm on my knees the way you like it boy
You're killing me, it hurts so good
So good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
If you kiss me, I won't feel the knife cut
Touch me right and I won't fight, I'll give up
You, you're the shit
But you ain't shit
And I still can't get enough
Call when you want me, it hurts so good
Deny you love me, it hurts so good
You take off running, it hurts so good
Break my heart you know it hurts so good
How much you got cause I can take it boy
The way you love me hurts so good
I'm on my knees the way you like it boy
You're killing me, it hurts so good
So good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
If you kiss me, I won't feel the knife cut
Touch me right and I won't fight, I'll give up
It hurts so good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
How much you got cause I can take it boy
The way you love me hurts so good
I'm on my knees the way you like it boy
You're killing me, it hurts so good
So good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
So good, so good, hurts so good
