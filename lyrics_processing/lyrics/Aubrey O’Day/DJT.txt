You can say it was all a fucking fairytale
Or you can say it was real
But I need to know and you know
Whatever the truth is defines the reality of you and I forever
And I need to be able to define that before I can walk away
I thought it was forever at the time but maybe I was lying to myself
Is that what you want?
You wanna, you wanna believe that everything with me was a lie? A fantasy?
And you want to go back and live in the life that you had have forever?
I don't know, I could... I couldn't do what I said I would do
So that answered the question for me
I'll always want you and always wonder about it
But it doesn't matter because I have to stay here
What made you stop believing in our world?
You know, I think probably the loss of the other world
I'm torn between two worlds both of which I wanted

I hate me for loving you, hate you for letting our love die
I hate me for loving you, hate you for letting our love die
I hate me for loving you, hate you for letting our love die
I hate me for, I hate me for, hate you for letting our love die

Tell me you love me, I need you to do that
No, you don't
Yeah I do, I need to know it before I walk away
No, that's exactly what's stopping you from walking away
No it wouldn't, that's exactly what would help me walk away
You know everything anyway
You're the only one who ever knew my heart
I have to move on, I need your help
I can't believe that this was all a lie
You have to tell me you love me
I don't 'cause you're a fucking pain in my ass
Tell me you love me and I won't talk to you anymore
I'll leave you alone
Look, it doesn't matter, it can't matter
The truth will only kill us both
You have to say it once to yourself and to me and then I'll go
I love you
Talk to you later
