"Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track..."

No way, never fallin', fallin', fallin'
No way, never fallin'
Never
Never
Chorus: Aubrey O' Day
Every time they see us ballin'
They get down on their kness and pray
Waiting for the day we fall off so
They can come and take our place

Every time that they see me ballin' (BALLIN')
I'm makin' cheese overseas or on tour
Put the money in the off-shore bank account
In some European bank that you can't pronounce
You see
I don't play around when it come to paper
I run Cali like Schwarzenegger
Hey DJ
Cross the fader
Take my hits, then alternate them
This is dedicated to
All the haters
Anybody that'll ever had an altercation with
Yeah, Roscoe Umali made it
And I know you hate it, but it feels amazin'
You might also likeRepeat Chorus
Hook: Aubrey O' Day
No way, never fallin', fallin', fallin'
No way, never fallin', fallin', fallin'
No way, never fallin', fallin'
Never
Never

Hi hater
It's ya girl, Aubrey O' Day
Danity Kane, you know
Y'all talk about me
On TMZ, callin' me (???)
But hey
If you really knew what went down
Sayin' that I, I, I get around
From my fifteen minutes, but
You ain't even had one whole minute
I
Need to get this off my chest
I'm real when it comes to my chest
You can ask big Hef
This girl keeps it real
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Hook

Ain't no way you can't knock me off
Roscoe ball hard like Alkasol
That's why the wrist shine bright like Armor All
And the Range, they parked in the parkin' lot
Got the black on black Armanis on
With the yellow, red, blue Umali's on
L.A. to the Bay, out to Collipark
We pop bottles and party like Mardi Gras
Stay gettin' that cheddar, that Parmesan
Stay rollin' with the kush and the (???)
East haters is softer than pony sauce
So I be laughin' to the bank like {HA, HA, HA}
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Hook

Every time they see us ballin' (Take that, take that...)
They get down on their kness and pray (I'm a bad girl...)
Waiting for the day we fall off so
