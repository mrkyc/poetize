Call you up so come and get me
Got my jeans on tight i'm feeling sexy
Tonight....Tonight....

I wanna be the girl in your truck song
The one that makes you sing along
Makes you wanna cruise
Dri nk a little moonshine down
Leave a couple tattoos on this town
Chillin' it with a cold beer
Yeah hangin' with the boys 'round here
Gonna take a little ride
That's my kind of night
You and me geting our shine on
I wanna be the girl in your truck song
Gonna hop on in so slide it over
Lay my head down on your shoulder
We can rev it up or take it slower
No i don't care, i don't care
We can do tailgates and back forty bonfires
Get a little bita mud on the tires
Or we can hop on the blacktop and just drive
All night all night.....I could be the
