I got this feeling, got me reeling
Going out of my mind
Like I'm losing time
There's no good reason
To keep me from living my life
I've got to simplify

And do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
Live how I wanna live
Be who I wanna be
And love who I'm gonna love
Show 'em what I'm made of
Ain't nothing to it
Gotta do it, do it, do it, uh

Why should I be a people pleaser?
Fall into line
That would be such a crime
I won't be my own enemy
And as far as I can see
There ain't nothing in front of me
In my way
No, it's just that easy

Gonna do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
Live how I wanna live

And love who I'm gonna love
