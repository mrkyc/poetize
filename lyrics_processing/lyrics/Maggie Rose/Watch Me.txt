I don't need no one
To tell me how to feel the beat
And I don't need no beat
To tell me how to move my feet
Just go and do what you do
'Cause there's nothing to prove
(I'm just being me, w-watch me do me)
I don't need no magazine to tell me who to be
And I don't need to pose for p-p-paparazzi

Just keep the cameras flashing
To try to catch this action
(I'm just being me, w-watch me do me, me, me, me)

Light up the floor
Play me one more (Let me hear that)
Click, clack, on the hi-hat
Let the bass vibrate (Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor
Just like before (Let me hear that)
Bass drop from the boom box makes your heart stop
(Feel the room rock)

I'm doing all I wanna do
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me, watch me do me (Me, me)
Watch me do me (Me, me)
Watch me
Watch me

I don't need no music
When I wanna sing a song (W-watch me)
I don't need what's popular
To know what's right or wrong (W-watch me)
I'm busy burnin' the track
Not holding anything back
(I'm just being me, w-watch me do me, me, me, me)

Light up the floor
Play me one more (Let me hear that)
Click, clack, on the hi-hat
Let the bass vibrate (Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor
Just like before (Let me hear that)
Bass drop from the boom box makes your heart stop
(Feel the room rock)
I'm doing all I wanna do (All I wanna do)
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me, watch me do me

I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready to go
Let, let it
Let, let, let it explode
I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready to go, to go, to go

Light up the floor
Play me one more (Play me one more) (Let me hear that)
Click clack, on the high-high
Let the bass vibrate (Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor
Just like before (J-just like before) (Let me hear that)
Bass drop from the boom box makes your heart stop (Stop)

I'm doing all I wanna do (All I wanna do)
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me, watch me do me (Me, me)
Watch me do me (Me, me)
Watch me
