Same house, same floors
Same problems as before
I tried to see all the possibilities

Well, it must be easy always being a pessimist
'Cause you won't feel broken holding hope like the rest of us

If there's nothing new for us under the sun
If we can't undo all the damage we've done
Guess we're gonna lose 'fore we even begun
Guess there's nothing new for us under the sun

You shot us down
Right before left the ground
How far we'd go
Well, it's something that we'll never know

Well, it must be easy always being a pessimist
'Cause you won't feel broken holding hope like the rest of us
The rest of us
You might also like
If there's nothing new for us under the sun
If we can't undo all the damage we've done
Nothing left to prove, but you're grabbing your gun
And pointing it at everyone
You say that you're hurt, but you don't wanna change
Scared of getting worse so you push me away
Guess we're gonna lose 'fore we even begun
Guess there's nothing new for us under the sun

Ooh
Guess we burned up, guess we burned out
And it's too late for us now

If there's nothing new for us under the sun
If we can't undo all the damage we've done
Guess we're gonna lose 'fore we even begun
Guess there's nothing new for us under the sun
You say that you're hurt, but you don't wanna change
Scared of getting worse so you push me away
Guess we're gonna lose 'fore we even begun
Guess there's nothing new for us under the sun

Ooh
There's nothing new for us under the sun
There's nothing new
Under the sun, under the sun
There's nothing new
Under the sun, under the sun
Guess we burned up, guess we burned out
And we burned up, yeah, we burned out
Under the sun, under the sun
Nothing new
