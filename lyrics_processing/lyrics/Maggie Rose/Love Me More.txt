Shot of patron, hair is a mess
I'm out on my own and I'm working this dress
Breaking the rules that almost broke me
Talking to boys, ignoring your call
Cause hearing your voice would only make me feel small
I couldn't be who you told me to be
With every shared cigarette, the later it gets

I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more
I love me more, yeah

Not gonna lie there's things that I miss
But you never tried to know me like this
I was losing myself until you lost me
I'm not gonna hide
My light's way too bright
You might also like
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more
I love me more, yeah
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules, that almost broke me
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules, that almost broke me
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules , that almost broke me
Breaking the rules

Breaking the rules

I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more
