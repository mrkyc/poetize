Everybody back in line
I run the show around here
No talking, get on your feet
Breakout
Breakout

You know I look good in stripes
Take my picture with my number
But the jailhouse ain't my type
I can't stand it any longer
Ooh, baby, I've got to breakout
Ooh, baby, I've got to breakout

Jailbreak, sweet escape
Let's bust the walls down
Jailbreak, sweet escape
Get off the ground

Chains can't hold me
In "Two, three, four", I'll be out the door
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout
Tip toe slowly
When "All lights out", gonna hit the floor
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout

Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool
Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool

It's too dark to see
You know that this could mean disaster
Got the spotlight chasin' me
But my feet are movin' faster
Ooh, baby, I've got to breakout
Ooh, baby, I've got to breakout

Jailbreak, sweet escape
Let's bust the walls down
Jailbreak, sweet escape
Get off the ground

Chains can't hold me
In "Two, three, four", I'll be out the door
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout
Tip toe slowly
When "All lights out", gonna hit the floor
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout
Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool
Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool
Breakout

Break, break, break, breakout
Get off the ground
Freeze

Chains can't hold me (Hold me down)
In "Two, three, four", I'll be out the door
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout
Tip toe slowly (Tip toe slowly)
When "All lights out", gonna hit the floor
(Breakout) Got to breakout
(Breakout) Got to breakout

Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool (Hold me down)
Oh, can't catch me, 'cause I'm cool
