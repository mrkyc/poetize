Up 'till then I wasn't sure
But he swaggered by and said
"The boys said to tell you hey"
And I was kicked back in his easy chair
Holding a fifth
Tapping the barrel of a fresh clean steel blue polished up .38
And I was kinda hoping he'd at least look scared
But all he said was
"OK, she was good and you don't dare"
Looking back now
I probably should've let him run
But paybacks are hell where I come from
Any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holdin' whiskey and a gun
The sun shines grey in the prison yard
Life to go was going hard
When the warden started getting sweet on me
He drug me up to a room one night
Poured me some 'ski
Gave me a light and I smoked slow
And waited 'till he was done
You might also likeAnd I thought that was that
'Till he got rough
And I fought back
And when I grabbed his pistol
He laughed and said, "Girl, you ain't got the guts"
Looking back now
I probably should've let him run
But paybacks are hell where I come from
Any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holdin' whiskey and a gun
They're strapping me down
And I'm scared to die
And I ain't the kinda girl to cry
But I find myself begging God for mercy
My hands are cold as I start to slip
Sodium thiopental drips
The room goes black
And I wonder if He heard me
Looking back now
I probably should've let him run
I bet paybacks are hell there where I'm going
But any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
