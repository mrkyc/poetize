Pretty people but I gotta warn ya
They're country as it gets
Divorce - everybody's cheatin'
Rehab - everybody's drinkin'
Welcome to the Wild Wild West
They call it Hollywood
It's not far from Dollywood
Just small towns with a different name
Dysfunctions, dysfunction
No matter what state you come from
It might as well be one and the same
If we said our lives through music
From here and now on
And everybody sang along
We'd sing a country song, oh, a country song
We'd be singing a country song
Tiny dogs and little bitty purses
Cosmos - everybody nurses
They get as trashed as we do, oh oh
Four kids, different baby daddy
Just hum, caught him with a fatty
That goes down in our town too

Yeah, it's backwoods all the way to Hollywood
It's one big reality show
Oh yeah, it's back to the W-O-O-D-S
All the same, no matter how you dress
What you drive or who you know
We're all stars in this Springer show
There's silicone and breastaline
Blowing up and getting thin
That's what you get when you set foot in
