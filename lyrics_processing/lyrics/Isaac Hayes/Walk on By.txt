If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Then walk on by, walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears (That you don't see the tears, let me grieve)
So just let me grieve (In private, 'cause each time I see you)
In private, 'cause each time I see you
I just can't help myself (I can't help it)
I think about how tight we used to be (Just break down and cry)
I break down and cry
Oh, baby, walk on by (Walk on)
Hmm

I just can't get over losing you
So if I seem broken in two
Please walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
(Is all that I have left, so let me hide)
That's all that I have left, so let me hide
(The tears and the sadness you gave me)
The tears and the sadness you gave me
I didn't ask for it (When you said it)
But you gave me
When you said goodbye
Oh, mama, walk on by (Walk on)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry (Walk on)
So, do me a favor, and walk on by (Walk on)
Please, oh, walk on by

Hmm
I just can't get over losing you (Walk on by)
So if I seem broken in two (Walk on by, walk)
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride

That's all that I have left, so let me hide
(The tears and the sadness you gave me)
The tears and the sadness you gave me
You put the hurt on me (When you said it)
You socked it to me, mama
When you said goodbye
So please, walk on by (Walk on)
Oh, mama, make believe you never see the tears I cry (Walk on by, walk)
So I'm beggin' you to walk on by, oh yeah (Walk on by, walk)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry (Walk on by, walk)
So I'm beggin' you, I'm beggin' you to walk on by (Walk on by, walk)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry (Walk on by, walk)
Oh, there's no dust in my eyes, oh no (Walk on by)
Smoke ain't making me cry, nah nah nah (Walk on by)
It's the hurt you put on me, yeah (Walk on by)
I don't want you to see this man cry (Walk on by)
So please, walk on by, oh, mama, mama (Walk on by)
