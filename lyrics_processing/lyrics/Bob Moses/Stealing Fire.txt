There's a feeling when you walk through the door
Oh, I know that you want something more
The feeling that I know who you are
Is gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
I could say it, but you already know
Why neither of us are letting go
Ain't it hard to deliver the blow?
Go on, go on, go on, go on

Come on, come on, come on
Can you feel it?
On and on and on
I'll repeat it
All that I can do for you is done
Back and forth, we meet in the middle
Pull me through the eye of a needle
Losing in a war already won
While you're stealing all the fire from the sun

There's a fear that you'd like me to know
Down here where it's all moving slow
Could keep it, but you won't let it go
Go on, go on, go on, go on
I wanna live where there's blood on the rise
You love it when there's blood on the line
And I'm sure that your lips love a lie
To call their own, their own, their own
You might also like
Come on, come on, come on
Can you feel it?
On and on and on
I'll repeat it
All that I can do for you is done
Back and forth, we meet in the middle
Pull me through the eye of a needle
Losing in a war already won
While you're stealing all the fire from the sun

But you don't know if I'm all yours yet
You don't know how much to take
Hear me out from where I come in
There's nothing now that you can say

Come on, come on, come on
Can you feel it?
On and on and on
I'll repeat it
All that I can do for you is done
Back and forth, we meet in the middle
Pull me through the eye of a needle
Losing in a war already won
