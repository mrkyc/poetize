Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testin' my patience, man
She was keepin' me up all night
'Cause you only get so far readin' faces
We were off to the races
And I thought to myself, "Hold tight"
You see there was just this one complication
She was already taken
And what was so wrong felt so right
She said, "No need to be lookin' over your shoulder
When you could just come over
And we could work this out just fine"

I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no gettin' over you
Slow me down, playin' by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catchin' up to you

If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearin' me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearin' me up
And I'm tryin' to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearin' me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearin' me up
You might also like
It all started with a simple conversation
It was all in the makin', man
She was talkin' me up all night
Kept asking if I was only fakin'
She was there for the takin'
Showin' me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her
Ya, she was makin' me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasin'
She had my heart racin'
And all it took was just one night

I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no gettin' over you
Slow me down, playin' by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catchin' up to you

If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearin' me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearin' me up
And I'm tryin' to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearin' me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearin' me up
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no gettin' over you
Slow me down, playin' by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catchin' up to you

If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearin' me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearin' me up
And I'm tryin' to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearin' me up
If you don't want my affection
