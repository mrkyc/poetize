A tunnel with no end
Here it comes again
A slowly creeping feeling
My old familiar friend
A voice without a name
Ringing in my head
The more that I believe it
I feel like giving in

Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
You might also like
I've been down this road
Further than you know
The finish line's retreating
There's still so far to go
Lost inside my head
It's more than I can stand
The pressure builds and
When it breaks I'll find out who I am

Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Oh you know it ain't easy on your own
We all need someone calling us back home
Saying to ya

Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
When you're going round the bend
Don't hold back
Just keep it rollin'
Down that track
Even when you
Fear you can't
You need someone to lean on
