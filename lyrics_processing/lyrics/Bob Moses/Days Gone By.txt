The world that you control is breaking and you feel it all
So cold around you, the pieces that you hold
Are falling with your feeling of the world, it found you
Even if I kneel, you worry that I turn around and steal
The future, feel it, you know well
So you play your part and turn away from me

With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson

The will behind your eyes, I could tell
That you can almost feel your pride
It's painted on your face
The smile that you would just as soon erase
If I would listen what you say
And not just play my part and turn away from you
You might also like
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
And you nor I have learned our lesson
With all of these days gone by
It's you and I, no need to question
Why all of these days go by
