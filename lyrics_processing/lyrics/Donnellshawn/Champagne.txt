I'm about to turn this place into a playground
Peeking all the flowers off the walls
Gotta let it burn, I guess that's what they say now
It's been a couple hours since we've talked

All those fireworks fill the room now
But girl I die here without you
 for the crew now
But girl I'm frustrated
And the only way that I can forget you is


Tonight we going in, pour some of the bottle
, taking them down in a row
And if it all , don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Tonight we drown the pain, in Champagne
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)
You might also like
Tinted off the windows just so no one sees me
Tippin' with somebody who ain't you
Pimpin' in the game, nobody said it was easy
Even when I win somehow I lose you


All those fireworks fill the room now
But girl I die here without you
 for the crew now
But girl I'm frustrated
And the only way that I can forget you is


Tonight we going in, pour some of the bottle
, taking them down in a row (down in a row)
And if it all , don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Tonight we drown the pain, in Champagne
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)

Let the Buzz kick in, and he's just sippin'
Blurrin' my vision, with a video vixen
She's a substitute, nothing like you
Let the  off, all my memory of you


Tonight we going in (going in), pour some of the bottle (pour)
, taking them down in a row
And if it all , don't worry 'bout tomorrow (oh, tonight)
Tonight we drown the pain, in Champagne
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)
(Pour some of the bottle, Champagne)
It's the only way that I know
