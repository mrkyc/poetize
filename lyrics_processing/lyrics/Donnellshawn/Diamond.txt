Painted your smile, but you left off the tears
It's 'bout to go down, there's glitter all on her skin
Tonight its gon' rain, but you won't need no umbrella
You work it so good, your name should be Cinderella

Fourty-five for a dance
Pass it off to your master
Gone with love, watch your hands
On the wall, papershower

If only they could see just who you are
There wouldn't be a price tag on your heart
'Cause even in the dark I see, that you're a diamond
You're a diamond
And I really wanna throw these bills at you
But tell me what I'm not supposed to do
'Cause written on name of your tattoo is diamond
You're a diamond

Started off shy, but now there's no ambitions
The money gon' fly, as long as you got bad wishes
The lights are so low, you probably can't see their faces
You movin' so slow, your body's in automation
You might also like
Fourty-five for a dance
Pass it off to your master
Gone with love, watch your hands
On the wall, papershower
:
If only they could see just who you are
There wouldn't be a price tag on your heart
'Cause even in the dark I see, that you're a diamond
You're a diamond
And I really wanna throw these bills at you
But tell me what I'm not supposed to do
'Cause written on name of your tattoo Is diamond
You're a diamond

Met a good girl after 3AM
She was all done for the night
Couldn't recognize it was me again, she had to get used to the lights
Lookin' for a love from a president, she couldn't care less 'bout a vice
Knew what it would be for a private dance, but for a heart she couldn't name the price

If only they could see just who you are
There wouldn't be a price tag on your heart
'Cause even in the dark I see, that you're a diamond
You're a diamond
And I really wanna throw these bills at you
But tell me what am I supposed to do
'Cause written on name of your tattoo Is diamond
