Girl you look like you wanna ride
And I feel like I wanna go
Test drive that, I prefered that rush
When we are out the road
But do you want me to press the gas
Or do you want me to ride the brakes?
You can reach the destination
No matter how long that it takes

Girl you got some nerves
Going in here, all them curves
If I don't got what it takes to drive, girl
Then I don't know what you've heard
You don't need a professional
Anywhere, girl we can go
Put the padle to the floor
But first you gotta let me know

Tell me, what's your speed limit
Cause I don't wnat to move too fast
And I don't want to move too slow
Let me know your speed limit
Tell me now before we hit the road
Cause I don't wanna lose control
Shawty what's your
You might also like
If I switch to another gear
Then getting cracking up in here
Is it cool with you?
Tell me what to do
Set the base, I take the wheel
Cause I ain't try to slow it up
But I ain't try to jump to ten
With a body like that
Put the top down
Ain't that be a ride you won't forget

Girl you got some nerves
Going in here, all them curves
If I don't got what it takes to drive, girl
Then I don't know what you've heard
You don't need a professional
Anywhere, girl we can go
Put the padle to the floor
But first you gotta let me know

Tell me, what's your speed limit
Cause I don't wnat to move too fast
And I don't want to move too slow
Let me know your speed limit
Tell me now before we hit the road
Cause I don't wanna lose control
Shawty what's your
I can make it smooth like we're out of control
(Cause I just wanna make you comfortable)
But I just wanna be prepared, before we can go
Shawty let me know

Tell me, what's your speed limit
Cause I don't wnat to move too fast
And I don't want to move too slow
Let me know your speed limit
Tell me now before we hit the road
Cause I don't wanna lose control
