One of us has got to try
To cut this off
Cause I don't wanna live a lie
Laying next to you
Or hit me when he ain't around (around)
And I'll stop by to feed you the apple leaf
Gonna escape with no casualties
:
I know karma is a mother but I just can't let you go
If we keep it off the radar, I won't let your cover blow

Cause you're not my girl, when you're with him
But you rock my world, what's forbidden
Always seems to be so much better, better, better, better
So much better, better, better, better
(You're not my girl, girl, girl, you rock my world, world, world, always seems to be-)

So save my name on someone else
When you message me (message me)
Cause I ain't tryna to knock him out
If he stepped to me (ooh)
And Imma tryna not get sprung
Let the truth be told, I don't wanna share no more
But I see he was here before me

Change my name from Shawn to Shauna
Meet me outside the car is warmed up
Don't never break, we can take this to the grave
In the afterlife, you'd still be the perfect gate
I wanna say you should switch teams
But I know you wanna see both, split screen
So I'm in and out like a robbery
Hotel, please leave the key in the lobby
Hotel, put that on the skeleton beside me
He gonna be career, I guess I'll be the hobby
He gonna be career, I guess I'll be the hobby
Keep the head low never sloppy
He got the key to your heart but does he know I got a copy, copy, probably
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't care
You're not my girl
I'm sitting on the sideline
