Ooooh oh oh oh

Yeah yeah, so it brought you all this way to planet earth
And all you looking for in it passing earth
Slightly strange but I'm so glad I could be first, first to make it work


Though your orbits, are familiar
Girl somehow I, can still feel ya
You say your moon is, made of silver
Oh this, I really gotta see
Can you take me there


Say there galactic girl
Tell me what you're doing in an average world
Like this
You should be in the sky
Ridin' the milky way
Baby cause you're so fly
But you landed here with me
Galactic girl (galactic girl, galactic girl)
Galactic girl (galactic girl, galactic girl)

Oh no, baby I can't take my focus off of you
Your intelligence is astronomical
This invasion happened straight above the globe
Much too good to be true


Cause your light year, is a million
And your space ship, is so brilliant
You say your moon is, made of silver
Well this, I really gotta see
Can you take me there


Galactic girl
Tell me what you doing in an average world
Like this
You should be in the sky
Ridin' the milky way
Baby cause you're so fly
But you landed here with me
Galactic girl (galactic girl, galactic girl)
Galactic girl (galactic girl, galactic girl)

Girl you're like a star, brighter than the sun
I know who you are, you might be the one
Let's take this UFO back to where you're from
Just the two of us


Say there galactic girl
Tell me what you doing in an average world
Like this
You should be in the sky
Ridin' the milky way
Baby cause you're so fly
But you landed here with me
Say there galactic girl
Tell me what you doing in an average world
Like this
You should be in the sky
Ridin' the milky way
Baby cause you're so fly
But you landed here with me
Galactic girl (galactic girl, galactic girl)
