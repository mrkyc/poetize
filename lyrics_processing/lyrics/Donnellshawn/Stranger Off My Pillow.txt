We should never drown in the tears, oh yeah
But you're the type of girl that would reach in and save me
So maybe I should just disappear, oh yeah
But you would need a while, you could just recreate me

I must be crazy to risk losing it all
Wish I could untie your heart, but it's double knotted
Girl you should trade me and get back what you lost
But the moment you let go, you're hurt so you just say to me

Why won't you call me?
When I've been sitting by the phone since three in the morning
'Cause girl I can't get the stranger off my bed
Stranger off my bed
But girl I love you, I do
I wish she was you, I do
She don't even touch you, oh
And I don't wanna lose you

I could never die in your arms, oh no
'Cause you're the type of girl that won't let love just slip, no
I'm laying next to my Ms. Wrong
Never recognize 'cause the face is a mystery
You might also like
I must be crazy to risk losing it all
Wish I could untie your heart, but it's double knotted
Girl you should trade me and get back what you lost
But the moment you let go, you're hurt so you just say to me

Why won't you call me? (Why)
When I've been sitting by the phone since three in the morning
'Cause girl I can't get the stranger off my bed (Oooh)
Stranger off my bed
But girl I love you, I do (I really really do)
I wish she was you, I do
She don't even touch you, oh (no she don't even)
And I don't wanna lose you

I wrote a new lie on a pillow case, hoping to god that it will erase
Maybe by the morning, think her name was done, so waiting for the sun to reveal her face
And we meet for the first time, probably speak for the last
And you know but you just won't go so you just ask

Why won't you call me? (Why won't you call)
When I've been sitting by the phone since three in the morning (Three in the morning, oh)
'Cause girl I can't get the stranger off my bed (Oooh)
Stranger off my bed (Ooh)
But girl I love you, I do (I really really do)
I wish she was you, I do
She don't even touch you, no
And I don't wanna lose you
