It's clear now, that it wasn't in my head
It's getting worse now 'cause you're not lying in my bed
It'd be too late now, let them see that side of me
And yesterday still lingers like the bruises on my fingers
Took me blindly, the way he grabbed you by the hand
And looked right through me like a shadow of a man
With a kind of cruelty, couldn't stand a chance
And his blurry face still lingers like the bruises of my fingers

The yellow lines I'm chasing got caught in a spiral
And my lover watched me fall from a man to a child
I could see her let me go in a drop of her smile
Now it's seven in the morning and I can't breathe

Oh my my, about last night
I know I lost my mind, jealousy
Oh my my, about last night
I want you on my mind, jealousy
Hopelessly in love, darling, don't you leave me
Got me hopelessly in love, baby, please believe me
Oh my my, about last night
I always win the fight, it's you and me

It's clear now that the demons are in me
You shouldn't fear now, they're not as bad as they may seem
But you're hurt now and it's all because of me
You know I'll spend a million lives, just trying to make it right

The yellow lines I'm chasing got caught in a spiral
And my lover watched me fall from a man to a child
I could see her let me go in a drop of her smile
Now it's seven in the morning and I can't breathe

Oh my my, about last night
I know I lost my mind, jealousy
Oh my my, about last night
I want you on my mind, jealousy
Hopelessly in love, darling, don't you leave me
Got me hopelessly in love, baby, please believe me
Oh my my, about last night
I always win the fight, it's you and me

Oh my my, about last night
I know I lost my mind, jealousy
Oh my my, about last night
I want you on my mind, jealousy
Hopelessly in love, darling, don't you leave me
Got me hopelessly in love, baby, please believe me
Oh my my, about last night
