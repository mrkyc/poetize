Stick lies and rhymes about the old days
Keeping rich just to make new waves
I thought about it in a few ways
Pull back, took on the pale blaze
Middle role, the world 'bout the game play
Soft focus hard on the airplay
Tryna make it sound like the new phase
It's only gonna be the same

Peering down was falling deep heat
Streak back trying to give it upbeat
False fibs talk about the old streets
Brick wall hit by the concrete
Throw Ben, backhand his pony
Hard to tell if any 
Took back time to think like the old me
It's only gonna be the same

Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
It's only gonna be the same

Shakes hard, turning out to get paid
Bad times, sees the people real fake
Pushing on her hard whats already been made
Coming up fast, cut glass, the next take
Better put your sticker on cause you gonna break
Late nights make you walk sideways
And now we're gonna party my way
It's only gonna be the same

Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love

It's only gonna be the same
