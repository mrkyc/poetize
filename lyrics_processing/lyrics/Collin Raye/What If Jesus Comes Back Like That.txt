He came to town on an old freight train
He jumped off in the pouring rain
Everybody says he's insane
Just a low down no account hobo
He made his bed beneath the county bridge
The city folks said "hey, that's not his"
They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash

What if Jesus comes back like that?
On an old freight train in a hobo hat
Will we let him in or turn our back?
What if Jesus comes back like that?
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that?

She was born into drug abuse
She couldn't help what her mama used
It wasn't like she got to choose
Now she's layin' there all alone
Got a monkey on her back
The nurses say they never saw a smile like that
Doctor says she might stand a chance
If somebody takes her home

What if Jesus comes back like that?
Two months early and hooked on crack
Will we let him in or turn our back?
What if Jesus comes back like that?
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that?

Nobody said life is fair
We've all got a cross to bear
When it gets a little hard to care
Just think about him hanging there

He came to town on a cold dark night
A single star his only light
The baby born that silent night
A manger for his bed

What if Jesus comes back like that?
Where will he find out hearts are at?
Will he let us in or turn his back?
What if Jesus comes back like that?
Will he cry when he sees where our hearts are at?
Will he let us in or turn his back?
What if Jesus comes back like that?
