There's a reason for the sunshiny sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love lights shines all around us
So let that feelin' grab you deep inside
And send you reelin' where your love can't hide
And then go stealin' through the summer nights
With your lover
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Just let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason, yeah, yeah
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love lights shine
All around us
So let the wonder take you into space
And lay you under its lovin' embrace
Oh, feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back, no, you can't hold back
