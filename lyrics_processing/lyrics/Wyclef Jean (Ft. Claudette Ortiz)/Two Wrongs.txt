I'm just sittin' here playin' the guitar

City High, Claudette and 'Clef (oooh oooh oh)

Ehh, excuse me
If you see me screamin'
Deep in my mind
I'm only dreamin'
Cuz if I wake girl
And your not by my side
I feel like half of me
Is no longer alive
So please shorty
Before you walk out that door, booby
Would you listen to my song?

If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
Wit the devil you can no longer dance
You've got to be faithful
So we could be fruitful
Build a family
And follow God's destiny
So just before I run to the block, papi
I might listen to your song
You might also like
OOH, before you walk out that door listen

They say two wrongs don't make a right
Don't make it right
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
Yeah, yea
Lay up in tha bed and make love all night
So papi I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same
Girl I'mma love you, like I never loved you
Touch me, like you never touched me
Yo, if you give me the chance girl, I'm gone show you
+(Wyclef)
Now baby, understand (I understand)
That I forgive you
But I ain't gone forget
That you brought me pain
Baby, baby, baby, baby
But I have grown
From a thug into a man
Built my castle with bricks
And no longer with sand
Oh girl

Then just before I run to the block baby
I might listen to your song

BOO, before you walk out that door listen

They say two wrongs don't make it right
Don't make it right
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I don't wanna fight
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
Yeah, yea
Lay up in tha bed and make love all night
So papi I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same
Girl I'mma love you, like I never loved you
Touch me, like you never touched me
Yo, if you give me the chance girl, I'm gone show you
I'm so used to rain
That I can't see the sunshine no more
I'm so used to the pain that the
The sickness feels like the cure

But only if you gave me the keys to your soul
And let me in, I'm gonna love you over
Over
And over
Over
Again
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, Ohh

They say two wrongs don't make a right
That Don't make it right, no!
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I don't wanna fight, no, whoa, oh
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
Yeah, yea, make love to me!
Lay up in tha bed and make love all night
So papi I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
