With a rockin' little body that just won't stop
Her legs go on and on and on 'til I lose my mind
She got her hair pulled back and some cutoff jeans
Like the picture on the cover of a magazine
She's making downtown main street look like Rodeo Drive
And I know you've got big city dreams
Oh but what you want ain't always what you need
I think you need a long dirt road and a bottle of wine
If I can wrap you in my arms then I can make you mine
Can't buy you expensive things and diamond rings
But there's a moonlight view from my porch swing
And you won't know what you're missing 'til it's gone
Maybe this small town love's what you needed all along
I'm not a rhinestone cowboy with a platinum card
I got an '87 Chevy, play an old guitar
I know the back roads of this town like the back of my hand
When there's hay to haul and work to do
I'm the first one there and the last one through
I think the love of a woman was meant for just one man
And I know you've got big city dreams
Oh but what you want ain't always what you need
I think you need a long dirt road and a bottle of wine
If I can wrap you in my arms then I can make you mine
Can't buy you expensive things and diamond rings
But there's a moonlight view from my porch swing
And you won't know what you're missing 'til it's gone
Maybe this small town love's what you needed all along
I had just one chance, I couldn't let it slip away
I had to lay it all on the line, convince you to stay
At the end of a long dirt road and a bottle of wine
When I wrapped you in my arms I knew that you were mine
It's gonna be tough but we'll get through
On an old porch swing with a moonlight view
'Cause right here by my side's where you belong
Yea, right here by my side's where you belong
Maybe this small town love's what you needed all along
