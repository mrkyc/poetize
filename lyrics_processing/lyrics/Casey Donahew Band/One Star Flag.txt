And this look on my face like I don't give a shit
Everybody's acting like I'm the only one messed up
I'm staring down the barrel of a whiskey bottle
Got the hammer down and I can't find the throttle
I'm revved up red line lookin' for a place to go
And I'm headed south like a freight train bound for Texas
There's a girl in Fort Worth who swears I'm on her mind
And she tells me the bed gets cold when she's all alone
And that one star flag is waving like it's calling me home
I got nerves of steel with my head on the gate
And when I nod my head I'll be lookin' for it
When my heart beats pumpin' so hard I can't catch my breath
I hope that it blows and turns into my hand
And I'll make a move for the girls in the stand
And I'll be smiling with a choker while I'm holding up the buckle
We'll be takin' it to the bar 'cause the drinks are on me
And I'm headed south like a freight train bound for Texas
There's a girl in Fort Worth who swears I'm on her mind
And she tells me the bed gets cold when she's all alone
And that one star flag is waving like it's calling me home
Well, if you think I'm easy, you're mistakin'
This left hand will leave you shakin'
I might bend, but I won't break
You can have what you can take
Come and get it, you'll regret it
Better just walk away
