And you'd still be here if I had it my way
But pages of our fairy tale are torn
But I've got my pride to keep me warm
And now this room feels like a tomb
On the dark side of the moon
And I know you're in his arms again
I should have begged you to stay
And never let you walk away
I should've told you that my hearts always been yours
So let these empty memories burn
Because you have not returned
And you know regrets
They are the hardest lessons learned
I often wonder if I ever cross your mind
Now I know you're gone
But my heart still thinks that there's time
And there's no life left in this place we called a home
The hardest part of waking up is knowing I'm alone
And now this room feels like a tomb
On the dark side of the moon
And I know you're in his arms again
I should have begged you to stay
And never let you walk away
I should've told you that my hearts always been yours
