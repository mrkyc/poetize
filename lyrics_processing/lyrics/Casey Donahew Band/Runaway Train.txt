Broken soul and I'm not believin' that
She's gone and I'm the fool again
Up high, take me down
The time goes on and my tears hit the ground
And I look back, I find that she's a friend
I'm runnin' fast, I'm gettin' nowhere
And I still remember the smell of your hair
And the way you looked whenever I would hitch a ride
And you were headed south on a runaway train
My life's in pieces like a broken picture frame
Love to hold you, but you long to be free
You need somebody, and I don't think that it's me
You walked away without sayin' a word
I tried to call you, but I guess you never heard
That was me and I was screamin' your name
But you were headed south on this runaway train
I still recall the day we met
The sky was cloudy how could I forget the way you looked in that blue dress
I sit alone in a room of friends and scattered thoughts dance through my head and I wonder if you'd ever love me at all
By my next picture in my head, and I still remember the last thing you said was
I've gotta go, and please don't follow me
And you were headed south on a runaway train
My life's in pieces like a broken picture frame
Love to hold you, but you long to be free
You need somebody, and I don't think that it's me
You walked away without sayin' a word
I tried to call you, but I guess you never heard
That was me and I was screamin' your name
But you were headed south on this runaway train
