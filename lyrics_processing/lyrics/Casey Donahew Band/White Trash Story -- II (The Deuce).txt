'Cause I'm sick of sitting here still
The good times and the bad have left me broke
Grandma, she smoked all my swagger
Dale Earnhardt 3 and the rebel flag
This trailer park is going straight to hell
But I'm still first class white trash if you can't tell
Now Junior, he's a little slow
He got 18 months for the plants he grows
And Mary Lou's back on the stripper pole to pay the bills
They got barefoot kids in cut off shorts
They spend every week down at juvie court
For startin' fights and selling grandmas pills
Sarah Anne she can't be found
I guess she got tired of being passed around
And planned a waffle house wedding
On the morning of a one night stand
I gotta get this trailer rolling down hill
'Cause I'm sick of sitting here still
The good times and the bad have left me broke
Grandma, she smoked all my swagger
Dale Earnhardt 3 and the rebel flag
This trailer park is going straight to hell
But I'm still first class white trash if you can't tell

'Cause my Jon boat stuck at the bottom of the lake
I got weekend stays and 6 months community service
And there's a pitbull chained to every tree
With a cardboard sign that says, pups are free
We got pink flamingos and blow up plastic pools
We like spotlight huntin' and natural light
And the cops get called here every night
And there's a 12 gauge smoking from a woman who can take a punch
I gotta get this trailer rolling down hill
'Cause I'm sick of sitting here still
The good times and the bad have left me broke
Grandma, she smoked all my swagger
Dale Earnhardt 3 and the rebel flag
This trailer park is going straight to hell
But I'm still first class white trash if you can't tell
My little sister's getting married today
And my dad's still in jail, so I'll give her away
I'm gonna get hammered drunk
And light some shit on fire
I gotta get this trailer rolling down hill
'Cause I'm sick of sitting here still
The good times and the bad are all that's left
It's either house arrest or on parole
There's no turning back, I'm out of control
And this trailer park is going straight to hell
But I'm still first class white trash if you can't tell
