Big blue eyes like the Kansas sky
He sat down beside me and we talked a bit
I told him my dreams, he told me his
It became so clear with every word he said
That boy didn't have a brain in his head
Sometimes, I think I'm lost in a fairy tale
In the land of Oz where nothing's real
Is it too much to ask for some honesty
From a boy who really is what he seems to be
I wish I knew which way to go
'Cause you can't find love on the yellow brick road
He was acting real smooth when I caught his eye
Silver tongued devil with an axe to grind
Said those things a girl likes to hear
Had a little way of whispering in my ear
But he played that game with every girl he met
I swear he didn't have a heart in his chest
Sometimes, I think I'm lost in a fairy tale
In the land of Oz where nothing's real
Is it too much to ask for some honesty
From a boy who really is what he seems to be
I wish I knew which way to go
'Cause you can't find love on the yellow brick road

Pulled up in the drive with a mighty roar
Played a good game, acted so tough
Had me believing that it could be love
But he tucked his tail between his legs
When it came to commitment, he was scared to death
Sometimes, I think I'm lost in a fairy tale
In the land of Oz where nothing's real
Is it too much to ask for some honesty
From a boy who really is what he seems to be
I wish I knew which way that I could go
I wish I knew which way to go
'Cause you can't find love on the yellow brick road
No, you can't find love on the yellow brick road
