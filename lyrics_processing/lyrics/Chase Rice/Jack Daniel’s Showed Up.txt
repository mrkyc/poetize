Flat on my back, underneath my truck
Couple buddies rollin' in to help me fix 'er up
I ask for a wrench, and they gave me a Solo
So we've been workin' long enough today
So I'm thinking it's Coors Banquet or Miller Lite
But to my head shakin', a cold sip surprise

Jack Daniels showed up
See, I was supposed to just get a little bit of a buzz
From the fuzz of a cold beer, then out of nowhere
He just had to interrupt, and jump into my cup
Yeah, he wasn't invited, but that's alright
Man, we all decided he could hang all night
Wasn't supposed to be a party, just chill enough
Just a couple of buds, but

Friday night country song, low C
I brought the cooler, she brought the heat
And then she turned me on & up a couple hundred degrees
When she turned down my beer and reached under the seat

See, I was supposed to just get a little bit of a buzz
From the fuzz of a cold beer, then out of nowhere
He just had to interrupt, and jump into my cup
Yeah, he wasn't invited, but that's alright
Man, we both decided he could hang all night
Wasn't supposed to be a party, just chill enough
A little back seat love, but

See Chase Rice LiveGet tickets as low as $85You might also like
So Gorley, Chris and I were just a-writing this song
But you know four names should get credit
'Cause us three picked guitars all night long
But it didn't sound like a hit record 'til

'Til he busted through the door, like what?
