Ready, set
Let's roll, let's roll

Damn, pretty girl, you went and done it again
You gone and turned your sexy all the way up to ten
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a Fireball shot
You got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town

Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Then slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we got all night
Ready, set, let's roll (Let's roll)
Ready, set, let's ride (Let's ride)

Ready, set, let's roll where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set
