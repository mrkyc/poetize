Five card, with the fellas on a Friday night
One hit, a little trip to get us feeling right
Boom boom coming hot out the tubes
Talking big game like us boys do
Then those hazel eyes, fire the light
On the eye five now I'm throwing deuces
I'm gone, fellas, catch you on the flip side
They give me hell like, what the hell?
Man you always bounce with poor excuses
But I'm out the door, hauling ass to you and ninety-five

I ride, swinging dust in my truck, can't get to you quick enough
Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets, you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

Girl why you laughing? I've told this joke a thousand times
But don't you dare stop, you know I love to hear your smile
Laying you down feels so right, nothing better than you by my side
Yeah then you give me hell for a smell, a high life on my breath
I say, come on, now you knew I'd be right here
I was up a hundred bucks when you hit me with that text
Folded on a full house and threw my truck in fifth gear

Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets, you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week
Yeah hanging with them is a damn good time
But it's got nothing on what, what I'm seeing tonight
So I ride, swinging dust in my truck, can't get to you quick enough
Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
