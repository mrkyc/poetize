It was a Friday night win and followed by a Saturday bruise
It was a first Blue Ribbon my dad and I drank, baptized on Glenville lake
A tear in our eyes the night we lost all we had to lose
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Oh, Carolina can
It was faded blue denim on Franklin Street
A "He's Not" buzz, a house band beat
It was a summer heat dragging me to a fifth year fall
It was classes skipped cause the room couldn't teach
What we learned three days on Wrightsville beach
With my high school love, short hair
And that sweet hometown southern drawl
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah, Carolina can
Carolina can

Oh hey Mr. Taylor, she ain't only on your mind
That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
The six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
