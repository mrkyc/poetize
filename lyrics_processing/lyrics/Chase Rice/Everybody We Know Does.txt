Everybody we know does

Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel, spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell, turn it up, sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust, but everybody we know does

That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin'
Not everybody knows what we're made of, but
Everybody we know does
