Wasn't hello, it wasn't goodbye
It's everything in between that hangs in my mind
Got your dust heart on my dashboard
Your flip flops on my floorboard
Your scratch-offs that you asked for
Your tire marks on my carport

I, I never woulda wrote you a love song
Woulda told you to keep all of your clothes on
Woulda never turned you on like late night TV
Let you talk to me dirty, oh, silly me
I woulda never been a stand-up guy
Shoulda stood you up the very first night
And girl, I woulda never let you go
Had I known that you'd be so unforgettable

Unforgettable, unforgettable, yeah

Benny Ludwig's, Alma Jean's, anything Tennessee
Tin roof, cheap whiskey, ignites your memory
Like every Jeep I see on the road
I slow on down and secretly hope
I see your face through the window, whoa
