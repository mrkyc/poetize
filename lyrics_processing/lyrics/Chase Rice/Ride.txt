Oh, oh, woah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pullin' on your hair
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body, baby, this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fuckin' runnin', feel the heat between us two

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's gettin' hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'm gon' make you feel that lovin', gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top all the way down to your feet

Yeah, girl, we can go slow (Oh, woah, yeah)
Yeah, we can go slow (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
