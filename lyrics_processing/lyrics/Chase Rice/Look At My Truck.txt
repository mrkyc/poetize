There's a shotgun on the rack, and that rearview's got a picture of us
That radio dial stays on 95.3 cause it's the only one around here that plays country
If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck
That headlights still busted out from the night they tried to take my keys
And that tailgate's all rusted now, but you wouldn't believe the good times it's seen
And when the girls would come and it can haul some ass
You'd never seen an '85 hit a hundred that fast
If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck
Yeah, plenty of stop sign, birds on the power line, shot in the daylight on county road 39
Plenty of full moons, plenty of me and you, plenty of memories in the rearview
If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of
I said if ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck
