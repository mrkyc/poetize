Met a guy named Tony down in San Antone
Said the best kinda love is like a rodeo
When you get bucked off, you climb back on
Keep jukebox spinnin' like a country song
Rolled into Missoula where nobody knew ya
Met a brand-new girl, but I swore I was talkin' to ya
So I hit the coast and I blew some smoke
Found a brand-new way to say adios

Somewhere between Key West and Colorado
I found God in a gold Silverado
Had to get a little lost to get a little found
Learned you can't find love if you can't slow down
Somewhere between that sand and the snow
Salt in the air and salt on the road
Finally let myself let her go
Somewhere between Key West and Colorado

I broke down in Boston on my way down to Austin
Cost me three damn days, but I gained a little ground up there
Then steerin' wheel prayers
Are steerin' me straight 'til I didn't care

Salt in the air and salt on the road
Finally let myself let her go
Somewhere between Key West and Colorado
Key West and Colorado

Coulda been the boardwalk, coulda been Boulder
But I knew it was over

Somewhere between Key West and Colorado
I found God in a gold Silverado
Had to get a little lost to get a little found
Learned you can't find love if you can't slow down
Somewhere between that sand and the snow
Salt in the air and salt on the road
