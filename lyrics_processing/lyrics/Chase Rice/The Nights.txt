I can still hear the gravel on my truck tires down the drive
You were in the passenger seat and we were both cryin'
Holdin' hands at the airport, I was droppin' you off
Left you in a ticket line for the last time
It's almost like you were never here
(Like you were never, never here)
Now it's a sip, a hit, and I disappear

But it gets me though the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
Gets me to the light, gets me through the pain
'Cause if I can't get to you, what's the point anyway?
Might run me off the tracks, might drown me in the waves
Might make me lose my mind, might send me to grave
But it gets me through the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
It gets me through the night

Now it's been a year, it's pretty clear I'm not over you
Could say it's all good and cool, but we both know that ain't true (That ain't true)
You see me actin' a fool in this shit I post, you know most
That I'm a fraud and that ain't me

But it gets me though the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
Gets me to the light, gets me through the pain
'Cause if I can't get to you, what's the point anyway?
Might run me off the tracks, might drown me in the waves
Might make me lose my mind, might send me to grave
But it gets me through the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
It gets me through the night
(Gets me through the night)

This'll be my last shot, reachin' out
'Cause I know you're through
But P.S., I still love you

And it gets me though the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
Gets me to the light, gets me through the pain
'Cause if I can't get to you, what's the point anyway?
Might run me off the tracks, might drown me in the waves
Might make me lose my mind, might send me to grave (Send me away)
But it gets me through the nights, gets me through the days
Gets me through the memories I can't escape
