Maybe your granddad kept his dog tags hanging on the rearview
And maybe your mama drove you around in a Chevy Nova bright blue
Might've got your 16 first date, yes at a slider in the drive thru
Down on Main Street, she was so cute, ended up just friends
If it sounds like it could've been you, or it's somewhere you might've been
Can I get an amen?

For a Roman candle sky
A July praying for rain
Yeah, sparks out the window, cigarette
With her silhouette caught in the flames
The keys to a fix-it-up dream
The love in a first crush heart
And to not knowing the secrets of life
But damn sure knowing where it starts
Amen, amen, amen

And maybe you shot some bullet holes through the tail of a windmill
Stuck a cross in some flowers by the road on the edge of a wheat field
And maybe that scar on your hands from a midnight parking lot disagreement with one of your buddies
So you squared off, then you made up
With a tailgate cold beer apology
Just some memories that'll always be
