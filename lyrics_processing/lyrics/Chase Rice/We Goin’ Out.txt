"C'mon man, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Heh, I'm going out"
We got the crew and the crew cap rocking that rebel flag
All hats back like a redneck rat pack
Boys looking cool blowing smoke from the mary jane
Girls hair down, frayed out, brought that A game
Kick back and watch how we do
Like Project X, we're next on the YouTube, yeah
We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out
It's going down like a whiskey waterfall
So raise your cup up up for a rockstar roll call
The yeti's low quick damn right we're killing it
Cold throwing in looks like we'll be chilling it
We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
