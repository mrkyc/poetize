Silhouette, moonlight halo
Wayfarer's looking all Hollywood
What you got there in that Solo?
Looking like it's doing you good
Cause you sipping it back, swaying around
Lighting it up and toking it down
We're partying with all our friends
You're showing off, you got me all

Yeah you got me all mmm girl, mmm girl
Yeah I'm buzzing like a shot of Jack, honey on a summer night
Mmm girl, mmm girl, you're rocking that Pink Floyd tee
And those frayed outs just right
I've got a fast ride waiting on a slow roll
I'm cranking up a little Strait on the radio
Mmm girl, mmm girl, yeah you're working it flirting
Got your tummy out on the prowl
Mmm girl, mmm girl, what you doing for the rest of the night?

Victoria's Secret, they're peeking out
It'd be a damn good secret to keep
It's something that you ain't gotta worry bout
I'll keep it just between you and me
And tick tock, time to wind it down
Before we take it on back to town
We'll top it off, last call, just wanna be
You and me, you and me, yeah
