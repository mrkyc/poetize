Firewood crackle in the fall air
"Red Dirt" playing on a radio
Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen

Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby

Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve
The kind that you never let go of
