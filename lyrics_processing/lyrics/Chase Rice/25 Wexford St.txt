Was I just dreaming?
Were my eyes playing tricks on me?
Was I really seeing?
Such a belle at 25 Wexford Street
I ain't gonna lie, don't recall her name
But the Dublin lights saw everything
Now the legend lives all across that town
An American boy and an Irish gal

That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur

Black hair, blue eyes, tattoos dark as night
And her necklace just said "dreamer" on a key
I ain't gonna lie, I recall her curse
And the jet black ink of a Bible verse
The things we did, never thought I would
But the 23rd psalm never looked so good

That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur


Kinda fitting her necklace said "dreams"
That's the only time I see her

Yeah, that night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Yeah, that night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur
What a beautiful blur
