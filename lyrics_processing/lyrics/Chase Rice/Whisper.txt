What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night?
What if I slid a match and lit the wick?
What if I shut you up with my lips on your lips?

Let the gravel of my voice
Drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight (Tell me right now)
These thoughts that no one else should hear
Cut through my lips, dance in your ear
'Til light (Lay me on down)
Comes burning through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me, baby, with nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls, oh
Hear what can start with a whisper

And what if that kitchen table gets a wreck?
Yeah, plates crashing down with my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94 you spent at the store
Takes the rest the night off as it slides to the floor

Answer me, baby, with nothing but your body

Hear what can start with a whisper

Mm, oh, with a whisper, yeah

Let the gravel of my voice
Drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight (Tell me right now)
These thoughts that no one else should hear
Cut through my lips, dance in your ear
'Til light (Lay me on down)

Your hands got a crazy way of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls, mm
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper, yeah
