I've been sitting here watching
I can't stop staring at you
Across the room
I can see you in my truck, I can see you downtown
I can see you waking up, I can see you laying down
See you in the lights, dancing to the band
Or here in my hand

So what's your name? Where you from?
What's your drink when you get drunk?
What's your sign? What's your song?
I wanna know what turns you on
What you wear when you get home
Who do you call when you're alone?
Every guy in here is thinking the same thing
Girl, what's your name?

Yeah, we've never spoken
And you've never met me before
I'm pretty sure
I can see you in the dark, I can see you in a dress
I can see your pretty head sleeping on my chest
I can't help it, it's outta nowhere
Oh, but girl, I gotta go there

So what's your name? Where you from?
What's your drink when you get drunk?
What's your sign? What's your song?
Tell me, girl, what turns you on
What gets you down? What gets you high?
What keeps you up in the dead of night?
What I don't know about you's killing me
