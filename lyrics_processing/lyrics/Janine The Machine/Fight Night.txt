Round of applause to the asshole
Who broke my heart and left me paralyzed
I knew that we would crash and burn
I could see it in your eyes
But I couldn't shake it your love
Yo-your love had me hypnotized
Hyp-hyp-hypnotized
Now I'm so mad
I'm so mad I just want to fight you
I'm so mad, I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
Now I'm so mad
I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
I'm so mad
Now I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
I'm mad as hell
T-turing red
Ballin' up my fist
Punchin' walls and shit
You might also likeOut of your mind
Out of control
You make my skin crawl
You make my blood boil
Blood boil
And I can't believe you left me here
Said we were forever
How did you just disappear
I lost my lover, I lost my friend
Now my heart is broken
And I'll never love again
Whoa, I'm dyin' inside
Whoa, and I wanna start a fight
C'mon, stand in a circle
Cheer me on
(Fight, fight, fight)
Pass me a brick
I wanna throw it at his car
(Fight, fight, fight)
Pump me up
Pump me up
Give me life
(Fight, fight, fight)
'Cuz tonight I wanna start a fight
Now I'm so mad
I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
I'm so mad
I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
Now I'm so mad
I'm so mad I just want to fight you
I'm so mad
Now I'm so mad
I just want to fight you
The love is dead
No need to talk
T-t-ticking like a bomb
You flipped my switch off, switch off
And I can't believe you left me here
Said we were forever
How did you just disappear
I lost my lover, I lost my friend
Now my heart is broken
And I'll never love again
Whoa
I'm dyin' inside
Whoa
And I wanna start a fight
C'mon, stand in a circle
Cheer me on
(Fight, fight, fight)
Pass me a brick
I wanna throw it at his car
(Fight, fight, fight)
Pump me up
Pump me up
Give me life
(Fight, fight, fight)
'Cuz tonight I swear
