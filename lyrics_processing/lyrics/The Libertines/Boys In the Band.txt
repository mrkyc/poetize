You walk in like you've never seen the light
You walk in like it every night
But I've never seen you dance and I've never heard you sing
So how could it mean a single thing?

It's all so rudimentary

You're talking like you're handy in a fight
You're talking like it every night
But I've never seen those flowers in the barrel of your gun
All I've ever seen you do is run

It's all so rudimentary

Well, tell me, baby, oh, how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel, yeah

And they all get them out for (They all get them out)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
They twist and they shout for (They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
See The Libertines LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like
You walk in like you've never seen the light
You walk in like it every night
But then I stop to think and I ask myself why
It's one of those things that, darling, you must try

It's all so rudimentary

And now I'm jealous, oh, I'm jealous of my own
I have no homestead but through these hearts I will roam, yeah

They all get them out for (They all get them out)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)


But tell me, baby, oh, how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel

And they all get them out for (They all get them out)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
Yes, they all want them out for (They all want them out)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (Only for the boys in the band)
