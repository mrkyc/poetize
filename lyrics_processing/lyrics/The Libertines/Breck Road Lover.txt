Right off the handle at the sound
Of scratching on the wall
Well, it could go either way
But I don't mind at all
'Cause I'll go, I'll go
And I'll go to Liverpool, oh, oh, oh
Well I know I'll be loved there
She's no scrubber
She's my Breck Road lover
And we wash in dirty waters
And walk the streets where
She gets her name
Oh, my lady
My lady clear your ears now
And open up your eyes
We're all out of sync now
And we no longer harmonize
And if lust and despair
Are two bullets in the same gun
Well we've been playing Russian roulette
For far too long

On the altar of the morning

Light my way, and I promise I'll believe

And she flies
Right off the handle
Always at the sound
Of scratchings on the wall
It could go either way
But I don't mind at all

Well, I'll go back to Liverpool, oh, oh, oh
