I have a Savior, a friend forever
The lover of my soul
Through every trial, He won't forsake me
I'll never be alone

All I'll ever need is Jesus
All I want to sing is His name
All my heart belongs to Jesus
And by His grace and mercy, I'm saved

There are no riches that could persuade me
Or steal away my soul
I have been ransomed, now and forever
My Savior, my reward

All I'll ever need is Jesus
All I want to sing is His name
All my heart belongs to Jesus
And by His grace and mercy, I'm saved

You're my future, You're my hope
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You
You're my future, You're my hope
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You
You're my future, You're my hope
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You

You know, this is why we do what we do
We want God to be glorified, through our worship
So that people who don't know Him would want to know Him
And, and you know, God made it pretty easy for us
He was willing to send His only begotten Son, His Son was willing to give His life
And because He died on the cross for our sins
All we have to do is believe and we can be saved
The Bible says in Romans 10 and 9 that
If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus
And believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead
That you will be saved.
It's just that easy
And I, I want to ask you to, accept Jesus into your heart
Because I know for sure that, that will be the best decision you have ever made
And the best one you will ever make
Jesus changes everything
He gives you life, He gives you hope
He gives you peace, He heals your body
But you know what the greatest miracle of all
Is that when we leave here
We get to be in His presence forever
It's eternal salvation, it never runs out
His love never ends, it never runs out
But you have to receive this gift
And so if you want it tonight repeat after me:
Dear heavenly Father
I come to You in the name of Your Son, Jesus
I believe that He died on the cross for my sins
And I believe on the third day, You raised Him from the grave
I confess, I'm a sinner, but I believe You're my Savior
Forgive me of my sins, I invite You into my heart
Be the Lord of my life, for the rest of my life
Fill me with Your Holy Spirit so I will be empowered
To live a life pleasing to You, in Jesus name I pray
Amen
If you said that prayer and you believe it
You know what, you're saved
You know what, He's your future, He's your hope
He's the anchor of your soul
Hallelujah, hallelujah

You're my future, You're my hope
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You
You're my future, You're my hope (Come on y'all)
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You
(You're my)
You're my future, You're my hope (Hope)
You're the anchor for my soul
And I was made for You

(All I)
All I'll ever need is Jesus (All I ever needed)
All I want to sing is His name
(All my heart)
All my heart belongs to Jesus
By His grace and mercy, I'm saved

All my heart belongs to Jesus
And by His grace and mercy, I'm saved
