When I was a child, I did childish things
My life was church and all it brings
I'd always hear the old folks sing
"He's never failed me yet!"
I heard this phrase and I trusted so
That one day, I would come to know
The truth in which these words do hold
He's never failed me yet

With years of life came test and trials
And nights when tears replaced the smile
Though God was right there all the while
My soul was not at rest
But I lived to tell that I made it through
So instead of singing 'bout the blues
I bring you news to encourage you
He's never failed me yet

When clouds and the valleys come
Set your eyes on the Risen Son
Pray the eyes of your heart be filled with light
And watch the blessed day break the night
You might also like
Like the three Hebrew boys that day
Oh forced to take their fate to flames
I, too, have had the choice to break
And serve the world instead
But I stood on the Word and did not bow
Endured the steps the Lord allowed
I came out stronger shouting "Wow
God's never failed me yet!"

God is not like men who lie
Nor like the son of men who die
His truth will always be alive
It never will be dead
So try Him for yourself and see
Those who believe, they shall receive
I pray the day you too can say
"He's never failed me yet"

Can you help me?
He's never failed me yet
He's never failed me yet
He's never failed me yet
I'm grateful for those simple words
That I so often overheard
Though many memories drift like birds
Some still I can't forget
They come back ringing right on time
Like bells so heavenly, they chime
That old-time phrase now mine-oh-mine
"He's never failed me yet"


He's never failed me yet


He's never failed me yet
