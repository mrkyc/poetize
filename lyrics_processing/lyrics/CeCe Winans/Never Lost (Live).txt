Miracles when You move
Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now (Du-du-du-du)
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out

And right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again

You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will, mm

Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now (Oh yeah)
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like it's Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down
You might also like
But right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again

You can do all things
(Come on and worship with me tonight, oh yeah yeah)
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will

You can do all things but fail (All things but fail)
'Cause You've never lost a battle (Oh, no, You've never lost)
No, You've never lost a battle
'Cause I know, I know
You never will

You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)

The bible says in John 1 and 5 that
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not understand it or overpower it
What does that mean?
God is so powerful
It doesn't matter what trial you find yourself in
It doesn't matter how big the mountain is, He's greater
And it's not even close, He's, He's, He's so much greater
And, and, and, and He has all power
He knows the end from the beginning, so you don't have to be afraid
Actually you can rejoice before you see your prayer answered
