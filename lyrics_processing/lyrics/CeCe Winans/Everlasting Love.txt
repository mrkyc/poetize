And if ever a hand is in need
Know that I'll be holdin' on
Know that the peace that comes from above
Is the same everlasting love
Remember me whenever you're all alone
And if it helps you to sleep know that I'll be looking on
Know that the peace that you dream of
Is the same everlasting love
You know I've watched you carry all this weight upon your shoulders
As if no one understands what you go through
But with all the might in you
Believe what I say is true
When I say that I will never ever leave you...
Or forsake you
So you just reach out as far as you can
Should the whole world just stare in disbelief
Know that I'll take hold of your hand
What your heart feels, is what you sing of
Is the same everlasting love
Everlasting love, Everlasting love

When the darkness filled the urgent sky
And the tears welled up in the corners of my eyes
And the sun would shine for the pourin' rain
Wondered if I'd ever see daylight again
When the stars protest at the moon's refrain
And I told myself I'd surely go insane
And the earth kept turnin' at an alarmin' pace
And I couldn't talk my heart out of joinin' the race
I remember a time I couldn't close my eyes
I would lie awake dispairin'
Don't know how many nights
Afraid of death that my chest would give way to the fear
Pulled the covers over my head and I cupped my ears
In attempt to escape the deafening sounds of silence
In attempt to escape these constant visions of violence
And with death as close as it could possibly get
Heard a voice in the distance sayin' CeCe not yet
Then suddenly the darkness gave away to the light
And I threw off the covers as I closed my eyes
Just in time to feel your spirit grip my body like a glove
And I knew in that moment that it was your...
That it was your everlasting, lasting love
I said it was your everlasting love
Yesterday, and today, forever more it will remain
Even now its still the same
Cause my love will never change
Know that the peace that comes from above
