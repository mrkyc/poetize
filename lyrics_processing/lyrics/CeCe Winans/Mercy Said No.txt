I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
And for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing
That what He'd have me be, is who I am
As I've come to see the weaker side of me
I realize His grace is what I'll need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said, "No, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away, you don't have to be afraid"
Mercy said, "No, sin will never take control"
Life and death stood face to face, darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank You, Jesus, mercy said, "No"
Ah, yeah

For God so loved the world, that He sent His Son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free
Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages
And makes a sacrifice so hard to see
As midnight fell upon the crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
As evil tried to stop redemption's flow

Mercy said, "No, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away, you don't have to be afraid"
Mercy said, "No, sin will never take control"
Life and death stood face to face, darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank You, Jesus, mercy said, "No"

And now when Heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago
Long ago

Mercy said, "No, I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away, you don't have to be afraid"
Mercy said, "No, sin will never take control"
Life and death stood face to face, darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank You, Jesus, mercy said, "No"

Oh, mercy
