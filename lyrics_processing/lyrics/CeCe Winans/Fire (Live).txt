Acts 2 and 1 says
When the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
Verse 4
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance
Just like He did it before
How many of you know we need Him to do it again
Just like You did it before
