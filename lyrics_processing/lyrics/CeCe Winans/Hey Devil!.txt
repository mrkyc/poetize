Hey devil, get behind me
Hey devil, under my feet
Hey devil, don't you touch me

Nah, nah, nah
Listen here mean devil
I admit I know I was wrong
But you've been messing this thing here up now for far too long
So in the name of Jesus
Go 'head and be gone

The Bible said and I believe it's true
I no longer have to listen to you
I'm pulling out, my spirit's free
And you gon' have to quit bothering me
On the count of three leave
One, two, three, go!

Hey devil, get behind me
Hey devil, under my feet
Hey devil, don't you touch me
Ooh yeah

Hey, CeCe!
What Twinkie?

I'm sick and tired of that devil
That's why we putting him outta here
Jackie, what about you, dear?
He is a liar and his momma is a liar if he had one
Come on, Dorinda

Jesus knew and I knew it too
You gotta do as I tell you to do
If I say out then out you go
This is all because of who I know
I-I got a right
The Bible tells me so

Hey devil, get behind me
Oh devil, get behind me
Hey devil, under my feet
You gonna get under my feet
Hey devil, don't you touch me
Ooh yeah
I'm not gonna take nothing from you
I'm here to tell you
I'm more than a conquerer (yes, you are)
Don't you touch me
You can't have me
Under my feet
Get behind me

Now, you got a few tricks, I must admit
But now I'm so much wiser
Too afraid for so long
I made you strong
But now I'm more than a conquerer
Your bark was so loud that you 
But now I stand on the way
So get out

Hey devil, get behind me
Hey devil, under my feet

I know you thought you had me but I guess you thought wrong
I'm not afraid of you if you can't tell by this song
The Spirit of the living God is making me strong
Get behind me
I know you thought you had me but I guess you thought wrong
I'm not afraid of you if you can't tell by this song
The Spirit of the living God is making me strong
Get behind me
You can't have me
Under my feet
Don't you touch me
Don't you touch me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
