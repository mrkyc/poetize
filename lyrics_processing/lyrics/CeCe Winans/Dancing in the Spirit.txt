Come on
Put those hands together
It's time to dance

I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it

When I think of the Lord has done
Look at where He has brought me from
I can hardly hold my peace
And I sure can't keep my seat
You better give me some room to run
Just as sure as the anointing comes
You might also like
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it

Oh, when I think of the Lord has done
Look at where He has brought me from
I can hardly hold my peace
And I sure can't keep my seat
You better give me some room to run
Just as sure as the anointing comes
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
You should praise Him
Praise Him till you feel it
I'll be
Dancing in the spirit
I'll be
Praise Him till you feel it
Keep on
Dancing in the spirit
Don't stop
Praise Him till you feel it

When I think of the goodness of Jesus
And all that He has done for me
My soul cries out, "Hallelujah"
Thank You for saving me
