Yeah, yo
I go by the name of Mario Winans
And this is the moment you all been waiting for
Yeah, I bring to you, my aunty Cece Winans
Yo Cece, drop that verse

I know that you think
You can't pray after that mistake
But I know it's the only way
You can make it better
And I know situations
Get too much for you to take
And you feel like you're gone break
And it makes you say

I can't take it
When will things get better?
I'm so frustrated
But it's gonna be okay 'cause
You've got someone in your corner
Who's gonna be there for ya
Just fall on your knees
Say a prayer and receive
You might also like
When the world feels like it's on your shoulders
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your life seems like its upside down
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your lonely nights are getting colder
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
I pray, you pray
(No matter how dark the day)
No matter how dark the day
(All you have to do, do is pray, pray)

I know you think you've gone too far
And you waited too late
(Oh yeah)
But I know that He loves you
And there's no love greater
(He loves you so much)
And I know that it's hurting
And you want your pain to end
And you feel like you can't win
And it makes you say

I can't take it
When will things get better?
I'm so frustrated
But it's gonna be okay 'cause
You've got someone in your corner
Who's gonna be there for ya
Just fall on your knees
Say a prayer and receive
When the world feels like it's on your shoulders
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your life seems like its upside down
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your lonely nights are getting colder
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
I pray, you pray
(No matter how dark the day)
No matter how dark the day
(All you have to do, do is pray, pray)

Our Father which art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
All you gotta do is say
Our Father which art in heaven
No matter how dark the day
(No matter)
All you have to do, do is pray, pray

When the world feels like it's on your shoulders
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your life seems like its upside down
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
When your lonely nights are getting colder
(I pray, you pray, we pray)
I pray, you pray
(No matter how dark the day)
No matter how dark the day
(All you have to do, do is pray, pray)
Our Father which art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
All you gotta do is say
Our Father which art in heaven
No matter how dark the day
(No matter)
All you have to do, do is pray, pray
I pray, you pray, we pray
