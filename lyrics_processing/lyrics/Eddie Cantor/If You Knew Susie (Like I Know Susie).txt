Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl
There's none so classy
As this fair lassie
Oh! Oh! Holy Moses, what a chassis
We went riding, she didn't balk
Back from Yonkers
I'm the one that had to walk
If you knew Susie, Like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! What a girl!
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl
She wears long tresses
And nice tight dresses
Oh! Oh!
What a future she possesses
Out in public
How she can yawn
In a parlour, you would think the war was on
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! What a girl
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
Let me put my arms around you
I could never live without you
You might also likeOh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
If you ever leave me
How my heart will ache
I want to hug you
But I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You beautiful doll
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
Let me put my arms around you
I could never live without you
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
If you ever leave me
How my heart will ache
I want to hug you
But I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You beautiful doll
Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awful nice to me
Ma, he's almost breaking my heart
I'm beside him
Mercy! Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me
Be my honey bee
Every minute he gets bolder
Now he's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, he's kissing me
Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awful nice to me
Ma, he's almost breaking my heart
If you peek in, can't you see
I'm goin' to weakin'
Ma, he wants to marry me
Be my honey bee
Ma I'm meeting with resistance
I shall holler for assistance
