Trying to remember all the feelings
But the only feeling was that something
Sweet had come and gone for everyone
There's factories in the fields where we used to run
There's a hard day coming for us daughters and sons
Wake up, some things had better change
Tear It All down and starting here and now
Let it all burn, so many souls in pain
Tear It All Down, too many hearts in doubt
We're never gonna learn
All of the treasures we own
God bless the house, the car and the T.V
They built us a prison without any locks
And meanwhile the men who claim God on their side
Spit out their message and sell me a ride
While we look for idols inside a fashion magazine
Things are gonna change
Tear It All down and starting here and now
Let it all burn, so many souls in pain
Tear It All Down, too many hearts in doubt
We're never gonna learn, there's a wall to keep us in
Tear It All Down, and walls to keep us out
Let it all burn, too many souls in pain
Tear It All Down, too many hearts in doubt
We're never gonna learn

We touch the burning cauldron to your angel face (angel face)
I look at my boy as he sleeps
An innocent facing the lions
I wish there was some way I could talk to my father again
There's a bomb in the schoolhouse
Wired to the face of the clock
In the face of disaster we stand like a rock
You can't want you're children to pay for your sins wake up
Some things are gonna change
Tear It All Down, some things are gonna fall
Tear It All Down, we can't go back again
Tear It All Down, with backs against the wall
Tear It All Down, There's a wall to keep us in
Tear It All Down, There's a wall to keep us out
Let it all burn, too many souls in pain
Tear It All Down, too many hearts in doubt
Tear It All Down, some things are gonna fall
Tear It All Down, we can't go back again
Tear It All Down, with backs against the wall
Tear It All Down, There's a wall to keep us in
Tear It All Down, There's a wall to keep us out
Let it all burn, too many souls in pain
