You know you're not the only one, I'm lonely too
I been surviving just day by day
I had some dreams but they all blew away
And then I saw your face across a crowded room
My heart missed a beat, oh, did you feel it too
To trust someone you just gotta be bold
The wall that you're building is crumbling, oh
Why don't we break it down
Why don't we break it down, pretty baby
It's gonna, it's gonna take
Take just one kiss, just one kiss
It's gonna, it's gonna take
Take just one kiss
To break it down
You look a little lonely, babe, a little blue
I said you're not the only one, I'm lonely too
I can't deny my heart anymore
You give me a feeling that I can't ignore
You try to play it safe, but you're not really shy
You try to look away, but I caught your eye
You can't hide, it's all over your face
The barrier between us is losing its place
