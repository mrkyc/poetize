"Me & Johnny"
By Rick Springfield
From Living in Oz
(c) 1983 RCA records

Lookin' back I'd say we broke a few rules
Left one or two hearts in ruin
Spent all that precious time doin'
Things we figured that Presley might have done
Stole a few cars, never got caught
Started some fights in the scrimmage
We got caught up in the image
Of playing young rebels by the handbook
Lookin' back I guess we had some attitude
We were gonna be hard and tough

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna shine

Look in the mirror, watch our faces change
We were gonna be McCartney clones
We skipped school to see the Rolling Stones
And sang their songs on the train on our way home
We were gonna be like all of them
Uncompromising to the very end
Live for girls, guitars and glory
And someday they'd write our story
Sometimes I think that they clapped in sympathy
But we were gonna be hard and tough

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place
In the sun

Johnny's still living back in Australia
I hear he's got himself a wife and kids
And I'm still chasing whatever it is
That put me out here on the road in the first place
I think of all the times I cursed out loud
Wishing I was still runnin' with the same old crowd
Sometimes it can make you cry
Just watching the years roll by
Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna shine

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place
In the sun

Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place
In the sun
Me and Johnny
We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Me and Johnny
We may get blood on our face
We're gonna have our place
