Well I was sure that I heard the Director yell
"Take it from the start"
And I could feel my body crushing yours
Camera dollied into place
Your husband's in the front row, I couldn't look him in the face
Part of the pleasure was that it felt so wrong
But it grew too fast, too strong
Don't you think your friends are talking Alyson?
They're blaming it all on me
I'm blaming it all on love
Well don't you think your friends are talking Alyson?
Just a little sexual tension
Under the guise of love
Young and tragic, I really felt the part
While we were sweating and screaming tearin' out his heart
Well I was sure I heard the wind and the wires
Crying in sympathy
For star-crossed lovers, Ally that ain't you or me
Part of the pleasure was that it felt so wrong
But it grew too fast, too strong

They're blaming it all on me
I'm blaming it all on love
Well don't you think your friends are talking Alyson?
Just a little sexual tension
Under the guise of love
For a limited run in to your local bedroom
We knew the curtain would be coming down soon
Reviews were mixed, the press was unkind
Ally I hope they will forgive us in time, in time
Part of the attraction was that we knew it couldn't last
So we closed our eyes and held on
Don't you thing your friends are talking Alyson?
Who were we trying to fool?
What was I thinking of?
Don't you think your friends are talking Alyson?
They're blaming it all on me
I'm blaming it all on love
Well don't you think your friends are talking Alyson?
Just a little sexual tension
