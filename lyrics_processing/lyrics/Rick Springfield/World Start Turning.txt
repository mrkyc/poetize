Yeah, a million miles from America
And whatever we wanted was just a matter of choosing
And I was raised in the Great White Way
Just like all those kids in America
And the T.V. taught us to win with no thought of losing (then I woke up)
This is the real world, the real town without pity
This is the real world, in the shadow of the city
This is the real wheel
You don't get too many spins
This is the real deal, not everybody wins
Just another soul lost in America
I was so frustrated and I got so lonely
It almost took a miracle to open my eyes
World Start Turning (turn into the wind)
World Start Turning (some things were never meant to be)
I've been standing on the beach
Crying to the raging sea
I was falling, falling
Heart start beating (turn into the wind)
Heart start beating (some things were never meant to be)
Made a promise to myself
I'll never get that low again

What he wants in America
It's only a matter of time, just a matter of seasons
But I walk through the houses of dreams that died
I see the ones still trapped there the ones that tried
But spent the rest of their lives wondering why
And searching for reasons (and they never wake up)
This is the real world, you've got to know just when to bend
Here in the world, precious little matters in the end
This is the real world, the real town without pity
This is the real world, in the shadow of the city
Just another soul lost in America
I was so frustrated and I got so lonely
It almost took a miracle to open up my eyes
World Start Turning (turn into the wind)
World Start Turning (some things were never meant to be)
I've been standing on the beach
Crying to the raging sea
I was falling, falling
Heart start beating (turn into the wind)
Heart start beating (some things were never meant to be)
Made a promise to myself
I'll never get that low again
You can't stop the world, can't' stop the world
Never could settle for where I was
Too many places I was trying to be
The times I succeeded and the times I failed
You know that no one will remember but me
World Start Turning, World Start Turning
I've been standing on the beach
Crying to the raging sea
I was falling, falling
Heart start beating (turn into the wind)
Heart start beating (some things were never meant to be)
Made a promise to myself
