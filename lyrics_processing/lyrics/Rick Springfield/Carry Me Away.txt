Baby, help me listen to my heart
And then take me to the top
I'm afraid of love, so afraid of love
And I'm scared to make it right
But I know tonight, that it's my last chance
My last shot at real love and I wanna take it
Last chance at the slow dance, in the big time
And I wanna make it tonight
You're gonna show what love is and why
Between the sweat and the lovin'
The whisper and the cry
I'm so tired of all this shit that I feel
Show me something real
Carry me away, baby, carry me away
I'm in love with you tonight, feels so right
Carry me away, baby, carry me away
I wanna be with you, what can I do
You've got the power, you've got the love
To take me to heaven or to lead me to heartbreak
I (I) spend my life waiting for the future and living in the past
Baby, show me love that I can hold on to
Give me something that'll last
I'm a total wreck but I'm up to my neck in this love I'm in
And I can't do a thing
It's a long shot, a far cry from a real world, me and you, baby
Last chance for the slow dance in the bright lights
And I think that maybe tonight it's gonna happen
Ain't no use in tryin'
Between the sweat and the lovin', the whisper and the cry
I'm so scared of all this feeling I feel
Show me something real
