I can't say that I like her face
Carved up on a silver platter
Served warm she's a real head case
I won't wait for an invitation
I can't stay for the sacrifice
I won't die as an unknown soldier
I won't even try
Sometimes you make me play the fool
Sometimes you use me like a tool
You are the the whip that drives the mule
But I brings the goods right back to you
You break my back
You break my balls
You break my heart
Just because
Sometimes you make me feel like
Just like the man that never was
Just like
Just like
Just like the man that never was
I drown in a mixed emotion
Washed up on a foreign shore
Face down in the salty ocean
Meet me there, I don't care
Anywhere is no where
I fly right and I know she loves me
I fly wrong and I'm DOA
I'm bombed out like an old cathedral
And I'm blown away

You break my heart

Just like the man that never was

You were never loved
We have so much more in common
