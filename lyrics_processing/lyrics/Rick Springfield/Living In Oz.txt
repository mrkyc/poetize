I remember having dreams of grandeur
I was gonna be someone, I know what I want
Everybody played second best
And I held you back just like all the rest
I think I got what I want
Everybody's got to fight their demons
And you know I had to fight mine, too
It took a lot out of me, it took a lot out of you
To be Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can shock you, too
All the money that I spend on you
Doesn't mean a thing if the love's not true
Baby please, I'll get what you want
Can't you tell me you and me ain't lost
I know what I did, I know what it cost
Now I'm yours and I've got what you want
All the fightin' will have been for nothin'
If at the end I can't have you
I'll throw it all away if that's what you want me to do

Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can shake you, too
Funny how desire can burn you up inside
And make you commit emotional suicide
Everybody's got the desire to leave their mark
Some just do it over a trail of broken hearts
And all the people that protect and serve
Would disappear if the well dried up
I'm thirsty for affection
Let me drink from your loving cup
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can shock you
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can rock you
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
Sometimes the dream can shake you
Living In Oz, Living In Oz
