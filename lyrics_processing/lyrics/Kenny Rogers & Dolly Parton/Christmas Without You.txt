Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

The fireplace keeps burning
And my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories
Of time spent with you

Old Christmas songs we knew (Old songs)
And used to make love to (We used to make love to)
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you
So sad, but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
You might also like
The sweetest gift I know (The sweetest gift)
Would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps
On this Christmas Eve

The most joyous Christmas (Merry Christmas)
If luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas
Brought you home to me

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you, I need you
So sad, but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you
So sad, but so true
Christmas without you
I just can't get used to (I can't get used to)
I just have no use (I have no use)
For Christmas without you
You know that I want you (You know that I need you)
You know that I need you (You know that I want you)
You know that I want you, I need you, I love you, oh, yes, I do
You know that I want you (You know that I need you)
You know that I need you (You know that I want you)
And I love you, I want you, I need you, I do
