But already I'm getting in over my head
It doesn't matter 'cause we've got something really hot
So get ready to give it everything that you've got
If it could always be like this
If it could always be like this
Feels like I never want to stop, never, never, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm all ready for this to be a habit with me
And when you're ready I'll show you how it's going to be
But don't you hurry, you just think it over and then
When you're ready we can do it over again
If it could always be like this
If it could always be like this
Feels like I never want to stop, never, never, oh yeah, oh yeah
If it could always be like this
If it could always be like this
Feels like I never want to stop, never, never
I was always one to stay all by my self standing on the shore
You come riding in on a wave and you showed me more
Yeah woo woo
