'Cause constantly you been on my mind
I was thinkin' about a short cut I could take
But it seems like I made a mistake
I was wrong, baby it took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
Fellas started to shower
You with love and affection
Now you won't look in my direction (on the)
Expressway to your heart
The expressway - not the best way
At five o'clock
It's much too crowded, (too crowded)
Much too crowded, (too crowded)
To got it (to got it), crowded, much too crowded
Much too crowded (much too crowded)
There's too many ahead of me
They're all trying to get in front of me
But I thought that I could find a clear road ahead
But I found stop lights instead
I was wrong, baby it took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
Fellas started to shower
You with love and affection
Now you won't look in my direction (on the)
