'Cause after my request had been fully analyzed
You indicated you might consent to tonight
What a standout
It's complicated
I tell you come out, you said that you would
And then you call 'cause you don't think you should
I'm thinking maybe you don't know what you've got
You just don't know....don't know that you
Standout
But you don't have a clue
What's so clear to me is a mystery to you
Standout
And when you do
There's no getting over you
So funny what our friends so often do
Though their reaction is really nothing new
They're talking to me but They're looking at you
What a standout
And still you tell me yeah
I guess I'll come out, well maybe I might
Or could we make it for another night
Ooh I'm thinking maybe you don't know what you've got
You just don't know
Don't know that you
