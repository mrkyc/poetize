That doesn't mean I'm in love
And I don't remember what it was I was dreaming of
I really bet she did something to me
I couldn't tell you a whole lot more than that
I don't have a clue, I wish I knew
She felt the same as me, with love and mystery
I can't put my finger on it, must have been something she said
I can't put my finger on it, what was it that she did
I can't explain it, but I know that there was something there
Something there
One conversation to pass the night away
That doesn't mean I'm in love
And I can't remember what it was we were speaking of
But even after the memories faded
That conversation is somewhere in my mind
I wish I knew, what did she do to have such a hold on me
And I love her mystery
I can't put my finger on it, must have been something she said
I can't put my finger on it, what was it that she did
I can't explain it, but I know that there was something there
Something there
You might also likeI must have noticed a glance or a word
Or a certain smile, or whisper that I heard
I find myself in a different world and I don't know why
But even after the memories faded
That conversation is somewhere in my mind
I wish I knew, what did she do to have such a hold on me
And I love her mystery
I can't put my finger on it, must have been something she said
I can't put my finger on it, what was it that she did
I can't explain it, but I know that there was something there
Something there
I can't put my finger on it, must have been something she said
I can't put my finger on it, what was it that she did
I can't explain it, but I know that there was something there
