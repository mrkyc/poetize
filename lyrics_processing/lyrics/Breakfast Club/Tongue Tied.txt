What I mean is that I
Every time I see you I'm tongue-tied
I try to tell you but I
What I mean is that I
When I see you
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
Hey I...I wanna walk up and say
You know I've been thinking of you
But afraid that you'd run away
You know I've been keeping my distance from you
Oh I know there must be a way
To talk about it to your face
But what'll I do if you walk away
And what'll I do if you laugh on my face
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
Hey I...I thought of calling you up
'Cause you know I've been lying awake
But I thought about it so long
You know there's no way you'd still be awake
So I lie back and face the fact
And think about how to adapt
'Cause if I can't find the words to say
I'm gonna get to you a different way

I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
Hey I...I spend a good part of my day
With my dictionary
Looking up words to say
Words that will tell you about it
And make it all so plain
Hey I...I'm not gonna worry about it
I'll take my time and decide what to say
But who knew that you were so near
And now I'm looking at your smiling face
Ooh I smile back...Oh I try anyway
But you don't have a thing to say
This is a different kind of game that We're playing
There is nothing that your smile doesn't say
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
I get so tongue-tied whenever you are here
You've got me tongue-tied when you're near
