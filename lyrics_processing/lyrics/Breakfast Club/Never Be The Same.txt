That when you left you told me life would never be the same
Well I was worried
I looked around so I could see if anything had changed
I walked around a bit
And then I noticed that it, it felt different to me, everything
It made me wonder
'Cause everything was still arranged the way it used to be
The only trouble is
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same as I was
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same
Do you remember
As you were leaving that you smiled as you walked out the door
Well I remember
'Cause I was thinking it would never be the way it was before yeah
I've been around a bit
And I'll get over it but everything that I see, everything
It makes me wonder
If it ever was the way it used to be
The only trouble is
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same as I was
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same as I was

Everything may be the same as it was
I will never be
I will never be the same as I was
I had to laugh at myself as I was
Looking for someone else
Somebody to explain
How to get back again to it
I've been around a bit
And I'll get over it but everything that I see, everything
It makes me wonder
If it ever was the way it used to be
The only trouble is
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same as I was
Everything may be the same as it was
But I will never be the same as I was
Everything may be
Everything may be the same as it was
I will never be
I will never be the same as I was
Everything may be
Everything may be the same as it was
I will never be
