Pants low, afro, no shirt, blowin' purp, I'm not a star, just a regular old hood nigga
VIP full of hoes, full of golds, we got guns in this motherfucker now, bitch that's how we coming

Murder weapons, .357s, Glock 9s, I ain't lyin', bitch, that choppa hold a whole motherfuckin' hundred

When they show up, it's gon' blow up, I'ma rip big holes in they stomach
I been runnin' the streets for years, so you know I ain't runnin'
Send some drama to your street, I'm Obama in these streets
Put that llama on you geeks, you remind me of sweets
Go ask my teachers, I'm a bully, you just another police
She'll suck it, I love it, she lick it all of me
Grind up off and chill nigga bring ya back outchea
Goddamn, even though you tired, these busters ain't satisfied 'til they asses get sanitized
Then they bring it on they self
Then they ass wan' cry
When the barrel of that pistol, look 'em right in they eyes
Get my California buzz on, chillin' with my cuzzo
Coward ass niggas gon' make me go put my gloves on
I don't give a fuck, I never did, I never will
And that's how I fuckin' feel
Young Savage, forever Trill
