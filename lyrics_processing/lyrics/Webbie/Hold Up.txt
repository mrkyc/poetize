Now I grew up around triggers, but it wasn't the triggers
It was niggas huggin' the triggers that was bustin' the heads
And I grew up around chickens, but it wasn't the chickens
It was niggas flippin' the chickens that was duckin' the feds
And I show up with a chopper, and it won't be the chopper
It'll be me bustin' the chopper that have them runnin' & scared
And I send ya to the doctor, and the doctor can try
But don't blame the doctor cause your bitch ass dead I ain't never scared mane
I been out chea I'mma be out chea you come out chea and you see me out chea
Hooked up with Bun B out chea, now we tryin' to get Pimp C out chea
Webbie mane ya know whatsup Young Savage don't give a fuck
23's on every truck cause me and my niggas blowed up
Grew up around licks, but it wasn't the licks
It was niggas hittin' the licks that was makin' the bread
I grew up around bitches, but it wasn't the bitches
It was niggas pimpin' the bitches that was gettin' ahead
