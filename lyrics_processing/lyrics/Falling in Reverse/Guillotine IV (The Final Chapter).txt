My heart is on fire again
From the depths of Hell, and it swallows me in
Well, the demons are all in my head
And they're pulling me in, pulling me in
Here I go
Sinking below, sinking below
All I know
Is fading away, fading away from me now

This can't be happening
I've watched my whole world fall apart

So long, farewell to the best of me, it's so far away
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy, and it's so hard to say
There's no way out, and you are way too late
Say goodbye to the rest of me, the best of me

Bound by the demons, they doubt me, doubt me
My whole world around me is drowning, drowning
And the demons I hate
Are the monsters I always create
My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell, and it swallows me in
The demons are all in my head
And they're pulling me in, pulling me in
You might also like
This can't be happening
I've watched my whole world fall apart

So long, farewell to the best of me, it's so far away
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy, and it's so hard to say
There's no way out, and you are way too late
Say goodbye to the rest of me, the best of me


Melt!

So long, farewell to the best of me, it's so far away
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy, and it's so hard to say
There's no way out, and you are way too late
Say goodbye to the rest of me, say goodbye to me
So long, farewell to the best of me, it's so far away
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy, and it's so hard to say
There's no way out, and you are way too late
