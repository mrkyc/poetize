I'm alive again
More alive than I have ever been
And now I'm climbing, climbing to the top to win
And nothing's gonna stop, stop me in the end; victorious

And every day that I awake
I say a prayer and I give thanks
That I'm alive and I am glad
That I've been given one more chance
My eyes are open, now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds, I've cleared my head
Now I am clean, back from the dead

Whoa, I rise above it all, and I'm not coming down
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down, I will stand my ground
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me now

Look how far I've come, the wars that I have won
I think out loud, victorious and proud
The years behind, the tears I try to hide
This pain won't last, time to remove this mask

My eyes are open now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds, I've cleared my head
Now I am clean, back from the dead

Whoa, I rise above it all, and I'm not coming down
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down, I will stand my ground
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me now

Wait, stop, stop, hold on, hold on, hold on

I got this new head on my shoulders, and I'm looking for justice
So gladly seeking out bitches that decided to talk shit
You want conflict? Well, I got it and I ain't gonna stop
Until I drop or take that motherfucking place on top
Ain't given it back when I take that place, as a matter of fact, let's cut to the chase
Gonna take that spot on top of the list quick, call it statutory rape
You want some beef? Better bring a fork 'cause I'm never gonna pass the torch
Gonna keep going with the flows exposing you hoes to show you I'm more important
A little bit of dirt mixed with the mud, a little bit of rock mixed with a thug
Got a good heart inside my chest and a little bit of gangster in my blood
Been to jail, I've been to prison, went to hell and had a vision
Was presented with decision to change how I was living
Gotta give it up, gotta give it back, I've had enough, gotta get intact
As a matter of fact, gotta get these kats in check and stack these fucking racks
Gotta get that cheese, gotta get that bread, gotta get that dough, gotta get ahead
Gotta cut no slack to these motherfucking punks that held me down, back from the dead, go
Yeah

Whoa, I rise above it all, and I'm not coming down
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me
Whoa, I rise above it all, and I'm not coming down
Whoa, because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down, I will stand my ground
