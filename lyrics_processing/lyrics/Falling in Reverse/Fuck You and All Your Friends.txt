This will be the last song I ever sang
About a person that I'd rather not name
You think you're so goddamn cool
Everybody thinks you're a fucking fool
Crash and burn on a car ride home
It would be a lot better if I slit your throat

And die for me, die for me
Why don't you?
I will sing this song
And know they're better off without you

I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking
And you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing
And it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever

I taught you all about breaking hearts
I didn't know that you would take it that far
I never thought after all these years
I would be the one that made you disappear
You might also like
And die for me, die for me
Why don't you?
I will sing this song (Sing this song)
And know they're better off without you

I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking
And you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing
And it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever

(Last forever, last forever, I guess best friends don't last forever)
(Last forever, last forever, last forever, lost forever)
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(Done with you for good, you're so Hollywood)
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la) Fuck you and all your friends
I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking
And you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing
And it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever
Done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking
And you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing
And it's for the better
