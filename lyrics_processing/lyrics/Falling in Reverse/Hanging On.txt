Last night I dreamed of you again
You swim your way up through my veins
Into my soul until you've reached my brain
You are the greatest part of me
So if dreaming's the only time you're near
Then waking up will be my nightmare

At that very moment, I jumped out of my bed
Trying to remember all the things you said
"Ronnie, I adore you, but nothing really lasts forever"

You gotta let me know
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
And complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging on

I am a lesson you will learn
(Lesson you will learn)
I'd take away your pain and hurt
But I'm not strong enough to be your cure
I am the battle you will lose
You think that you are saving me
But I'm the one that's saving you so
You might also like
And at that very moment you appeared in my bed
Looked you in your eyes, and then I finally said
"Baby, I adore you, but this ain't gonna last forever"

You gotta let me know
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
And complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging on

This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
And complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me hanging on

This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
This is all I have to offer
(Setting ourselves up to fall apart)
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Don't leave me hanging on
