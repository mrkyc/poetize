I was lost, now I'm found, I'm sustained by the sound
Of the angels singing me to sleep while my feet are leaving the ground
Am I dead? Or am I dreaming instead?
A cornucopia of opiates have flooded my head
I'm insane, I am smart, all it takes is a spark
To ignite my bad intentions and do what I do best to your heart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full, so you know I won't play by the rules

I will never spill
Spill my blood for you
You have let me down
One too many times

Someway, somehow, we've fallen out
Caught in between my enemies
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

Due to mistakes I have made to the state
I am trapped inside a dillinger, diligently thinking of ways
To get out of this god awful place, I have learned that my fate
Is something I can't escape, so
Sound the alarm, what I've said from the start
Is I'll never let your system break me down or tear me apart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full, so you know I won't play by the rules
You might also like
I will never spill
Spill my blood for you
You have let me down
One too many times

Someway, somehow we've fallen out
Caught in between my enemies
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

This is the end of you
This is where I draw the line
And I won't lose
This war is mine
Oh

Spill my blood for you
One too many times

Someway, somehow we've fallen out
Caught in between my enemies
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me
One day they'll see, it was always me
