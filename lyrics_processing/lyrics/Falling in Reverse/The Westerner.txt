I was born one morning in December on the coldest day
Abandoned by my mother, whom my father I was raised
My father raised my brother and I with a stubborn heart
My mother left me her good looks and confident charm
Well, I spent most of my teenage years searching for her love
I could not find it anywhere, so I turned to drugs
And after all the smoke had cleared and it was said and done
I found myself addicted by the age of twenty one, I tell the truth

I've been beaten, I've been bruised, I was left for dead as well
I was wrongfully accused, you left me locked inside a cell
I've been cheated, I've been sued, but I have lived to tell
The more you kick me when I'm down, the more it truly helps
I feel the madness creeping slowly
Loved by many, I'm still lonely
Pay the price for your mistake
The music died the day I walked away

No, I won't let you win, not this time, my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride, I'll keep my head held high
'Cause I know that I'm better in the end
You might also like
Whoa, I know you're jealous and you wish you could be me
I'm so smart and clever with my lyrics, can't you see?
There's nobody better in this music industry
And in case you think you are, go ahead, give me a ring
Whoa, I deserve a purple heart from all my fucking wounds
Lacerations to my ego, pride that I've consumed
And in your final hours, when you are looking back
You'll find that I'm the best at what I do, and that's a fact

No, I won't let you win, not this time, my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride, I'll keep my head held high
'Cause I know that I'm better in the end

And all I got to say
(Do-do-do-doo doo doo do-doo)
(Ba-ba-ba-bada)
(Do-do-do-doo doo doo do-doo)
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Take it or leave it, but you best believe me it's true
(Ba-ba-ba-bada)
There's no mistaking, so, please, stop thinking I'm through
You know I'm better than you!

No, I won't let you win, not this time, my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride, I'll keep my head held high
'Cause I know that I'm better in the end
In the end!

(Do-do-do-doo doo doo do-doo)
(Ba-ba-ba-bada)
(Do-do-do-doo doo doo do-doo)
