From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the Devil
After all the dust had settled
There's an hourglass of time
Counting down all of the lies
And with every grain of sand
Time is slipping through my hands

Oh, I sold my soul to rock and roll
And I let my demons take control
Redemption seems so far away
This microphone is my escape
Don't mess with ouija boards
'Cause now my spirit's torn

I'm bound by fear of being trapped
I'm falling faster, fade to black
Something's standing in my way
Hoping for better days!

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality, oh
You might also like
I spill my heart out on the stage
The only way I feel okay
And right before that curtain calls
I just got one more thing to say
Don't mess with ouija boards
'Cause now my spirit's torn

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality, oh

From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the Devil
After all the dust had settled

Look into my eyes
You will see the light
It burns so bright
This flame will never die
I speak the truth
Immortalized my youth
No other way
Until my final day
Oh, I feel the hate
Welling up inside
And it's too late
Nowhere to run and hide
Don't mess with ouija boards
Don't mess with ouija boards
I'm bound by fear of being trapped
I'm falling faster, better days

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality, oh
I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality, oh

Don't mess with ouija boards
Don't mess with ouija boards
Don't mess with ouija boards
