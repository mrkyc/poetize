Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed
Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me

And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters

I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up

Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie)
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope


God bless all of you now
'Cause I'm going straight to Hell
And I'm taking you down with me
'Cause you know damn well

(I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones)
(Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?)

I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope
