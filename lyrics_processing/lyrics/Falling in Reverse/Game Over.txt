My life is like a video game, trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Trying hard to save the girl, obstacles, I'm jumping hurdles
I'm growing up to be a big boy
I battle with the evil ways, I travel far and try and save
Sorry, but your princess isn't here
I take a rest, I push the pause, level up and move along
In hopes that the next stage I will clear (I fucking passed, asshole)

I'm just trying to keep from dying

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it

Today I went to therapy, told him my embarrassing
Issues that I'm having with my life
He told me that I need to change, life is not a video game
So stop playing and open up your eyes

I'm just trying to keep from dying

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it

Don't talk about it, just be about it
Don't ever doubt it, even when your brain is clouded
I may be crazy, but life's amazing
And through it all and even with your problems facing
So just know that it's okay

My life is like a video game, trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it
It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
