It's nine o'clock on the dot at the spot, and I'm hanging with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place, and you're fashionably late
And I don't wanna be that guy that makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about making out with your friends, go

I love the way that this began, started off right, so innocent
I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go, I want your best friend
I'm giving it up and asking why you seemed so shocked and so surprised
I'm sorry it hurts, I'm surely a jerk, I understand why you're mad

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody knows I'm wrong (Wrong)

It's got nothing to do with how you look, just another excuse to write a hook
I'm letting you know, she liked my post up on my Facebook
And after all, you're not my type, but all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean, stop making a scene and take some words of advice

And I've got the topic conversation now
And I know I'm running out of time
It's not an honest demonstration now
You're not the only one, not the only one

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don't act like that

Everybody, sing along, ah

Without a doubt; sorry about fucking all your friends (What?)
