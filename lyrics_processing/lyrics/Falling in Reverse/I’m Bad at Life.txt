Hey girl, I'm in love with you
But the world doesn't want me to
I'm not well, I am sick
The best kind of sick that one can get
So you can't believe a word they say
About the person I am today
If all else fails, just think instead
At least you know I'm good in bed
So trace the lines of my tattoos
Whisper that you love me too
We might as well, no matter what
They think I suck, but I don't give a f-

So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life, I'm bad at life

Hey, girl, let's get out of here
View the world in the rearview mirror
Just me and you with nothing to lose
Electric love and something to prove
So, please, take care of my hurt heart
'Cause trusting you is the hardest part
You might as well, no matter what
They think I suck, but I don't give a fuck
You might also like
So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

All your friends tell you I'm wrong, ha-ha
But all your friends sing this song
All your friends tell you I'm wrong
But all your friends sing this song, song
And I don't give a fuck

So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I told you a million fucking times
I'll give you bad advice because
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life
