I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I've got nothing to prove
But honestly, I'm just like you

I've got a bad case of ADD (Uh-huh)
I've been this way since seventeen
I got a fucked up brain and a really bad attitude
And I blame it on my drug abuse

So you don't wanna be too close to me
'Cause you might see my broken heart

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you
Just like you

I've been so lonely for the longest time (Uh-huh)
They tell me that I'm such a lovable guy (Yeah right)
Could it be because I'm off my meds?
Or could it just be something I said?

I really don't care about all of that though

And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you

And I'm always stuck with some bad luck
I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
And I hope, in fact, she breaks her back
The moment I step on this crack
And don't tell me I'm not worth it
'Cause you are far from perfect
I am aware that you are all assholes
Who the hell cares about all of that though?

I am aware that I am an asshole

I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you
