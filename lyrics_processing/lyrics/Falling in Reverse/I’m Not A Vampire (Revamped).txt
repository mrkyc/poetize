Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one
Sometimes, I sleep all day 'cause I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always achin'
And the dark is when I feed
Well, I can lure any woman that I want to
In my bed with me

And whiskey seems to be my holy water
And mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters

'Cause I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinnin' from this dizzy, blurry vision
And my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby
'Cause I'm always throwin' up
You might also like
And hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict
And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire)
I just want the world to bleed (He's not a vampire)
Lust at the sight of your blood (He's not a vampire)
I swear to God, I am not a (He is not a)
(He is not a)

So God bless all of you now
'Cause I'm goin' straight to Hell (Straight to Hell)
And I'm takin' you down with me
Because you know damn well

So I sharpen my teeth, 'cause I love the way it feels
When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real
You don't believe me, should I write it in blood?
You better drive that fuckin' stake right through my heart and try to run
Motherfucker, I'm a vampire
And I'm insane, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all
Heart has fucking lost all
Heart has lost all hope

(He's lost all hope)
(He's lost all hope)
Lonely (He's lost all hope)
