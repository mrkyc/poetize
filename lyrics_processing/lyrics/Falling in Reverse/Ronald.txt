Once upon a time, everything was alright
I used to feel safe, not a worry in sight
Then I grew up, quickly realized
The world is a fucked up place sometimes
Death is at your door
Reaching in from the other side
It's time to cut the cord
Hangin' on like a parasite, go (Ah)
Hangin' on like a parasite
Hangin' on like a parasite

Don't hesitate, you're hangin' on for your life
Don't hesitate, you're reachin' out from the light
Walking on a razor's edge
My blood runs black, I'm not your friend
Fuck

Pull from the depths of the 36 Chambers, ah
Ah, pull the trigger, give a bullet to a stranger, nice
Ah, pull from the depths of the 36 Chambers (Hahahahaha)
Pull the trigger, give a bullet to a stranger

I don't wanna die (Die), but I'm not gonna live
In a place so cold, in a world like this (This)
Crucify me (Me), it's blasphemy (-my)
Throw me in the fire, let me burn for eternity, go (Go, go, go)
Burn for eternity (-y, -y, -y), eternity
I'll never be the one that will ever back down
Never turn around and run
Never, never, never back down
You might also like
Deep into the trench of a place unknown
Lies a dead man clutched to the bottom of a throne
At the bottom of a hole that nobody wants to go
It's the devil that you know that's gotta hold up on your wicked soul (Damn)
What is up in your mind?
Are you thinkin' the devil is makin' the crime?
Or the people are evil and never no demon design?
Or the opposite of a divine? No
Yes, the hell is in front of you, side and behind
I can feel every sign of a human decline
I'm believing the time is upon us when all of our people are blind (Yo)
Red rain, saw it fallin' from a tower's dead plane
Head banged Mandalay Bay hotel, lotta lead came
Sex change could get you caught up in death range
He pled sane but really imitating Ed Gein
How do we get this way? Negative shit to say when you get dismay
Havin' a fit today so you wanna make a bitch decay
My son's mom went gone, it was really wrong
I thought I was gonna vomit searching for my son, but I didn't go John Muhammad
So the devil's right here on this level, wipe tears
'Cause when rebels ready to pop the heavy metal, why fear? (Yeah)
Abomination, they been fakin', consecration hatin', western education
Got that killer on a kid, I gotta chase 'em, go
Go
Spiraling out of control and deeper down the rabbit hole
Ayy
Never gonna let them get the most of what they'll have to resurrect
You're sick to death, better take me down
I don't give a fuck, this disgrace to God (No)
Yeah (Ah)
Never gonna let them get the most of what they'll have to resurrect
