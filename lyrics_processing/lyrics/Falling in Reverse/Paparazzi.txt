S-E-L-L M-Y S-O-U-L

Yo, here's another song for the kids to sing to
With the same four chords, just another hit single
And your radio station plays the same three tracks
That's nine total minutes we could never get back

So get up, get up, come on, come on
We don't wanna hear the same old song
So delete your playlist, it ain't the greatest
Let's start something contagious
I guess we're desperate for a radio hit

Paparazzi, please, snapshot me
'Cause I'm just a bad boy meant for the tabloids
I need my big break before it's too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless, just wanna be famous

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Now we're steady making process, and it's hard to stop it
We got our T-shirts in the mall's Hot Topic
Warped Tour famous, and the fans devotion
Walking to our signings like we're in slow motion

So get up, get up, come on, come one
We finally got what we fucking want
So delete your playlist, it ain't the greatest
Let's start something contagious
I guess we're desperate for a radio hit

Paparazzi, please, snapshot me
'Cause I'm just a bad boy meant for the tabloids
I need my big break before it's too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless, just wanna be famous

The future sucks as we know, we watch reality shows
We never leave our homes, we're glued to our phones
The future's making me sick, we post the same damn pics
What the fuck's a selfie stick? We're always talking shit
Hahaha, fuck you
S-E-L-L M-Y S-O-U-L
S-E-L-L M-Y S-O-U-L
I'm shameless for you, I want to be famous
I'm shameless for you, I want to be famous
One, two, one, two, three, four

(I want to be famous)
Paparazzi, please, snapshot me
(I'm shameless for you)
'Cause I'm just a bad boy meant for the tabloids
I need my big break before it's too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless, just wanna be famous
(I'm shameless for you)
Just wanna be famous, yeah
(I want to be)
