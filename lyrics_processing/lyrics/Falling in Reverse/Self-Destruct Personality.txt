There is a price that we all must pay
I'm really sorry for the mess that I have made
So can you tell me what will you do
When everything you've known turns right around on you?

I've been through a hell of a lot
You let them nail me to your cross
No matter who, what, where or when
I've always went down for all your sins

My daddy told me not to bite my tongue
I hate my momma 'cause she left me with no love
Bottle it up and sweep it under the rug, hate my mother
If all the good things gotta come to an end
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins
I'm obviously pessimistic, cynical, hypocritic mess, yeah

Self-destruct personality
Won't discuss my responsibilities
I am always walking on the final verge
I'm killing myself, but I am not a murderer

If all the good things gotta come to an end
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins
I'm obviously pessimistic, cynical, a hypocritic mess

Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life when everything around me has failed
Who knows what the future brings, but eventually the truth will prevail
In moments like these when you really gotta think about the broken dreams that you sell
Tick tock in your head, it goes; where it stops, who knows; like a carousel
Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life when everything around me has failed
Who knows what the future brings, but eventually the truth will prevail

I'm obviously pessimistic, cynical, a hypocritic mess, oh go
