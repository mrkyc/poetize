Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
So come on!

Yo, white boy on the beat, rockin' Gucci sneaks
A-a-a-all I do is win, Ch-Ch-Ch-Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene (Uh)
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me
Ca-came from the lowest of lows, rose to the top with a vision
My haters talkin' shit while washin' dishes for a livin'
Fuck you bitches, I'm a business, I'll be kissin' on your misses
What you spend in fifteen months is what I spend in fifteen minutes

Oh, don't give a fuck about you!
You're feelin' froggy, motherfucker?
Ain't a damn thing you can do!
You're a bitch, you're a punk!
Don't make me pull the pump!
Cock it back and leave you slumped
Now that's what I call bad luck!

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I got a lotta people talkin' nothin' but chatter
"Wh-wh-why'd you switch your style up?"
And that I don't matter
Man, I've been in rap since I was shittin' in Pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top, and now I'm shittin' on rappers
A-a-a-all I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossin' the line
I-I-I find it kinda funny, the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face-to-face, you ain't got nothin' to say to me

Oh, so fuck you too!
You better take a step back before I call up the crew!
You talk a lotta shit, but you spread nothin' but lies!
You keep on runnin' your mouth, you better open your eyes!

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switchin' my lanes like I'm racin' a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfuckin' neck
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switchin' my lanes like I'm racin' a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world
So break your motherfuckin' neck!
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
