So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy, and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

You've got pep in your step, you live your life with no regret
How you look when you are wet is something I cannot forget
I just wanna kiss your lips, the ones between your hips
If I cashed in all my chips on you, then, baby, I'd be rich

So come on
Sexy, please, text me, I'm ready for you
So come on
Waiting, I'm begging, so, please, get here soon

So, please, just take it in the ass and suck my dick
