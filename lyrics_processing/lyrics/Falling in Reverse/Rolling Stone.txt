Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through

I got that shit that you can bump in your car
Steady lurking on my enemies to settle the score
I am never backing down until the day that I die
And I don't give a fuck about no hater on my life
I am the best at what I do, and I will always prevail
And overcome all obstacles while walking through hell
And if you got a problem, now's the time to speak up
'Cause I'm blowing up, I'm never gonna stop

Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone

I spit the fire, and I'm killing the track
Ambitious from how many knives are stabbed in my back
And if you think you know me, then you're probably wrong
I spill my heart and soul, so lock and load and keep bringing it on
I got an anger that runs deep in my blood
And I'm always staying true, repping the city I'm from
And if you got a problem, now's the time to speak up
'Cause I'm blowing up, I'm never gonna stop

Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone

Don't get it twisted, ballistic, characteristic when I rip shit
Intricate visions of infinite, wisdom, empirical, spiritual, lyrical, very cool synonyms
In layman's terms, I am the best you must agree
I got that white boy swagger, rapping right down to a T
I got my hand upon the throttle, holding up a broken bottle
Ready to cut you up and gut you like a fucking avocado
Desperado on the track, in fact, if I am gone tomorrow
Then my motto is no sorrow, no apologies, just karma
Don't get it twisted and delete me off your friends list
Staying busy, tweeting hatred at me, all up in my business
I'm getting kicks outta this shit like it was my sneakers
And the game fears me like a motherfucking wife-beater, oh


Just let me go, on my own again
A rolling stone, I'm in the zone, yeah
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
