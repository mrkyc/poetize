Why do I feel so claustrophobic?
My heart jumping like I done did aerobics
Three days past and I barely notice
Ice Ice Baby just can't control it
Hold it I don't think I've eaten either
Alcohol is gonna kill my liver
I'm scared to death how did I meth
Up my life and short of breath
Bad checks they bounce drain my account
Listen to the voice in my head announce
"Man quit this shit" Feeling down and out
Tired but I'm wired got fired about
A week ago punched the boss in the mouth
But I wasn't wrong I just wanna belong
And I gotta a pain in one of my lungs
Man what have done? Still up at the dawn

I've meth'd up royally
I'm the King of Tweakers and I'm sinking deeper
Ive meth'd up everything
I'm the King of Tweakers such an evil creature

Monkey on my back done become King Kong
Stopped at the pawn shop my ring's gone
Such a disappointment to mom and dad
My Skin itches crabs grabbing at my nads
I done become what I'd be laughing at back
When I was sober with a stack of cash
Take off the edge with bag of grass
Walk by the mirror look at the jackass
What did I miss sick of this abyss
Diagnosis terminal emptiness
Gritting my teeth and clinch my fists
Hard to love anything when you stay pissed
At yourself and your health deteriorates
Cause your face stays down on mirrors and plates
If I let a tear drop I get hysterical
I'm praying begging for a miracle

I really don't like this anymore
Why did it have to happen to Danny for?
I did it to myself I can't ignore
I'm beating myself up like a dirty whore
Help me I can't take it anymore
Thank God... I hocked my 44
Lordy Lordy my nervousness is vicious
Is this a sign? Is that was this is?
