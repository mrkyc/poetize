I woke up early this morning
Went downtown and I got a cup of coffee
Drink it on up then I got a little jumpy
Then I had a thought that I can't remember
Walked around town looking down at my shadow
Pick up a nickel older than I
Gave it to a man who needed a shot of liquor
I could tell by the look in his eye
Walking around the bus station I saw a young girl
Couldn't have been older than 13
Smoking a cigarette pregnant and barefoot
I said "Hello" she said "The world is mean"

So I kept on walking
Taking in the scenery
Observing everything
And what it means to me
Could it be as simple
As me just being me
Looking for sweet
Conformation
So I kept on walking

To the hardware store
Asked the manager for an application
And on the way out I threw it in the trash cuz
Something in my head said just be patient
I saw a bunch of birds on top of the court house
Sitting on the edge all in a row
If I didn't know better I'd swear they were watching me
I think I heard a bird tell another there he goes
Then saw a mannequin in the window
The prettiest woman that I've ever seen
Wearing a green dress and beautiful string of pearls
She wasn't interested in me

Conformation
So I kept on walking

To a seat on a bench on the corner
Took a little rest beneath the shady tree
'Long came an old lady with a walking cane
And she sat down next to me. She said
Hey there dreamer how are you doing?
Said the doc told her she's 'bout to die
And yet she comes here everyday about this time
Just to watch the world pass by
Gave me a nickel and said this is a fortune
Lit a cigarette and said the world is mean
Just be patient the birds on the courthouse
Serve a purpose like you and me
Then I got up and said thank you kindly
The the sun broke through the trees
And as I turn to walk away she said hey
......
Don't worry 'bout the mannequin she can't see
So I kept on walking
Taking in the scenery
Observing everything
And what it means to me
Could it be as simple
As me just being me
Looking for sweet
Conformation
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
So I kept on walking
