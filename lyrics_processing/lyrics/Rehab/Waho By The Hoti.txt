Take 75 North get off on Northside Drive
Take a left cross the bridge on the left side
We would watch the sun come up after a long night
Everything you need to make you feel like wrongs right
Blazing raising cain at the Days Inn
Room 221 getting it done
Going out our minds for a good time
We were high like HI living life on the run
Spending my money like nothing else mattered
When the folks rode by everybody scattered
It was dirty it was seedy
It was grimey it was gritty
They were stripping they were strapping
They were tripping they were trapping

There's a Waho by the Hoti where they slang that bolo
And if you drive through you don't wanna go solo
Mouse Trap or chicken melt plate and a good buzz
Good times baby a day cuz that's just what it was
Cuz that's just what it was oh that just what it was
That's just what it was

The sink and the bath tube both full of beers
There were empty cigarette packs everywhere
People coming people going everybody's celly ringing
Ain't nobody sleeping till you hear the birds singing
Taking everything that you can think of to the head
Just letting off steam some were popping off lead
And the honeys made their money with the oldest known profession
Unless you were holding cuz they all on a mission
We were ready to fight at the drop of a dime
Didn't never check the clock wasn't worried about the time
It was dirty it was seedy it was grimey it was gritty
They were stripping they were strapping
They were tripping they were trapping

And if you drive through you don't wanna go solo
Mouse Trap or chicken melt plate and a good buzz
Good times baby a day cuz that's just what it was
Cuz that's just what it was oh that just what it was
That's just what it was

Yeah we were living for the moment
If they had it we was on it
Getting drunk and staying crunk until the morning
Talking junk and looking homeless
It was just the place your mama told you not to go
The kind of spot you're locked and loaded if your smart
But if you're not you're like I was when I was there
Stupid but the rooms were cheap
Food is inexpensive getting geeked until we went to sleep
Better hope you get a bed cuz those were sure some dirty floors
Had to look through the peep hole when people knocked for sure

There's a Waho by the Hoti where they slang that bolo
And if you drive through you don't wanna go solo
Mouse Trap or chicken melt plate and a good buzz
Good times baby a day cuz that's just what it was
Cuz that's just what it was oh that just what it was
That's just what it was
There's a Waho by the Hoti where they slang that bolo
