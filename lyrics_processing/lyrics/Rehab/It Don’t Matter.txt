Sittin' in traffic, another day of feelin' nothin'
Tryin' to find somethin', I guess it's back to huffin'
Paint and model glue, oh how I die when I look
At you smilin' lovin' life and all I know is blue
Rainy days and cold stares, broken love affairs
Everything's beautiful, as long as I ain't there
I guess I wasn't meant to crack a smile, who cares
I think I'll go to sleep for a while now

I'm barely livin' in my skin
Depression's my only friend
And I don't know where I am headed
Tryin' to forget where I've been
And I'm so sick of lyin'
God, please show me that silver linin'
'Cause I've heard a tale and I'm not well
My head's full of hell and this world's a jail, but

And it don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear
And it don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear
See Rehab LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like
And as the pain begins to displace, had it to ear level with this place
You see it on my face, a state of suspended grace
Gradually I erase and find comfort in the sickest womb
I might be present but not in the room
To whom it may consume, melting ensembles, bleeding cellos
Running through Bordellos drama like Othello
Hidin' out from Poncharello, dead off in the Median
Fallin' apart like usual, handin' out flyers to my funeral

And, so, they say that life's a play
And that all the world's a stage
Then for another part, I pray
The show ends the same way every day
And my heart carries the pain
Of a brain I can't explain
Am I insane?
Am I insane?

And it don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear
And it don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear
And everything good is gone
And everything good is gone
And everything good is gone
And everything bad is here
And everything bad is here
And everything bad is here
It doesn't really matter now, does it?

And it don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear
It don't matter and I don't care
I let my pain into the air
'Cause everything good's over there
And everything here's hard to bear, yeah

It's hard to bear
And everything here's hard to bear
And everything here's hard to bear
