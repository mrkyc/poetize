Hey, there, pretty little girl (Hey, man)
With your long brown sexy curls (Uh, uh)
You a hottie, body tight
Good, God almighty (Shit)

Alright, son, hold up
You need to slow your roll
We've been talking for a while now
She ain't no ho
She got class, style, pizzazz, a jazzy
Smile as a matter of fact she has me
Twisted just like she did back then when
The game of Galaga played among friends
Is all it was about
Been at her every since
We talked last night around 10
And I told her, yo

Listen up, 'cause I love you, lady
We go back, like, 1980
Lord knows you're the one to change me
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy
You'll see, it'll be, you and me
Always, always

I told her look
I know a lot of folks around town
Probably been telling you that
"Danny just a crook."
I definitely done some things that I shouldn't be proud of
But we can do it by the book
We've known each other for a long time
I know your the strong kind of women with a strong mind
And that's what got me hooked
I got some crazy homies
Whatchu talkin' about?
You got some crazy homies
Yo, quit fronting and lolly gagging
We can have a baby daughter
Maybe call her Maggie
We've known each other since the 9th grade
We make each other laugh
Best friends, let's do this the right way

Listen up, 'cause I love you, lady
We go back, like, 1980
Lord knows you're the one to change me
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy
You'll see, it'll be, you and me
Always, always
Listen up, 'cause I love you, lady
We go back, like, 1980
Lord knows you're the one to change me
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy
You'll see, it'll be, you and me
Always, always
I know I'm still crazy
But I've changed a lot
I've cleaned up a little
And you're still hot
But if I ain't the one
I hope you find true love
And if not, I'm here when push comes to shove
Just know if you walk down that aisle
With another dude to take those vows
How I'll react, there ain't no telling
I might bust in the back of the church and start yelling

Listen up, 'cause I love you, lady
We go back, like, 1980
Lord knows you're the one to change me
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy
You'll see, it'll be, you and me
