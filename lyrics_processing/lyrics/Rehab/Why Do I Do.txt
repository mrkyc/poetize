Everyday same old thing same routine waking up between
1 and 2 PM with cloudy thoughts and fully clothed
Smelling like the night before the rut I'm in has become a bore
Eyes bloodshot and my head is pounding don't ask me I don't know
Man all I know is I can't find my cell
I woke up on the couch with a Taco Bell
Crunch Wrap supreme smashed all in the cushions
Feeling like my teeth need a good pressure washing
Television on mute another ExtenZe
Commercial, left my car windows down again
See Rehab LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like
And it's raining just no use to complain
That's par for the course just more of the same

Why do I do what I do

Take a shower clean myself up
Drink my coffee and beat myself up
Shake it off and try to salvage the rest of the day
Hit a drive thru looking for the 99 cent menu of course the
Cashier looks like she just might be feeling the same way
Yep I got about three friends who owe me at least 10 bucks a piece
And I'm scraping up change to eat
My windshield's cracked from a fight with my sweetie
A dash full of trash so I can't find the speeding
Ticket that got last month I think
Or was it before that I'm up that creek
And it's raining just no use to complain
That's par for the course just more of the same

Why do I do what I do

One day I'll get it together
At least I sure hope I do
I know my mama worries bout me
I know father he does too

And time keeps ticking away
And I'm in the same old place
I'm sure you can tell by the look on my face
