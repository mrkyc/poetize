Hey you guys
Chic-a chic-a dobe dobe dobe dobe
All the children went to heaven
Won't be back 'til ten after eleven
Are you ready (ready)
Are you ready (ready)
First there was the weed sack, coppin' and chillin'
Then came the cocaine, robbin' and stealin' (stealin')
I said I dropped more pounds then maternity wards
And got the gold chain from the gudda awards Yup!
We like that trunk knockin'
Roll by them ladies jockin'
We blazing up the bad
We got them baggies in our pockets
Y'all know we drinking somethin'
We know your thinking somethin'
Making your windows rattle
Turn the corner hear me comin'

Let'em know that you ain't nothing to be messed with
Bring the fire every time get that money don't quit
Grind off shine off make it happen
Get it get it
Lives large come hard
If you gonna spit it, spit it
See Rehab LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also likeI rocked the living room the first day I started walkin'
Was rhyming spitting flames the first day I started talkin'
Had the class and the teacher bouncing in kindergarten
Then I slapped her on her ass she said I beg your pardon
I said get get get get get it girl
One of these days I'm gonna rock the world
Just give me a crayon and give me an A on
Everything I do with a ground to play on
We're on a whole 'nother, no love for under covers
I had you suckered since I busted out my father's rubber
Give me ball caps and sneakers, fresh in some jeans and t-shirt
Still got them children dance, looking like they having seizures

Kiss my acrobat my soda crack my B-u-t-t-y butty whack
Yo ma', yo pa, yo gritty granny with her hose in a panty
And a big behind like Frankenstein rock the beat down Sesame Street
It's your turn know let's get it on
