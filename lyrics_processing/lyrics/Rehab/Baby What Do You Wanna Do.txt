Baby what do you wanna do
Who do you wanna be
Cause I wanna be with you
And I want you to be with me
Baby what do you wanna do
Who do you wanna be
Cause I wanna be with you
And I want you to be with me

You're the most beautiful thing I've ever
Seen you trust me to leave you never
No I don't have a lot of money
But I dream big and I work hard honey
You and me we can leave this town
Nothing here for us take a good look around
And tell me what do you see
Cuz I need you to believe in me

Baby what do you wanna do
Who do you wanna be
Cause I wanna be with you
And I want you to be with me
Baby what do you wanna do
Who do you wanna be
Cause I wanna be with you
And I want you to be with me
