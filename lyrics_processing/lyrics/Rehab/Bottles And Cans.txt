I think about, you know life and what it really means
I drink about it, I think I'm busting at the seams
Don't over think it, I think somebody told me that before
Yea whatever thats my attitude what can I say. Evidently
I was raised to be this way, but incidentally
There's days I really want to change. If heaven sent me
Then why do I feel this crazy
Got a man down mayday mayday

Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Down to my last roach, here I am again
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday
Telling myself it'll be okay
Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Will I ever change, guess it all depends
Feels like nothin' ever went my way
Telling myself it'll be okay

Broken-hearted, I've been listenin' to my head scream
"Got it spark it" You hear that or is it just me?
What's the matter are you feeling just like me
Has anybody seen my mind I can't find it life is flyin'
Somebody rewind it, were all dying and just runnin' around blinded
I think we've gotten a little too open minded
Got a man down, mayday, mayday

Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Down to my last roach, here I am again
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday
Telling myself it'll be okay
Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Will I ever change, guess it all depends
Feels like nothin' ever went my way
Telling myself it'll be okay

Broke and lonely
Choking on dro can I borrow another tommorow dear lord
I'm scopin' hopin' some door can open
And my folks don't even know me no more
My kids are growin' and my age is showin'
Are the seeds I sowing gonna sprout I'm not sure
The doubt and the lure and a couch of velour
With a mirror and a blade and a pile of the pure

Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Down to my last roach, here I am again
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday
Telling myself it'll be okay
Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Will I ever change, guess it all depends
Feels like nothin' ever went my way
Telling myself it'll be okay
Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Down to my last roach, here I am again
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday
Telling myself it'll be okay
Bottles and cans, seeds and stems
Will I ever change, guess it all depends
Feels like nothin' ever went my way
Telling myself it'll be okay
