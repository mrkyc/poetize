Lad/ I get mad at myself sittin in the back of a cab
Feelin wack as a whip on the back of a slave on a ship
Back in the days at times waking up is slap in the
Face/ but the passion of one whose flesh was torn away
By the cat of 9 tails an pierced by one spear and 3
Nails/ has saved my soul but there's still times I get
Weak and there's still times I get beat/ and sometimes
I write rhymes way to ill to repeat and I don't want
To be another hypocrite on a beat/ but sometimes when
The sun shines I wish I could sleep it away but today
I woke up with some strength counted a couple of
Blessings and stepped out in the street/ and the sweet
Smell of victory put my mind at ease and the breeze
Told the tree's to whisper something to me/ and they
Told me don't worry I told the devil u was with me

Jesus loves me this I know
For the bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak but he is strong
Those who trespass allow me to forgive I wasn't dealt
The hand they got lives they got to live/ besides
They don't answer to me I'm not you and we've all made
Mistakes and known not what to do/ it's true see if I
Hurt you that hurts me I'm not entitled to the lord's
Tender mercy/ till I drop down on my knee's and say
Please put me into your solution and free me of this
Disease/ I won't make it one more step unless u take
This load I tote with my soul I'll just break and
Won't wait one second longer than I must or bond with
Anyone stronger than this trust so/ the only thing to
Do is lean on you and not be lead astray by what the
Demun do

Don't try to be the best man be the best that u can/
Cause number 1 ain't nothing but the opinion of man and
Man loves death, hate, crime, and pain/ his kids are
Into theft, long lines of cane/ insanity profanity
Ecstasy and blasphemy but as for me I'm just tryin to
Maintain and it's a damn shame our brains have been
Trained to crazy and lazy scared to make change in
These hard times I try to be a role model but I ain't
Gonna lie y'all I still battle the bottle and that's my
Biggest struggle/ I ain't the one to follow sometimes
I get the urge to leave a 12 pack hollow/ just writing
Some inner-sentiments ain't none of us innocent from
Mansions to tenements whether male or feminine all of
Us are guilty of showing a little ignorance being
Resentful, envious, and belligerent/ one day maybe we
Can figure it out but till then I guess I'll just pull
This cigarette out pull up a chair and open a brew
Sit down on the porch and do what I do

Jesus loves me this I know
For the bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
