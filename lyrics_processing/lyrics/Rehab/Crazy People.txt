Sittin' on the corner of 33rd and utter hell
You ain't killed nobody today, but I ain't well
Hangin' up on strippers, working on my 3rd bottle of liquor
You smellin' like cat litter, still bitter
Walk around the earth stressed
I've been buggin' since I fell out of my mothers dress
I guess, I'll have another panic attack
It's always darkest right before it's pitch black
(Chorus)
World full of crazy people and I guess I'm one in the same
And I tell you man it's evil, but I don't know no other game
How did I get so dirty, you can see it on my face
But I ain't killed nobody today, just yet
So ya'll better give me some praise
(Verse 2)
I'm mood swingin' like a wreckin' ball
Knockin out a wall and I don't got a gun
So I'm shootin' birds at ya'll
And it piss me off more that you don't fall
I oughta take a ball of C4 to the mall
Lookin' out the window and the world calls me a chump
Smokin' a cig at the gas pump
Hey you wanta' bump
Excuse me sir, can you spare a buck of two
Fuck you mother fucker, I need liquor too
The worlds a cess pool and I'm a piece of shit
Stomach hangin' out my mouth when I'm blowin grits
I'm like a rat inside the wheel and it's played out
Drivin' off a cliff, smoke a spliff on the way down
Can't get a bitch, all of them are gay now
Hey pal, got the time? Does anybody really now?
Man, ya'll done lost ya'll mind
Well, so has everybody else
We're just cuttin' in line
See Rehab LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like(Chorus)
World full of crazy people and I guess I'm one in the same
And I tell you man it's evil, but I don't know no other game
How did I get so dirty, you can see it on my face
But I ain't killed nobody today, just yet
So ya'll better give me some praise
And how am I suppose to walk
And how am I suppose to talk
And how am I suppose to live
When I ain't gotta damn thang to give
(Repeat)
(Verse 3)
Hey you wanna get a 50 piece, nah
Me neither
You ever wanna kill a cop, nah
Me neither
Ever contemplated suicide, nah
Me neither
You ever wanna run through a mall with an M16
Yellin' kill em all, nah
Me neither
You ever wanna swerve into the oncoming lane
Leavin' nothin' but body parts, wrecked cars and brains, nah
Well, me neither (That's a good thing)
(Chorus)
World full of crazy people and I guess I'm on in the same
And I tell you man it's evil, but I don't know no other game
How did I get so dirty, you can see it on my face
But I ain't killed nobody today, just yet
