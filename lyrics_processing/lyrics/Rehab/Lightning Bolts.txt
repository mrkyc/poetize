Father if I die ahead of you one thing that I hope you do
Is always know you were a fine example
Mama if I had to fly long before it comes your time
Always know that I always loved you
And if I go before you both it was just my time to go
I'll visit you in lightning bolts until we meet again
We'll meet again

I never gave a damn, don't have a damn to give
I never had a plan, all I want to do is live
Don't know a whole lot, I learned what I learned
When the spots hot get out before you get burned
No need to hurry got to wait your turn
I love my plants I don't mean those ferns
Eyes on the prize try to tell no lies
La lalala lala la lala la
Broken bones been stabbed beat with a brick
Around here order got hit for a lick
I stood in a snake pit and I been bit
Here I am with another fifth gettin lit y'all

Father if I die ahead of you one thing that I hope you do
Is always know you were a fine example
Mama if I had to fly long before it comes your time
Always know that I always loved you
And if I go before you both it was just my time to go
I'll visit you in lightning bolts until we meet again
We'll meet again

I've loved and lost I've gambled and won
I looked down the barrel of a big ol' gun
Down in the grave you don't get no sun
So I seize the day watch it ease away
I've gone a little right all kinds of wrong
You can live your whole life hope you live long
Hot butter pop da pop da popcorn
It goes on and and on and on and on on
Making it to mirrors just seein the next dawn
Even if hes drunk face down on the lawn
I'm broke but I got me a necklace to pawn
I been reckless since the day I was born

Father if I die ahead of you one thing that I hope you do
Is always know you were a fine example
Mama if I had to fly long before it comes your time
Always know that I always loved you
And if I go before you both it was just my time to go
I'll visit you in lightning bolts until we meet again
