It's just another lawn chair high
And I'm sittin' in the carport
Lookin' down the driveway
Watchin' all the cars go by
And it's alright...it's alright
And it's alright...it's alright
Hey Reese, check this out
And while the world trippin'
I'm sippin'
I really don't give a flyin' parapalegic chicken
Watchin' the cars
We don't need bars
We got a garage
A cooler full of beers
Fuck an entourrage
My life is one big funny mirage
I slept all day
And I'm a sit and let the cd play
My wife is a thousand miles away
And I've got (X)anax all the way
No work, all play
My attitude is go away
I'm talkin' to people
I'm through with this episode
I'm workin' on a sequel
I take my iced coffee with 2 Equal
I'm too evil
At least that's what people think
You wonder why I drink
'cause I've done it all, seen it all
And it don't really matter
I might as well sit in the carport
Talk shit and get fatter
It's just another lawnchair high
People rollin' by, "Hi"
Look here, don't die
Well it's just another lawn chair high
It's just another lawn chair high
And I'm sittin' in the carport
Lookin' down the driveway
Watchin' all the cars go by
And it's alright...it's alright
And it's alright...it's alright
Hell yeah, got my boombox
This tune rocks
The boondocks
Back as well
Packin' the bag of the wacky tobacco
Pack a bowl up
You can stack or fold up the lawnchair
I don't care
Got a brew in the Igloo cooler, too
Plus a barrage of puzzlein' thoughts
In my garage, guzzelin' Heinekin
My mind I cannot focus
'cause I'm blind again
So find a friend to tell it to
I'm tryin' to relax, dawg
I ain't tryin' to hear about
The guns, loot and cars
Or one silicone titty, pity
Done tootin', bars
I'm tryin' to catch the escalator
To the sun, moon and stars, bra
You gotta love it, whoo
Like Jimmy Buffet, yeah
Give me some stuff that I can handle
And fuck it
And please hold my calls
'cause I'm out for the night
Mosquito bites and lightnin' bugs
Got neon bars
You better recamuthafuckinize
Give me that funnel and run along
Youngins
Well it's just another lawn chair high
It's just another lawn chair high
And I'm sittin' in the carport
Lookin' down the driveway
Watchin' all the cars go by
And it's alright...it's alright
And it's alright...it's alright
Hell Yeah
I got it all goin', I know'n
And there ain't nothin' that you can
Tell me in this moment
And I'm hopin' this evening
I'm leaving all my troubles inside
While I sit and get by
With what I really do best
And if I may suggest you do the same
Which is nothing
And that ain't frontin'
I'm steady comin' with it
Talkin' to myself and all else
It's gettin' figured out
As'n I gets further along
Turn the right into wrong
Change the words to this song
I know I ain't singin' along
But deep inside it feels on
So I'm a carry on
Sippin', skippin'
Every other idea that
That runs up in here
'cause it's clear, they multiply
Fly back between both of my ears
And who cares?
I've got a minute if you're with it
We can get it
Set it in the chair
Somewhere in the front, out there
Holler in the air
"WE THE SHIT OVER HERE!"
Well it's just another lawn chair high
It's just another lawn chair high
And I'm sittin' in the carport
Lookin' down the driveway
Watchin' all the cars go by
And it's alright...it's alright
