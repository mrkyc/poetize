I got my hat tilted sideways and brand new shoes
I got my Alpine bumpin' rattlin' my rear view
Lookin' at the world behind me make it bump bump bump
Turn it up another notch and watch it pump pump pump
Let it punch you in your chest then it kick in your back
When it's time rewind it back make it bump bump bump
It can get your leg to rockin' make it pump pump pump
Blister your transistor make it thump thump thump

Black tree silhouetted against an orange sky
Cool breeze on a country road I'm ten feet high
I'm just about to take another step up ohh
Real world got me kinda fed up ohh
I got places to go and folks I know that are waiting for me to arrive

A Warner Robins state of mind is what it is if you ain't heard
We too broke to drink and too drunk to work
All day smokin' herb a tad bit disturbed
Yes sir absurd, don't know when the curse occurred
But we're scarred livin' harder than hell on wheels
Retarded oxycontin poppin' swappin' powder for pills
And if we want it we steal, we might be pawning your drill
If it's on you will get a soup bone to the grill

We addicted but intelligent live the criminal element
Coke is so American show it stops the arrogant hoes
Constantly staring at you, ain't no comparing the flow
Make sure you stare in the hole before you answer the door
Be sure you rappin' in code the folks are tappin' the phone
My boy Jeff Mack put a cap in his dome
That's how it happens back home
My man got trap now he's gone
We're all a little paranoid I got the hell on
I got my hat tilted sideways and brand new shoes
I got my Alpine bumpin' rattlin' my rear view
