The heaven's have become a part of man's world
And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility
It inspires us to bring peace and tranquility to Earth
You're go for landing, over
Coming down I put a hole in my soul
And I done heard 3 morning roosters crow
And I can't live this way no mo'
My brain's on the Autobahn, my body's slow
Scared of me now, I've been mean and hateful
Jealous, greedy and so ungrateful
If I be wise and I can't drive
It's hard to believe I'm still alive
Skin is plastic, breath is death
A theft charge and that is all that's left
Computer's glitched, all money's gone
And I don't even know my way back home
(Chorus)
And I've landed in a place I don't belong
This is wrong, this is my song
Call someone, I need some help
Can you save me from my self?
It started out good about 5 days ago
I was gonna have a few drinks, maybe stop after fo'
Long Island Iced Teas, take the me outta me
You can go ask my dad, it takes the him outta he
But something, caused me to malfunction
I dropped the drink and start huntin'
Figuring better things, wantin'
Something for my sinuses, something for my back pain
Either one it's dope but give me Lortab and cocaine
Off the chain, the next four days I'm handed
I'm sober and stranded, naked and cattle-branded

Coming down I put a hole in my soul
And I done heard 3 morning roosters crow
And I can't live this way no mo'
My brain's on the Autobahn, my body's slow
Scared of me now, I've been mean and hateful
Jealous, greedy and so ungrateful
If I be wise and I can't drive
It's hard to believe I'm still alive
Skin is plastic, breath is death
A theft charge and that is all that's left
Computer's glitched, all money's gone
And I don't even know my way back home
(Chorus)
Hey, I'm sorry mama
Yeah, I was just a little boy
It hurts, it hurts so bad sometimes
Feeling not many joy
And I've landed in a place I don't belong
This is wrong, this is my song
Call someone, I need some help
Can you save me from my self?
And I've landed in a place I don't belong
And I've landed in a place I don't belong
This is wrong, this is my song
Call someone, I need some help
Can you save me from my self?
Can you save me?
And I've landed in a place I don't belong
Can you save me from myself?
Can you save me from myself?
Can you save me?
