Hot as a pistol
Drinkin' liquor out the bottle
Got a friend named Crystal
Done away with the past
She left it dead in the Chevy
My little runaway Whinnie
Got my back and she ready
Booty shorts in beetle
Tramp stamp with Adidas
And I think she tryin' to bust my speakers
She grew up around the corner, father was a stoner
Mother been gone since shorty was around 10
Now she's 'bout 19, cussin' like a sailor
Smokin' (a Capri), and sippin' up on her Jager
Flippin' off the cops, tell her stop
But she don't care
Says she just want to have a little fun, no fair
Got her feet up on the dash
Laughin', smokin' up my stash
Says she don't care where we goin'
Just as long as we're goin' fast

And she knows I love her
And I'd do anything for her

12-pack right beside her
And when it all goes down, she'll still be around
Even if I don't wife her
My little rideout chick, tough little bitch
Swear she got it goin' on
Says I can take her 'bout anywhere with me
Just as long as I don't take her home
And we high, and she bumpin' T.I
Ain't she somethin'
She fly, and she loves me
She says but she lies
And she steals, and she drinks like a man
She got moves
Watch her work it and drop it
Wiggle, jiggle, and pop it
And she's kinda spacey, maybe little crazy
Throwin' beer cans at the speed limit signs
While we whippin' through the back roads
Young, but she acts old
Head out the window to let her long hair blow
Wants to go out to Vegas to make us some big dough
Pedal to the floor baby, careful what you ask for
Got her feet up on the dash
Laughin', smokin' up my stash
Says she don't care where we goin' just as long as we're goin' fast

And she knows I love her
And I'd do anything for her
She's my little rideout chick, that I hideout with
12-pack right beside her
And when it all goes down, she'll still be around
Even if I don't wife her
My little rideout chick, tough little bitch
Swear she got it goin' on
Says I can take her 'bout anywhere with me, just as long as I don't take her home
We're like Mickey and Mallory
Whilin' out on the run
Hate it for whoever gotta
Clean up the mess when we're done
We're fuckin' shots at the moon
Tearin' up motel rooms
We set the night on fire
Just for the smell of the fumes
She got my back, I got hers
Her bond is left, and not words
Livin' life on the edge
Fast as we can in a blur
She's my rideout chick
And the chick don't snitch
We gon' run it til the wheels fall off in this bitch
And she knows I love her
And I'd do anything for her
She's my little rideout chick, that I hideout with
12-pack right beside her
And when it all goes down, she'll still be around
