But I don't give a damn about you, this much is true
My vision's blurry and my thoughts are hazy baby
I know I'm stupid so I must be smarter than you
Keep your advice, leave me alone and don't rattle my cage
Just let me wallow in my own chigones, rattle my cage
I'm known to bite the hand that feeds me so don't rattle my cage
I'm bossly in row, now everybody starin' at me cold, rattle my cage
Do I look like I want to be bothered
Like I care about the globe
My life's a comode, I like my depression a-la mode
On the road, get off my back about my health
I like disease, I'll still be around when y'all are feeding trees
I don't want your speech or your sound advice
Don't like people who seem nice
Talking in my head like a family of lice
Just let me wallow in my rage
Don't clean up my droppings and don't rattle my cage
Keep your advice, leave me alone and don't rattle my cage
Just let me wallow in my own chigones, rattle my cage
I'm known to bite the hand that feeds me so don't rattle my cage
I'm bossly in row, now everybody starin' at me cold, rattle my cage
