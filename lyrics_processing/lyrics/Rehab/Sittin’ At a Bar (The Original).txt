Bartender, I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 a.m
The door was locked, so I kicked it in
She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunkin' stooper, I did what I should've never done
Now I'm sittin' here talkin' to you, drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

You know, Mo, I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers 'til they get here
Yeah, I know the sun is comin' up
And y'all are probably gettin' ready for closin' up
But I'm tryna drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin' on

She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

Guess it's meant to be
Romance is misery, so much for memories
And now I'm headed to the Penitentiary
See me on T.V
The next cop series, I am a danger
I guess I shoulda did somethin' about my anger
But I'll never learn, real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn
I know it's my fault, but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit, so I crashed that piece of shit Nova
And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
When we all pile out that county van
They'll ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
