I can't catch up to you, you've already gone too far
And you don't remember who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you, you're way up ahead of me
And you're gettin' harder to see every day as you run away

You're cuttin' lines out on a bible
Too busy dyin' to stop and live
You done gave up on survival
You gave all that you can give
And I sure wish you would come back home
Nothin' else for you to prove
I know you try real hard to make your mark
But that world don't love you the way I do

I can't catch up to you, you've already gone too far
And you don't remember who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you, you're way up ahead of me
And you're gettin' harder to see every day as you run away

There just ain't no comin' down
When there ain't no one around
And your head still makes that sound
And I watch it drive you crazy
Your mama's sayin' prayers
Pleadin' with the man upstairs
You feel like no one cares
And I watch it drive you crazy

You run run run run
Hidin' from the su-u-un
And I know you wanna turn around
But there's nothin' I can do

I can't catch up to you, you've already gone too far
And you don't remember who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you, you're way up ahead of me
And you're gettin' harder to see every day as you run away

It's these demons behind their faces
You know the lies they tell are true
You paint yourself into a corner
And you chose the color blue
And you look for inspiration
In the dark where the sickness lives
And you're stumblin' over your own two feet
And you're headed for the edge of a cliff

I can't catch up to you, you've already gone too far
And you don't remember who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you, you're way up ahead of me
And you're gettin' harder to see every day as you run away
I watch you stumble, watch you fall
And I just can't seem to help at all
And I feel...
I feel like I'm wastin' my time with you
And I know the way you feel
Been there myself
And I just don't wanna see your pain
I don't wanna see you go through hell
I know it hurts, I know it stabs
I know it makes you feel real bad
To feel those things that are goin' on
Inside your head and make your eyes
Bloody red and I sympathize
'Cause I know the way you are
