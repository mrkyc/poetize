Pour some liquor on my ulcer
I wanna talk about the pain
Come on friend let's sit down and suffer
Together man together man
I'm strangly angry unashamed deranged
My lady says I'm broke because I'm scared of change
My lady says I'm broke because I'm scared of change
Whatever don't care for drama

I slammed my boss man on his neck took my check
Kicked a dent in the pricks Benz bent the antenna
Once again I'm unemployed
But once I get up with my boys I'm copasetic
The past is too over to sweat it
Wifey told me to get sober
I told her to dead it I'm so firmly embeded
In my bullheaded ways going home I dread it
Feels Like I'm being pulled seven way I hate it
I'm jaded simply stated I'm faded ain't it a bitch
If I was paid they'd all swing from my dick
Wanna sing on my shit
Now care is the only thing the I'm eager to quit
Yeah I teeter a bit on the edge of sanity that say Danny
Be tripping cuz they hear my teeth as they grit

So many people and opinions it drains my energy
I care about me exclusively
No apologies or excess baggage
To damage or slow my pursuit of max potential
Sick of advice clogging my noggin
Finding selfishness essential
I snap like a pencil past pissed
Pushing psychotic fist through sheet rock
Why the boundaries no more conscience attacks
That prove to be nonsense in fact
No more respect fuck what you feel
Far as I know my thoughts and visions
Are the only things real
I'm not an extra in a movie 'bout everyone else
I got a thousand fuck yous to give out
It's time to hit below the belt
And back stab with violent aggression
And spit in fucking faces
Pour some liquor on my ulcer
I wanna talk about the pain
Come on friend let's sit down and suffer
Together man together man
I'm strangly angry unashamed deranged
My lady says I'm broke because I'm scared of change
My lady says I'm broke because I'm scared of change
Whatever don't care for drama

I hear a roaring beast
I'm in the war for peace
The tears pour from these eyes
The core in me tries
To store the heat rising inside of me
Anger bangs on my brain but
I manage not to do damage
What a planet we inhabit
It's sad but its true dammit
The dealer of bad habits
Is working his black magic
Imagine packing the gat that
You grab from your dad cabinet with
Nothing less than evil intention
Pour some liquor on my ulcer
I wanna talk about the pain
Come on friend let's sit down and suffer
Together man together man
I'm strangly angry unashamed deranged
My lady says I'm broke because I'm scared of change
