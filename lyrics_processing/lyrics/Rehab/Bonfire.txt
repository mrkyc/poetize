Everybody gather 'round, cuz you know we are fitting to do this thing
For reezy some serious. Put your money in your shoes and it won't get wet. Come on
Here comes a man across the field, honey
Here comes a man across the field, babe
Here comes a man across the field
He's kicking up dust like an automobile
Honey, oh, baby, mine

Get it up girl, down in them Daisy Dukes
I want ya ass butt naked in a baby suit
Gonna keep on drinking till the tummy puke
Got a problem with that, well you can get the boot
Got shotgun pointed to the sky
Got smoke in the eyes, and I'm surely high
Waking and baking, till the noggin' fry
Macon rolling round with a hog and I
Taking from the rich and I give to me one Escalade, two extasy's
Put four more hoes right next to me and I think I found serenity
Back up that buck is mine again I jacked a truck of Heineken
Looks like it's time for a line again and how about five Klonopin?
And I start to grin and start to dance
I'm speakin' in tongues, takin' off my pants
I'm blowing my whole hot damn advance
And we ain't gonna stop till the ambulance
Slow ride a hundred GMCs hooked up Crown Vics with DVDs
Got people down here you'll want to see had the same haircut since '83

Start the bonfire drop the tailgate
Pass the Knob Creek and we can drink it straight
And if the fire keeps burning and the skies stay orange
We gon' be up in this motherfucker real late

Better give me that bag of wacky tobacco
Them cracker's ain't takin' a damn thing
Drinking and smokin', stinkin' and pokin'
Banging these hoes, we profane
Getting' it up in the back of a truck
With a bitty with titties that's shaking her butt
Call me retarded but that's how we party
Bacardi is lord almighty y'all
Breaking it down like it ain't been done
Straight jacked to the brain till I see the sun
You a punk fothermucker if you got a gun
Leave that at home and just bring your lungs wit
Pimp swiggin', shindiggin', shit kicking, picknicking
Big dicking, thick chickens and it's sickning
TNA and smoking dope in the open, no choking, or joking
The morning rolling, and I'm locing, hoping to leave a jaw broken
Soaking in your blood, while I'm stroking your ho in the wide open
With my folks scoping that bastard's crazy as hell!
That's how we do it down here in Georgia
It's on like a mother when the weather's gorgeous
Shit you industry punks never seen on a TV screen
From radios to porches, to patios, let's torch it
Some bitch, I pour gas on it Crunk?, Bet your ass on it!
Start the bonfire drop the tailgate
Pass the Knob Creek and we can drink it straight
And if the fire keeps burning and the skies stay orange
We gon' be up in this motherfucker real late

That's why at 3:30 I'm seein' shit
Screwin' three or four broads like a trail of piss
Takin' three or four rolls I ain't feelin' shit
Give me three or four mo' 'bout real quick
Ain't nothin' down here but 'trailer crank'
Poor man with a meth lab and a bama? stank
Man, y'all keep that dyin' shit
Motherfucker do I look like I'm tryin' to quit?

Moonshine in a Mason jar at noon-time, trippin'
Beer is for the guzzelin', this is for the sippin'
When the Sun go down, it sure be goody good
In the dirty dirt, speakin' dirty words
They might be scarred but them boys ain't skerd
I don't know if you heard, you can't polish a turd
Yeah, my vision blurred, my speech a little slurred
But back off of me cracker 'for your ass get hurt
"Oh my God! What are these blue turtles?"

"I don't know dude, but every time I wave my cigarette around I
Catch a trail"

Start the bonfire drop the tailgate
Pass the Knob Creek and we can drink it straight
And if the fire keeps burning and the skies stay orange
We gon' be up in this motherfucker real late

To the window, to the walls
Till the sweat running off my balls
Till the shit runnin' out yo' drawers
Skeet, skeet motherfuckers, skeet, skeet
Skeet, skeet motherfuckers, skeet, skeet
To the window, to the walls
Till the sweat runnin' off my balls
Till the shit runnin' out yo' drawers
