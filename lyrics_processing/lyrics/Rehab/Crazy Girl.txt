She's got views and she's got opinions
She went to school and she handles her business
When she gets to tripping when she gets to bugging
Ain't no man gonna tell her nothing
It's her way or the highway right or wrong
If she holds back it's not for long
Simply will not tolerate ignorance
Quick to leave the party if she's not feeling it
So I... just try... to make her laugh

And she just sits there staring at a crooked window
Tears in her eyes with a glass of Kendall
Jackson Cabernet Sauvignon
And it don't matter what I think
She won't change for nobody
Says I don't listen when she yada yada yada
Crazy girl crazy girl
She says I'm outta my mind
And she's my crazy girl

She likes to watch TV in the dark
Whether the car or the grocery cart
She's gotta drive because she's got issues
Corrects my speech whenever I misuse
A word or get my verb tense screwed up
Three times a week I pick Mexican food up
Cheese dip fixes everything
I'm just a court jester and she's my queen
So I just try to make her laugh

And she just sits there staring at a crooked window
Tears in her eyes with a glass of Kendall

And it don't matter what I think
She won't change for nobody
Says I don't listen when she yada yada yada
Crazy girl crazy girl
She says I'm outta my mind
And she's my crazy girl

I try to tell everything is gonna be alright
She says I'm really really sorry that I'm so uptight
I tell her don't apologize that just the way you are
Some folks think about things too hard
I'm like yo looka here listen truth be known
It's quite possible I have faults of my own
Don't know of any yet but I'm sure there's some
You probably can't tell but I bet there's one
And I think... that she just might... crack a smile

And she just sits there staring at a crooked window
Tears in her eyes with a glass of Kendall
Jackson Cabernet Sauvignon
And it don't matter what I think
She won't change for nobody
Says I don't listen when she yada yada yada
Crazy girl crazy girl
She says I'm outta my mind
