Going north in the south-bound lane
Railroad crossing, I outrun the train
Holdin' pain, golden grain, Danno Malone's the name
In my chest got a flame
A collage of photos is in my brain
My temper is fire and prophane
No shame, no game, no pain, no gain
Hey that's insane
Should I bend over and let the world gang bang
Or raise my neck and let the vampires position their fangs
Or be a pussy that hangs from a beam and swang, no thanks
I got an old truck, I'm the king of tough luck
From where ya bluff you get your card plucked and get fucked up, ya get fucked up
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna try me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey, then kick my ass

Beatin' seals wearin' a fur, choppin' down trees
Sprayin' aerosol cans, ozone deficiency
Just wanna make sure everybody hates me
I am the anti whatever you are
Alien drunk at the bar, junkie misfit
Conforming mics into unbiodegradable toxic shit
And don't possess no guilt about it
Rebel without a cause
Just to severe your fuckin' claws and your biblical laws
That really ain't got jack to do with psalms
No officer I won't calm, I won't vote
I won't participate in hands across America
Or any area, in fact I'll be
What the fuck man, what the fuck is this
It's all good fuck it, no fuck you
The most brilliant thought you had today
I had when I was two bitch
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna try me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey, then kick my ass
Every bit of me's hostility
And I'm ridiculous
Got a life, let's see if you're ticklish
I will rip your jaw completely out your head, yeah
And when you kick my ass make sure that I'm dead, uh
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna try me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna fight me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey, then kick my ass
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Kick my ass
