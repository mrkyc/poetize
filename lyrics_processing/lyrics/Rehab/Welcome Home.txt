Welcome home
Where the faucets drip at night
Welcome home
Where the screen door don't hang right
Welcome home
The only place you'll ever fight
Because you love
Over and over again

Chicken on the grill hole in the wall where I got ill
Comin' home late smellin' like a still
Mom waited up to get in my grill
I swear my dad caught me becomin' a man
Came with the bail money did the best he can
A cross on the wall a bible on the table
Under a full moon, drinkin' the black label
Standin' on a screened-in porch that lean
Chiefin' the good leaf feelin' the breeze
Mama said everyday hit your knees
And give thanks that you're alive

Oh, take it to the house
Take it to the house take it to the
Take it to the
Take it to the house

Think about the years
Troubles of the world don't matter here
Talk about Chevrolets over a beer
Don't gotta worry about what I hear
Because ya know it's all said in love
Sometimes pushy comes to shove
And we forgive, but we don't forget
And its okay to be full of it
'Cause we all know who we messin with
Car in the yard over run by weeds
I remember when I used to climb that tree
When I was young and dumb
Oh

Oh, take it to the house
Take it to the house take it to the
Take it to the take it to the house

What a beautiful day
Lookin' back and thinkin' 'bout the people that I'm missin'
You can hear 'em in the breeze and the trees if ya listen
Some are in the ground and some are in prison
Now I remember mama hangin' clothes on the line
Way back before I opened my mind
And got hip to the guilt, hard times, and fear
And I'm just damn glad to be here

Welcome home

Welcome home
Where the screen door don't hang right
Welcome home
The only place you'll ever fight
