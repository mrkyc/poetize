I want all the Evidence of everything
That's beautiful in this whole world
Like an old man dancing...out in the yard
To the laughter of a little girl

Why can't we just love life live life
We got a little bit of gratitude
Instead of a whole lot of attitude
This is us In God We Trust and then we lust
All of our neighbors paper the house the gold
I got a fashion statement to make, "Just wear clothes!"
We judge too much hold a grudge too much
I'm like a lot of us
I probably couldn't walk without the crutch I lean on
Ain't gonna lie seen a fiend on the streets
But for the grace of God there go I
The kids need opportunity stop the lunacy
Chop of the excess because greed is evil
We gotta treat people equal people
Life is a blessing without no sequel
I'm talking to the hooker on the street
And the preacher beneath the steeple people

I want all the Evidence of everything
That's beautiful in this whole world
Like an old man dancing...out in the yard
To the laughter of a little girl
On a windy gray October day

A country boy in this city noise
The frowning faces the dreamers schemers
Money chasers the Jags and Beamers
That I don't need deceit surrounds me
Bitter critters give me the jitters
It is amazing these things we take for
Granted the king is the man that make more
Money sunny days go unnoticed
Bloat us divide us I find it's so dis-
Heartening the divine art and things
In nature a world full of beautiful creatures
That over wager and plagiarize
Under paid teachers anger lies
Everybody looking for the way to make another person
Look inside the mind and feel what they feel
We fallen in love with things that ain't real

I want all the Evidence of everything
That's beautiful in this whole world
Like an old man dancing...out the yard
To the laughter of a little girl
On a windy gray October day
Or the simplicity of a smiling face
......
I wanna be Evidence of everything
That's beautiful in this whole world
Like an old man dancing...out the yard
To the laughter of a little girl
On a windy gray October day
