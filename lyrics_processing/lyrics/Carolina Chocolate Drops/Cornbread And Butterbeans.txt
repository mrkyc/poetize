Cornbread and butterbeans and you across the table
Eatin' them beans and makin' love as long as I am able
Hoein' corn and cotton too, and when the day is over
Ride the mule and cut the fool and love again all over
Goodbye, don't you cry, I'm going to Louisiana
To buy a coon dog and a big fat hog and marry Susie Anna
Sing-song, ding-dong, I'll take a trip to China
Cornbread and butterbeans, then back to North Carolina

Hoein' corn and cotton too, and when the day is over
Ride the mule and cut the fool and love again all over

Wearin' shoes and drinking booze, it goes against the Bible
A necktie will make you die and cause you lots of trouble
Streetcars and whiskey bars and kissing pretty women
Women, yeah that's the end of a terrible beginning

Cornbread and butterbeans and you across the table
Eatin' them beans and makin' love as long as I am able
Hoein' corn and cotton too, and when the day is over
Ride the mule and cut the fool and love again all over

I can't read and don't care and education is awful
Raising heck and writin' checks, it ought to be unlawful
Silk hose and frilly clothes is just a waste of money
Come with me and stay with me and say you'll be my honey
