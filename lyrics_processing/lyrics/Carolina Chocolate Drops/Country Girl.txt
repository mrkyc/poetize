I was raised in the country, that's a natural fact
Food on the table from the garden out back
Everyone working to make the land their own
Red clay crackin' where the silver queen grows

Runnin' with your cousins from yard to yard
Livin' was easy but the playin' was hard
Didn't have much, nothing comes for free
All you needed was your family

I am a country girl
I've been around the world
And every place I've been
Ain't quite nothin' like
Livin' in the South
Oh honey, shut your mouth
I am a country girl
I am a country girl

Biscuits in the morning and gravy too
Fried chicken in the afternoon
Jaw draggin', eatin' sweet potato pie
Takin' half an hour to say goodbye
Blackberry patches scuffin' on by
Sweet Georgia peaches and dandelion wine
The best kind of food is made by hand
The only place to get it is from the land
You might also like
I am a country girl
I've been around the world
And every place I've been
Ain't got nothin' like
Livin' in the South
Oh honey, shut your mouth
I am a country girl
I am a country girl

All day I dream about a place in the sun
Kinda like where I'm from
With the tall grass blowin' in the breeze
Runnin' barefoot 'round the tall oak tree
All day, I dream about a place I've been
A place where the skin I'm in
Feels like its supposed to be
And anyone around who looks at me says

I am a country girl
I've been around the world
And every place I've been
Ain't got nothin' like
Livin' in the South
Oh honey, shut your mouth
I am a country girl
I am a country girl
Livin' in the south
Oh honey, shut your mouth

I was born in the country, that's a natural fact
On these long city days I wanna look back
See tobacco fields a row after row
