While he was scheming
I was beamin' in his beamer, just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I threw everything away

Hey ladies, when your man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash
And spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
When you go then, everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he messed up, you gotta hit 'em up

There goes the dreams we used to say
There goes the times we went away
There goes the love I had, but you cheated on me
And that's worth that now
There goes the house, we made a home
There goes you'll never leave me alone
There goes the lies you told
This is what you owe

While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill, just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in my bag and
Threw everything out till there was just nothin' left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fades away, fades away

Hey ladies, when your man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash
And spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
When you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he messed up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies, when your man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash
And spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
When you go then, everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
