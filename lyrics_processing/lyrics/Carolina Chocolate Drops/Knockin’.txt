Half a bottle wine
Sit and eat your fill
And give me what is mine
Chicken in the fridge
Half a bottle wine
Sit and eat your fill
And give me, give me, give me, give me
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money and the milk and the honey
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money and the milk and the honey
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money and the milk and the- hah!
