Look at that gal right over there
Avert your eyes boys because the waters is mighty cold
Make me wanna sing, I tell ya
We gonna talk about you, woman
Ha ha ha ha!
Know a little girl
Name was Fee
Played it with every that man she did see
Played with the man they call Mr. Key
Had her dress made to her knee
Went to the river, couldn't get across
Spent five dollars on old grey horse
Horse wouldn't pull, swapped it for a bull
All you could hear
The boys was sayin'

Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin'
Lower it gal
I wanna see
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin' at the
Short dress, no mo' style

Everybody's lookin'
Lower it gal
I wanna see
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin' at the
Short dress, no mo' style
Talk to me

Makin' old school music on the porch with my friends
Climbin' up the apple tree behind that old wood fence
Just to see that Sally girl walkin' by in a dress
Gotta check it out I'm singin' man I gotta confess
You gotta see what I saw man, nothin' compares
She hang me out to dry in the cold fresh air
Then I'll try to get a glimpse, just get out of my way
Gotta get a little somethin' at the end of the day

I said, lower it gal
Everybody's lookin'
Lower it gal
I wanna see
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin' at the
Short dress, no mo' style
Hit me with three!
We're gonna make  some room here for the ladies to talk
Cause you know they got somethin' they wanna say

I know a guy, his name is John
Always talkin' 'bout what I have on
My skirt's too short, my legs too long (That's true)
I walk like a queen in the Amazon (Hah!)
Baby you shoutin' but I don't mind
Take a good  look while you got the time
Now watch the skirt, it's gonna get high
Cause baby where there's smoke you know there's a fire!

Lower it gal
Everybody's lookin'
Lower it gal
I wanna see
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin' at the
Short dress, no mo' style
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin'
Lower it gal
I wanna see
Won't you lower it gal
Everybody's lookin'
(Woman: And that's alright with me)
