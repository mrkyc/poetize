But not the way I do love you
Well, holy moly, me-oh-my, you're the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you
Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I'll scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothin' that I need
Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie, chocolate candy Jesus Christ
Ain't nothin' please me more than you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
La, la, la, la, take me home
Mother, I'm comin' home
I'll follow you into the park, through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alley ways and pay-phone calls
I've been everywhere with you, that's true
Laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets we're runnin' free like it's only you and me
Jeez, you're somethin' to see
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
La, la, la, la, take me home
Daddy, I'm comin' home
Jade, Alexander
Do you remember that day you fell out of my window?
I sure do, you came jumpin' out after me
Well, you fell on the concrete and nearly broke your ass
And you were bleedin' all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital
You remember that?
Yes, I do
Well, there's somthin' I never told you about that night
Why didn't you tell me?
While you were sittin' there in the backseat smokin' a cigarette
That you thought was gonna be your last
I was fallin' deep, deeply in love with you and I never told you 'til just now
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Lay awake 'til break of dawn
Home is wherever I'm with you
