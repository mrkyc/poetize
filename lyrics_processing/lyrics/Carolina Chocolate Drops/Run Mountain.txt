And you can't reach me
Yeah you can't reach me
You got a broken heart
Don't let them see it
Don't let them see it
You built a wall bigger than your dreams
Feeling so small, covered in your fears
Baby, open the door
Let me come closer
I'll dry your tears
When the lights go out
I'll still be here
When the world falls down
Just listen clear
If only you knew that your words can
They can move a mountain
You're changing my world when you're smiling
I can't live without it
And I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
'Cause you are the air that I breath
Step into the dark
So you can see me
So you can see me
We're a work of art
That I couldn't finish
I couldn't finish
I built a wall bigger than my pride
And how I wish you were here by my side
But I closed the door
Still I want you closer
With nothing to hide
When the lights go out
I'll still be here
When the world falls down
Just listen clear
If only you knew that your words can
They can move a mountain
You're changing my world when you're smiling
I can't live without it
And I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
'Cause you are the air that I breath
Yeah you are the air that I breath
You are the air that I breath
When the lights go out
Search for me, search for me
And I'll clear your doubts
If only you knew that your words can
They can move a mountain
You're changing my world when you're smiling
I can't live without it
And I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
I won't leave you hanging, hanging, oh no
'Cause you are the air that I breath
Yeah you are the air that I breath
Yeah you are the air that I breath
