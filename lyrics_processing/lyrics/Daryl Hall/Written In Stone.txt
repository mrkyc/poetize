I search for words that might explain
How can a love go so deep
Girl, it's in my blood
It'll always be a part of me
If we stay together
Or if we go our separate ways
I know... love will last forever
The sun may someday lose its light
The moon may not shine one night
Your heart will always have a home
It is written in stone - written in stone
Seasons go by and minds have changed
But I will never doubt why I feel this way
It goes on so strong
Like a solid rock
Even when the moment's gone
Nothing lasts forever
But one thing's sure to stay the same
Our love... the love is getting better
The sun may someday lose its light
The moon may not shine one night
I know just how the story goes
It is written in stone - written
In stone
