Sooner or later, it's a matter of money
And then it's just a matter o' time
You can say you don't care and you think it's funny
But baby it's your life on th' line

You're selling yourself and that's a matter of fact
Your love is your life and your life is your act

You know, you gotta have something in 2/4 time (ooh, 2/4)
You gotta have something that always rhymes (2, 2/4)
You know, you gotta have something in 4/4 time (ooh, 4/4 time)
You gotta have something, you gotta have something (time, time)
That rhymes (rhymes)

Continue to dream after you're robbed of sleep
Even though the images fade
So grab what you can and all you can keep
Do you really think you'll come through unhurt, do ya?

You're selling yourself and that's a matter of fact
Your love is your life and your life is your act
