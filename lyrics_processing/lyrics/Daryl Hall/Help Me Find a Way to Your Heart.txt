Hey, open the door
Hey, open the door
It's alright, mm-yeah

Another day and I'm spending time alone
I called you place, but there's no one home
I've been laying low, but I'm thinking of you
Out there by yourself trying to find something new
Girl I thought what we had was so
Good that I'd never hear you say no
And for all that it's worth
I can't think about ever letting go
But I'm lost for the words that I
Need to get over the way I feel
I can't do it by myself
Girl, I really need you here, oh

Help me find the way to your heart, oh
Help me find the way, I can't see
In the dark
Tell me if I've drifted too far
Am I warm?
Am I cold?
Tell me now, let me know
Baby, where we are

I've asked myself a thousand times or more
Girl, if we don't communicate then
What is loving for?
'Cause I thought what we had was
So good that I'd never hear you say why
I can't do it by myself
Girl, we've really got to try

Help me find the way to your heart (Help me baby, baby)
Help me find the way, I can't see (Help me)
In the dark (Oh, oh-oh)
Tell me if I've drifted too far (Drifted too far)

Baby, where we are

Too much time
Too much confusion
Love won't let me be
Take a little time and show you care
For me
Baby tell me what to say
'Cause I can't live my life this way
Show me where your feelings start
Show me sweet baby the way
To your heart
How you know
We don't have much time
But I've been trying for so long
It's time to do that which is like a man
'Cause I know
I-I, I, I, I, I
I've got a teach you my purpose
I, I, I, I
Love you baby, love you baby
And I can't let you go

Help me find the way to your heart (Help me find the way)
Help me find the way, I can't see (See)
In the dark (In the dark)
Tell me if I've drifted too far (If I drift too far)
Am I warm?

Help me find the way to your heart (Ooh, hoo)
Help me find the way, I can't see (Find a way)
In the dark (I can't see in the dark)
Tell me if I drifted too far
Am I warm?
Am I cold?
Tell me now, let me know, hee-hee
Help me find the way to your heart (Baby, oh-oh, help me)
