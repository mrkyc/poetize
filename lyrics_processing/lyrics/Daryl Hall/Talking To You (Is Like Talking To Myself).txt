I try, try to make it right
But every day it's like it was a first night
Sweet dreams
Your dreaming doesn't matter
When you're wide awake
All the patterns scatter
If you run away and don't listen to me
You're only hurting on your own
You see
Talking to you is like talking to myself
(Talking to you is like talking to myself)
Talking to you is like talking to myself
(Talking to you is like talking to myself)
You're sleeping in while there's a riot rollin' down
(Talking to you is like talking to myself)
Can't you understand we got a good thing goin' on
Good thing goin'
I'm saying there's too much noise around
You live behind a wall of unrelated sound
Are you hearing me? Cause I couldn't tell
Is it "Ooo yeah" or is it just "Oh well"

Good thing goin' on
Shine on prove to me
Something real someone can see
Is it sand or gold dust in my hand?
