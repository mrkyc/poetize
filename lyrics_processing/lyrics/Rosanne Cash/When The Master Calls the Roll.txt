Girl with hair of flaming red
Seeking perfect lover
For to lie down on her feather bed
Soft secrets to uncover

Must be gentle, must be strong
With disposition sunny
Just as faithful as the day is long
And careful with his money

And so the open letter read
The news boy did deliver
Three months later plans were made to wed
Down by the King James river

Lo, the season may come
Lo, the season may go
What love has joined together
Will forever be made whole
When the master calls the roll

Oh my darling, will you lead?
Take me to the altar
I don't have strength to watch you as you leave
But my love will never falter

Oh my darling Mary Anne
The march to war is calling
Somewhere far across these southern lands
The bands of brothers falling

My tender bride, the tides demand
That I leave you with your mother
With my father's rifle in one hand
Your locket in the other

Lo, the season may come
Lo, the season may go
Beware, the storm clouds gather
Take heed, dear mortal soul
When the master calls the roll

But can this union be preserved?
The soldier boy was crying
"I will never travel back to her
But not for lack of trying"

It's a love of one true hearted lass
That made the boy a hero
But a rifle ball and a cannon blast
Cut him down to zero
Oh Virginia, whence I came
I'll see you when I'm younger
And I'll know you by your hills again
This time from six feet under

Lo, the season may come
Lo, the season may go
One man is torn asunder
Will someday be made whole
When the master calls the roll

Though the storm clouds gather
Let the union be made whole
