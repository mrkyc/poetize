It's the right time, you know I feel fine tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
It's the right place, I've got my new face tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I'm in the right mood, I've got my new shoes tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I've got my new dress, I couldn't hurt less tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)

Somebody told you I was so cold and mean
(Who was that talking?)
Somebody wants you and don't want me in between
(She better start walking)
Somebody hurt you, but, baby, she wasn't me

Let's find a new name for such an old game tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I'll show you how long that I can go on tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I don't know why you don't want me

Just when I think that I can make it without you
You come around and say you want me now
You tell me "don't leave" and I want to believe you
Why can't you see just how much I need you?

Oh, it's the last chance for a romance tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)
There'll be no next time if you won't be mine tonight
(I don't know why you don't want me)

I don't know why you don't want me
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I don't know why you don't want me
(I don't know why you don't want me)
I don't know why you don't want me
