Weh the young gyal dem deh, weh bleaching fit you? Make your bumpa roll

When you see a gyal and her crew say, "Who let the Flintstones out?"
Yabba Dabba Doo!

Check Mr. Chin down a Town, get mi rubbings
Gyal a say, "Addi, you white out, and me love it!"
Link the thugs dem a Hannah Town side of Public
"Benz don't?" Me disguised inna Sunny

"Wha' you use?" Bio Claire with the Omic
If your elbow take long fi reach, rub a little curry pon the Fair & White, spend your bloodclaat money!
My youth, no matter how you drink roots...
Mouth water no breed gyal, a cocky juice!
Souls make your hood dead, no lovey-dovey

Addi Di Daddy inna your goal like Pele
Turn it backway, rev it out, *vroom vroom*!
Make your mother say, "Look wha' him do your pum pum!"

Third verse now, gyal, you're clean like a cheddar
Don't too walk out inna sunny weather

Face white, body black, rasclaat! It's a zebra?

Don't take no boost, don't take no peer pressure
Me no sorry fi you if you nae did a listen
Now your skin look like salt fish pon stretcher
My girl, you might get stretch mark if you rub the gel pon your body too hard
Watch how you paste pon your legs and your arms
If you rub your batty hole and your pussy, wear draws
