Bookey, feds dem ah move spookey

Mi a drive in from Grange Hill
With a pound a di marijuana
Police pull me over
Step to mi car,  "Officer, wah yuh want?"
Him say, "Wah dat mi smell pon you?
Wah dat green sumtin deh, ah nuh callaloo
Yuh must go a jail bwoy, what yuh gonna do?"
Mi light up mi weed and say

Squaddy, mi nah stop bun my ganja
So come put on di handcuff dem
Memba' mi must get bail, carry mi go jail
Ah in deh di high grade sell
Mr. Officer, low mi with di ganja
Mr. Officer, ah gun yuh fi look fa
Mr. Officer, nuh harass the Gaza
Mr. Officer

Mi rememba the first weed weh mi ah bun
When round mi ah 10
Mi haffi light it again and out it again
It's like a band ah play a riddim inna my head
It mek di place get dizzy and mi eye red
Instantly mi hungry nuh bloodclat
Mi haffi fuck up some crackers and a dry bread
With 2 bun wid ah bulla and ah fry egg
An when di kitchen empty mi go ah my bed
Mi tun big man, now use one light one
Any man try coke fi go try dead
Squaddy charge me and Bobo Shabba fi di weed
And seh to court we invited
But di judge advocate fi di herb
She dash out di case it's indited
And she love di smell when it lighted
And she style the police as a lightshead
