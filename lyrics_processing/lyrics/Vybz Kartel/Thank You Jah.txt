Psalms 127, Selah
"127:1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman watcheth but in vain."
Thank you, its just another day (Selah!)
Its just another day...
Oh!

Thank you Jah mi wake up this morning, roll out the herbs before me start yawning
Turn 'round, buss a kiss pon mi darling
Tell her say, "honey mi a touch inna di street"
In di street mi see poor people bawling, nuff juvenile d'even nyam from morning
Weh di black woman future, me asking?
Weh di system a do fi she?

Now
Big up di gyal dem weh fight it alone
And a raise two, three, pickney pon dem own
Weh di man deh? No man nuh deh home?
Babylon have dem inna jail (Mhmm)
Big up di juvenile dem inna di street
Weh a say, "dem haffi make it, and nah touch di chrome"
Them no waan we fi claim our own
But Africa nah form no fool inna Rome
You might also likeGhetto youth we go on and on (Babylon waan we gone)
Hungry from morning 'til night come
Them waan we fi live our life so
Them a wonder if di youth dem a go stop (No)
A wonder if di ghetto a go drop, (No)
Them a wonder if we catch inna di trap, (No)
A wonder if Jah turn him back, (No)

Thank you Jah mi wake up this morning
Stand up, and smile, Lord, when we see it storming
Mi vision say, better days coming
Every day that mi a pree...
Mi nuh see nuh job, nor no free education weh dem did promise
None of dem never give we nothing
It's like ghetto youths lost to di system
Every day that mi a pree
