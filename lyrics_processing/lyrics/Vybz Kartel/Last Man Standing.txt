Barber boy embarrass him fans, mi cya believe him run wid him bans
Him sing 1 tune 2 time, when Teacha run out wid a million songs
Gaza shub out the casket, so 2009 nuh mek nuh more plans
Shoot, mi shoot him in front of Adams, shot bite him like mad ants
Weh yuh dress up inna police suit for? Mi neva see nuh police man go war
Mi run out inna full camouflage, knapsack full a clip, 2 bloodclat SLR
Yuh bring 2000 man go Sting, an a jus' shorty mi bring
But when yuh see a pair a tings, you run like Usain a Beijing
