Ain't no stoppin' us now
We're on the move
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We've got the groove
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We're on the move
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We've got the groove

There's been so many things that's held us down
But now it looks like things are finally comin' around
I know we've got a long, long way to go
And where we'll end up
I don't know
But we won't let nothing hold us back
We're puttin' ourselves together
We're polishing up our act, well
And if you've ever been held down before
I know you refuse to be held down any more, well

Don't you let nothing, nothing
Nothing stand in your way
I want you to listen, listen
To every word I say
Every word I say

I know you know someone that has a negative vibe
And if you tryin' to make it, they only push you aside
They really don't have nowhere to go
Ask 'em where they're going
They don't know
But we won't let nothing hold us back
We gonna get ourselves together, come on
We gonna polish up our act, well
And if you've ever been held down before
I know you refuse to be held down any more, well

Don't you let nothing, nothing
Stand in your way
I want y'all to listen, listen
To every word I say
Every word I say
