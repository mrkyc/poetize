And I will always be your Lady Tee...
Touch me in the morning
Baby, I don't mind
You can make it all better
It's fine
Everywhere I go
In every face I see
Honey it reminds me
Of you and me
And if you think
I'm gonna love you baby
Then come on and hear me when I say...
You blow me away
Just like a summer breeze baby
You blow me away
Just like a warm wind
You blow me away
And I love you, sugar
Baby you know I do, swear I do
Beautiful dreamer
Helpless like a little baby
Feeling soft and shy
I won't let this golden chance
Pass me by
You can have me baby
You can have all of me
From my head down to my toes sugar
And all that's in between
And if you think I'm gonna be here, baby
Then come on and hear me when I say...
You might also likeYou blow me away
Just like a summer breeze

Beautiful dreamer do you hear me calling you?
Please, please baby
I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm hopeless romtantic just for you

Just let me tend to your every desire
Baby come on feel the fire
(Can you feel the fire, can you feel the fire and desire, can you feel the fire, sugar all night long?)
Sugar all night long, yes
There's nothing I won't do to please you baby
(Nothing for you, nothing for you that I wouldn't do)
I wanna be close to you, I wanna get next to you
And if you think I'm gonna be here baby
Then come on and hear me when I say...

No one else can ever love me like you do
No one else can ever touch my heart like you
