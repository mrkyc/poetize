Ooh-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

If I could paint a picture
Of the love I have inside
It would paint all of you and all of me
Without no thought of pride
Then maybe you would know
Exactly all the things I feel
Not just a maybe
Baby, I'm for real

'Cause I've been wishing on the stars and hoping
Just as it shoots across the sky
Searching for the so-called answers
That we're supposed to find in time
Holding you close, not letting go
Baby, I've got to let you know

Dear lover
I hope this letter finds you
Dear lover
And that it comes in time to say no, "C'est la vie"
Baby, dear lover, listen to me
You might also like
I could write your name out
Forever in the Hall of Fame
It would be history, no mystery
Not at all in vain
I'd quote a poet on a verse
That read when I was small
And write your name out
Across the sky in letters ten feet tall

'Cause I've been wishing on the rings of Saturn
Calling on Jupiter and Mars
Praying on ten zillion light years
To bring you closer to my heart
Holding you close, not letting go
Baby, I've got to let you know

Dear lover
I hope this letter finds you
Dear lover
That it comes in time to say no, "C'est la vie"
Baby, listen to me, darling

Baby, every word that I say
Baby, I'll give you my love, ooh
Baby, if you say you love me
I'll be right by your side
Dare anyone to try to take you from me all my life
Straight from my heart
(Dear lover)
Straight from my heart
(Dear lover)
Straight from my heart
(Dear lover) Dear lover, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh
(Dear lover) Ooh-woo
(Dear lover) Ooh-ooh-ooh, dear lover
(Dear lover) Dear lover, oh-oh-oh, straight, straight
(Dear lover) Straight from my heart, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh
(Dear lover) Dear lover, oh
