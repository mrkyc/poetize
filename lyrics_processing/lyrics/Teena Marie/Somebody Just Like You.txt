Who walks with an easy twist and who has good taste
Who has a suttle arrogance, Whos kiss can my me sigh
Somebody just like you
Somebody just like you
Hes got to have two eyes that lets me know he's lived
He's got to be funny and kind of sensitive
A gentle man with charisma, one kiss can make you die
Somebody just like you
Do you know someone out there for me like you
Somebody warm and tender
Somebody I can surrender to
Somebody baby Somebody just like you
Some one who knows how to touch me right
A man to love me, tonight's the night
For a strong man
A tender man
A real man's man, hey
Baby, let me love you, if you'd only let me try
I know you know I need it
And I 'll tell you why
Cause I need a man who's everything
Anticipation's high
For somebody just like you
Do you know some one out there for me like you
Somebody out there who's just for me
Somebody tender to set me free
Somebody baby just like you
A man to love me who's not afraid
A man to touch me don't make me wait
I need a strong man
A tender man
A real man's man
Baby can I blow your horn (once?)
Somebody to love me baby
Somebody baby Somebody just like you
Talking:
Uhh, I need a man that can handle me
And darling, that's not always an easy thing to do
You see, my attention span can be real short sometimes
So you gotta keep it in the mix
You know what I mean, you gotta rub me the right way
Cause I pull no punches sugar, this is lady T.K.O
Hitting hard, talking to you baby
But you can call me by my southern name, oh, it's Honey
Can you handle it, can you make it what it is now
Cause i need some excitement
I need a man that can make love to me all night long and still get up and go to work the next day
A gentle man, a tender strong man, a real man's man
I need a man that likes a little adventure from time to time, yes
Somebody that will take me up in a hot air balloon and make frantic love to me
Oh, do you wanna kiss me as much as I wanna kiss you
Danger, I gonna hyperventilate, let's run the red light
Somebody, Somebody just like you
So what do you think baby? I mean honestly
Do you think you might be able to fill the bill
Oh, please don't please don't kiss my eyelids like that. Please don't.....Oh, my neck
Please don't suck on my earlobes like that
