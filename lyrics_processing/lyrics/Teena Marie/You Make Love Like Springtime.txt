Ha
Yo quiero hacer amor
Je ne sais quoi
I love you

Early morning whispers to me unaware
I awake to fingers floating softly through my hair
Paradise, this feeling, being lost inside of you
An adventure in the raw, a phantasm for two

You say you love me with your eyes
My heart soars up to the skies
And it's all so crazy
What you do to me, baby

You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion
You make love like springtime even when love's not in fashion
You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion
You make love like springtime even when love's not in fashion

I love you so and I can't let go of you
Ooh, la-la, ooh-la, baby, ooh, la-la, oui
Ooh, la-la, ooh-la, baby, ooh, la-la, oui
Ooh, la-la, ooh-la, baby, ooh, la-la, oui (Ooh, la-la, oui)
Ooh, la-la, ooh-la, baby, ooh, la-la, oui (Ooh, la, oui)

Poetry in motion, teach me, spirit dove
No words need be spoken, I know what you're dreaming of
Like this song, I wear your love like heaven on my breast
Rainbow colors all so pure, I feel like I've been blessed

You say you love me with your eyes
My heart soars up to the skies
And it's all so crazy
What you do to me, baby

You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion

You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion
