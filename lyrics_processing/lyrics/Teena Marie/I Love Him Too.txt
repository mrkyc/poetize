Oh, wow, I don't believe this
There's a new girl in town
Is your name De De O'Neal?
Yeah, that's me
They call me Cognac
You know you've got a lot of nerve coming up in here in my party
Oh, no disrespect, Miss Teena
Evidently, you've got something to say to me
So say it, girl
Bring it

What makes you think I'm peace enough to stand by
Huh, and let you take my man from me
And what makes you so sure that he's in love with you?
'Cause anytime he wants to (Anytime he wants to), ooh, ooh
He's making love to me
You feeling me? (Do you feel me when I say that?)

You're just a young girl
With stars in your eyes
I don't think you even understand it, De De
Or that you realize
I give him all my precious time
And maybe I've been a bit too blind
But for last seven years or so, you see
(Seven years or so)
He's been making love to me
Do you understand me?
(Just in case you haven't heard me)
You might also like
I love him too
(I love him, I love him, love him)
Just as much if not maybe more than you do
Don't be no fool
And I love him too
(I love him, I love him, love him)
And if you think I'm gon' give him up
Then you're a fool
(Don't be foolin')

You better think about the consequences
You better think about the mind and common senses
You better think about the things that I convey
And you better think about my child that's on the way, hey, hey
You better think about the lovin' game, I'm not here to play
You better think of right now you're in my domain
You better think
And stop leaving it all up to trust 'cause
(Leave it up to trust)
He's been making love to us
What a revelation
(Can't you get what I've been saying?)

And I love him too
(I love him, I love him, love him)
Just as much if not maybe more than you do
Don't be no fool
And I love him too
(I love him, I love him, love him)
And if you think I'm gon' give him up
You've lost a screw
Don't be no fool
(Don't be foolin')
Listen, you'd better think again, girl
(You'd better think again)
You'd better think again
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, you'd better think again, sister girl
(You'd better think again)
You'd better think again
'Cause I love that man right, hey
Don't you know he's mine
And if I haven't broke it down entirely to you, dear
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then let me make this crystal clear
Just so you know where I'm coming from
(Woman to woman) Woman to woman

Yeah, yeah, I, I love him too (I love him)
(I love him, I love him, love him)
(I love him too)
Just as much if not maybe more than you do
Don't be a fool
And I love him too, yeah
(I love him, I love him, love him)
And if you think I'm gon' give him up
You're a fool
(Don't be foolin')
You better think again about the consequences
(You better think again)
You better think again about the mind and common senses
You better think again about the things that I say
(You better think again)
