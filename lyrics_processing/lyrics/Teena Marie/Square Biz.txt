Hee...
Everybody get up

Flashback, who's that dancing to the latest?
Suave de bone, the greatest, ooh, he sure is moving me
That's what I said, though you didn't know yet
All of it was kismet, soon to be made history

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talking Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking love that is
Square, Square Biz

Square, Square Biz
I'm talking love
That is, that is, that is Square Biz
You might also like
So shy, oh my, had to change that real quick
Had to use a few tricks, you know like my femme fatale
Phase two, me, you dancing on a cloud
I'm gonna sing it loud 'cause my love is on the wow

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

Joy upon our faces sent from up above
Bombs burst, fireworks, big production thing
I'm talking horns and strings, orchestration is my love

Baby, what's happening? Entre vous Lady Tee
I've heard a boatload of others ladies' raps
But they ain't got nothing on me
I'm less than five-foot-one, a hundred pounds of fun
I like sophisticated funk
I live on Dom Perignon, caviar, filet mignon
And you can best believe that's bunk
Here's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, huh, huh, Square Biz
I've been called Casper, Shorty, Lil' Bit
And some they call me Vanilla Child
But you know that don't mean my world to me
'Cause baby, names can't cramp my style
(I love chick-icken) And plus collard greens
A little hot water cornbread
I love you, too, Cat daddy
But don't you let that go to your head
That's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz
You know I like spirituals and rock
Sarah Vaughn, Johann Sebastian Bach
Shakespeare, Maya Angelou
And Nikki Giovanni just to name a few
Well, I'm wild and peaceful Lady Tee
I gots to keep my irons in the fire, you see
I got the point, the scam, the low, the deal
What you feel, say what?

Flashback, who's that? (Flashback)
Flashback, who's that? (Flashback)

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talking Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking love that is
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz

Well, everybody's dancing on the Tee
Jackie, Jill, and Mick, and Lady Tee
