Love is gonna take you out
Can't you see?
Love will make you stay out all night long
Away from me
Love will make you say the sweetest things
Now you're talking crazy (gangsta)
Love is a pocket watch, solid gold
Always runs a little late
Kinda cold
Love will have you stranded on the corner
In the rain
That's what happens when the hunter's captured
By the game (gangsta)
Love is a gangsta
Love is the ultimate Don, it's a gangsta
It's the black and white keys on a piano
And an O-G singing soul
Love is a gangsta
Love is the Valentine's Massacre Gangsta
Have you actin' kinda shady, making lots of babies
Playing with the ladies' heads, oh
Love is a Marvin Gaye, hear the call
Baby you sure love to play, "Love to ball"
Love is gonna soothe the savage beast
Hear me now
Before I put you right back on your leash
'Cause you been foul
Love is a natural
Nice and round
Foxy just like Ms. Pam Grier
Pretty and brown
Love will have you sexing all night long
'Cause you're the man
Now you're laying up in the cut
With the upper hand (Gangsta)

Love is a pintstripe suit-wearing gangsta
A machine gun in a violin case
Take you here and take you there
Love is a gangsta
A bootleg liquored up gangsta
Gets no better than this, has an iron-clad fist
It's a diamond tiara, a gangsta
Love'll make you come home early, (early)
Make you stay out all night long, (all night long, gangsta)
Love'll make you do some things, (some things)
Baby that you know is wrong, (know is wrong, gangsta)
Love'll have you stranded out on Crenshaw, (Crenshaw)
Crying the blues there in the rain, (in the rain, gangsta)
Make you forget who you are, where you going
Where you came from baby
Now you're feeling so much pain (so much pain, gangsta)
Love'll have you crawling 'round your carpet (crawling)
Searching for your rock cocaine (cocaine, gangsta)
Make you forget to count your blessings (blessings)
Knowing God's love will sustain (sustain), ooh
Love is a gangsta
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta
Machine gun in a violin case
Take you here and take you there
Love is a gangsta
A bootleg liquored up gangsta
Have you actin kinda shady, making lot's of babies
Playing with the ladies' heads
Be careful 'bout the company that you keep
Or you might just end up loosing sleep
Paying the price that most of us will find too steep
And in the end you're right back on the street
Love is an O-G gangsta
A diamond tiara, a gangsta
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta
A platinum chain, it's a gangsta
Love is an O-G gangsta
A diamond tiara, a gangsta
The ultimate Don, it's a gangsta
