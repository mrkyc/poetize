Thug life

Thug life

Twenty-two dubs up in the sky
Spread your angelwings and fly
A comet soars across the sky
Sent to give the whole earth light

Brother, I ain't mad cause you made my body shake
Came and went so fast, you might need a resolution
Reasons for my life and the places that I've seen
Rollin' with my crew keeps me rockin' till tomorrow

Makavelli never lied
Throw your hands up say "He's for real"
And Aaliyah never lied
Lemme hear you holla now "She's for real"
Mom and commy never lied
Give it up for heartbeat, props for real
And Stevie Wonder never lied
Talk about the prophet now he's for real
You might also like
Told you he was ride or die
Made you laugh and made you cry
I'm gonna count from one to ten
And dust it off and try again

Sister, I ain't mad cause you made my body shake
Came and went so fast and I need a resolution
Reasons for my life, feeling all my deepest grace
Rollin' with my crew keeps me rockin' keep me rockin'

Makavelli never lied
Throw it up, your hands, say "He's for real"
And Joni Mitchell never lied
Lemme me hear ya holla now "She's for real"
And India Arie never lied
Give it up ya heartbeat, props for real
And Bob Marley never lied
Talk about the prophet now he's for real

Pretty beauty please don't go
Stay and satisfy my soul
Make me high when I feel low
What's this need for neo-soul
Blessed are the righteous ones
Pure and heartened peaceful ones
Know that when your life is done
Heaven, it lasts always

Brother I ain't mad cause you made my body shake
Came and went so fast and I need a resolution
Reasons for my life and the fine lines on my face
Rollin' with my crew keeps me rockin' till tomorrow

Makavelli never lied
Throw it up, your hands, say "he's for real"
And Marvin Gaye would never lie
Lemme hear ya holla now "he's for real"
And Lauryn Hill would never lie
Give it up, the heartbeat, props for real
And you and I would never lie
Talk about the things we truly feel

Makavelli never lied
Throw it up, your hands, say he's for real
And John Lennon never lied
Lemme hear ya holla now he's for real
Chaka-kan would never lie
Give it up the heartbeat, props for real
And Jesus Christ would never lie
Talk about the prophet, now he's for real
Buffalo soldier here I come
Left us his redemption song
And joy is found from within
How sweet my soul aquariums
Beautiful ones gone too soon
Would you go back to the moon (Never)
To the stars where angels host
And to the one who loves ya most?
Infinitely, talking bout eternity
They never lie
Forever, forever
Never lie
