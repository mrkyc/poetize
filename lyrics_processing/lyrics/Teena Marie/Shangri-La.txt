Your love takes me
Higher than I've ever been before
You keep on, get off, darling
Shangri-La
Shangri-La

Orange marmalade, chocolate coated candy kisses
When my castle smiles
My heart beats and then it misses

Can I break it down in your corner?
Love will find you, love will blind you
So, take me with you, baby
Satisfaction and plenty of good times for you only
But don't be lonely, I'm gonna take you, lover

Down by the sea where the sand meets the Shangri-La
We can make some more pretty memories
Under the stars where I'll beg you for Shangri-La
And your milky way is so heavenly
You might also like
Heaven, here on earth, for my fortune, it implores you
Never set me free, simply said, "Ooh, I adore you"
And you give me, baby
Ice cream, sandwiches, cherry hugs you hold me so close, yeah, yeah
Sipping Beaujolais, to your love I make the first toast

Can I break it down in your corner?
Love will find you, love will blind you
So take me with you, baby
Satisfaction and plenty of good times for you only
But don't be lonely, I'm gonna take you, lover

Down by the sea where the sand meets the Shangri-La
We can make some more pretty memories
Under the stars where I'll beg you for Shangri-La
And your milky way is so heavenly

Turn yourself around, won't you let me love you down
Where the galaxy caresses you
It could be fun, and when it's done
You'll say the words I want to hear
Keep on, get off, lover, lover, lover
Shangri-La
We can make some more pretty memories
Under the stars, baby, Shangri-La
And your milky way is so heavenly

Keep on, get off, darling
Keep on, get off, lover
Keep on, get off, sugar
Keep on, get off, baby
Keep on, get off, darling
Keep on, get off, lover
Keep on, get off, sugar
Keep on, keep on, get off
Baby, get off
