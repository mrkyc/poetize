I was on my way from church
I met a guy named Youngblood
Who was totally berserk
He told me he was looking for a place to lay his head
I read him Romans 8:13
And this is what he said
"Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go
I got plenty of blow
And it's more fun doing wrong"
"The ladies call me lover 'cause I got the gift of gab
And a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me"
He said, "I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out and ooo"
He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
Freaky party, party, freaky party
I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
(I'm not gonna help)
I don't want to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
You might also likeI can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
Knowing there was no contentment in two eyes so blind
I told him how the joy would surely bring eternal bliss
I read Galatians Chapter 4
And he said, "Baby, check this"
"Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on, girl, it's wide
It's a long way to slide
And it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me baby 'cause I've got a killer smile
And they love my smoothy touch
Only time will tell if there's Heaven or Hell
Or if I'm just out to lunch
He said, "I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out and ooo"
He asked me to help, Youngblood get to the freaky party
Freaky party, party, freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
(I'm not gonna help)
I don't want to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on, girl, get live
It's a much hipper vibe
It's more fun doing wrong
And the ladies call you lover 'cause you got a killer smile
And they love your smoothy touch
But all that you have done, you can tell to the one
Who has given you so much
He said, "I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out and ooo"
He asked me to help, Youngblood get to the freaky party
Freaky party, party, freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party, yeah
No, no, I'm not gonna help
Won't get me to help
Oh, I refuse to help, you won't get me to
Say, Youngblood, David Lawrence is
Gonna help you get to the freaky party
Play, baby.  Owww
I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
Knowing there was no contentment in two eyes so blind
I told him how the joy would surely bring eternal bliss
I read Galatians Chapter 4
And they said
"Blood, check this"
