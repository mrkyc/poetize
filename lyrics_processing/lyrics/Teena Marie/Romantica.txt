Romantica
I'll always be so hopelessly romantic
Just like the wind, baby, the earth, the sky
And you and I made magic

What about me, baby?
Will I live my life alone?
No one to comfort me
Must I sing for everyone?
Was that a kiss I felt
Soft on my cheek just then?
Did you awaken me?
And where did it all begin?
How can I time travel?
Must I encapsulate?
All that we ever were
The sand, the sea, the shore and fate?
I'm riding in your rocket
You crash me back to earth
I cried when Steveland sang
"And do you have angel wings?"

Romantica
Just like Heaven works of wonders
Two passing ships in the night
Two restless lovers
Romantica
To the stars you must surrender
So take your place as you return to forever
Return to forever, my love
My love
You might also like
What about you?
Are you sleeping with the angels now?
And are you making music?
Did you take a sacred vow
To be an altar boy?
And do you ring the bells?
I hear you're with your mother
Yes, and she too is well
I have my memories (I have my memories)
As I lay here in my bed
Oh, how we danced those nights
On those days when we were wed
I'm happy for you now
So happy that you're free
Ours was an epic tale
Sung through eternity

Romantica
Just like Heaven works of wonders
Two passing ships in the night
Two star-crossed lovers
Romantica
Now your soul you must surrender
So take your place
As you return to forever
Return to forever, my love
My love
They say I'll see you again but I know
That's intangible
Why must I keep wanting things that I know
Are not haveable?
Why is the earth so still?
Is it that surreal?
Has your cup been filled?
Will I grow old gracefully?

Romantica
I'll always be so hopelessly romantic
Just like the wind, the earth, the sky
And you and I were magic
Romantica
I'll always be so hopelessly romantic
Just like the wind, baby, the earth, the sky
