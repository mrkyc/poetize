You know, baby
We go back a long way
It hasn't always been easy, you know
I mean, you living on the East Coast
And me living on the West Coast
It's tearing me apart
We've got to stop meeting like this

Try to understand
When I say how much I care
It hurts me so inside, each time we say goodbye
And it's so unfair

And I've cried, yes, I've cried
As I face my calendar
I mark red X's off, and with each tear that drops
Baby, it gets harder to bear

'Cause your love could send a rocket up to the moon
Your love hit me just like a lead balloon
So let's make a wish
Seal it with a kiss, my baby
You know we've got to stop meeting like this
You might also like
Try to understand
Our long distance love affair has gotten out of hand
It's more than I can stand
Ooh, girl, this I swear

And it hurts, yes, it hurts
Baby, as I face my calendar
I mark red X's off, and with each tear that drops
Baby, it gets harder to bear

Your love could send a rocket up to the moon
Your love hit me just like a lead balloon
So let's make a wish
Seal it with a kiss, my baby, yeah
You know we've got to stop meeting like this

Can you find a way to say goodbye without really saying goodbye?
Can you make it easier on me?
Can you stop these tears I cry?
Baby, I can only try
Can you find a reason why love shouldn't die?
I hear what you're saying
And my love will be waiting
I hear (I hear) what you're saying
And my love will be here
After your other lovers fall
If you'll only stop (Woo-hoo) meeting like this, baby
You know we've got to stop, my love
This hurting in our hearts, my love
I've been blind, so blind, so blind, baby
Time after time
You know we've got to stop it, baby, yeah
Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-hoo
Know we've got to stop, my baby
I've been going crazy, out of my mind
Time after time
