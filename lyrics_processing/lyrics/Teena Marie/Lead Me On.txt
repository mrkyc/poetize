Turn around to see you in a crowded place
I watch for the emotions on a guarded face
Saying, "Lead me on"

Victim of a dream and a memory
But when I try to break free
You say to me, "Come on, lead me on"

A matter out of time in the reaches of space
Caught up in the patterns in the light of a life
Walk across the bridge to the shadows of the night

Saying, "Lead me on" (Lead me on)
Lead me on (On, on, on)
Lead me on (Lead me on)
On and on (On, on)
Lead me on

Voices in the night chase the demons away
Looking in the mirror, it's easy to say
"Lead me on"
You might also like
The choices of a lifetime
In the dreams of a day
When the coast is getting clearer
I hear you say, "Come on and lead me on"

A matter out of time in the look on your face
Caught up in the patterns in the light of a life
Walk across the bridge to the shadows of the night

Saying, "Lead me on" (Lead me on)
Lead me on (On, on, on)
Lead me on (Lead me on)
On and on (On, on)
Lead me on

Talk to me of lightning
I'll hear what you say, my love
(Hear the words you say)
Reaching for the meaning, it's all of the way
I can keep believing in you and me, my love
(You and me, my love)
Oh, finding the answers that we need
Sometimes it's meant to be
Oh, lead me on (Lead me on)
Turn around to see you in a crowded place
I watch for the emotions as they cross your face
Saying, "Lead me on"

I see you in a dream and a memory
A captive of the light
You say to me, "Come on and lead me on" (Lead me on)

Come on and lead me on (On, on and on)
Come on and lead me on (Lead me on)
Lead me on (On, on and on)
Lead me on (Lead me on)
Lead me on (On, on and on)
Come on and lead me on (Lead me on)
Lead me on (On, on and on)
