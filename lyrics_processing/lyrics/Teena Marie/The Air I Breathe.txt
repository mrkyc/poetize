Your hand reached out to shelter me
Now no reasons have I more to weep
For love was everything you touched
And wanting to give back as much
Silence now is golden when you sleep
You know you are my baby and deep inside your dreams
Yes I'd like to fly - never more to cry
You're the greatest joy I've ever known within my life
You're the air I breathe
You're the songs I sing
You're the rain that makes the roses grow
The earth beneath my feet
The wind and waving wheat
You're the air I breathe so now you know
That I can't live without you baby
Baby I would die without your love
Morning brings a brand new song
Playing for you all along
Melody and lyric you must know
That somewhere cross the galaxies
Was planned a greater destiny
A time to reap and then a time to sow
You know you are my passion and deep inside of you
Yes I'd like to fly - never more to cry
You are the greatest joy I've ever known within my life
You're the air I breathe
You're the songs I sing
You're the rain that makes the roses grow
The earth beneath my feet
The wind and waving wheat
You're the air I breathe so now you know
That I can't live without you baby
Baby I would die without your love
Like autumn changes leaves to gree
Like winter calls to spring
Like roses need the rain to grow
And just like rivers flow
I will always love you
You are the very air I breathe
My life, my love, my heaven and my all
And no one could ever change w0hat God intend
I wished upon a star and here you are
And I wouldn't last a day without you
Just like autumn changes leaves to green
You're my winter, summer, fall and spring
Everything I am
