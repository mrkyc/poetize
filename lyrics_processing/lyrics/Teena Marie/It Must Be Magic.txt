Whee
You are under my power, it is the power of love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh

You say my kisses taste like magic (Well, stop)
That's got to be the classic line
Please, no, no presto change-o now that I'm in love, baby
'Cause that would really blow my mind
I'd pull a rabbit out my hat or cross a black cat's path to find you
And darling, you can best believe there's nothing up my sleeve
But love (It must be magic, must be magic, must be magic)

It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic), got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic)

Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
Keep workin' my love, such a magical feeling
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it
(Tilt me) It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (It must be magic, baby)
Oh ('Cause it feels so good)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (It must be magic, baby)
Oh ('Cause it feels so good)
You might also like
You say you know I got the potion (Well, stop)
No, baby, don't stop, don't you dare (Don't you stop it, baby, don't you dare)
Aladdin, Houdini and Merlin The Magician
To you, they never could compare
I see no long black flowing cape, yet still, I can't escape
Those two eyes (When I look in your eyes)
And we don't need no crystal ball 'cause we have said it all
In love (It must be magic, must be magic, must be magic)

It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic), got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic)

Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
Keep workin' my love, such a magical feeling
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it
I can't get enough of it, of it, no, no, no

It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic), got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), our good fortune, I can tell, baby
It must be magic 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, got me love, got me lovin' you
It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, got me love, got me lovin' you
Teena went to Wonderland, the plot is getting thick (Ooh, magic)
Met the king of Punk Funk and he taught her all the tricks
She feels the heat, there's magic in her feet
Now she's groovin', always movin' to the funky beat
Under your spell, ooh, it must be magic
Under your spell, what is it? What is it?
Under your spell, ooh, it must be magic
What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?

It must be magic 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, our good fortune I can tell, baby
It must be magic, we're gonna take it to the top
It must be magic, don't you let the magic stop
It must be magic, got me love, got me lovin' you
Got me love, got me lovin' you (Got me love, got me lovin' you)
It must be magic 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic 'cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic, Temptations, sing

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh (It must be magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh (It must be magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh (Baby must be a magician, 'cause he's sure got the magic touch)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh (It must be magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  (Baby must be a magician, 'cause he's sure got the magic touch)
Oh
