Yeah, I'm your bee charmer, Lady Tee
But you can call me by my southern name, it's Honey
Too hip, got to go
Seems I got your honey call
Going to let the love flow
Nice and slow, let it go
Baby from the get-go
You'll be hitting oh
To and fro indigo
Up all night like no doze
Going to blow the solo
Sweet and low sexy flow
Taste like amaretto
Cause that's the way I roll
(Got cha honey call)
Got a honey call
(I'm coming at you with the quickness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give you all my sweetness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give it to you, baby)
Got a honey call
(Because your loving makes me crazy)

You don't have to be shy
Going to make you sigh sigh
Amplifier real high
Hotter than July
You'll be saying "my my"
Standing by, give the eye
Get a little comply
Maybe be your ally
Pass you by
Don't you cry
For you I would die die
On this you can rely
(Got cha honey call)
Got a honey call
(I'm coming at you with the quickness)

(Hit me on cellular phone)
(You can buzz me in my honey comb)
Honey comb
(It's sweet and sticky right down to the bone)
To the bone
(It's on and cracking do you feel me?)
(Cause it's happening, now!)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm your sweet sticky thing
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Busy little bee
I'm going to give it:
I'm going to give it to you
(Ain't nothing sweeter than my stuff, baby)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
You like my honey very sweet
Super fine
? wine
When you give the high sign
Tasting like a fine wine
Turpentine down my spine
Clinging like a grapevine
When we do the slow grind
?
You'd be mine
Flowing like my lifeline
Make me feel like moonshine
I'll recline
We confine(?)
I'm trying not to get mine
I'm going to take my time
(Got cha honey call)

(I'm coming at you with the quickness)
Got a honey call
(I'm going to give you all my sweetness)
All of my sweetness

Give it to, baby
