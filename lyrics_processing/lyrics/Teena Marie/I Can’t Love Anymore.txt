I can't love anymore
Ever since the day you've been gone
My heart has turned into an empty shell
Look at me, I can't love anymore
I can't love anymore
Kisses they just don't feel the same
They love me and I leave them in tears and in pain
I never was like this before

And if I knew that long ago I would feel this much sorrow
Without you by my side
If you'd been more of a man, tried more to understand
Instead of hiding behind your pride
And now my heart is broken (My heart is broken)
And I'm in misery

And baby, I, I can't love anymore
And darling, I, I can't love, I can't love anymore
You have taken the best part of me, baby
Hoo, ooh, ooh

I can't love anymore
Something deep inside me has died
My heart has been broken, and maybe that's why
I can't love anymore
You might also likeI can't love anymore
Words I thought I never would say
If love is just a game then I don't want to play
Ever again in my life

And if I knew that long ago I would feel this much sorrow
Without you by my side
If you'd been more of a man, tried more to understand
Instead of hiding behind your pride
And now my heart is broken (My heart is broken)
And I'm in misery

And baby, I, I can't love anymore
And baby, I, I can't love anymore
And darling, I, I can't love anymore
And I cannot, I can't love anymore

Can't love anymore
You have taken the best part of me, baby
(Can't love anymore)
Baby, can't you see I'm crying?
Have mercy, baby
You left me alone and I feel, I think I'm dying
(Can't love anymore)
Ooh, I'm down on my knees
Come on back, come on back
(Can't love anymore, can't love anymore)
Come on back, baby
(Can't love anymore, can't love anymore)
I can't love anymore, baby
Please, ooh, oh baby, baby, baby
You see, you see I'm crying
I'm down on my knees
(Can't love anymore, can't love anymore)
