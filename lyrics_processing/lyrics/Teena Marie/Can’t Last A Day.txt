If the sun in the sky disappeared from view
If the love in my heart baby wasn't true
If the rivers and seas all just up and dry
If the moon pass away from the deep blue sky
If I lost all my faith in the Higher Power
Tell me where would I be in the final hour
I'll be losing my way baby I'd be through
Cause I can't last a day honey without you
Can't last a day baby without your love
(Can't last a day)
Can't even last one day without your love
(Can't last a day)
Can't last a day baby without your love
(Can't last a day)
Can't even last one day without your love
Look at me baby
Thinking that I'm real cool
Thinking that I can keep from calling
To talk to you
Filling my days with
Things to occupy my mind
My mental state's playing tricks on me
But my body never lies
Trust when I tell you
Baby your love is king
I'll be alright 'til you come back
But I wish you'd never leave
Losing the battle
What's up with my defense?
Can't last a day without you
This don't make no sense
You might also like(Chorus)
Don't need your touch
(I don't need your touch)
Don't need your voice (your voice)
Don't need your hands (baby)
Can't last a day
Don't need your arms
(I don't need your arms)
Wrapped around me
(Wrapped around me, baby)
Don?t need your lovin?
(I don't need your lovin')
Can?t last a day (Can?t last a day)
Faith
Don't need your lovin'
Don't need your candy kiss
Don't need your voice to remind me
These are all the things I miss
Feels kinda crazy
When my love's coming down
I try not to listen baby
But my heartbeat starts to pound
Hot like the summer
Sweet like the morning dew
I need you like the four seasons
With each day comes I love you
Where has my faith gone?
You hold it in your hands
Guess I should learn to trust you
Cause I need you baby, baby
(Chorus)
Don't need your touch
Don't need your voice (your voice)
Don't need your hands (your hands)
Can't last a day, don't need your arms (unh, unh, unh, baby)
Wrapped around me, don't need your lovin' (I don't need your arms, I don't need your lovin' baby)
Can't last a day (baby, baby, baby, baby)
Teena (repeat 1st verse)
If the sun in the sky disappeared from view
And the love in my heart baby wasn't true
If the rivers and seas all just up and dry
If the moon pass away from the deep blue sky
If I lost all my faith in the Higher Power
Tell me where would I be in the final hour
I'll be losing my way baby I'd be through
Cause I can't last a day honey without you
(Chorus)
Don't need your touch
Don't need your voice
Don't need your hands (Baby), can't last a day (I can't last a day)
Don't need your arms, (your arms)
Wrapped around me (wrapped me baby)
Don't need your lovin' (I can't last a day)
Can't last a day (Baby, I can't last a day)
Faith and Teena alternate per 2 lines:
Faith: If I reach over table boy to grab you
Faith: Would you tell that you love me can I have you?
Would you be my baby and my one and only?
Would you try to kiss me back or leave me lonely?
Would you wrap your arms around me keep laughing?
Tell the other ladies I'm the one that's happening
Would you tell the truth or will I have to doubt you?
Would you listen? I can't last a day without you
Together:
Trust me when I tell you baby
Teena:
Baby, your love is king
I'll be alright 'til you come back
But I wish you'd never leave
Faith:
Losing the battle, what's up with my defense?
Together:
Can't last a day without you
Cause I need you baby
(Chorus)
Don't need your touch (I don't need your touch)
Don't need your voice (I don't need your voice)
Don't need your hands (baby)
Can't last a day (I can't last a day without you)
Don't need your arms (your arms)
Your arms wrapped around me, baby
Don't need your lovin'
