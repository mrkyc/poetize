Every time you come around
I feel my world starts turning topsy-turvy
And I just can't fight the spinning
Baby, won't you listen to this love
Whose heart's been missing and don't hurt me
'Cause I'm falling your way again

Am I weak?
Well, sometimes I just can't hardly speak
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you've got me singing

Ooh la la la
It's the way that you feel when you know it's real
Ooh la la la
It's the warm that's inside when you're satisfied
Ooh la la la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooh la la la
Let's stay together, oh

I can see it there
That look upon your face is saying love's in making
Boy, I know what's on your mind
Love is for the lasting
And it's yours just for the asking, for the taking
'Cause I'm falling your way this time
You might also like
Do I thrill?
Well, sometimes I get subliminal chills
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you've got me singing

Ooh la la la
It's the take to the sky on a natural high
Ooh la la la
It's the heaven that's sent when your heart's content
Ooh la la la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooh la la la
Let's stay together

Ooh la la la, don't ever go
'Cause I love you so, I love you so, baby
Ooh la la la, don't ever go
'Cause I'll surely die if you ever say goodbye, my baby
You got me falling
Falling for you, falling with you
Falling to you, falling after you
Falling, ooh, sweet thing, you've got me singing
Ooh la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing, oh, you've got me singing
Ooh la la la
It's the way that you feel when you know it's real
Ooh la la la
It's the warm that's inside when you're satisfied
Ooh la la la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooh la la la
Let's stay together (Ooh)
Ooh la la la (Ooh-ooh, sweet, ooh)
Ooh la la la (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh la la la (Ooh, ooh, sweet thing)
Ooh la la la (Ooh)

You know, everybody
Sometimes you should just stop
And take some time out to tell the one you love
Just how much they mean to you
Because, you see, sometimes the needs of the one
Outweigh the needs of the many
And if you understand what I'm talking about
Let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Oh, I'm giving up to you
I said I'm falling (Ooh la la la)
