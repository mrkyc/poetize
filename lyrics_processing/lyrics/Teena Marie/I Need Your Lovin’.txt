Love's fever comin' on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame, no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talkin' pressures or material gains

But M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I'll never understand what people's heads are in, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do
(Just a little love)
Just a little lovin' this will do
(La-la-la-la)
Just a little lovin' this will do
(L-O-V-E, love)
Just a little lovin', me and you
You might also like
Love's comin', so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
Easy feelin' though your love keeps getting better
Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

'Cause M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my bones that you and I can win, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin', and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin', or just a little time
I need your lovin', and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin', or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin' this will do
(Just a little love)
Just a little lovin' this will do
(La-la-la-la, la-la)
Just a little lovin' this will do
(La-la-la-la-la)
Just a little lovin', me and you

L-O-V-I-N (My baby), I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do
L-O-V-I-N (My baby), I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do

'Cause M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my third eye, love will never end, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin', and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin', or just a little time
I need your lovin', and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin', or just a little time
I need your lovin', yeah
I need your lovin', or just a little time
I need your lovin', and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin', or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do
(Baby, me and you, yeah)
Just a little lovin', me and you
(I just need your lovin')
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

L-O-V-I-N, I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do
L-O-V-I-N (My baby), I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do
I need your lovin'
I need your lovin'


Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you
L-O-V-I-N, my baby love me
And I love my baby back
Ha, is that enough love?
