You like your candy very sweet
You're a classy little dame, with sophisticated game
And you know all of the best restaurants to eat, uh-huh

I'll take you any place, fit into your time and space
That's why I chose to make you mine, uh-huh

Times may get rough, but I know there's enough
Enough freaky love when my love tumbles down, baby, doo-wah-wah
