Yeah yeah

Days keep ticking by
But memories never die
Still waiting for you to come home
Can't change it if I tried
I always wonder why
When all this time I should've known

Memories fade, but you stay the same
Never singing what you know
I can't read into everything
Tell me, where's your heart of gold?

I need a little sunshine, baby
Don't want no maybe
I'm missing you tonight
You know you got me going crazy
A love so hazy
This ain't no paradise
I need a little sunshine, sunshine, sunshine in my life
I need a little sunshine, sunshine, sunshine in my life
You might also like
Drifting like the wind
You couldn't let me in
You always running alone
I had you by my side
No need to run and hide
Don't do this, not on your own

Memories fade, but you stay the same
Never singing what you know
I can't read into everything
Tell me, where's your heart of gold?

I need a little sunshine, baby
Don't want no maybe
I'm missing you tonight
You know you got me going crazy
A love so hazy
This ain't no paradise
I need a little sunshine, sunshine, sunshine in my life
I need a little sunshine, sunshine, sunshine in my life

Rain keeps pouring down
The night is getting colder
I'll keep waiting it out
Until the Summer's over
I got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand
Got this feeling on demand

I need a little sunshine, baby
Don't want no maybe
I'm missing you tonight
You know you got me going crazy
A love so hazy
This ain't no paradise
I need a little sunshine, sunshine, sunshine in my life
