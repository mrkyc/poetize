Comeen like some Benz some Lexus and some bimmer
And the jeep weh dem call Omega
The gal sey them need a good plumber
Lord have mercy
And dem should know, well
(Chorus:)
Gal dem have di face
Gal dem have the figure
Remind me of the Benz, the Lexus and the bimmer
To have this girl would be my pleasure
She is so precious like the gold inna mi treasue, again
Gal dem have di face, an dem have di figure
Remind me of the Benz, the Lexus and the bimmer
To have this girl would be my pleasure
She more precious that the diamond in mi treasure an den mi sey...
(Verse 1:)
Di gal deem mek mi body tense
Dem look like some Lexus some bimmer an some Benz
A good body gal mi waan fi feature mi ends
Look like some boy need some contact lens
Boy dem chase di gal while a dem mi a defend
Well woman is a mus, a nuh pretend mi a pretend
Boy a ack like star, gal a ask from when
Styling up the gal some way as skettel
Model wid yuh shape, mek di punk head swell
Gal dem nuh stoop low, dem never yet sell
The Killer sey, unno fi pop style Michelle
Mi sey

(Verse 2:)
Look pon di gal dem shape
Wid di face, di gal dem round like grape
Yuh try nuh have no intention fi rape
Try ask and get first an tek
Tings like that we naw go preciate
Yuh move any gal mountain, so longs yuh have faith
Yuh Mr punk who love aggregate
Pon di hol topic yuh fi concentrate, mi sey
(Chorus x2)
(Verse 3:)
This is a straight statement
Gal dem look so good, dem look like ornament
Sinting to keep without cost treatment
Skin soft and smooth don't need ointment
Dem intelligent with a smoooth accent
Dem dress normal though dem well decent
Genorosity, a hol heap a patience
An when inna di cowd dem can stan
Dem can stan fi dem self
