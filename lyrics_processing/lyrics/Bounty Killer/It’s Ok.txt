Sincerely
I know she can hear me (I know she can)
From my heart, I'm saying I'm sorry, my dear
(From my heart way down)
I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done, and all the pain I caused
But two hearts become one, and that's a bond
I need you in my life, not as a memory (Lady!)
I need you to be there to journey (Gyal!)
Needs like my love attorney... (My baby!)
Huh!

My eyes can see more clear as long as you're standing there
Seems like I'm in a dream or things aren't the way they seem
Sorry, if I treated you bad, or if I ever made you sad
I didn't mean to get so mad, you're the best thing I ever had
I don't know what to do, I'm so in love with you
I hurt you, yes, it's true, but I got a few words for you

It's ok, it's alright, I'm gonna make it on the morning flight
I'm gonna do all the things you like
Like champagne and candlelight, light

Touch your body when the mood is right, right
Make you tingle with delight
And later on in the night we're gonna make love 'til morning light
Baby, don't let love go, mi say, let love stay
I want us to be together 'til we're old and gray
Don't leave me in this sorrow nor in dismay
A reply from you would simply make my day
I was a fool to make she pack and go away
Now, lonely is the price that I got to pay
I guess I gotta be the player everybody want me to be
(That you want me to be...be)
And I couldn't get to see the things that you want me to see
(That you want me to see...see)
I want you in my life, I don't want you as a memory
(Not as a memory)

Well, life wouldn't be complete
Without this woman by my side I'm so obsolete
The stupid ways of mine I woulda never repeat
If this world was mine I woulda give you to keep
Place it at your feet
Gyal, your loving no cheap
And me no understand how could I be such a creep?
It cut me like a knife, and now I'm hurting deep
Many nights me no sleep
Me a moan and a weep
And mi heart skip a beats

It's ok, it's alright, I'm gonna make it on the morning flight
I'm gonna do all the things you like
