Tear off your face, put you fi go recycle
True me look long, and maga, and look simple
Bwoy a exercise badness a look title

You should not say nothing
And that's why you can't learn 'cause you nah listen
Shabba Ranking say we reach the 10 stage of evil
Listen wha' me say, a murdering people
When me buss mi gun all the whole world tremble
Claat it again, and the informer marvel
Hush up your mouth and dem haffi keep humble
We a shot boy, no 'if' and 'but' and fumble
Rise 'gainst the Killer gunshot will make you stumble
When me a kill, a 6 o'clock and 7
Mama and papa, and your niece and your nephew
Aunty and uncle, and all your cousin
When me a kill a cyan less than a dozen
All mama and your papa a go dead by 11
