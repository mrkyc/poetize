Yes boy

Murder them, murder them
Test the most high, it's a suicide mission
MCs dead, all others fled, fearing the power
Thunder and lightning, lyrics like hot lead showers
In the desert or in the jungle
When I bust off shots, I blow up spots and competition turns humble
Guns rumble, bodies tumble but I can't be injured
When I kill off the contenders, I escape like a ninja

When my mind spray, you must get flat
Or snatch up your girl and gun and shoot your way out the back
When I fire, the lingo blows out your rib cage
You retire the sound and not because of old age
Blood splatters and holy fire turns to dawn
Killing smooth and silently like the Rasta James Bond
Armed and dangerous, so grab your pistols
But like an MX missile, I'll rip right through you
Some rather die, then face a fate worse than hell
With a bounty on your hood and Bounty Killer on your tail
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Waterhouse with dem ya big long gun ya
Calaloo Bed man nuh come ya fi linger
Now your head a buss like a gas cylinder
Yes boy

Mi gun no cut like razor
Just get da gun ya weh dem call name Blazer

How dem fi take Calaloo Bed man fi gazer?
