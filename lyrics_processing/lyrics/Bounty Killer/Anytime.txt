Alright...

Never let your problems get you down
Gotta stay focused and hold your ground

We do what we do so we stay alive
We sell what we sell so we haffi survive
We tired of the fuckery...
And we Fed Up from 'bout 95

Tell dem say, anytime we hungry again dem a go see we nine
Police outta road say dem a fight crime
And holiday a come and me nuh see the first dime
Tell dem say anytime the government policies a undermine
Poor people's plight, that a sure sign
Corruption and war a go reach it's prime
