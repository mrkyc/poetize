Well I and I a risin' star, nah no mercy
(Yo let me get that Dutch master)
Well Bounty Killer and Raekwon a rising star
(This goes from New York to Jamaica y'all)
Nah no mercy... war and crime and violence, is all this boy preaching!
(New York to Jamaica yo)
Never stop until gunshot reach him
Me sing, me sing, cho!
(Yo let me get that Dutch)

War! and all type a thing this guy preaching
Copper shot reach him, and him dead
There is nobody in this world to accept him
Raekwon just kill him, and then said
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin
Well New York say
I, wonder if one day that
Some idiot would say that, them want a war
Me have a 45 Haskell and all a gun big so til it nah no name
And can't hold inna mi car
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin

Junglist
Dem ask fi war, and now dem get it
Then dem all a bawl, say dem can't defend it
45 Haskell me pop out and end it
Bwoy a tell story like him name Louise Bennett
Gunshot a drop inna him heart and him gullet
Lick off the pants buckle, gone wid him wallet
Lost all the one dollar coin inna him pocket
Bwoy a confront di Wu-Tangs wid all ratchet
Watch it! Hey mi gun a bark like a rocket
Big like a plane, mi guns large like the market
Get hook by yu mouth, and dead like a mullet

War! and all type a thing this guy preaching
Copper shot reach him, and him dead
There is nobody in this world to accept him
TG just kill him, and then said
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin

Relax your soul like Clarks from England
These terrorists brothers is back, gun cocked, wit their jewelry swingin'
Collab on, we get laced in the Avalon
Runnin' the Dutch, my marathon, Don, carry on
These scandalous brothers, we trample this
Fake and get blamp'd wit this, Bounty and Chef, don't even sample this
A loner, a sharp tie-your-brother-up owner
Pass the Corona, what's the science Bounty? (...man grow me)
All they knew, he was wit Shaolin now
Police be wildin', you know, so we was splurgin' in, Virgin Islands
This Mediterranean lady try to play me then
Came wit a man, he had a ruger, he's Arabian
He had a accent, plus his back was bent
I'm on the corner, there's a Cressida wit black tints

War! and all type a thing this guy preaching
Copper shot reach him, and him dead
There is nobody in this world to accept him
Raekwon just kill him, and then said
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin
Well, so
I, wonder if one day that
Some idiot would say that, them want a war
Me got mi 45 Haskell 'cause all a gun big so til it nah no name
Can't hold inna mi car
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin
Well, cho
Diamonds, come and walk wit me, gun point emotionally
Playin' me close like he suppose to be
He looked at 18, word to my son
He was a paid fiend, gettin' money in Jamaica, Queens
Lex' keys fell out my pocket, yo, dun, he cocked it
Ready to blaze me like a sky rocket
Suddenly stunned, dunn dropped the gun
So now it's over, now I'm slidin' in a Rover wit one
We stay trifler, rude boys buildin' in the ghetto cypher
A year from now I buy my bitch a tiger

Word up, no infiltrators, only Wally gators
