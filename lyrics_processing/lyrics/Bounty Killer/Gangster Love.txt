She say that she's leaving... (She's leaving)
Because I'm acting deceiving (I don't know why...)
She's grieving, and she's hurting
But what a bond to break (What a bond)
People try to instigate (Oh, they always)
But it's never wise to make decisions when your mad (It's never)
Remember, think, concentrate, it's better try to relate, straight, straight
Lady! Gyal!
Huh!

Say you're leaving and the reason is clear
Because I am a gangster and she's living in fear
In case that I don't make it, is the news you will hear
I got something to tell you baby, are you prepared?
You say that you are leaving and the thoughts have me grieving
Mistakes that I made, make me look deceiving
If I have her this morning, it would wonderful this evening
Breakup to makeup, love is the reason
Say that you are leaving and the thoughts have me grieving
Mistakes that I made, make me look deceiving
If I have her this morning, it would wonderful this evening
Breakup to makeup, love is the reason

Well, hear me now nuh, spouse
You waan me fi refined like cornmeal make oats

Fi the boss gimme the minimum and take the gross
Well, I'm a gangster, that's first and foremost

Woman, you bear mi kids, you have mi land and mi house
So, let's take a trip and go pon the north coast
A wha' you a cuss 'bout?
Cross!

You're the prettiest things my eyes ever behold
You're worth to me more than money and gold
So make the love unfold, so let's take a stroll
Killer nah go diss you for no other soul
So, get this straight and put it inna your mole
So, for this love you nuh haffi pay no toll
You have full control and I'm telling you whole
Friends a instigate, but what a bond to break
I know you might lose faith
I might give you more than you can take
Unconditional love have no estimate
