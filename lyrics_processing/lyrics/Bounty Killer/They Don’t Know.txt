They call to di rescue yo! huh
Di system was design to perplex you(warning)
And stress you, but to di promise land we best go aiyo yo yo
Ghetto youths don't over dweet go easy in these suites
Fling a jamaica's feet
Nuh loose man! nuh loose move! nuh loose meds yow!
Don't mess up di youths head it's warlord
We gotta get news spread kaboom! deh deh bout deh deh bout well!
Lease likkle thing di man dem ready fi pop it off
Grease up di 'tensil let di thing and di shot kick off(blow)
Youth dem want dem money(now)
Dem wi done you any(how)
Mi wi lay down inna bed and head top lick off
Three pickney mi seh just dead and it hut mi heart
Three dads mi si seh dem go ketch through crime stop tip off(yow)
Madness thing unno fi(low)
This a nuh police and nuh(show)
When you dead you just a dead you nuh have no part bawling
You ever hear a likkle baby bawling
When nuh food nuh reach him belly from morning
Tell mi what you expect watch him starving to death
And you go mek di baretta get brawling
Papa apply fi work and dem nuh call him
Mama use to sew shirt but now it stalling
Turn round a look pon her youth, caan find nuh food now fi calm him
Through they don't know how ghetto people grow
They say that they know but they really don't know well!
Mr politician tek da one inna you head
Everybody have a family dem waan provide di bread
How you teach di youths dem dread you tell dem country inna di red
So nuh badda come back out ya come f*ck up di youths dem head
Tell how you feel, when you set you system fi di youths dem haffi steal
Running down a fantasy and don't know what is real
Gunning down a mantasy if that can make dem heal
Teach dem love because a that di youths dem need
Through they don't know how ghetto people grow
They say that they know but they really don't know well!
Bawling you ever hear a likkle baby bawling
When nuh food nuh reach him belly from morning
Tell mi what you expect watch him starving to death
And you go mek di baretta get brawling
Papa apply fi work and dem nuh call him
Mama use to sew shirt but now it stalling
Turn round a look pon her youth, can't find nuh food now fi calm him well!
Through they don't know how ghetto people grow yo
They say that they know dead punks that they don't know
