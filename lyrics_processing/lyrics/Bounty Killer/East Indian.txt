Nah no mercy

And a say him a Indian
Lost him culture and him reputation...
Well this a the last part of the session

Me know Supercat the big brother, Junior Cat the small one
Him must be an East Indian
Yeah!
A wha' take this punk a say him a Indian?
Me ago kill him with counteraction
After me do Riding West, and him do "ride ass" song
The boy still a prolong

What a surprise as me a ride pon drive
Winchester inna mi hand, well Black Talon start to glide
Sitting Bull and Chief Joseph, dem run gone hide
Crazy Horse and Red Cloud, inna bush them a dive
And the Indian fool-fool and love fi make noise
Riding through the black hills it is like a landslide
Naseberries fly down like wild fowl
Black Talon a make them feather fly and them head roll
357 get out of control
It inna mi hand, me big, bad, and bold
So, "Don't fear no guys", that I have been told
By my daddy, although my daddy get so old
If you try take my gold you're gonna lose your soul
I'm gonna aim to your heart or your mole
