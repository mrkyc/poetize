Well, I and I say the Lord is I and I light, and I and I salvation
I and I fear no evil
When I and I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I and I fear no evil
Nah no mercy!
Make some a live like weeple?
All of them a pooch, war, who it benefit?
Who it profit?
Jailhouse?
Dead house?
That's the benefit
Nah no mercy!

The Lord is my light, my salvation
Who shall I fear? No evil one
I walk through Valley of the Shadow of Death and I fear no evil, I fear no one
The Lord is my light and my salvation!
Me sing say!
I wonder if one day that some gunman would say that them want to church
Ready fi put down the .45 and go seek Father God and say that him quit all dirty works
Killer a hail Selassie I in concert!

Me sing!
It's war you want? Check the police you get it!
And nuh bother bawl say, you can't defend it
Soldier up a camp, hey, dem ready, just say it!
Ask the police, if a war them a beg it
You waan war, war, then whoit benefit?
Dead house, the principle, a jailhouse, the profit
Stop make the bombs, unuh fi stop make the rocket
Stop make the guns, unuh fi ban all the ratchet
And make some more pants with all 55 pockets!
You Mr. tie, you Mr. jacket
Me back it!
