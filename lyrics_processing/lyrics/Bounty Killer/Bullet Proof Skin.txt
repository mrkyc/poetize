Him have di tallest tongue inna Jamaica
Him long it tongue centerspread inna di paper
It measure bout two yards of acre
A Susanne and Carlene dem odda taster
Talk bout licky back yuh lick tings back and forth
At weekends yuh long out yuh tongue like yuh rope
Bruk out di fallen Ange; lunatic like a court
A magic carpet now (? )
Miss Ivey, ok yuh work cashly
Not 'ware bout how di house a leak like yuh see
A six months ago yuh modda ask fi a fridge
And yuh a model wid di switch and this big (? )

But to live wid mama would be di biggest priviledge
Yuh go live wid Patrick and go walk wid back bridge
And go live Peter King crib, well!

Fi di video him a go fi Queen pop out neck so

Bulletproof face, neck, forehead and chin

Sodemite dreadhead I buss like a pumpkin
