Nah no mercy
I said, "I'm riding west in my bulletproof vest"
I never identified no object
It could be Antoinette, or mi gyal Paulette
Nah no mercy, and some guy get upset
Me sing
Me sing
Cho!

Dem leave the world inna suspense
Said, "dem riding "ass"" when dem a talk with experience
And see me work and take sick to the treatment!
And the other day dem couldn't please dem audience
Elephant!
Dem leave the world inna suspense
Said, "dem riding "ass"" when dem a talk with experience
And see me work and take sick to the treatment!
And the other day they couldn't please dem audience

"Riding west inna mi bulletproof vest"
Nowhere me never identify no object
It could be Antoinette, or it could be Paulette
DJ hear mi argument and get vexed
Said, "dem a ride ass", that is the wrong subject
Any guy a ride ass, a Black Rhino dem get
Me never hear no ass a cross the desert yet
It's only a camel could make such flex
You soon hear the boy say him a ride cow next
Me sing say!

Dem leave the world inna suspense
Said, "dem riding "ass"" when dem a talk with experience
And see me work and take sick to the treatment!
And the other day they couldn't please dem audience

Boy see mi work and lost all confidence
Make him friend boost him and him take influence
Junglist anthem this boy go talk 'gainst
And have the heart fi jump the Tivoli man fence
Matthews Lane man a fling him out inna a trench
Boy all go harass and a take public bench
And go drape up Selassie 10 commandments
Go down the road go through, well that never make sense
Capleton, the rasta dem, a fling him off of dem bench
Shout, "Selassie I!", and bawl say, "judgement!"
Mi sing say!

Dem leave the world inna suspense
Said, "dem riding "ass"" when dem a talk with experience
And see me work and take sick to the treatment!
And over Sting dem couldn't please dem audience

Boy a fend me song, and mi put up defense
Now dem all a bawl and can't pay the expense
Well, how your mouth's so big? Well, stand the consequence!
Well, Seaview man nuh attend no conference
Dem live inna mi style like a new apartment
Like dem and mi lyrics all have assignment
Or a contract, or a big appointment
Fi hype up themselves, dem woulda spend the last cent
That nah go exercise Killer's talent
Mi sing say!

Waterhouse anthem this boy go talk 'gainst

And go accept Selassie 10 commandments
Go down the road, that never make sense
