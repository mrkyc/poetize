I just gotta say, smoke your ganja
It gives me a good sense of humor
Nah no mercy
And keep away from the cancer
Nah no mercy
I just gotta say, I got my ganja diploma
I went to the ganja college
Nah no mercy
Increase my wisdom, understanding, and my knowledge
Nah no mercy
Just gotta say, big up the man called Kutchie
Ganja fill up mi dutchie
Nah no mercy
Hey!

Smoke your herb, give thanks and praise
It make we think constructive and brave
Because it was found at King Solomon's grave
Him was the wisest man in his days
Hoii!
I'm serious, me nah make no joke
Ganja me smoke and not coke
I will never drink dem rum and me nah eat pork
Or go sail inna this white woman's boat
I have wrizzla ready, hand me the chronic
Me have some preserve put down and make tonic
Crack and the coke, all those things must abolish
Peter Touch burn chalice inna Buckingham Palace
Mi say!

Ganja man me come to congratulate
And with no coke head we nah go collaborate
Wha' dem a demonstrate? A wha' dem a portrait?
Say dem a illustrate when dem a contaminate
The younger youths dem mind fi nyam this white gyal's cake
Dandimite open him eyes and Doolas a walk straight
Right out of Rome to Mount Zion's high gate
Make hay while the sunshine, don't be too late
Good things inna life the Killer a penetrate
And conscious message is what we come to dedicate
Youth, no make your life go to waste
Hey!

Rasta inna the bush and dem no stop cultivate
'Copter fly down from nowhere, out of space
Deal with me bad and all lick me inna mi face
Drape up mi gyal and say dem a interrogate
Me move out mi ganja weh me just reap, make haste
Fast, fast, fast without leaving any trace
Soldier pon foot and dem no stop circulate
Dem dog inna dem hand, dem look mean inna dem face
Dem want to find mi seeds, so dem no stop speculate
Dem burn down mi camp, Kutchie haffi migrate...
Hey!
And farm some other place
