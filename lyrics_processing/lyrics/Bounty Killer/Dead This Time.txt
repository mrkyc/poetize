(Dead! dead!)
I come to kill boy
Assassinate and to destroy
Fi murder certain guys, that we enjoy
Lawd av mercy!

Bwoy yuh dead this time
Mi have a gun yah name "see it and blind"
Or "dead same time"
How him sour like lime?
Ready status, mi nah go speak mi mind
A guy see di sign, and a act like him blind

You diss badman with weapon like these
Gunshot a tek dem body like disease
Dem a travel so hard, never check dem speed
Fly past danger road and never look and read
When badman arrive, a informa must leave
You know you wi' dead, mouth murder Steve
Say him a murderer, now him a beg man, "please"
And a bawl like baby, him deh pon him knees
Mi big gun pop out and shot start squeeze
While gunshot a sting bwoy body, like bees
