(Intro, Chorus: Bounty Killer, Wyclef, Lauryn)
Michael Jackson brought you Thriller
It made all the gun-man hollar
Refugees with Bounty Killer
Mack 11 guard your grilla
(First verse: Lauryn Hill, Bounty Killer)
Why you gwan, watch out for Babylon, MC's babble on and on I
Phenom, bomb like Ethiopians, not Italions, Queen Asheba, balance like a
Libra, rain like meteor storms, that change forms like the pillars of
Islam, make the best rule, and- the rest who'll, it takes one drop of
Purity to clean the cess pool, the next crew, will be comprised of kings
And queens wearing crowns and holiday scepters, facing Mecca, making
Records, raiding biblio-techas, I sip nectars with the gods in the street
Apparel, keep the path straight and narrow while we bombin' on Pharaoh, so
Bounty Killer pour the sorrel let's make plans for tomorrow
Cause if it's down a Sodom and Gommorah Refugees we nah go so
(Chorus)
(Second Verse: Bounty Killer, Wyclef)
So talk well if you vex, try and jump in a mi chest, you Mr. Punk
Well come and do your next best, mi end you distress, mi lay you to rest
Askel 45, Fugees dem tech. Well talk well if you vex, try and jump in a mi
Chest, you Mr. Punk well come and do your next best, mi end you distress
Mi lay you to rest, rappers from the east and rappers from the west, well
You might also likeYo, five years old I heard shots out the window, I thought that it
Was Zorro, driving in from Mexico, I asked my father Pablo who the hell is
This Paco, He said It's Bounty Killer, He's driving from Montego
(Bounty Killer)
That's when shots start to echo from yah so and from deh
So, well that is the life of a --- from the ghetto, moving 40 kilo, from
Here to Puerto Rico, smoke my manifico, but I never do perico
(Wyclef)
Yo, this is a sound clash, you ain't fit for the job, you're-
And you're making my -hard, you wanna rap, here's presents, go rap it in
A box, you versus me is like a mouse versus a ox, Wyclef, preacher's son, I
Sing a hymn the lights get dim, reflection of the end, is your face facing
A coffin, oops, to abstract so you kill me with gaps, figments of your
Imagination, you never dealt with incarceration
(Bounty Killer)
Thought I heard you want to be my rival, askel 45 a it a
Idol, them start war and no seek survival, Refugees we gonna treat them
Detrimental, Punks, fools
Bridge: Wyclef, Bounty
Another sound boy dies, slow death, Refugee camp, Bounty Killer...
(Chorus)
(Third Verse: Praz, Wyclef, Praz, Bounty Killer)
Through the temples of doom somehow we managed to bloom like
Blossoms, by any means necessary said Malcolm, nights before battle we play
Dead like possums, minimizing our losses like caution to the maximum
Strategies for the Refugees, how many mics do you rip, I say not too many
Yo, which man runs from my magnum
Haitian shot a man
Them blame Jamaicans
(Chorus)
(Bounty Killer)
Yeah, Yeah Yeah...
(Outro: Bounty Killer, Wyclef)
Well talk well if you vex, try and jump in a mi chest well
Come and do your next best, mi end you distress, mi lay you to rest, askel
45 New York gun take, well talk if you vex, try and jump in a mi chest, so
Mr. Punk, well come and do your next best, mi end you distress, mi lay you
To rest, askel 45, California take, well, well
Bounty Killer on the borderline, Refugee camp, Wyclef, L. Boogie
Prazwell and it don't stop
