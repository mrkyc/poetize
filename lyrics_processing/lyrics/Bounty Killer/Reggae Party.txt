Is it soft? Is it soft?
Coco B, R&R
And Bounty Killer
Refugees Productions
Black John on the Sound
C'mon Let's Run
Chorus: (Nona)
It's A Party (Show Love)
Let's get together (C'mon down)
Make it happen (Let's make it happen yo)
Feel much better (Feel this)
There'll be no shooting (Hold it down)
At each other (Hold it down)
It's a party (Why? Cause the Killa said so)
Verse 1:(Coco Brovaz)
In a smoke filled room
Banging my favourite tune
Play it loudly
Soldiers around me
Getting Rowdy
Coco B's and Bounty
We mash the Party
Then flee the county
Country to Country
Come see the Nazi from the refugee
All Star in the clup pay the V.I.P
Show me love BCC in the double tree
Rap star at the bar pour bottles of bubbly
We MCs rocking box like Run-DMC
Spread love with my peeps and my family
S-T double E, Smokey he run with me
Tail flowers cover me that's my PNC's and
