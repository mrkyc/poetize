People are dead
(People are dead. Dead.)
That's what I said
The blind must be led
The hungry must be fed
'ey yo, you know
I'm looking through our whole despair
Over the years
Nobody cares
Take a look in my house
Would you live in there?
'ey yo, you know
Look at my shoes
Can you see my toes?
But that's how the struggle goes
Nobody knows

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Can you feel my pain?
Am I your enemy?
You might also likeGive us a better way
Things are really bad
The only friend I know
Is this gun I have
Listen to my voice
This is not a threat
Now you see the .9
Are you worried yet?
You've been talking 'bout
You want the war to cease
But when you show us hope
Then we will show you peace

Look into my mind
Can you see the wealth?
Can you tell that I
Wanna help myself?
But if it happen that
I stick you for your ring
Don't be mad at me
It's a survival ting
Look into my heart
I can feel your fear
Take another look
Can you hold my stare?
Why are you afraid
Of my younger face?
Or is it this thing
Bulging in my waist?

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Can you feel my pain?
Am I your enemy?
Give us a better way
Things are really bad
The only friend I know
Is this gun I have
Listen to my voice
This is not a threat
Now you see the .9
Are you worried yet?
You've been talking 'bout
You want the war to cease
But when you show us hope
Then we will show you peace

Look into my life
Can you see my kids?
And let me ask you this
You know what hungry is?
Well, in this part of town
Survival is my will
For you to stay alive
You've got to rob and kill
Look into my house
Would you live in there?
Look me in the eyes
And tell me that you care
Well I've made up my mind
To end up in the morgue
Right now I rather die
'Cause man a live like dog

Look down on my shoes
Can you see my toes?
The struggle that we live
Nobody really knows
Stop and ask yourself
Would you live like that?
And if you had to then
You would a-buss gunshot
Look into the schools
Tell me how you feel
You want the kids to learn
Without a proper meal?
Den what you have in place
To keep them out of wrong?
If they drop out of school
Dem a go bus dem gun

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Can you feel my pain?
Am I your enemy?
Give us a better way
Things are really bad
The only friend I know
Is this gun I have
Listen to my voice
This is not a threat
Now you see the .9
