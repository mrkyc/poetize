Well this one called, down inna the ghetto
None other than the mighty Bounty Killer say so
Everyday I get up it's just gunshot and echo
Nah no mercy

Well, down inna the ghetto weh the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same thing
Down inna the ghetto weh the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same thing

My pocket is weak, my heart is willing
I want of pound of rice, but can't find a shilling
Can't buy the chicken back, much less the chicken
Turn left and right and it's gunshot a fling
Every weh me go it's wicked song dem a sing
Now hear me now queens, and hear me now kings
All over this world, local and foreign
Black and white, me nah prejudice skin
Hear me Mr. Lou, Mr. Wong, and Mr. Chin
To kill another man, what good does that bring?
I feel it so much 'til cold bump take mi skin
Mi head start to hurt me, and mi eyes dem a spin

Down inna the ghetto where the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same -

Who give the guns? Who give the crack?
No one to take the blame
And a who import the guns and cocaine
And a who innaculate the ghetto youths brain
And mobilize dem inna this Bloodsport game
Say if you want to rich, you haffi kill Shane
And wicked enough to kill him mother, Mrs. Jane
Mek dem say you a di wickedest man pon the lane
And if you want you respect fi long like a train
Well you better make shot fall like a rain
You waan fi put one foot pon dem concord plane
Hey, you better sell twenty kilo of cocaine

Down inna the ghetto weh the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same -
You know dem release the chain and a use dem brains
Well I am a man, I believe you are the same
Nuff things weh happen make Father God shamed
Down inna the ghetto, yes, a pressure and strain
Like all some youth weh get caught pon cocaine
Get giddy and a go pon the false lane
I tell you how much him inna the hall of fame
And the MAC11 weh him carry no have shame
And it can't tame fi flush out your brain
Whether pon the street, pon the public, inna the main
I say a hollow point shot him gun contain

Down inna the ghetto weh the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same thing
Down inna the ghetto weh the poor nuh have a thing
And the politicians, it's the gun dem a bring
Hey
And the crack and the coke, dem a support the killing
Me check it out, the whole of dem a the same thing

My pocket is weak, my heart is willing
I want of pound of rice, and can't find a shilling
Can't buy the chicken back, much less the chicken
Turn left and right still a gunshot a fling
Every weh me go it's wicked songs dem a sing
Now hear me now queens, and hear me now kings
All over this world, local and foreign
Black and white, me nah prejudice skin
Hear me Mr. Lou, Mr. Wong, and Mr. Chin
To kill another man, what good does that bring?
I feel it so much 'til cold bump take mi skin
