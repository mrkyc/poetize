Girl, something about the way you handle things, uh-huh
Like a perfect picture is how you take to me, ooh wee
I was brokenhearted 'till you came, came my way, uh-huh
Now look just what you started off up in this place
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh
1 - Every which way you flex
Every which way you move
Every which way you turn
Baby I'm feeling you
You might also likeEvery which way you walk
Every which way you talk
Every which way you roll
Baby I'mma roll with you
One trip to Rio, I knew you had me
Yes you did, yes you did
Never took for granted all this love I give
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Never too afraid to show your emotions
And I like it babe, like it babe
Now come let me rub you with body lotion
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Repeat 1
I adore you
Anything for you
Memories in my mind
Like deja vu

Uh, uh, uh, uh
You talking about easy mo, easy go
Easy flow, easy Joe
Here we go, there Gino
Wanna ride with a rich negro
Take a flight to Mexico
Hit the spot and dosi-do
Hater's head, see 'em roll
Rockland making all that dough
And if y'all don't know
But acts will rove
Vegas Cats step in the door
Tantalation from head to toe
Bringing heat like Dinero
We rock ice and be like, so?
Man we sell out every show
Y'all ain't know
Now y'all know
I hate to say I told you so
