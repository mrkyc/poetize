I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, 'cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your love)
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your touch)
Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy, your love

When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Yeah, but I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
You might also like

Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your touch)
Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy, your love

'Cause your love got the best of me
Baby, you're blind if you can't see
Baby, you got me, got me
You got me
 
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your love)
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now

Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy, your love's got me lookin'
