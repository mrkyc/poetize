We all love, we all pray
We all make some mistakes
Win or losing, we all human
We all go through things
We all dream, we all cry
We've all felt pain at some point in our lives
We'll keep on moving (Keep on moving)
Yeah, we all human (We all human)
We all go through things (We all go through things)
Oh yeah

See no matter what colour of your skin
It feels just the same when the knife goes in
And no matter who gonna win or lose
We all gonna bleed the same shade of rouge
We'd feel much better if we told the truth
We're so good together, but we mad confused
So human

Rich or poor, young or old
We all out here, we're tryna save our souls
Yeah, we all learning (We all learning)
Yeah, we all human (We all human)

We keep losing (We keep losing)
'Cause this ain't human (This ain't human)
We going through things (We going through things)
