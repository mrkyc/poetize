Hey, yeah

You are what God imagined, you are a true perfection
Baby, you're made of stars, don't let nobody tell you different
You are a lot of soul, mixed with a lot of magic
Look how the sky turns gold every time you're dancing
You deserve all the love, why don't you let it in?
Don't punish who you are for who once you have been
You've got a heart of fire, it's gonna take you higher
Just let it flow, look at you glow, you gotta know

That you're an extraordinary being
Yes, you're an extraordinary being

See, your anatomy is made up of those before you
Gold is your history, you're standing upon their shoulders
See, you're a giant now, getting too high for cowards
Look how you're flying now, check out your super powers
You deserve peace of mind, you deserve all the laughter
You are one of a kind, you deserve happy ever after
Oh, how the tides are changing, feel how your heart is blazing
You gotta breathe, you gotta see, you gotta believe
You might also like
That you're an extraordinary being
Yes, you're an extraordinary being, that's right
Yes, you're an extraordinary being
Oh, you're an extraordinary being

It's not your fault that you're magic
Baby, you're pure fantastic
Endless love like the ocean
Sing your song and be certain
If the world kicks you to zero
Spread your wings like an eagle
Raise your hand to the sun
And know that you are someone

Yes, you're an extraordinary being (You are, you are)
Yes, you're an extraordinary being (That's right)
Oh, you're an extraordinary being (Hit me with the duel-up)
Extraordinary being

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are, you are (Extraordinary)
You are, you are, you are
You are, you are (Extraordinary)
You are, you are, you are
You are, you are (Extraordinary)
You are, you are, you are
(Extraordinary)
(Extraordinary)
You are (Extraordinary)
No matter what you do, you are (Extraordinary)
No matter what they say, you are (Extraordinary)
No matter what they say (Extraordinary)
