He's out your system, yeah it took you a while
You got your family back and you got your smile
And you promised your sister that you'd never go back again
But friends keep telling you what he did last night
How many girls he kissed, how many he liked
And you try to remember that
There's no way you could ever be friends

But now you're, you're looking like you really like him, like him
And now you're feeling like you miss him, miss him
You're speaking like you really love him, love him
And now you're dancing like you need him, need him
Put it in your pocket, don't tell anyone I gave ya
It will be the one you run to, the one that saves ya
It could be your daddy, daddy, if you take it gladly, gladly
Daddy, daddy

He kissed you on the lips and opened your eyes
You had to catch your breath, got such a surprise
And you almost forgot how it feels to live in his light
He pulled you closer, said he'll never let go
You couldn't trust him, but you never said no
In that moment he made you forget how it feels when he's gone
You might also like
But now you're, you're looking like you really like him, like him
And now you're feeling like you miss him, miss him
You're speaking like you really love him, love him
And now you're dancing like you need him, need him
Put it in your pocket, don't tell anyone I gave ya
It will be the one you run to, the one that saves ya
It could be your daddy, daddy, if you take it gladly, gladly
Daddy, daddy

You're looking like you really like him, like him (I do, kind of, like him)
And now you're feeling like you miss him, miss him (I kinda miss him)
You're looking like you really love him, love him (And now you love him)
And now you're dancing like you need him, need him (Need him)
Put it in your pocket, don't tell anyone I gave ya
It could be the one you run to, the one that saves you
It could be your daddy, daddy, if you take it gladly, gladly
Daddy, daddy
Put it in your pocket, don't tell anyone I gave ya
It could be the one you run to, the one that saves you
It could be your daddy, daddy, if you take it gladly, gladly
