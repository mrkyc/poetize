I was lost
In the dead of night
But then came angels
I could not fight, no
All of a sudden, I'm affected
I was blinded, by the light
'Til you said

Babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe

There were sirens
Out to get me
So by now, I swear I've heard it all
I just pray
You choose to catch me
But either way
You were always worth the fall
So I said
You might also like
Babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe

Hate all the things that they say
Love 'cause the things they choose to hate
It's just a love that they're afraid of
But see, I'm not afraid to take a leap
Not afraid to get too deep
Singing long live the angels
And hey, take note of colours in your dreams
Things aren't as dark as they may seem
Remember fear is in no way truthful
And I say what luck to find you in this life
I've been around so many times
And never found someone so beautiful

So babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Shout it out, say it loud, down the hallway
Hold me now, hold me now, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me down, hold me now, hold me always
