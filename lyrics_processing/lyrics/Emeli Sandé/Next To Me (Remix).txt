I'm looking at the flashy lights and wonder, the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine, even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fighting the same drug
The feeling that caned us in vain, it's tough love
Please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing bigger than you, I thought a Benz'd do
But nothing bigger than you, ain't nothing bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
You're many moons away, but still you're right here

You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice and staying out 'till three
You won't ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him trying to chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You might also like
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me (Next to me)
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need is a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

When the end has come, the buildings falling down fast
When we spoiled the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
