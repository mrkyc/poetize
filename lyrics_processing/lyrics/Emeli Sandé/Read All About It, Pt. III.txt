You've got the words to change a nation but you're biting your tongue
You've spent a lifetime stuck in silence afraid you'll say something wrong
If no one ever hears it
How we gonna learn your song?
So come on, come on
Come on, come on

You've got a heart as loud as lions, so why let your voice be tamed?
Maybe we're a little different, there's no need to be ashamed
You've got the light to fight the shadows so stop hiding it away
Come on, come on

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it
Oh, ohhh, oh
Ohhh, ohhh, oh
Ohhh, oh, oh

At night we're waking up the neighbours while we sing away the blues
Making sure that we're remembered, yeah, 'cause we all matter too
If the truth has been forbidden, then we're breaking all the rules
So come on, come on
Come on, come on

Let's get the TV and the radio to play our tune again
It's 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events
There's no need to be afraid, I will sing with you, my friend
Come on, come on

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it

Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
Now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this
Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
Now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it
Oh, ohhh, oh
Ohhh, ohhh, oh
Ohhh, oh, oh
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it
Oh, ohhh, oh
Ohhh, ohhh, oh
