High, high

So high that the aeroplanes are envious
Yes, you know it's dangerous, this high
So high that the highs and lows are always highs and never lows
You know no lies
So high that the atmosphere is different here
It's pretty clear to see love's here
Oh, love, no fear, oh, love, oh, love

Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher

So high that the astronauts look up to us
Yeah, heaven touches us this high
So high we're above the sun
The pain is gone, the pain is gone, yeah, no, no cry
So high that the galaxies are at our feet
It's pretty clear to see love's here
Oh, love, no fear, oh, love, oh, love
