Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
Come find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
So come find my address
And build me up, build me up

See we got deep love, but it's a deeper ocean
Dear God, help us keep floating
Some choke and some panic
See some got a boat, but most haven't
Well dear heaven, you know we're tryna make it
But dear heaven, you know it's complicated
Got deep love, but it's a, a deeper ocean
We got deep love

Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
Come find my address
And build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
Come find my address
And build me up, build me up

Yeah we're still hearing and we're still breathing
Knee deep with a deep needing
We stay brave though we've been damaged
See most got a heart, but some's savage
Oh dear heaven, I hope you're up to something
'Cause dear heaven, this just can't be for nothing
We're still here, and we're, we're still breathing
Yeah we're still here

Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
Come find my address
And build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
Come find my address
And build me up, build me up

Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
Come find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
Come find my address
