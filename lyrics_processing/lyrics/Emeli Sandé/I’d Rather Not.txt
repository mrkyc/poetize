Something like a hurricane
Total destruction, torrential rain
You went in straight for the jugular
And that's what I got for just loving ya
Arrows and bullets flew
Your tongue loves war in the afternoon
Your favorite bomb was "Let's just be friends"
But now you're suggesting we try again

But if it's all the same to you
As much as I'd love to
I'd rather not
I'd rather not have my heart blown to pieces again
No, I can't make it stop
But I'd rather not
I'd rather not

What's the good in paradise?
At any moment it could vaporize
So dangerous to ever get used to you
Do you have any idea what you put me through?
See, now my heart's a Frankenstein
Super-glued after your dynamite
And just when I thought I have got some closure
You started talking 'bout starting over
You might also like
But if it's all the same to you
As much as I'd love to
I'd rather not
I'd rather not have my heart blown to pieces again
No, I can't make it stop
But I'd rather not
I'd rather not

See, when it was good it was amazing
But the bad was devastating
We could never seem to find an in-between
And God knows I adore you
And nothing came before you
But I don't have the heart to risk what's left of me

So if it's all the same to you
As much as I'd love to
I'd rather not
I'd rather not have my heart blown to pieces again
No, I can't make it stop
But I'd rather not
I'd rather not
But if it's all the same to you
As much as I love you
I'd rather not
No, I'd rather not
Get my heart ripped into pieces
No, no, no, no, no
I'd rather not
No, I'd rather not
But if it's all the same to you
As much as I love you
I'd rather not
