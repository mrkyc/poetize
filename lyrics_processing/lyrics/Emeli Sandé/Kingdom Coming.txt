Ho-oh, ho-oh, woah
Ho-oh, ho-oh, woah
Ho-oh, ho-oh, woah

Daddy been cleaning windows
Daddy been shining shoes
Daddy's a taxi driver
Driving all night surviving on a couple hours sleep in the afternoon
Daddy's so home sick
Twenty years past, Daddy's job and still no promotion

Fuck that, Daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, Daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, Daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running

Mummy been lighting candles
Mummy been saying prayers
Mummy don't think she can handle
No more thugs or thieves
Or dogs or sharks or grizzly bears
Mummy's so fed up
Four-night shifts in a row but the debt won't let up
You might also like
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel

And I know she loved to travel
Take a picture in the album
But that's something come and gone
And the kids need uniforms
And I know he loved to hold her
I mean really get to know her
But that's something come and gone
And the kids need uniforms

Fuck that, Daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
I pray you get home safe
I pray your date of birth, to come boat to those cold gates
I pray you don't lose faith, pray you don't lose faith
Life begins at 40 momma, I pray you see old age
I've seen you go to work and come home and go to work
And not moan about your worth
Because there's nothing in your purse
But that money don't define you
Plus, you hate being lied to
That's probably why there's no fella beside you
But besides that, I'm beside you
Hospital bedside, thinking how the fuck can I 
There's no quittin', there's no quittin'
What good's a fire in the booth if I could burn with those lyrics
Clock's tickin' and it's getting hard for me
They just said my mother's got heart disease
Man, I swear I felt that in my artery
If we could swap I'd give you every part of me
Every lesson that you taught me was priceless
I mean it's funny how you add value when you're a minus
Corned beef sandwich for dinner when we were rice -less
Had that shit time after time, I guess it's timeless
The candles stayed lit when the electric gave in
I kept our fire burning, mom, we never gave in
And if the kingdom's coming man it's best waiting
'Cause I ain't leaving your side, it's gonna be a long night
Fuck that, daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
Fuck that, daddy
You're a king and the kingdom's coming, no more running
Fuck that, mummy
You're an angel, and this ain't no place, for an angel
