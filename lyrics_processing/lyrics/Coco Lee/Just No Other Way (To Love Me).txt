In your arms again
And it keeps on getting better
Well, I don't mean to read your mind
'Cause when I look in your eyes
I can almost see forever
But before you go too far
Before I fall too fast
Baby, you should know
I need love that's gonna last
You gotta promise to be here
Through the laughter and the tears
Let me know
That you're my everyday and every night
'Cause there's just no other way to love me
Take my heart
Take my soul
Baby, never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you're gonna fall in love with me
There's just no other way to love me

And baby, I swear
I'll be right there when you need me
But I gotta know that you'll always be true
That you're gonna see this rule
And give your heart completely
I wanna feel it when we kiss
Believe it when we touch
Baby, don't just say you love me
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna see it in your eyes
Believe it deep inside
Gotta know you'll be here
Everyday every night
'Cause there's just no other way to love me
Take my heart
Take my soul
Baby, never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you're gonna fall in love with me
There's just no other way to love me
I will never ask for more than a gift to you
(Gonna give my everything)
Give my everything
But I gotta know that your heart is true
Every day, every night, for the rest of your life
'Cause there's just no other way to love me
Take my heart
Take my soul
Baby, never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you're gonna fall in love with me
