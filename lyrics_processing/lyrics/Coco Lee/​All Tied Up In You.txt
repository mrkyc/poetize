I feel the feeling coming over me
But meeting you like this is scaring me
But I lost myself you see
In the magic of the moment
The moment of your touch
(Yeah)
I know you're working me, baby
But I'm needing you too much
'Cause I can't think and I can't eat
It's 3:00 in the morning
And I can't even sleep
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
And I don't know what to do
Sometimes I can't think
Sometimes I can't speak
It's a crying shame what you've done to me
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
I'm so all tied up in you
I smile at your sweater when you're not at home
I love the scent of your new cologne
You know it drives me crazy
When you're not near me, baby
You might also likeI call your number just to hear your voice
I wish I didn't have to
But I got no choice
Like a rope around your heart
Just wanna be where you are
'Cause I can't think and I can't eat
It's 3:00 in the morning
And I can't even sleep
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
And I don't know what to do
Sometimes I can't think
Sometimes I can't speak
It's a crying shame what you've done to me
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
I'm so all tied up in you
There ain't nothing you can do 'bout it
There ain't nothing that I can say
I'm as guilty a sin, boy
When it comes to meeting you, baby
I'm all wrapped up in you
I'm ready to give you everything I've got
'Cause I love you
'Cause I can't think and I can't eat
It's 3:00 in the morning
And I can't even sleep
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
And I don't know what to do
Sometimes I can't think
Sometimes I can't speak
It's a crying shame what you've done to me
'Cause I'm all tied up in you
