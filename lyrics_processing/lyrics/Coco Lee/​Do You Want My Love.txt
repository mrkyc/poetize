Can you make me sweat?
Do you want it bad enough
To make it soakin' wet?
Do you want my love?
Show me just how much
Tell me, baby
Do you, do you want my love?
Baby, if you took my love
Would you make the best of every moment?
If it takes all night, baby
Would you like to spend the hours
Freakin' to the mornin' light?
Love just comes if you let it
I'll be here to satisfy you
You look so good
I can't deny
If you're up to it come and get it
If you're ready, baby
Give it up
Boy, it's time to show me
Show me how much
