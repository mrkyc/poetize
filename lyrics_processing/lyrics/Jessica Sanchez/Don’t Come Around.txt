Hey
Hey
Ah, ow

Don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no
Don't come knocking outside my door
No, oh, no, oh

Does it make you feel big and strong
Everytime you scream and shout
Or is it that you just get up on seeing me broken down
You think you got me right under your thumb
But, boy, you got it all, all wrong
So tell me, tell me, how does it feel to be alone now
Locked up, out in the cold now?

Now you wanna buy me diamonds (diamonds)
And you wanna send me roses (roses)
But you know that the roads
With the shops are closed forever
Yeah, but, yeah
You might also like
Don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no
Don't come knocking outside my door
No, oh, no, oh
You think you can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So no, don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no, oh

Does it make you feel like a man
When you're throwin' those words to me
You never thought to pick 'em off the ground
And shove 'em back in your face
You hate that I never was afraid
Sorry, you can't get your way
See only little boys like to fool like you
So I think it's time you grow up tonight
Now you wanna buy me diamonds
And you wanna send me roses
But you know that the roads
With the shops are closed forever

Now you wanna buy me diamonds (diamonds)
And you wanna send me roses (roses)
But you know that the roads
With the shops are closed forever
Yeah, but, yeah
Don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no
Don't come knocking outside my door
No, oh, no, oh
You think you can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So no, don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Boy, you can cry me, cry me, cry me, cry me a river
Hope you drown in
And too many times I tried, now it's goodbye
So you better let it sink in
Boy, you can cry me, cry me, cry me, cry me a river
Hope you drown in
And too many times I tried, now it's goodbye (too man times)
So you better let it sink in

Don't come around here no more
No, oh, no, oh, no (oh)
Don't come knocking outside my door
No, oh, no, oh (no)
You think you can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So no, don't come around here no more (oh no)
