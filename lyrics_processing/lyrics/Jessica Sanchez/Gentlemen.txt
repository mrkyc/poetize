Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm

Where have all the good men gone?
The players I'm meetin', they don't turn me on
You get, shake it, don't say "yo uh hun"
I get my own while you get some
Keep me waitin' by the phone
Pick me up, don't bring me home
You think this is a date we're on
Where have all the good men gone?

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For all the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they ca-a-a-a-are
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Put your hands, oh put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me

I'm gonna give you a lesson in love
Gotta get your game up, up, up, up
Open the door when I come
Open your mouth when I run
Where have all the good men gone?
Without a lady, no no, you would've never been born
Whether pulse or pressin' is all you've got
While we gotta teach you what's up, up, up
You might also like
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For all the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they ca-a-a-a-are
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Put your hands, oh put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me

Come now, bring on the chivalry
No less, no less is not enough for me
Come boys, you gotta bring on the chivalry
Treat me like a lady
Come now, bring on the chivalry
Turn it up, you will graduate with a degree
Come boys, you gotta bring on the chivalry
Treat me like a lady

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For all the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they ca-a-a-a-are
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Put your hands, oh put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
