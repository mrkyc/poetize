Hey, I'm kinda jealous, I'm kinda mad
I'm kinda poutin', I'm kinda sad
Girl, where'd you get him, he's such a find
You hit the jackpot, one of a kind

Do he got a brother or maybe just another one like him?
Do he got a homie
You can introduce me to?
Just like him

I'm kind jealous that your boyfriend seems like a fairytale
Like a fairytale
He's hella perfect, hella cute, hella fun like a fairytale
Like a fairytale
Did he come to your rescue?
Did he win the fight?
Did he slay the dragon?
Did you ride off in the night?

Sorry, I can't stop staring, I'm still in shock
How did you find him? He's smokin' hot
Must have paid cupid, more than a lot
To go searchin' all around the clock for him

But I don't mean to be jealous, I don't mean to be mad
In fact I'm rather happy, in fact I'm rather glad that I know
That cupid is on the road and he's gonna find mine

I'm kind jealous that your boyfriend seems like a fairytale
