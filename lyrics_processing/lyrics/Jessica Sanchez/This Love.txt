And I need you

See there's some things that just won't change
And Ill always love you the same
Money come and go but you complete me
Only you babe

Or hits from the 80s
Like jump ropes and boom boxes
This love is a classic
Like old school movies
Love letters and prom queens
Weekend drive ins and chick flicks
This love is a classic
