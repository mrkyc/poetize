I gave you pleasure
You gave me passion
More than a summer loving
You thought you started something
My time I wasted
Your time you spending
You want that strong connection
But I just want a session

So when this high hits
I'm lit, Vibin'
Pull up the 'Rari and Drive it
Find me wildin'
Up in the club on the weekend
Not thinking right
I like calling you up, so

Be a treat and tease me
Can you touch me without feelings?
You give me all I want
But I'm messed up and all out of love, love
Be a treat and tease me
Can you touch me without feelings?
You give me all I want
But I'm messed up and all out of love, love
You might also like
You got some patience
'Cause I keep you waiting
For more than just a party
A place to get acquainted
Intoxicated, I stay on faded
'Cause when I start to focus
I start to like your motives

So when this high hits
I'm lit, Vibin'
Pull up the 'Rari and Drive it
Find me wildin'
Up in the club on the weekend
Not thinking right
I like calling you up, so

Be a treat and tease me
Can you touch me without feelings?
You give me all I want
But I'm messed up and all out of love, love
Be a treat and tease me
Can you touch me without feelings?
You give me all I want
But I'm messed up and all out of love, love
There's something so sweet
Some little feeling
Eyes like Hennessy got me tipsy
Lost in your sheets
But you won't catch me sleeping
'Cause I can't dream
So won't you

Be a treat and tease me?
Can you touch me without feelings? (No, no, no)
You give me all I want
But I'm messed up and all out of love, love
Be a treat and tease me
Can you touch me without feelings?
You give me all I want
