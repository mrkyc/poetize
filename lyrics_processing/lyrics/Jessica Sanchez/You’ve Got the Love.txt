I'm burning up, I'm on fire
(You've got that baby)
All them things things you been doing to me
(Got me crazy)
Tell me what's the move and I'm with it
Cause you the one and I get it, I get it
I get it, oh

It might be hard sometimes
But we're riding together
Right next to paradise
Boy you're the best, they never
And yeah I mean to brag
'Cause baby you deserve it
And just in case you haven't heard it

You've got the love
Standing like a soldier
This kind of love
I'm never getting over
This kind of love
Got everybody talking
'Cause you give me what I need
Can't get enough of, enough of...
You've got the love
You've got that love
You've got that love
You might also like
Boy I love the way that you do it
(I am feeling you)
Make me do do what I'm doing
(Ain't nobody like you)
You keep me up when I'm on it
Just say the word and I'm on it

It might be hard sometimes
But we're riding together
Right next to paradise
Boy you're the best, they never
And yeah I mean to brag
'Cause baby you deserve it
And just in case you haven't heard it

You've got the love
Standing like a soldier
This kind of love
I'm never getting over
This kind of love
Got everybody talking
'Cause you give me what I need
Can't get enough of, enough of...
You've got the love
You've got that love
You've got that love
You've got that love
You've got that love
Almost feels like it's way too good
Can see me here in your arms away
Gonna stay with all them things
Boy just keep on doing what you doing when you do it, how you do it, baby
Cause you've got the love
