(I'll be there) I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on, oh no

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well, that's all I'm after (Ooh)
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)
I'll be there to protect you, with an unselfish love, I respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)
