More than just friends
More than just friends

When I met you, you were someone
That I just loved to be around
We were just friends, and we agreed that
It wouldn't become anything else

But then you, you, you
Couldn't find the break of light
Then you, you, you
Started texting late nights
Then you, you, you
Making things weird now
Tell me why

Afraid to say you're cool, just hanging out
Now you wanna know who else I hang out with
Everything with you is changing out
'Cause you wanna be more than just friends

Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends

Told you secrets 'bout my boyfriend
And the reasons we broke up
Had you best friend on my Instagram
All along, you were falling in love

But then you, you, you
Couldn't see the stop signs
And you, you, you
Calling me late nights
And you, you, you
Making things weird now
Tell me why

Afraid to say you're cool, just hanging out
Now you wanna know who else I hang out with
Everything with you is changing out
'Cause you wanna be more than just friends

Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends
More than just friends
OMG, you changed up
Wish you just wake up
Why try to make us
More than just friends

Afraid to say you're cool, just hanging out
Now you wanna know who else I hang out with
Everything with you is changing out
'Cause you wanna be more than just friends

Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
Now you wanna be-e-e-e-e
Now you wanna be, now you wanna be
More than just friends
