I know I said I love you, but I'm thinking I was wrong
I'm the first to admit that I'm still pretty young
And I never meant to hurt you when I wrote you ten love songs
That guy that I could never get
His girlfriend was pretty fit
And everyone who knew her loved her so
And I made you leave her for me
And now I'm feeling pretty mean
But my mind has fucked me over more times than any man could ever know

Maybe I should give up giving
Give up trying to be thin
Give up and turn into my mother
God knows I love her

And I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware
You might also likeI will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again

So we stayed up late one night
To try and get our problems right
But I couldn't get into his head just what was going through my mind
Thinking he knew where I was going
He put Ryan Adams on
I think he thinks it makes me weaker, but it only ever makes me strong
I've got this friend who sounds just like him
And he's the man I leave you for
The man that I just adore like you
The same man, he turns to me
He said "I've got to tell you how I feel
If God could make the perfect girl, for me it would be you"
And my God told me not to tell
About how much do you love your fella
I don't know more everyday
Not in this new romantic way

I'll always be your first love
You'll always be my first love

But I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware
I will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again
I will never love a man
Cause I could never hurt a man
