Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from her good, good love
She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone)

Now I'm sittin' here going half crazy (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved this
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
Right..

The way it felt, no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back, back)

Now I'm sittin' here halfway crazy (oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)
