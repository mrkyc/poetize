She picks up the phone
In my head I know I'm wrong
I just want to know what she's heard
I'm pacing back and forth, 'cause I know that I've been caught
Trying to think of the perfect words
So I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye, goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smartphones, dumb shit

Never knew I call so if she heard it all
I'm all out of luck tonight
I can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow
Only way to make it right

Aw, man, I got to think of something
I'm about to lose it all
I swear that shit really didn't mean nothing
It all started with a pocket call
So I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
