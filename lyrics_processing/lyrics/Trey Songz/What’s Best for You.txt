Don't make this hard for me
It's not about who's right or wrong, no
If it's how it's supposed to, really supposed to be
Then this love will carry on, girl
If we leave how we began
Then just know, that

I only want what's best for you
It's not what's good for me
It's not about what I want
But it's all about what you need
I want what's best for you
But I don't want you to leave
It's not about what I want
But it's all about what you need, I want what's best for you

'Cause you're the sweetest thing I know
If I said I loved you, really loved you so
Then I could let you go
Girl, doesn't mean I'm giving up, no
So just know that

I only want what's best for you
It's not what's good for me
It's not about what I want
But it's all about what you need
I want what's best for you
But I don't want you to leave
It's not about what I want
But it's all about what you need, I want what's best for you
