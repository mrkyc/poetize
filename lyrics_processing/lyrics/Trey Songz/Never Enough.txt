That's just not me, yeah
That's just not me, ooh
That's just not me, yeah
That's just not me

I can't love 'em, no
And I won't trust 'em, no
A young nigga worked too hard
And I don't wanna hold you up
Cause the money is a motive
I guess the money got me open
And I've been drinkin' for a minute
Shit, that's just how a nigga livin'
She don't wanna go raw
And she gon' go so hard
She keep it so open
While I'm deep in her ocean

I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

I can't fall no more
I won't let myself
Seems like every time I've tried
I hurt someone else
While I hurt me too
I'm so on the loose
She's so over me
I'm not over you
Yeah I did my dirt
Hit you where it hurt
I put your heart in the mix
Issues that I need to fix
But I guess a nigga focused
They say that money is the motive
Can't you hear, I'm so broken
When it come to love think I'm just hopeless
I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

Never enough
Sometimes I need somebody, but these hoes is
Never enough, never enough
