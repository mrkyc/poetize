Songbook, Songz for you
Yeah, come on

Every night up in the club, getting money with the thugs
Thought I'd never fall in love and then there was you
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club, tricking with a different girl
Thought I'd never fall in love, then I met you
Girl, you changed my mind

One look and just one touch
And I knew she was the girl for me, like no other I had seen
They say that I'm tripping, but I know what I want
This girl here is different, she got something that they don't, yeah

She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club, she wanna go too
And I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
They throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
There's a lot of girls up in this club, but baby, I'm taken
Throwing that good ol' groupie love, I'm already taken
And it's hard as a man but I know I can, baby, I'm taken

She's the apple of my eye, keep that body on time
I know I'm a player, but she might be Mrs. Right
Plus, that girl told me, if I ever do wrong
I can have all the money, all the keys, from that day on she's through with me

She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club, she wanna go too
And I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
They throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
There's a lot of girls up in this club, but baby I'm taken
Throwing that good ol' groupie love, I'm already taken
And it's hard as a man but I know I can, baby, I'm taken

Thought I'd never fall in love then there was you
And I don't want to be a player no more
Every night in the club, tricking with a different girl

Girl, you changed my mind

So when they throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
