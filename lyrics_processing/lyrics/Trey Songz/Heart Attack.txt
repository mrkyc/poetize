Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

We share somethin' so common, but still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbin', even here inside these walls
Breakin' each others hearts and we don't care 'cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
