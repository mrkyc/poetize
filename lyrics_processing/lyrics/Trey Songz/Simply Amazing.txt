I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it is, it's um
Whatever it is, it's simply amazing

Her head is on my chest, the sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face
Beautiful in every way, you are

See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing
Amazing, mazing

The girl's a work of art and I can't help but stare
With the smile like the sunset and an ocean as her hair
Ooh, what she do ain't fair
Ooh and she know me better than I know myself

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'd be damned, if I don't believe in us
Like when I said "I love you" for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change, no

She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me

There is nothing in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody
Who could ever compare to you, oh
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
