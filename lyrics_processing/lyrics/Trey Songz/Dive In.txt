Ooh, I'm about to dive in, woah
I was thinking about taking a couple laps, I just wanna dive in
Yeah, dive in, yeah

Splash, baby girl, that's your waterfall
Feel it coming down on me, so crazy
Yeah, girl, I love the way your body talk
Come a little closer just like that, keep on talking, girl, you got me

Wanting to go deeper than you'll ever know
Wanting to feel, the way you flow
Ooh, you got that look up in your eyes
What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise

I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Swimming in your body, let me dive in
You know ain't no running 'round this pool
Going under just for you, baby, you
Watch me stroke left stroke, right stroke, back stroke
Girl, there ain't no running 'round this pool
Ooh, I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Put me to the test, girl, when I dive
