She said that these niggas just don't impress her no more
She done seen it all before
She don't wanna deal with it
Says she wants some real shit

Said that she was tired of the lames
And the games these niggas be playing
Say she's ready for a change but she just gave me the brains
So I can't believe a thing she's saying
I got a problem and she's the solution
She give me her body, don't give me excuses
She said it's a body, I know what to do it
And giving her heart's just been useless

Okay, I'm on it baby
You got my loving 'til the morning, baby
Don't give a fuck, we in the moment, baby
Always with a new one 'cause it's so hard to choose one
Bad girls ain't ever been good for me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me, yeah
Bad girls ain't ever been good to me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me

You thinking 'bout getting your booty done, ain't it?
Maybe one day, baby you'll become famous
I can't tell what's fake or what's real no more
I can't tell if I even feel no more

Ridin' on this dick like that, movin' that ass
You do it so good, that it gotta be bad
Like tell me where you learn that at
I don't wanna know, no, I don't wanna know
Do it fast, do it slow
Got a good girl waitin' at home
Instead I'm spendin' time with a freak
If she see me in the streets, don't speak
Bad girl, she just love to creep
No flickin', no pictures, I don't need them shits to leak
I don't need them shits to leak, I don't even skip a beat
Even if it's Halloween, I don't need to trick or treat
So you a good girl, or you a bad bitch?
