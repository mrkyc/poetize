Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from a good, good love
She told me that those days were gone (Gone, gone, gone)

Now I'm sitting here halfway crazy (Oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (Oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (You, you, you)

And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends, right

The way it felt no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done, we can't take it back (back, back, back)

Now I'm sitting here halfway crazy (Oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (Oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (You, you, you)
