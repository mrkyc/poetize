Oh, cake, cake
Oh, cake, cake
Oh, oh

Baby, this might sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too
But ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too?
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too if cake's on the menu?
Cake's-cake's on the menu
Cake's-cake's-cake's on the menu
I'd like to have dessert for starters
Tell me, baby, can you take my order?

Hey, pretty lady
Give me some of that cake
I'd like to place an order, ooh, I just wanna taste
And ooh I'd hate to wait
Wanna lay your body down all over my plate
Once I blow the candles out, put it in my face
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby

Cake tastes great, I love all of it
