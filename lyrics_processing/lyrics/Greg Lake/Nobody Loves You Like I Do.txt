You can even dig some diamonds out of rock'n roll
You can change the world
But if you lose control
They will take away your T-shirt
And when you lose your reason and there's no release
You can buy seclusion but you can't buy peace
You got everything but the golden fleece
And a shepherd for your sadness
Now I don't expect your sympathy
This is what and where I want to be
For as long as my blood runs
Love comes and goes
God knows
Nobody loves you like I do
No no no nobody loves you like I do
It comes on unrelentless
I've tried so hard to prevent this
But nobody loves you like I do
There are highway dreams in my head tonight
I can't breathe without you, and I'm losing height
I don't need a periscope or second sight
To see nothing lasts forever
With a planet stare and a guiding star
You can only be what you think you are
If I didn't approve it, remove it
I'm coming through
Oh nobody loves you like I do
And I'm dirty, mean and unworthy
This is true
But if somebody says it loves you
From all sides out here above you
Believe me nobody loves you like I do
You might also likeFor you know I will love you sweet and strong
I will love you full; I will love you long
I will love you right even better wrong - tonight
Tonight
Nobody loves you like I do
I can't make it, shake it or break it without you
And if you pause at my insistence
I'll be yours from any distance
So you see, nobody loves you like I do, do, do, do
Nobody loves you like I do
I said nobody loves you like I do
It comes on unrelentless
I've tried so hard to prevent this
But nobody loves you like I do
I said nobody loves you
I said nobody loves you
I said nobody loves you like I do
Oh oh oh nobody in the world
