There may be an 'O' in 'moment'
But there's very few folk in 'focus'
Not the first, not the last, not the least
You needn't be well to be wealthy
But you've got to be whole to be holy
Fetch the rope, fetch the clock, fetch the priest
Oh this planet of ours is a mess
I bet heaven's the same
Look the madman said 'Son
As a friend tell me what's in a name.'
Hallowed be thy name

I give you the state of the statesmen
And the key to what motivates them
On the left, on the right, on the nail
Still I don't see a man in a mansion
That an accurate pen wouldn't puncture
Go to town, go to hell, go to jail
And there's bars and saloons
Where the jukebox plays blues in the night
Till the madman says 'Son
Time to go we could both use some light'
And thy will be done
You might also like
We live in an age of cages
The tale of an ape escaping
In the search for some truth he can use
But many a drunk got drunker
And mostly a thinker, a thunker
Set the place, set the time, set the fuse
The optimist laughed and the pessimist cried in his wine
And the madman said 'Son
Take a word they'll all wake given time'
Let thy kingdom come


The madman and I got drunker
Till both thought the other thank you
And we laughed all the way to the stars
The optimist asked for a taste of the pessimist's wine
And the madman said 'son
How do you feel?' I said 'Me? I feel fine
Lead me into temptation

Into temptation
I said into temptation
I need my allocation of recreation
I want a revelation in degradation
