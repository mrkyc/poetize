Pulling you away
I forgot the end of the world
Was scheduled for today
Tell them you got things to do
And one of them is me
Tell them that you got the flu
Ah tell them anything
I'm a man who's on a mission
Waking up the woman sleeping
In your eyes
Oh I got a very strong suspicion
This could be the day
That she's ready
And she's waiting
So tell her it's okay
To come on out and play
Look at your crawling back
Smiling like a cat
At it girl you ought to be proud
Blowing them off like that
Forget about what's on your mind
Forget about your hair
Put your little hands in mine
Ah put them anywhere
You might also likeI'm a man who's on a mission
Waking up the woman sleeping
In your eyes
Oh I got a very strong suspicion
This could be the day
That she's ready
And she's waiting
So tell her it's okay
To come on out and play
I don't want to talk today
Let's put the words away
Words don't matter anyway
For what I wanna say
For what I wanna say
Put your mind
Into neutral
Close your eyes
And just be kama sutral
For where I want to go
You don't need a map to read
We'll find our way there naturally
And when your body
Is in motion
We can just sit back
And let it lead the way
I'm a man who's on a mission
Waking up the woman sleeping
In your eyes
Oh I got a very strong suspicion
This could be the day
That she's ready
And she's waiting
So tell her it's okay
To come on out and play
I'm a man who's on a mission
Waking up the woman sleeping
In your eyes
Oh I got a very strong suspicion
This could be the day
So tell her it's okay
