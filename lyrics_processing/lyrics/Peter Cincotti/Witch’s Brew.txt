But it doesn't really matter
Cause one thing's for certain
Nobody's leaving now
I like the room
I like you even better
Black lacy curtains
Can't wait to pull them down
She's winding in my arms
She's whispering my name
With the fire in her sigh
And her open gipsy lips say
"Kiss the world goodbye
It's a witch's brew tonight"
And if I run away
You're gonna come and haunt me
So go on and leave me
Where the children should never go
You lock me up in chains
You got me if you want me
Like I'm drunk on the devil
And the devil's got the taste of you
It's a witch's brew tonight
You might also likeYou touch me like a thief
Crawling trough a window
But stealing is easy
The hard part's the getaway
Unplug the phone
And disconnect the cable
I wanna make a movie
Like nobody's ever made
She tells me I'm insane
She reaches up her hands
And she closes both my eyes
She tells me I'm the rain
And she's gonna drink it dry
It's a witch's brew tonight
And if I run away
You're gonna come and haunt me
So go on and leave me
Where the children should never go
You lock me up in chains
You got me if you want me
Like I'm drunk on the devil
And the devil's got the taste of you
It's a witch's brew tonight
And if I run away
You're gonna come and haunt me
So go on and show me
Where the root of desire grows
You lock me up in chains
You got me if you want me
Like I'm drunk on the devil
And the devil's got the taste of you
Oh it's a witch's brew tonight
It's a witch's brew tonight
