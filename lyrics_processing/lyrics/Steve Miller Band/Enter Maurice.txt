Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Enter Maurice
My dearest darling, come closer to Maurice so I can whisper
Sweet words of epismetology in your ear and speak to you of the pompitous of love. Even though our road is rough and long, for you to leave me at this time darling, must surely be wrong
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
So come back and reconsider one more thing
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Maurice is the only one to make your little heart sing
(Maurice will love you)
Ooh mama ooh (Ooh), ooh mama ooh (Ah)
How can you do the things that you do? (Ah)
Ooh mama ooh (Ooh), ooh mama ooh (Ah)
I'm gonna buy you some brand new shoes (Ah)
(Ooh, ah)
I'm gonna buy you some brand new shoes (Ah)
Enter Maurice (It's not too late, it's not too late)
I don't know why you won't make no more apple pie
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Since you've been gone it's been starvation, mama
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Ever since I lost my probation
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Don't you remember the time that you ended up in jail?
(It's not too late)
That's right, darling, it was Maurice who went your bail
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Now, there's just one more thing that I wanna say
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Before you turn and walk away
(It's not too late, it's not too late, for me to love you)

Darling, please (Ah), don't walk out that door
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
You must reconsider, darling
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
You've done it so many times before (Ah, ah)
It's not too late
It's never too late, sweetheart, precious one, for Maurice to love you
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
(It's not too late, it's not too late)
Just remember, sweetheart
I bought myself a gun, and I will be the only one
(For me to love you)
