Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Well it's kill or be killed
And one day we'll get the best of them
Hello helicopter, will you be my friend?
Will you take me away?
Hello helicopter, have you heard the news?
No one gives a shit about the things they do
We all waste and consume, destroy and ruin everything we touch
It's easy not to think when you're not told that much
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Hello helicopter, are you lost out there?
Swimming through the garbage dump that fills the air
In several more years no one will care
They'll be rich and dead
So let somebody else devise a cure for it
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Nobody seems to care
Nobody ever learns
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay?
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Well it's kill or be killed
And one day we'll get the best of them
Hello helicopter, are you listening?

Nobody ever learns
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending that we care?
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending that we care?
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending...
