I've got emotion dripping out my pores
And I thought I would let you know
You are the night light
Ripping through my wicked world
How you make it sparkle and glow
Before I lose control
There's just one thing you should know

This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go

I had some nightmares
Clawing at my skin and bones
I nearly did explode
You smote the demons
Gave me back my feelings
Now I am good to go (good to go)
Before, my face hits the floor
There's just one thing you should know

This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go

This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real

For a physical challenge, I'm notoriously bored
Intravenous delivery, electrolytes and more
Every time it's the same routine
Out with the bad, in with the clean
Before I lose all motor skills
There's one thing you should know

This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let go
I said from the start, that you could take it or leave it
I prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
