You are not alone
We've all had our battles with darkness and shadows
I'm here to let you know
It's a pleasure to meet you

Can you feel it, disappearing
It'll happen, you are not alone
I have been there, hell I'm still there
Oh, and better

Everything is so damn tragic
Time erodes the waves of panic
Take it in

You are not alone
We've all had our battles with darkness and shadows
I'm here to let you know
It's a pleasure to meet you
Today is all we have
So try for a moment to break from the torment
And sing this to yourself
It's a pleasure to meet you

At a distance
There's a difference
Things will make sense
You are not alone
Got to hold on for the moment
Til the next one

Everything is so damn tragic
Time erodes the waves of panic
Get up

You are not alone
We've all had our battles with darkness and shadows
I'm here to let you know
It's a pleasure to meet you
Today is all we have
So try for a moment to break from the torment
And sing this to yourself
It's a pleasure to meet you

Every damn night for years of my life
I've spent driving around this miserable city
Just looking through windows at people
Alone for an answer or reason to live
But every day since, I've been peeling away
At this counterfeit skin that just got in the way
I can see my reflection and clearly can say
It's a pleasure to meet you again
You are not alone
We've all had our battles with darkness and shadows
I'm here to let you know
It's a pleasure to meet you
Today is all we have
So try for a moment to break from the torment
And sing this to yourself
It's a pleasure to meet you

It's a pleasure to meet you
