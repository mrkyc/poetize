Outside, the sidelines failing
Harder than the martyred stars of made-for-TV crime
Indoor living in cardboard confines
Counts for very little, when safe is just a state of mind
I fell off the sidelines long ago
I have no occupation, I'm just wasted for the weekend scene
So don't ask me out, don't make me try
'Cause I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna...

And I can't complain if I don't know how
It's a sad, sad song with no story line
I fall to sleep in my rented room
It's not much to talk about
I've got so much to talk about
But I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you down

Last call for societal knockdowns
Measure my endeavors loosely based on someone else's song
Melodrama and a bottle of wine
Yeah, here's to self expression, here's to everyone that's dead
Bring back the days that fell behind
I'm all wasted conversations in the corner of an empty room
So don't ask me out, don't make me try
'Cause I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna...
