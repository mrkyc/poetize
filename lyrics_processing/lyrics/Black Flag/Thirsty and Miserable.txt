Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't even see anymore

Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more

My brother wants a ride to the liquor store
You pity him for what he wants it for

Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more

It's 1:30 and we're all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us (Oh Shit!)

Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
