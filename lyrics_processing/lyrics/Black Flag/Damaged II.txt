Damaged by you
Damaged by me

I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused

Stupid attempts
No conclusions

I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused

Put the gun to my head
And I don't pull

I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security

Problems stick
My life drips feelings
Stupid feelings
Stupid illusions

I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused

Scars for...

I'm confused
Confused
My emotions are bruised

Wrong in what you think
You don't feel shit

My life drips
Feelings...
Scars! Aah!

I'm confused
You're wrong
Don't wanna be wrong

Stupid incompetence
Stupid in what you think
I'm confused
Well, you are wrong
I don't wanna be wrong

When I talk to you
My mind falls apart

I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security

Problems... my problems
No longer feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick, my life!
