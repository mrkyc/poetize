Know this is a universal truth
People let you down
So reach out for the things that you can use
Buried in the ground

I think I've been misunderstood
Not all of my choices have been good
In a fading light
So we should put this one to bed
Before it bursts out of my head
Ready for the fight

So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here?
So when it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me here?

Inside of another tiny life
Full of big ideas
Strikes me with the baggage left behind
I could dry those tears

All of my secrets they are free
Now watch them tumble out of me
Into better days
So safe those homiletic tones
And come just singing from the moles
And you'll hear me say

So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here?
When it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me
Hey ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey eey
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So step away from castle walls
Those voices calling in the halls
They are moving on
So I keep my side of the street
Clearer than our pounding feet
Ever walked to upon
So when it get's too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here?
When it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me here?
When it gets too late
And I find my place
Who will save your soul and love me here?
When it get's too far
So well let down your guard
Who will save your soul and love me
