Right now the world looks so exciting
But that first rung it feels so cold
The air up there looks so inviting
You'll do the rest when you are old
The printed pictures they stain your hands
It's like a memory you don't own
The architecture of your grand plan
Designed to put you on the throne
The bitter taste of the unknown

I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing
Trying to bring to life your dreams
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes

I don't know if you're gonna make it
How many girls you're gonna know
I don't know if you'll pay your dad back
With front row tickets to your show
Right now your snare drum is a trash can
Your bedroom shadows are your stage
Your old best friend he is your one fan
He'll watch the light inside you fade

I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing
Trying to bring to life your dreams
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing
Trying to bring to life your dreams
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes
(Ooo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo x4)

I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing
Trying to bring to life your dreams
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes
(oh oh)
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing
Trying to bring to life your dreams (hoh oh)
I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one fading away
