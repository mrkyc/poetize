Walking down to the water's edge
Where I have been before
If I don't find my love sometime
I'm walking out that door
Some may come and some may go
But no-one seems to be
The person I've been searching for
The one who's meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cos it's about time

You try too hard and it feels just like
You're running on thin air
Why does luck happen by surprise?
If you don't really care
The past is gone the flames are out
From fires that have burned
New ideals and different thoughts
From lessons I have learned

And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door

And I'll find her, 'cos it's about time

Got the feeling this could take a pretty long while
To find that smile
I'll put my faith in another piece of good advice
Well I tried that twice
Waiting for, a little something more
To inspire, take me higher (oh-oh-oh-oh)

And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cos it's about time
It's about time
It's about time
It's about time
