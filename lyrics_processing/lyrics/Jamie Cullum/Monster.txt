An ocean there in front of me
And I question my beliefs
Well I make a list of everything I know
And see I've hardly even started down the road
And you'll find me, yeah you'll find me
Singin' all I gotta do is write a monster
Suddenly a flash of inspiration
And I feel like I'm a saviour
And it feels, and it feels
Like the world is with me
All the chips are falling where they ought to be
And it feels so sweet
So sweet
So sweet
So sweet
So sweet
So sweet
I just wanna hear, I just wanna hear you sing it back to me
Sing it back to me
When I'm digging in the dirt
For what it's woth, for what it's worth
And I just can't find the treasure
Well I always thought there would be something more
Then it takes me back to where I was before
And you'll find me, yeah you'll find me

Tell myself that I'll amount to nothing then it works
And you're still you, and I'm still me
