One, two, three, four

Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me
So you think about a chance
You find yourself tryin' to do my dance
Because you love me, oh

So when we tried, things had to slow down
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear your ass up

I know that I'm carrying on
Never mind if I'm showing off
But I was just frontin'
You know I want you, babe
I'm ready to bet it all
Unless you don't care at all
But you know I want you
You should stop frontin', babe
