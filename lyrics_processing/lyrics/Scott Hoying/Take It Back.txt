Baby I was delusional, oh maybe I was high
Everything I did for you, I wish I did not
So why don't you hand back over that diamond necklace that I bought
Or I'll take it back all the "I love you"s
I'll take it back all the "honey I'll be there for you"s
Take it back all the "baby you're beautiful"s
I take it back
I'll take it back all the "I'll never leave you"s
Take it back all the "how can I please you"s
Take it back, I take it back, I take it back
All of our romance, it was no good
And you know I would rewind this relationship if I could
All the love we had, well it all went bad
So leave me alone
'Cause I take it back all the "I love you"s
I take it back all the "honey I'll be there for you"s
Take it back all the "baby you're beautiful"s
I take it back
I take it back all the "I'll never leave you"s
Take it back all the "how can I please you"s
Take it back, I take it back, I take it back
You are amazing, you were the light of my life
I couldn't imagine another girl so defined
You were the one I wanted with me all the time
But everything I just said, everything I just said
I said I take it, oh I take it back
I take it back all the "I love you"s
I take it back all the "honey I'll be there for you"s
Take it back all the "baby you're beautiful"s
I take it back (I take it back)
Said I take it back all the "I'll never leave you"s
Take it back all the "how can I please you"s
Take it back, I take it back, I take it back
