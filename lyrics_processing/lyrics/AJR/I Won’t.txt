(Hee-ha-ha-ha)
Put your hands up 'cause I won't
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't
Get your ass up 'cause I won't
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel

Hello, how you doin'? Am I talkin' too fast?
I'm runnin' on adrenaline and one-hour naps
'Cause I do what you tell me to and do it to death
Do it to death

Acapulco, Tel Aviv, and maybe Japan
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death
But I can't do this shit again

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
See AJR LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also like
I don't got a body like I see in the press
So I got to the precipice of pressin' my chest
And now I look impressive with a couple of pecs
Just like my friends

So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, but I digress

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel

So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back (And take a breath)
Acapulco, Tel Aviv, and maybe Japan
(You've come to life, you're bored to death)
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance
(So welcome back and take a breath)
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death
But I can't do this shit again

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my; I won't)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
