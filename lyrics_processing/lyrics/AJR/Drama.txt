When did all my friends become so loud?

Recently he said that she said that we said some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me

So we're caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking
We're caught up in problems
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh, ahh
Hold up, hold up, can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up, but I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking now

We break up with lovers and friends
Make love to the rumors instead
Maybe we're addicted to it all
The drama is dangerous
But it's so exciting to us
