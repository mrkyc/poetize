Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing

It's kinda funny how I paid for college
When YouTube was an option
But then I would've had to spend
My best years
Skipping ads and readin' comments
And when the hell did advertisements get so good?
They're like narcotics
So now I'm spendin' every penny I own
I should have allotted to finishing college


It's kinda funny how I keep debating
If someone's shy or if they hate me
I feel like everyone I know right now
Is hooking up and getting wasted (Without me)
And maybe sex is overrated
But we're too shy to ever say it (Say it)
So we pretend we're all amazing
It's 3 AM, I should be sleeping (Sleeping)

Would you go runnin' if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em, yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no, that's super scary (Ah-ah-ah)
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock (Ah-ah-ah)
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not

It's kinda funny how you vote for someone
To vote for someone to vote for someone
And you might end up with someone evil
But you say that he means well
If I keep on talkin' politics
My friends'll dip, they're over it
If I keep on talkin' politics
I'm Hamilton (Without the hits)

Would you go running if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em, yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no, that's super scary (Ah-ah-ah)
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock (Ah-ah-ah)
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not

Come on, guy

Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Isn't this obvious, am I insane?
Let's blame our parents 'cause they taught us their ways
Stay out of politics, stay on the fence
Stay out of all of it to keep half your fans
Isn't this obvious? Am I insane?
There might be two sides to everything that you say
It's all a bit cloudy, but there's one thing I know
That if you're fuckin' racist, then don't come to my show
(No, we have to do one more)

(Ah)
