I'm ready...

You're feeling good, you're feeling right
Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind
Baby girl, looking fine
Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys
Catch my stare, little smile
Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe
Someday I'll be so damn sublime
We'll arrive behind a hashtag sign

I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
My lady, I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark

I'm ready...

Break me down, dirty jokes
Watch me dear, and say what you wanna know (Say what you wanna know)
Beauty lies, within the eyes
Of the beholder, I'll be holding you close all night

I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name

Break me down, I'm ready, break me down  (Oh, oh, oh)
