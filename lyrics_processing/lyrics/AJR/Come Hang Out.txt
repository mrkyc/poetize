Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard, you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time

I can't complain, no, I won't be mourning
'Cause I skipped on prom for Elvis Duran in the Morning, yeah
All of my life I have been starving
Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist

Yep, yep, I'm gonna miss this someday (I'm gonna miss this someday)
Yep, yep, I missed another Friday
And all my friends say

Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard, you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time

Last album's sales could have been higher
Maybe that's why I haven't seen friends in a while
They're at a bar down in the Bahamas
While I'm doing promo, trying to blow up in Chicago

And come, hang out, we can save you a shot

Or should I follow the click in my ear?
