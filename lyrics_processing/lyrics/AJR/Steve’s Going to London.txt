Steve's goin' to London
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's goin' to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna do?

Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice for someone to miss ya?
Hey-hey, funny how all the things
That you used to like, now they depress ya

While you try to find some meaning in your life before you're gone (Ooh)
There's a song that don't mean anything at all (Ooh)
And it sounds like

Steve's goin' to London
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's goin' to London (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Dan peed in the pool (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?

Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice to see me on TV?
I'd dress to the nines with a smile
And you'd probably think that that was the real me

While you try to find some meaning in your life before you die (Ooh)
Here's a bunch of random shit to waste your time (Ooh)
And it sounds like

I try hard to write a cool song
So I start with somethin' simple like tryin' to put my shoes on
Now somethin' kinda clicked 'cause you relate a bit
But no one's gonna care about a shoe song
I try hard to write a cool song
But I gotta make it matter, so maybe I'll throw the news on
Could I relate the shoes to 2022?
Or maybe an election down in Tucson?
I try throwin' something cool on
So I'm listenin' to Kendrick and playin' the swimming pool song
But why did I do that? 'Cause now I hate my track
I'm quite aware I'll never write a cool song
But who really needs a cool song?
There's so many better melodies, why do you need a new one?
So stop writin' a song about writin' a song
You're losin' their attention, buddy, move on
