Everyone's laughin' at me
But not like they used to
The room's spinnin' all around me
But not like I'm used to

Hired, hired, can I get hired?
I got no skills except gettin' high
I'm tryin', tryin', I can start Friday
You've wasted your life, but thanks for applying

Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
You got older 'cause you're good at life
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help

The DJ is cryin' for help
Don't know what to do with myself
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
The DJ is cryin' for help

Everyone's trippin' on pills
But now they're prescribed too
And everyone's stackin' their bills
But not 'cause they like to

Oh, hired, hired, can I get hired?
Yeah, I fucked up, but I did it my way
I'm tryin', tryin', I can start Friday
Gettin' a life's a little like dyin'

Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
You got older 'cause you're good at life
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help

Don't leave me out
The DJ is cryin' for help
Don't leave me out
Don't know what to do with myself
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
The DJ is cryin' for help
You got older 'cause you're good at life (Don't leave me out)
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help
And now I'm all (I'm all) alone (Alone)
Waitin' for the beat to drop
Be kind to me, be kind and wait it out
And now I'm all (I'm all) alone (Alone)
Waitin' 'til the party starts
Be kind to me, be kind and wait it out

And now I'm all alone
