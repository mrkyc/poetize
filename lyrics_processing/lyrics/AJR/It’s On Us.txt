Nobody knows what you're going through
So you just be you, and I'll be that, too
No one should know if you bleed red or blue
You just bleed you, and I'll sit with you

It's not your fault you don't feel safe
It's not your fault so don't take blame
(No, it's on us)
It's not your fault you don't feel safe
It's not your fault so don't take blame
(No, it's on us)

We can try together
Make it right together
We can fight together
It's on us
Though your trust is stolen
Though your heart is broken
You are never broken
It's on us
Know that it's on us

I wonder where, where your mind goes
Come out of the cold, we'll take the load
And if they hurt you with words so cruel
Here's what we'll do, we'll all fight for you
