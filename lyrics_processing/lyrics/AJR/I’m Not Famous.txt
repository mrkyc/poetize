Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

You've never heard of me
Or the weird shit I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no
And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
'Cause I'm not famous, no

Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go

Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

You never overheard
That I blew twenty grand on shirts
Nobody knows my quirks
'Cause I'm not famous, no
Everyone got their habits
But you'll never hear what mine is
Best thing about my life is I'm not famous, no

Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go

Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
