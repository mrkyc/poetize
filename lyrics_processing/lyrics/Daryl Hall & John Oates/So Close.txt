Hey
Ooh
Ohh

They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved 'cross the floor
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms and out the door (Yes, she did)

Yeah, a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall
Drop a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away

Some people think, if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yeah, I know someone who just heads for the sun
She says "I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young"

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, but we're stuck in today
Baby, we're so close, so close, so far away

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart (So close)
And the dream that pulls us together, girl
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here? (So close)
We gotta fight to keep it together, girl
For the dream, that keeps us

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
So who would of thought, girl, that we'd end up this way?
Getting so close, so close, so far away

So close, so far away (We're living in a dream world)
So close, so far away (But we're livin' today, girl)
So close, so far away (Just you and me, baby)
So close, so far away (Baby, side by, side by, side by)
So close, so far away (Side by, side by side)
So close, so far away (Aah)
So close, so far away
