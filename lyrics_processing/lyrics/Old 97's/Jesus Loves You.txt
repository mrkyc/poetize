Jesus loves you more than I do
Just because He doesn't know you
Not like I do
Jesus says you'll get salvation
If you just keep on waitin'
And readin' the same book
Over and over again

Well, you can talk to Him all night
But I'm right here
He makes wine from water
But I just bought you a beer

You say Jesus loves you
And I say what about me?
Maybe Jesus loves you
But where the hell is he?

He's got the power and the glory
He's got a pretty kick-ass story
And what do I got?
I got the hots for you
You might also likeHe's got the whole world in His hands
I've got a Lone Star in cans
And I'm bringin' one over to you
And I'm sittin' down next to you
I'm not discountin' the Sermon on the Mount
And oh, when I was little you know
They dunked me in the fountain
They told me I was born again
But since then I've been torn
And when I think about making love with you
I know it would be more than sin
I'm a real person
A real live person
You could do a whole lot worse than
Ending up with me then
Even though I'm a heathen
Not everybody out there is
Connecting like we've been
I'll take you to the river
Let me take you to the river
I will deliver you

Pray to Him all night
But I'm your man
He can walk on water
But I'll kiss you on the sand
You say Jesus loves you
And I say what about me?
Maybe Jesus loves you
But where the hell is he?
You say Jesus loves you
I say what about me?
Maybe Jesus loves you
But where the hell is he?
Jesus loves you more than I do
Just because He doesn't know you
