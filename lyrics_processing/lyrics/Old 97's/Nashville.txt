Back in May of '99
It was fucked up at the time
But I figured we'd keep trying
Her brother and her dad
They were spittin' mad
When I packed up what I had
And took off runnin' it was bad
It was mean, I didn't care
And it's gotten me nowhere
So I'm trying to be a better man
I turned left turns into right
I turned sunshine into night
I got my ass kicked every fight
No, I couldn't get it right
I built castles out of sand
I didn't understand
Why everything I planned
Ran like whiskey off my hands
And my hands were never clean
Things I wish I'd never seen
I'd do anything to wake up
From this motherfuckin' dream
You might also likeWho do I got to blow
To get into this fucking show
It's dark in there I know
And I got nowhere else to go
Well I need a place to hide
So I put away my pride
And come inside
'Cause I'm tired of runnin'
And there's a universe that's floating out in space
And I look up there and I can't find my face
And I'm seeing my reflection backstage
Writing down the same old words on the same old page
Who do I got to blow
To get into this fucking show?
It's dark in there I know
And I got nowhere else to go
Well I need a place to hide
So I put away my pride
And come inside
'Cause I'm tired of runnin'
Who do I got to blow
To get into this fucking show?
It's dark in there I know
And I got nowhere else to go
Well I need a place to hide
So I put away my pride
And come inside
'Cause I'm tired of runnin'
Come inside 'cause I'm tired of runnin'
