And I don't think I can do it anymore
Well, I'd say you're on my mind
But I'm not the thinkin' kind
And I don't think I can do it anymore

Well, it started six months back
When you faked that heart attack
But I brought you back and I put you in my bed
Must have been playin' sick
'Cause you sure got better quick
When you asked me for my love, here's what I said
"Sure, you can stay, if you don't get in the way"
What's a stupid boy like me to do?

Well, I'm sick and tired of making love with you
Whoa yeah, I'm sick and tired of making love with you

Wakin' up with you
Is like catching the flu
Well, the best I can do is go back to sleep
You might also likeWell, I'd say I like you here
But I ain't had that much beer
And I'd be lyin' and the price for that is steep
But it don't matter what I don't say
'Cause I know you're gonna stay
What's a stupid boy like me to do?

Well, I'm sick and tired of making love with you
Whoa yeah, I'm sick and tired of making love with you


Breakin' up with you
Would be the smart thing to do
But I'm not smart, it's half past two and you're still here
See, I like the way you moan
God forbid I should sleep alone
So forgive me if I don't sound insincere
But in the morning you'll be gone
You won't ever hear this song
It's the best a stupid boy like me could do
Well, I'm sick and tired of making love with you
Whoa yeah, I'm sick and tired of making love with you
Whoa yeah, I'm sick and tired of making love
I'm sick and tired of making love
