We've been doing this longer than you've been alive
Propelled by some mysterious drive
And they still let me do it as weird as that seems
And I do it most nights and then again in my dreams
Infinite hallways and giant hotels
Dressing room looks about as good as it smells
Bottles of whisky and bottles of beer
There's a bottle of medicine somewhere round here
We've been in nightclubs and we've been in bars
Honky-tonks and theaters from Memphis to Mars
Most of our shows were a triumph of rock
Although some nights I might have been checking the clock
I'm only human though I'm super at times
I jump off of risers I should not have climbed
Rock jumps won't kill you until one of them does
Well they'll say "He died doing what he loves"
We got our share of loving in our past
Although we were all looking for someone who'd last
Well, it must be hard to get partnered with me
Some narcissism, some OCD
Well love that comes easy's a fake or a fluke
Love is a marathon, sometimes you puke
Speaking of which there has been alcohol
Oceans and oceans, but that isn't all
Mountains of weed, a handful of pills
None of the hard stuff, that shit kills
We've been doing it longer than you've been alive
Twenty good years of about twenty-five

Rock 'n' roll's been very very good to me
The open road's the only place I wanna be
I'm not crazy about songs that get self-referential
And most of this stuff should be kept confidential
Aw but who even gives half a fuck anymore
You should know the truth, it's both a blast and a bore
Rock stars were once such mythical creatures
Up there with Presidents, playmates and preachers
Aw now you just do it cause it's what you do
They throw underwear instead of money at you
Now I've made a living out of shaking my ass
And if you offer me an office, I'd have to pass
But our jobs are all jobs, and sometimes they suck
I love what I do, and I've had pretty good luck
All the fans are all clapping screaming and squealing
And I won't lie to you, that's a pretty sweet feeling
And I might butt heads with the guys in my band
But I never once went to work for The Man
The men and the woman like you have been hurt
We're sharing this night that will soon be a blur
We've been doing this longer than you've been alive
Get on the bus, and tell the driver to dri-i-ive

The only place I wanna be
Oh yeah
