Man, I had a terrible day
I couldn't stop gettin' in my own way
Time to blow my pay, I need a drink
Move your ass cause that's my stool
Pour one Bass, no, make it two
Don't need no lip from you, I need a drink

Fire up the generator, hoist the flag and set the sails
Tonight ain't gonna be here very long
Take a picture now cause pretty soon it's going to hell
I'll kick your ass if you don't sing along
Let's sing a drinkin' song

Today I'm sitting on top of the world
I got a phone number from a tattooed girl
She seems just like the first
Let's have a drink
Climbed a hill on a motorbike
Heard a new song by an old band I like
I like it better than I thought I might
Let's have a drink
You might also like
Fire up the generator, hoist the flag and set the sails
Tonight ain't gonna be here very long
Take a picture now cause pretty soon it's going to hell
Don't put another sad record on
Let's sing a drinkin' song
Hell yes hell yes hell yes hell yes
RIght on right on right on
Let's celebrate our sickness
Give in to our weakness
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
And sing a drinkin' song


Fire up the generator, hoist the flag and set the sails
Tonight ain't gonna be here very long
Take a picture now cause pretty soon it's going to hell
All these drunken broken hearts can't be wrong
Let's sing a drinkin' song
Hell yes hell yes hell yes hell yes
RIght on right on right on
Let's celebrate our sickness
Give in to our weakness
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
And sing a drinkin' song
Hell yes hell yes hell yes hell yes
RIght on right on right on
Let's celebrate our sickness
Give in to our weakness
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
And line 'em up and knock 'em down
And line 'em up and knock 'em down
