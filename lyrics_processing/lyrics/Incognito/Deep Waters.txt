Is it a crime for me to be feeling this way
I'm going out of my mind
And there's no change from a runaway love
Is it a dream (is it a dream)
That I'm throwing in the wishing well
I'm losing control body and soul
Standing here waiting for a train that may never come

I saw the signs I read the book
I should've have had a second look
But boy you caught me dreaming
And there were times you'd come around
And we'd agreed just to be friends
Tell me who was foolin' who

Deep waters
I'm drownin' in
Deep waters
Slowly drownin' in deeper
(Repeat)

What do I say (What can I say?)
When words have failed me before
What do I do when I'm feeling so blue
And there's no place for me to run and hide

I saw the sun inside your smile
And wished for more than just a while
Cause boy you caught me dreaming
A giant step into the dark
We threw caution to the wind
Tell me who was foolin' who

Deep waters
I'm drownin' in
Deep waters
Slowly drownin' in deeper
(Repeat)

Mmm... I'm drownin'
Deeper deeper deeper
I'm drownin' in deeper

Oh I saw the signs I read the book
I should have had a second look
Cause boy you caught me dreamin'
And there are times you come around
And we'd agreed to just be friends
Tell me who was foolin' foolin' who
Oh
Deep waters
I'm drownin' in
Deep waters
Slowly drownin' in deeper
(Repeat)
Deep waters
I'm drownin' in
Deep waters
Slowly drownin' in deeper
(Repeat)

Deeper deeper deeper
I'm drownin' in deeper
(Drownin' in, drownin' in, drownin' in, drownin' in)
Deeper deeper deeper
So deep is the water
