If I'm a fool for loving you it's the way I want it
Keep me a prisoner for your love
There's no place I'd rather be, it's the way I planned it
You can gladly throw away the key yea

Babe you got something something that I need
Babe you got something that brings me back for more
What you doing don't stop
You're the one, the only one
What you doing don't stop
You're the one for me
Just say nothing no baby hold me close
Just say nothing I don't wish for nothing more
Or there's nothing, nothing that I know
Or there's nothing, that compares to you yea

Take a chance, make it last, it's the way I like it
I'm not going to try to hide my love
All the things you do to me, babe you know I need it
Just keep on doing what you do to me

Babe you got something, something that I need
Babe you got something, that brings me back for more
What you doing don't stop
You're the one the only one
What you doing don't stop
You're the one for me
