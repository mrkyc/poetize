But I don't want to fight about it baby
Even though I know our loves true
We kind of lost the feeling maybe
It's not your fault or mine, we keep wasting our time both reprimanding
And demanding
It hurts me I won't lie
Can't we give one more try
What we need is a little understanding
Don't turn around baby don't you doubt
Don't walk away cause we can work it out
Baby we've been here before
Even closer to that door
Baby kiss me let's fall in love again
Come closer now cause i don't want to fight
I can think of better ways that we can spend the night
Baby we've been here before
Even closer to that door
Baby kiss me let's fall in love again
Hey girl come tell me everything
You feel inside
There's no wrong and no right when we fight just our pride
Baby kiss me let's fall in love again

Wanna spend my life with you

Baby please listen cause the words I say are true
Don't walk away cause we can work it out
Baby we've been here before
Even closer to that door

Come closer now cause I don't want to fight
I can think of better ways that we can spend the night
