And autumn leaves do fall
Oh, it sometimes rains in paradise
And even the warmest heart can turn to ice
I know it happens to us all
Every kind of people fall
And after all the tears are gone
Do we have the heart to carry on

Here and now, still somehow
Still a friend of mine, oh you're still a
Friend of mine
Still a friend of mine, you're still a friend
Of mine
Still a friend of mine, oh you're still a
Friend of mine
Oh
To think of all the times I hurt you
And never thought it through
Oh, I treated you so badly baby
Could such a cruel heart ever be free
I know it happens to us all
Every kind of people fall
Oh, and after all is said and done
Do we have the heart to carry on
