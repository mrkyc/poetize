There's truth in the love
I know He said to the blind man, open your eyes and see
And I know He said to the lame man, stand up and follow Me
I know he walked on the water
Said look at what faith will do
He turned the water into wine
And fed all the multitude

Well, how do you know?
I just know by the way I feel
How do you know?
I just know 'cause the joy is real
How do you know?
I just know 'cause I've been set free
And there's truth in the love He gave to me

I didn't get in at the Sunday school
When they tried to put the fear in me
Talking 'bout fire and brimstone and burning in eternity
I didn't get it when they came knocking
Insisting on witnessing to me
And I sure didn't get it from no TV preacher
Trying to get all my money

Well, how do you know?
I just know by the way I feel
How do you know?
I just know 'cause the joy is real
How do you know?
I just know 'cause I've been set free
And there's truth in the love He gave to me

I've been taking a good long look around
A good long look around
Taking an honest evaluation
He's a friend I know, I know
In any situation
Oh I betcha can't beat that
Oh I betcha can't beat that
What a real good best friend I got
Real good best friend I got
There's truth in the love
There's truth in the love, there's truth in the love

He made it easy enough I do believe
To get it all together
Gave you the right to do wrong
Made you wise enough to know better
Said he'd never ever force his will on you
He'll lay down a heavy suggestion but it's gotta be you
Well, how do you know
I just know by the way I feel
How do you know
I just know 'cause the joy is real
How do you know
I just know 'cause I've been set free
And there's truth in the love He gave to me

I've been searchin' and I think I've found the right way
Somebody why don't you ask me
Ask me and I'll tell you
How do you know?
My God sure loves to celebrate
How do you know?
I found the truth in the love affair with my Jesus
How do you know?
Me and my love takin' care of business
How do you know?
Got Him on the mainline talkin' it over
How do you know?
It's all about lovin'
How do you know?
Whoa, whoa, whoa I just know that
How do you know?
Another praise for His heavenly glory
