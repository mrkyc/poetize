Hey, what became of my head
The beats in my heart, the jokes that I said?
I guess all these false starts
Of a puzzle you can't finish 'cause you're missing the best parts
And don't you fear, I'm bringing you home
Out of this pit where I left you alone
In this horrible mess that I made
But I guess that's what you get when you're not paying attention

So baby, welcome back to the man you've been missing
Baby, welcome back to confusing, perplexing

We all go up in flames
Going out in style
And Heaven help us
Hope that Hell will let us rest for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames
Going out in style
Am I out of my head to think
The world could start believing me when I am dead?

I was a mess of a man with washed up excuses
I know, I know part of the confusion is me
We both agree
That I wasn't the man that you needed me to be
But, oh, how I changed and oh, how I've grown
But could she believe me when I've got nothing to show?
My everything, she needs to see
The choice is hers to believe in me

So baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop
Baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop

We all go up in flames
Going out in style
And Heaven help us
Hope that Hell will let us rest for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames
Going out in style
Am I out of my head to think
The world could start believing me when I am, I am dead?

You and me, we're not enemies, I'm begging
If anything, all we are, we are
In harmony, sing with me, I plead
Oh, if I can make things right then this will be our night
The world against you and I
We all go up in flames
Go out in style, style

We all go up in flames
Going out in style
And Heaven help us
Hope that Hell will let us rest for just a little while, yeah
We all go up in flames
Going out in style
Am I out of my head to think
The world could start believing me when I am dead?
