Carry them over your shoulders, you fear
The absence, the void you'll cause
When you choose to leave them all here
There's no turning back, it's time that you steer
The wide open stares back alone at the cusp
The self that you thought you lost
The shine that burned well into rust
You can't hear my voice 'cause I'm not loud enough

Believe me, when I say
It's a long way back from here
Goodbye for now

Hang on, it's clear
That the road's about to get rough
Oh, can you hear
The ringing it's left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us, I choose to give it all up
You want me here?
Well, then ask me to stay

The glistening wet concrete, the heat off the road
The clamoring hands and the bus you call home
This is it, believe what you want
In this space, I don't fit
The same day repeats with the things that you see
Dirty dressing room carpets and broken TVs
Is this it?
In this water I'll tread 'til the day that I'm dead

Hang on, it's clear
That the road's about to get rough
Oh, can you hear
The ringing it's left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us, I choose to give it all up
You want me here?
Well, then ask me to stay

Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes
Mile marker, minutes, hours
If this is it and there is no more
And you believe that's true
It's a long way back from here
There's no going home

Hang on, it's clear
That the road's about to get rough
Oh, can you hear
The ringing it's left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us, I choose to give it all up
You want me here?
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes)
