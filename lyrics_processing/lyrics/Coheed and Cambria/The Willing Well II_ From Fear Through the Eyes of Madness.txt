What is this that I feel
And what is this that I fear?
In these arms that whored out
Amongst the worms that mate in these fields
Oh, from pressure to pain, I wish to stay awake
In the measure I test with your love for me
To shout against these walls
With hope that one will break free
So hear me...

What is this that you keep selling me, boy?
I'm not gonna hold your hand here, when you walk
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
I'm not gonna hold your hand here, when you walk
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out

So picture this face and burn it to flake
To shelter it at home, at the fireplace
And all but memory will fade
With the flick of the flame
So, I have a secret
That no one should know, that I shouldn't tell
But of all the, but of all the worlds
This one won't feel, this one just won't leave me well

What is this shit you keep selling me, boy?
I'm not gonna hold your hand here, when you walk
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
I'm not gonna hold your hand here when you walk
You'll burn in Hell, while they're digging you out
You'll burn in Hell...


In the press of your back
Do you feel the shore swell?
Oh boy, I'm eating my way back home
In the press of your back
Do you feel the shore swell's good?
Oh boy, I'm eating my way back home


As father told son, in the make of his final escape
Should all good boys die
With God at their side at the grace of His gates?
No, the Robot holds none
With a mind and a heart to comply
Then I will disguise and grieve of those dead
When I'm given the time
Run, little rabbit
Go, hide in the blades of that grass
Run, rabbit, run

Should capture be our earnest fault
Breathe up through lust, I'll find your cure
In there, I'll kill, kill her
In there, I'll kill, kill, kill her

With your last breath of air
As the earth comes trembling down
Would you give her this last night
And give up your life?
With your last breath of air
As the earth comes trembling down
Would you give her this last night
The love of your life?
