In those discouraging day, I always missed the mark
When we were comfort and close, I would neglect to keep (Ooh)
You safe and unexposed, a portrait of time repeats
This moment now replaced with an empty wish to give, I give, I gave

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This selfish war machine
Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life with someone else?
I promise you, there is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me

Now in your absence, I wade through the coursing, lonely, lost
And in this tragic dismay, I never could believe what I became

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This welcomed war machine
Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life with someone else?
I promise you, there is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me

I couldn't give you what you needed
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh)
It's all my fault
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh)
Too coward to believe I lost it all
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh)

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This selfish war machine
Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life with someone else?
I promise you, there is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me
Here, in the dark side of me

"You fought to withdraw from a location which has incited severe, quantifiable pain, and nearly terminated the mission; nearly terminated your life
Yet, you desire to set a course back to it
I am not equipped to comprehend human rationale
Sirius, Is this what love is?"
