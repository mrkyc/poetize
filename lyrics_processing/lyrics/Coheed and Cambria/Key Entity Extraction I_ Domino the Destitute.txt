If you had the courage to stop me from turning
Into what would be the worst in everybody's eyes
Hey, I'm no angel or the devil of your conscience
To tell you who to be, good, bad, ugly, or otherwise
If you had good common sense
Your choices would be gleaming, flawless
I want no part in this self-deprecating
Worthless chemistry

We made our beds to lie in them, proud
Proud of our great mistakes
This warring knife, the flash of its blade
Turn, about-face
I implore you, brother
Don't walk away, don't walk away from me
'Cause this is our war

Oh, you think they have it all
While you were left with nothing
Oh, oh, you've taken the fall
For them to walk all over
You made your bed
So soft and comforting
These dreams await
The grey good morning

Proud of our great mistakes
This warring knife, the flash of its blade
Turn, about-face
I implore you, brother
Don't walk away, don't walk away from me
'Cause this is our war

Oh, we've got you by the throat
Ha-ha-ha, all you wanna be...
Welcome all, to the everlasting all-time low
Please put your hands together
For the ever-failing one man show...
Domino
Ladies and broken gentlemen
The undisputed champ of misery
Oh, and in this corner, we find his challenger
The pride of utopia, the greatest thing ever


If you could recall one moment of your past
That defined you to be, that made you the man
We've come to love, all of the above
This disaster binds us, absolute
A thousand lies, you tell yourself
That no one ever loved you right
Oh, but I would do anything for you
The question fits the question mark
Your signals crossed, your message lost
Ha-ha!
"Well, this has been an extraordinary change of events, as two great champions at the fight to the finish find themselves in their last and final round! The fight now being deemed around the world as the upset of the century, let's get back to the brawl and in the fray! The fighters meet in the center of the ring, the challenger swings to the right, quick with a left hook across Domino's jaw, followed by a crushing strike to the body - OH! He might have took another left- his hook sends Domino into the ropes! The Challenger lands a devastating combo followed by a driving hook that sends Domino to the floor. The crowd's on their feet, the ref's called the fight - he's out! He's out!"

This wall won't hold, forever
Your time has come, it's now or never

We made our beds to lie in them, proud
Proud of our great mistakes
This warring knife, the flash of its blade
Turn, about-face
I implore you, brother
Don't walk away, don't walk away from me
'Cause this is our war

One by one
We are together! We fall together!
One by one
We are together! We fall together!
Now, my brother, don't be afraid
We are together! We are together!
Brother...
