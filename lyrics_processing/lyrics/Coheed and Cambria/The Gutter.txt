Over my dead body
The stars will let you know
It's over
Now, if I had my way
I would leave you here to waste your final days
Buried beneath
(With the possibility of how things could be)
Oh, please rest assured
This was not my fault and time is getting short
So, I'll be here if you want me
(Beaten and covered in a red so bloody)
Oh, my darling, can you hear?
My words so pure they burn your lying ears

And so the story goes
When I leave
Will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance, honey, better (Call your mother)
All hope is lost
Down in the gutter

When you're in your bed
Sleeping toward the void so deep it feels like death
Oh, don't you
(Wake, wake)
Oh, my love, I hear
Life holds nothing for us beyond our time in here
Oh, don't you dare turn your back on me
(No use running when the bad guy's coming)

Oh, I think you've got me pegged as the wrong man
Oh, I think you've got me pegged

And so the story goes
When I leave
Will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance, honey, better (Call your mother)
All hope is lost
Down in the gutter

Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ooh, ah
We were better together
I know that much, oh, can't you see
Through the bad and the good
We had all the luck
The devil's got nothing on us
You and me
Baby, over my dead body
Baby, over my dead body
Baby, over my dead body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're still counting on you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll keep counting on you
Mother, come on out
Show me what the world is all about
And we'll keep counting on you
Mother, come on out
Show me what the world is all about
And we'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep (We'll keep fighting)

Oh, I think you've got me pegged as the wrong man
Oh, I think you've got me pegged
And so the story goes
When I leave
Will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance, honey, better (Call your mother)
All hope is lost
