Wait! There's never been a mess like this
No more hands to hold
When the page turns tomorrow, with the hurt to give up
Curse us, as God has (sold us)
Believe me
Hell has no room for your crime (here)
So beat me
'Til the blood and the bone finds our end near

Bye-bye, world
Or will our hope still hold on?
Boy, you're never going to see
The things that'll come of these (days)

(Raise your hands high!) Young brothers and sisters
There's a world's worth of work and a need for you
Oh, change is coming, feel these doors now closing in
Is there no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today?

So march to the drumming, show them you're coming
You've been their play (toy)
Cut to the carving, bleed them 'til robbing
Enough, they'll take no more

You've been given all the power, boy, now go and make your move
Curse us, these gods aren't faking
Have mercy on the cowards, boys, they'll pray to have you lose
Help us, this world's now breaking
So now, they've noticed all you've given in sound
Let us in, let us in
Give me love over life, the sweet soft of ground
Let us in, let us in, now

Bye-bye, world
Or will our hope still hold on?
Boy, you're never going to see
The things that'll come of these (days)

(Raise your hands high!) Young brothers and sisters
There's a world's worth of work and a need for you
Oh, change is coming, feel these doors now closing in
Is there no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today?

So march to the drumming, show them you're coming
You've been their play (toy)
Cut to the carving, bleed them 'til robbing
Enough, they'll take no more
In the light we'll sing, as all hurt must bring
In the falling cusp of all broken things
In the coming dusk, you will call on us
And unite we must. I'm the Crowing, thus!
You all think you've figured me out, do as I say
Your words mean nothing at all, so now, I lay
I said, "Come, Momma! Come, Momma! As I need"
I said, "Come, Momma! Come, Momma! Watch it bleed"
Oh, what did I do to deserve all of this?
What did I do to deserve all of you?

(Raise your hands high!) Young brothers and sisters
There's a world's worth of work and a need for you
Oh, change is coming, feel these doors now closing in
Is there no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today?

Bye-bye, world
