Here, sleep
At the bottom of Hell
Your time has come to pick the road
You'll walk in this tale
Turned
And as a coward, you've learned
Through sickness and health, there's only one
Now go and bite your tongue

You'll just say the worst of me, with a hope they'd understand
No, they know you're just a boy, so grow up and be a man
Little baby, oh, kick and you scream and whine
Victims pay the price, eventually
The cost? Let's see... your life
You've got nothing to prove
Stay afraid, young brother
You've got nothing to prove

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Their sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools
Don't cry anymore

A fear sleeps
Inside your stomach, it swells
A torn boy alone, in need of fix
And the pinch that cures the itch
For too long
This little baby's cried on
For tomorrow, we'll sing the words and song
Of a time we're glad's long gone

You'll just say the worst of me, with a hope they'll understand
No, they know you're just a boy, so grow up and be that man
Little baby, kick and you scream and whine
Victims pay the price, eventually
The cost? Let's see... your life
You've got nothing to prove
Stay afraid, young brother
You've got nothing to prove

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools
Don't cry
Mother Superior, come catch the rabbit, he runs
My how've you been?
You're frightened of leaving this truly gone-fishing amalgam
Go fetch your gun

Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel
Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one
Tonight, you'll find the right
In the pull of the trigger, now bite
Young fools
Don't cry (Oh, oh)

Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
When you're sick to the stomach, just pull out the knife, oh no
Don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
Not anymore, don't cry, boy
