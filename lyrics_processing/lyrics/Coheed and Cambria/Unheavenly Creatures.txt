We were young and had it all figured out
She was the quiet one and I had the mouth
Until she fell to me (Ooh, oh)
We escaped through the alley in the back
Judge told me, "Creature, don't you dare go back!"
But I couldn't dodge the ringing in my head
Her lonely, subtle voice, through the echoes as it said
"Please don't leave me here, my love"

Oh, pretty angel
Swinging from your cable
I fear, my dear, the end is near
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun
Did anybody treat you better?
To obey and follow to the letter
I fear, my dear, the end is here
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun

There was something I forgot to tell her then
Between the kiss and, "Knock 'em dead, kid"
"There will be no other like you" (Oh, oh)
Now I can't keep the guilt from my heart (Ooh)
These stuttering emotions keep me fixed to fall apart
And I know I'm leaving all this sweat in our bed
A broken heart bleeding with a gun to my head

Oh, pretty angel
Swinging from your cable
I fear, my dear, the end is near
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun
Did anybody treat you better?
To obey and follow to the letter
I fear, my dear, the end is here
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun

Like a son of a gun
A son of a gun
The weight of the world on the shoulders, can you feel the thunder?
All unheavenly creatures (Oh, oh, all the unheavenly creatures)
We're all unheavenly creatures
On the way to the car, I heard her voice a little louder
"Please don't leave me here, my love"

Oh, pretty angel
Swinging from your cable
I fear, my dear, the end is near
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun
Did anybody treat you better?
To obey and follow to the letter
I fear, my dear, the end is here
So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun
Oh, pretty angel
