We carried on, unnoticed
Thinking that all dreams were ours for the taking
And out of that, we found ourselves back at the start of it all
So scarred and incomplete
Only now, I've come to this moment in my life
Fitting pieces to a puzzle with no regrets
But if I had just one chance left
I'd hold on to her close, with what little confidence I have
And make no mistakes, as your life's surely about to change
For the better half

Now, on your marks, get set, clock starts to count
'Cause boy, everything's about to go down

So sleep tight, little Atlas
'Cause when your daddy goes off, just you know
That you're the weight of his anchor
The love that is guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home

Oh, I've had my share of leaving this retreat
But never did it once feel anything
Like you, you see
And if there's one good thing that comes from my away
It's that you won't be anything like me
Oh, and so better for it, you will be

So sleep tight, little Atlas
'Cause when your daddy goes off, just you know
That you're the weight of his anchor
The love that is guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home
The love that's guiding him home
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


So sleep tight, little Atlas
'Cause when your daddy goes off, just you know
That you're the weight of his anchor
The love that is guiding him home
So sleep tight, little Atlas
'Cause when your daddy goes off, 'cause when your daddy goes off
That you're the weight of his anchor
The love that is guiding him home

There's no running away from what's been done, here
Will you sink with the ship, or will you burn it down?
Now, give us the man that you've been hiding
'Cause this is your, this is your life, this is your life, now
There's no running away from what's been done, here
Will you sink with the ship, or will you burn it down?
Now, give us the man that you've been hiding
'Cause this is your, this is your life, this is your life, now
This is your life, now
This is your life, now
