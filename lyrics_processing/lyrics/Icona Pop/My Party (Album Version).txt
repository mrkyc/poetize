Got no ice, DJ's not here and I've called him more than twice, but he won't pick up
Where the guys? I've had a couple of friends come, not the ones I really like
What the fuck?

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry... yeah yeah yeah

I was gonna do it big, make it live for a hundred nights
I put my best dress on, overpriced, now the zipper broke in the back so my crack's hanging out
I wish they'd all go home

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry... yeah yeah yeah

Bottles are flying, vodca, courvois 'n' lime, shots of patron, rocky on ice
I'm a star, I gotta be fly n, watches be shining, proper defiant, it's my party
I'll style if I want, man of the moments, Smiler's the one
Man know that I be too, dope in the flesh, looking like a man has been riped from a GQ-page
Gage what I been about, lb's on the feet, rips in my Diesels
Hard in the paint, big body whips
Couple o' Melissa Fords round me, big body chicks
Mannikin status it's real over this side fam
Man have never been actors, Smiler the rapvillain
The portfolio - what's happening
The black Romeo god, we own the block
The king o' this musical ish, S.M and Icona Pop

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry... yeah yeah yeah
Uh huh, uh huh
