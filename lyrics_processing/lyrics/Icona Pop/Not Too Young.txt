It's getting old
So many suggestions
On my direction
Where I should go
They say "Hey little girl in this world you will learn when you're older
Don't rush how you feel cause you know when it's real in time"
I don't mean to be rude but I know that we don't live forever
So I'm gonna go with my heart cause a heart don't lie
They say I'm young
But I'm not too young, to know what love is, to know what love is
They say I'm young
But I'm not too young, to know what love is, to know what love is
Oh

Got all the answers
Miss know it all (miss know it all)
Please quit with your predictions
On my decisions
I'll make my own
