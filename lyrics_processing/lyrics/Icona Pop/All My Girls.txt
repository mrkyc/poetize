There's nobody like you
You're not just a girl
Keep walking on tall
Yeah, show the world
Don't cover your flaws
The part of who we are
You got nothing to hide
Just wear it with pride, wear it with pride

All together as one
I'm on your side
Guess who light up the night
When you flash that smile
Sing it up to the rafters
To the back of the crowd
All my girls, yeah we got this
Sing it out loud
