Ice cream dreams made of me
No regrets, you got it
Feel my needs, come find me
Read my lips, you got it

You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

Stick your tongue out
Lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it
Stick your tongue out
Lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it
Lick it, lick it, lick it

Ice cream dreams made of me
No regrets, you got it
Feel my needs, come find me
Read my lips, you got it
