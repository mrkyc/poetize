You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
You hate my love, because you're dead without it
You love my love, you know you'll never find better love
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it

Oh, you couldn't live without me
I didn't ask why, but then why should I?
Oh, guess I was fine without you
But when I saw you suffer, you couldn't do without
Had to find out what that was all about

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(And I don't want you to)
You hate my love, because you're dead without it
(You got me, good for you)
You love my love, you know you'll never find better love
(And I don't want  you to)
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it
(You got me, good for you)

Oh, you had to do the hard work
You had to play me, I didn't disagree
You said you lost your number, and now you needed mine
That's all you got, now get it right this time

(You got me, good for you)

You got me wondering why
Didn't we just play rough for the night
You got me wondering why
Shouldn't we call it a night

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(And I don't want you to)
You hate my love, because you're dead without it
