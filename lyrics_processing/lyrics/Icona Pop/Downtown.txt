We walk the streets of the suburbs
You hold my hand like it's all I need
We kiss in the woods behind your parents' place
I whisper "I'll tell you 'bout my dreams"

Can we keep it simple?
Just give me what I need
I like you better when we go

Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown)
Like you better when we go
Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown, downtown, downtown)

I need to feel you love me my way
Get me going baby
You should know by now I like you
I like you when you kiss me downtown

We walk the streets in a circle
We know every corner by heart
Subway south, and I'm outta here
Are you in? Are you out?
You might also like
Loving me is simple
Just give me what I need
I like you better when we go

Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown)
Like you better when we go
Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown, downtown, downtown)

I need to feel you love me my way
Get me going baby
You should know by now I like you
I like you when you kiss me downtown

Can't we keep it simple?
Just give me what I need
I like you better when we go

Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown)
Like you better when we go
Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown, downtown, downtown)
Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown)
Like you better when we go
Downtown, downtown
I like you when you kiss me downtown (town, town, downtown, downtown, downtown)
