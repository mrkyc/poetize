I asked, are you alright? He said, You mean my physical or mental health?
He held up his hand and said, It doesn't matter I'm just thankful that you care
A lot of people pass me by, most of them completely unaware
You can't see my future, know my past or feel the gravel in my shoes
I don't compare my suffering. We're all just different shades of black and blue
I've thought myself unworthy, been a shadow, felt my sanity was lost
But I somehow found the courage and the strength
To keep me working on these Knots
He looked down at the filament. Then held it up and asked what I could see
There's memories that hurt so much in there my brain has hidden them from me
I thought of cutting bait, but in my mind it was a coward's way to go
I gave up cigarettes and pills and booze to keep from killing myself slow
You can't see my future, know my past or feel the gravel in my shoes
I don't compare my suffering. We're all just different shades of black and blue
I've thought myself unworthy, been a shadow, felt my sanity was lost
But I found the strength and courage, and the grace
To keep me working on these Knots
Sometimes one unravels and reveals me to myself
And sometimes I can manage running headlong into hell
Other times, not so much
He didn't want my money or my pity. He was happy just to talk
So we talked a little more of peace and war before I went on with my walk
My handshake couldn't thank him for his service, but I think he knew my mind
We saw ourselves a little clearer in a mirror made of hope and fishing line
You can't see my future, know my past or feel the gravel in my shoes
I don't compare my suffering. We're all just different shades of black and blue
I've thought myself unworthy, been a shadow, felt my sanity was lost
But I found the strength and courage, and the grace
To keep me working on these Knots
