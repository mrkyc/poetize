This is a whining song
And the perfect timing song

Baby girl me love how you whine
And the way that you whining for me
Baby girl me love how you move
And the way that you whine it for me
Baby girl me love how you whine
And the way that you whining for me
Baby girl me love how you move

Shambam there
Better than them
Physically speaking
Oko better than them
Spiritually beeing
Oko higher than them
Higher than them
Higher than them

So just whining proper
Girl you know say you a show stopper
And the way you move
Girl no other
Girl your thing turn me to a big pauper
No no
So whine baby now
Girl me never know
You got the formula
The thing you give me girl
It make me coming back
If I tell a man me I reconsider
Me I reconsider
She-She
She keep the thing on speed dial
Special kind of whining
So superfly
