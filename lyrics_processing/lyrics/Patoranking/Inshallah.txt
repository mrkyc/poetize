After the rain, the sun will shine
After the pain, it's blessing time
Don't go insane 'cause it's not your time
Big up the man dem pon the other side doing time
Me and my guys we go reach there (Reach there)
One day, one day we go reach there (Reach there)
Yes, yes, yes, we go reach there (Reach there)
Rich, rich, rich, rich this year (This year)
