I've been lyin' to keep you from this pain
Now you're cryin', and to know that I'm to blame
And I'll miss you, but it's over now
I'm so sorry that it had to be this way
Please don't hate me
But there's nothing you can say to change my mind
I've got to go

(Where's the guy that I fell for?
He wanted more and more)

Bye bye boyfriend, it's time that I'd be on my way
Bye bye boyfriend, I used to like the way you'd say
Baby, back it up, lay downward
It was fun, but it couldn't last forever
Bye bye, pretty boy friend
It's time to, it's time to pack it up
Baby, cause it's over now

Let me tell you how it was when we started off
With your tattoos and your lip pierced
And raggedy style you used to rock
Lately, everything you do and say is messed up
Things have changed, down is up, we're outta luck
And baby, I'm sorry that it had to be this way
Please don't hate me
But there's nothing you can say to change my mind
I've got to go

It's time to, it's time to pack it up
Baby, cause it's over now

You never put the effort into things that really counted
Word here, and a kiss there
Could change the way it's turning out
You worked so hard at all the things I never cared about
And your hands worked and your fingers moving, and you're eyes wide shut
And baby, I'm lonely, though you're right in front of me
You controlled me, that was the girl I used to be
Gave up myself, it's over now

I'm backing up, baby, cause it's over now
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty boyfriend
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Baby, back it up, lay downward
It was fun, but it couldn't last forever
Bye bye, pretty boy
It's time to, it's time to pack it up
