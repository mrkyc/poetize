Touch me, it's such a beautiful reaction
Shining like the sun
I want more, and I'm craving satisfaction, but it never comes
You say it's love but it feels like a drug
And I want you so much, but it only makes me hate you
You pick me up just to thrown me down
Yeah, you're my habit now and I just have to break you

Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
I feel you stepping on my wings
I would anything to get you off, to get you off of my back

A warm rush jammin' up like a freeway when I'm next to you
Sweet stuff, and it's running through each vein
When I'm next to you
It sounds dumb but it leaves me numb
Till I don't know what I want, but I'm needing your protection
You're so hot and you love me a lot
But what we've got feels more like an addiction

Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
I said, hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
I feel you stepping on my wings
I would anything to get you off, to get you off of my back
You might also like
I've been living lately like I'm dying all the time
Might do something crazy like
Jumping off the Hollywood sign
Cause boy, you make me feel like I can fly, yeah


You say it's love but it feels like a drug
And I want you so much, but it only makes me hate you
Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
I said, hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah, get off of my back
I caught you stepping on my wings
And I would anything to get you off, to get you off of my back
Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, you, you, yeah, yeah
Get off of my back
