Your face is all I ever see on this crowded street
Like no one's watching, you don't care to act a fool with me
You made me dance in public, trippin' on my own two feet
Just like a drum, my heart is jumpin' like a trampoline

Nowhere to wash away my worries like the angry sea
Havin' a good old time, never been on the edge of my seat
It's rainin' lava, got me sweatin', I can feel the heat
The fire's ragin', no tellin' what's about to come for me

If I die tonight, at least I left a legacy
If I die tonight, at least I left a legacy
If the lights go out, I'm forever in your memory
If I die tonight, at least I left a legacy

Na na na na, na-na, na, na, na (Yeah)
Na na na na, na-na, na, na, na (Yeah)
Na na na na, na-na, na, na, na (Yeah)
Na na na na, na-na, na, na, na (Yeah)

It's true the eyes are the windows of a person's soul
It's like I'm starin' in the mirror when I look at you
I turn the heavens down if the devil came for you
I'd rather go through hell or high waters
Yeah, it's true
