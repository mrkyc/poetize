I know it's me who always leaves you stranded
We are always apart
I know you hate this, but please don't end it
There must be a way
I wish I could stay

When I met you I was barely living
I was lost in the dark
But with the love that you've been giving
I'm back from the dead
With you in my head

When I look in your eyes, I know you understand
That good things always seem to slip right through my hands
When everything but love is just grains of sand
With you, this is my life
Here with you, this is my life
This is my life

All day long I'm okay while I'm working
But it hits me at night
When every part of me for you is hurting
I go through withdrawals
I love you, that's all
You might also like
Because when I look in your eyes, I know you understand
That good things always seem to slip right through my hands
When everything but love is just grains of sand
With you, this is my life
Here with you, this is my life
This is my life

Why does it always have to be like this?
Always desperate in a goodbye kiss

Now I'm back from the dead
With you in my head

Because when I look in your eyes, I know you understand
That good things always seem to slip right through my hands
When everything but love is just grains of sand
With you, this is my life
Here with you, this is my life
This is my life
When I look in your eyes, I know you understand
(This is my life)
That good things always seem to slip right through my hands
(This is my life)
When everything but love is just grains of sand
With you, this is my life
Here with you, this is my life
This is my life
