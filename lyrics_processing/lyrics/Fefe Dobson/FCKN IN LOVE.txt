We just made love
I'm in bliss, I don't wanna get up
Let's just stay here
Sun is shining in
Lightin' up the art
Tatted on your skin
Every part of me is shakin' in awe, awe
In awe

Damn, I'm so in love with you
I'm so fuckin' in the love with you
Damn you in your birthday suit
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

God, your lips are soft
On my lips, I'm about to take off
Got me singin', can't get enough
Boy, you're fitting me just like a glove
Think I've died and gone to heaven
Don't stop
Don't stop
You might also like
Damn, I'm so in love with you
I'm so fuckin' in the love with you
Damn you in your birthday suit
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
Damn, I'm so in love with you
I'm so fuckin' in the love with you
Damn you in your birthday suit
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you

I would walk to the ends of the earth for you
Buy a ticket with no return for you
I would suit up and go to work for you
Give it all up just to be with you
I would walk to the ends of the earth for you
Buy a ticket with no return for you
I would suit up and go to work for you
Give it all up just to be with you

Damn, I'm so in love with you (In love with you)
I'm so fuckin' in the love with you (In love with you)
Damn you in your birthday suit
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
Damn, I'm so in love with you
I'm so fuckin' in love with you
Damn you in your birthday suit
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
I want your babies
I want a house
I want forever
I want it now
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
