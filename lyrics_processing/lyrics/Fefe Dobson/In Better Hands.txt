Three strikes, we tried
Now I'm in better hands
I know this may sound impolite
But I'm in better hands

Knew I had to let it be
Losing your identity
You became the shadow
Thought I'd make you understand
Drop a boy, got a man
Dude had to hit the road

This has become so uncool fast
Guess we weren't built to last (No)

Three strikes, we tried
Now I'm in better hands
I know this may sound impolite
But I'm in better hands
His hands, his love
Fits like a glove
Three strikes, we tried
You know I'm in better hands
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la)
You might also like
Got over your nicotine
Habits and your skinny jeans
How they're always tighter than mine
You get under my skin
When you take me out for din
I paid the bill every time

This has become so uncool fast
Guess we weren't built to last (No)

Three strikes, we tried
Now I'm in better hands
I know this may sound impolite
But I'm in better hands
His hands, his love
Fits like a glove
Three strikes, we tried
You know I'm in better hands

Every night I lay beside you
Knew there was more for me, me
Found someone who's nothing like you
Hands fit perfectly-ly
Every night I lay beside you
Knew there was more for me, me
Found someone who's nothing like you
Hands fit perfectly-ly
No
Three strikes, we tried
Now I'm in better hands
I know this may sound impolite
But I'm in better hands
His hands, his love
Fits like a glove
Three strikes, we tried
You know I'm in better hands (Better hands)
Three strikes, we tried
Now I'm in better hands (I'm in better hands)
I know this may sound impolite
But I'm in better hands
His hands, his love
Fits like a glove (Like a glove)
Three strikes, we tried
You know I'm in better hands

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) I'm in better hands
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) I'm in better hands
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) I'm in better hands
