Watch out

Was just about to leave the party
When this super hot thing came on up to me
He said, "I really think that you should come with me
There's something, something that you have to see"

He said, "Don't worry
I'll just lock the door
Close your eyes and count to ten"
And one, two, three, four

Oh oh, I just made out with your boyfriend
That's right, but we only did it one time
Oh oh, I didn't know he was your boyfriend
That's right, and that'll be the last time
I make out with your boyfriend

You can have him back
You can have him back, back, back
You might also like
So the night after the party
He calls and tells me that he wants me, wants me
And then he tells me that he's never felt this way
I told him "Boy, you better stay away"

Should've had him begging for more
It was unbelievable
One, two, three, four

Oh oh, I just made out with your boyfriend
That's right, but we only did it one time
Oh oh, I didn't know he was your boyfriend
That's right, and that'll be the last time
Oh oh, I just made out with your boyfriend
That's right, but we only did it one time
Oh oh, I didn't know he was your boyfriend
That's right, and that'll be the last time
I make out with your boyfriend

I, I, I just made out with your boyfriend
I, I, I just made out with your boyfriend
I, I, I just made out with your boyfriend
I, I, I just made out with your boyfriend
You can have him back
You can have him back, back, back
You can have him back
I never wanted that
You can have him back
You can have him back, back, back
You can have him back
I never wanted that

Oh oh, I just made out with your boyfriend
That's right, but we only did it one time
Oh oh, I didn't know he was your boyfriend
That's right, and that'll be the last time
Oh oh, I just made out with your boyfriend
That's right, but we only did it one time
Oh oh, I didn't know he was your boyfriend
That's right, and that'll be the last time

(You can have him back
You can have him back, back, back)
I make out with your boyfriend

(You can have him back
You can have him back, back, back)
