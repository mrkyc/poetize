I gave it all just for you
And you needed help for what you threw
And you think that you would remember, paved your way
When you thought you only remembered how to use me

One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah

You blocked reality when you were here
And now you've gone, it's so much clear
When the girls walked by you love me, you would say
You hook up, you get caught
I'm in denial, so I forgave you
Just know that...

One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
You might also like
All I wanna know is what I've done to you
You think that I'm confused and I'll just run to you
Whatever, whatever
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Back to you
I think you should know...

One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah

Now that you're gone, I finally see
My friends were right, you were wrong for me
You never controlled me, I gave you the control
This song's for you, I want you to know
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine if you get what you deserve
One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
One day, girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
(Just know that)
One day, (One day) girls (Ooh)
Oh, right in the kissah
One day, (One day) girls (Ooh)
