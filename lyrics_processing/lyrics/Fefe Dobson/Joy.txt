Turn my head, there you were
I went red
Oh, I knew for sure
There was something 'bout you, baby
That I never ever felt before

Can I touch or just look?
Feels like love
Oh, I wish I could
Could I keep you to myself
And never, ever have to look no more?

I got joy, joy, joy burning through my heart
I got joy, joy, joy, don't tear us apart
I got joy in my bedroom when it's just you and I
I got joy when you're satisfied
Flip over and cry
I got joy, joy, joy running way down low
I got joy, joy, joy, xoxo
I got joy burstin' out of me, explode with a bang
I got joy for your anatomy
Please don't take it away
You might also like
Make it last, take it slow
Take your time
Yeah, I know, I know
That we can do it better
Than whoever said that dreams don't come true
'Cause they do
Don't get down, keep it up
You're allowed to be so in love
'Cause I'm liking what I'm seeing
And I'm seeing what I'm liking in you

I got joy, joy, joy burning through my heart
I got joy, joy, joy, don't tear us apart
I got joy in my bedroom when it's just you and I
I got joy when you're satisfied
Flip over and cry
I got joy, joy, joy running way down low
I got joy, joy, joy, xoxo
I got joy burstin' out of me, explode with a bang
I got joy for your anatomy
Please don't take it away

Oh yeah, you know how I wanna play
Just stay, oh yeah, you know how to blow me away
With your joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
With your joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
Away, oh baby, please don't take it away
I got joy, joy, joy burning through my heart
I got joy, joy, joy, don't tear us apart
I got joy in my bedroom when it's just you and I
I got joy when you're satisfied
Flip over and cry
I got joy, joy, joy running way down low
I got joy, joy, joy, xoxo
I got joy burstin' out of me, explode with a bang
I got joy for your anatomy
Please don't take it away, mm
