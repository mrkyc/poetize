Sometimes I wish that it could be different
We could start over and you would be mine
It wouldn't need to be so complicated
We had the right love at the wrong time
I used to think you wanted what I wanted, babe
And maybe you did, but you still couldn't stay
Even though you tore it out and burned the page
I wish you, I wish you the best

'Cause I wouldn't change
The late night talks and sheets we rearranged
It kills me to wait, but you said that you need some space

So let me know, so let me know
Because if you really love me
Then you gotta let her go
So let me know, just let me know
I can't wait here forever
My heart will turn into stone
I would still do anything for you
But you got, you got some shit to prove
So let me know, just let me know
'Cause if you really love me
Then you gotta let her go
You might also like
I stay up 'till sun shoots through the blinds
I don't ever want to fall asleep
'Cause I can't bear to see you in my dreams
Lying here alone, my bed is cold
Your ghost is still here next to me
And I'm still haunted by the memory
But I wouldn't change the tears and shame
Oh, what a mess we've made
It kills me to wait
'Cause it feels like we've gone up in flames

So let me know, so let me know
Because if you really love me
Then you gotta let her go
So let me know, just let me know
I can't wait here forever
My heart will turn into stone
I would still do anything for you
But you got, you got some shit to prove
So let me know, just let me know
Cause if you really love me
Then you gotta let her go

(If you really love me, if you really love me)
'Cause if you really love me, then you gotta let her go
(If you really love me, if you really love me)
You can go
I won't be mad at you
I won't tell
Do what you need to do
Make your choice
Or I will choose for you
I will choose for you

So let me know, so let me know
Do you really love me?
Are you gonna let her go?
So let me know, I need to know
If I wait here forever
My heart will turn into stone
I would still do anything for you
But you've got, you got some shit to prove
So let me know, just let me know
'Cause if you really love me
Then you gotta let her go

(If you really love me, if you really love me)
'Cause if you really love me, then you gotta let her go
