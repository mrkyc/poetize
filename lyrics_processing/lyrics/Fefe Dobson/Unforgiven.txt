Oh
Oh
Oh

Daddy, daddy, why you break your promises to me?
Daddy, daddy, don't you know you hurt me constantly?
And there's something that I think that you should know
I'm not the little girl you left waiting at home
All the hurt and pain you left with mom and me
Why can't I be angry?
I hope you're somewhere out there listening to this song
I hope you're thinking what you did, indeed was wrong
Well, let me make it crystal clear for you to see
It's too late for 'I'm sorry'

'Sorry' is a word you like to say
But 'sorry' won't erase the things you did yesterday

And I want you to know that I didn't need you anyway
And this rope that we walk on is swaying
And the ties that bind us, they will never ever fray
But I want for you to know
You are, you are unforgiven
Unforgiven

Daddy, daddy, fan of absolute simplicity
Daddy, daddy, expert in responsibility
Where were you when I fell down and skinned my knee?
Where were you when I was scared to go to sleep?
Where were you to sooth my insecurities?
Why can't I be angry?
Where were you the first time someone broke my heart?
Where were you when I first learned to drive a car?
Where were you when I plugged in my first guitar?
It's too late for 'I'm sorry', yeah

And I want you to know that I didn't need you anyway
And this rope that we walk on is swaying
And the ties that bind us, they will never ever fray
But I want for you to know
You are, you are unforgiven
Unforgiven

Unforgiven

'Sorry' is a word you like to say
But 'sorry' won't erase the things you did yesterday
And I want you to know that I didn't need you anyway
And this rope that we walk on is swaying
And the ties that bind us, they will never ever fray
But I want for you to know
You are, you are unforgiven
Unforgiven
Unforgiven
Unforgiven
Unforgiven
Unforgiven
Unforgiven
