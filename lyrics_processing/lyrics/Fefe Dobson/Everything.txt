Ayo, la-da-da-yo
Ayo, la-da-da-yo, la-dee-da

Sometimes I give into sadness, sometimes I don't
Doo-doo-doo-doo, ohh
At times, I'm part of the madness
Sometimes I won't give into you

You see in a way I have been driftin' down a river to nowhere
And you've given me nothing

But if you're ready to be my everything
If you're ready to see it through this time
And if you're ready for love then, this I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time
La-dee-da
Ayo, la-da-da-yo, la-dee-da

At times I feel myself smiling, at times I'm not
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Hey yeah, what's with that guilt that you styling?
Baby, talk
Don't look good on you
You might also like
You see in a way I have been lookin' for a reason to go there
And you're leadin' me nowhere

But if you're ready to be my everything
If you're ready to see it through this time
And if you're ready for love then, this I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time
La-dee-da
Ayo, la-da-da-yo, la-dee-da

Are you waiting for a special occasion to give me your heart?
'Cause I need a little confirmation to make a real start
Don't wait 'til it's too late
Are you ready to show me?
Are you ready to love me?


You see in a way I have been driftin' down a river to nowhere
And you've given me nothing

But if you're ready to be my everything
If you're ready to see it through this time
And if you're ready for love then, this I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time
And if you're ready to be (Ready to be my everything)
And if you're ready to see it through this time
(If you're ready for love) If you're ready for love then, baby
This I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time
La-dee-da
