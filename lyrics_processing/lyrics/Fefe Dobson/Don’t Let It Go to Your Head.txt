So what if I came clean
And told you all you mean to me
And so what if I meant every word I said?
Baby, don't let it go to your head

So what if I write your name?
'Cause you're always on my brain
In a heart, I paint it crimson red
Baby, don't let it go to your head

Don't be getting any big ideas
Let me make it clear

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
If I looked in your eyes
One, two, too many times
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head
You might also like
So what if I want to kiss
From your toes up to your lips
It don't mean that you've had me yet
You're gonna be good, I bet

I'm the one whose in control here
Let me make it clear

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
If I looked in your eyes
One, two, too many times
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head
Oh-oh, don't let it go to your head
Oh-oh, don't let it go to your head

I had a porcelain doll
I held on to it so tightly
But when it broke, I swore
I'd never hold onto something that tightly again
Don't let it go to your head
Oh-no, oh-no, oh
Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
Don't let it go to your head

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
If I looked in your eyes
One, two, too many times
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head
Oh-oh, don't let it go to your head
Oh-oh, don't let it go to your head
(Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it go to your head)
Oh-oh
Don't let it go to your head
(Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it go to your head)
Oh-oh
Don't let it go to your head
(Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it go to your head)
Oh-oh
Don't let it go to your head
(Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it go to your head)
