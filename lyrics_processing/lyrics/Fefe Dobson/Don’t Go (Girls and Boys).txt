I was ridin' my bike on 43rd street
Past the station and there's one person without a seat
Got my sunnies, cause the sun just keeps on lookin' right through me
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, baby, can't you see?

(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world

I've got jumbo polka-dotted trousers with the empty pockets
It's funny to me that the two of us could fit in one pair
Kings and queens on magazines that have me on the cover
But none of that compares to just one night alone with you
And what you do

(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world
(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world

I was just ridin' my bike on 43rd street
Past the station and there's one person without a seat
You got me wishin' I was just a little squirrel at your window
Got me whistlin' a song I thought I never could like
Just for you

(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world
(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world
(Don't go) Girls and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and boys can rule the world
(Don't go) Boys and boys should be together
(Don't go) Girls and girls can rule the world

Boys and boys should be together
