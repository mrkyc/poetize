There's an English beat on Sesame Street
And there's a little boy dancing with dancing feet
I know, you know, and he knows, what I knows

There's E Left pumping from the ghetto blaster
Young girls chattin' about who they're after
I know, and he know, but I know, that he know

I said, "Gimme all your money, Mr. Johnny Cash
Gimme all your money, Johnny Cash
'Cause you're flashing all your money like Johnny Cash
So gimme all your money, Johnny Cash"

Girls are Barbies
Boys are Johnny's
Booze, cash, money
Boys like honeys
Girls are Barbies
Boys are Johnny's
Booze, cash, money
Boys like honeys
