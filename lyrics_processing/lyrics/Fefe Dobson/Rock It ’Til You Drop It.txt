C'mon now
Rock it till you drop it
Mmm-mmm-mmm, uh-uh-uh
Rock it till you drop it
You know what I'm sayin'

When you're walkin' walkin', your body's talkin' to me
But your mouth ain't makin' a sound
When I'm stalkin' stalkin', I can feel my body rockin'
With all these feelings I've found

It's in the way that he moves
It's in the way that he likes the things I do
It's in the way that he grooves
You know I love it when he takes me dancing

I never waited for that special one
I thought I'd settle for a setting sun
Tonight's the night we get this party on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

C'mon now
Rock it till you drop it, hey
You might also like
And I'm takin' takin' as you hit that tricky rhythm
You take me out on the floor
I've been itchin' itchin' for the jive that you've been drippin'
And you got me wantin' more

It's in the way that he moves
It's in the way that he likes the things I do
It's in the way that he groves
You know I love it when he takes me dancing

I never waited for that special one
I thought I'd settle for a setting sun
Tonight's the night we get this party on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

C'mon now
Rock it till you drop it
You know what I'm sayin'

We'll be rockin' it all night long
We'll be droppin' it 'til the break of dawn
There's no stoppin' it once the freak is on
Is on, and on, and on, and on
We'll be rockin' it all night long
We'll be droppin' it 'til the break of dawn
There's no stoppin' it once the freak is on
Is on, and on, and on, and on
Hey

I never waited for that special one
I thought I'd settle for a setting sun
Tonight's the night we'll get this party on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on
I never waited for that special one
I thought I'd settle for a setting sun
Tonight's the night we get this party on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

(Special one, oh)
I never waited for that special one
(Setting sun, oh)
I thought I'd settle for a setting sun
Tonight's the night we get this party on
