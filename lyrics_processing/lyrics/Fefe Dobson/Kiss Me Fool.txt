Tell me, who should I be to make you love me?
Tell me, what does it mean to be alone?
Can't you see me standing, staring, out from a distance?
Hear my cry, if you'd only listen
Out of focus, into me and you

Kiss me fool if you care
If your words have better meaning
Playing it cool is so unfair and why this veil of secrecy?
God forbid, friends found out what we did
And why can't some like you be with someone like me?

Tell me, who should I be to make you love me?
Tell me, what does it mean to be alone?
Can't you see me standing, staring, out from a distance?
Hear my cry, if you'd only listen
Out of focus, into me and you

Touch me fool if you're allowed
I'll be dancing in the corner
It's so cruel to play it proud
Take your hands and cover me
I'm aware that all in love is fair
But that's no reason to make me feel this way
You might also like
Tell me, who should I be to make you love me?
Tell me, what does it mean to be alone?
Can't you see me standing, staring, out from a distance?
Hear my cry, if you'd only listen
Out of focus, into me and you

And that hurts me so bad to deny it
These feelings are out of control
Do you know what it's like to want something so bad?
And than having to let it go
And it hurts me to know that this time in our lives
So soon, will be in the past
And this game of pretending and playing it cool
Never knowing, never knowing, never knowing what
What we should have had

Tell me, who should I be to make you love me?
Tell me, what does it mean to be alone?
You've got me wondering if Im good enough
Pretty enough, giving enough, special enough?
Tell me, who should I be to make you love me?

Who should I be? Who should I be oh, oh?
To make you love me
Who should I be? Who should I be oh, oh?
To make you love me
Who should I be? Who should I be oh, oh?
To make you love me
Who should I be? Who should I be oh, oh?
To make you love me
