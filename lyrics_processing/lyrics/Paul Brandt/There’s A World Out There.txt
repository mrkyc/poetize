I'd get so annoyed
Whenever it was pouring rain
Standin' at the glass door
Starin' at the outside nose pressed against the pane
I told my momma
I don't wanna be stuck inside no more
Give me thunder and lightnin' somethin' excitin'
That's what I'm livin' for
CHORUS:
There's a world out there and I wanna be in it
I got a life and I'm gonna live it
Don't tell me the sky's the limit
There's footprints on the moon
I wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
Sew my dreams where they won't unravel
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
I can't stay in here when there's a world out there
I remember back in school
They thought I was a fool
For asking Lizzy Walker to the dance
She was always with the captain of the football team
Nobody thought I even had a chance
But imagine my surprise
When she looked me in the eyes
And said I'll go with you instead
I knew we'd be together for the rest of forever
When Lizzy looked at me and said
Hey Baby
You might also likeCHORUS
I imagine when they land on a brand new planet
In some far off galaxy
Somebody in the rocket's gonna look out the window
Feeling just like Lizzy and me
Hey Baby, there's a world out there and I wanna be in it
I got a life and I'm gonna live it
Don't tell me the sky's the limit
There's footprints on the moon
I wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
Sew my dreams where they won't unravel
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
Can't stay in here when there's a world out there
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
You can't stay in here when there's a world out there
("No, I just can't do it")
There's a world out there
("Don't even try and play it safe")
No, no, no
