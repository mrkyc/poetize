Had to put some folding chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's getting full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an aeroplane, it's her sister's girl
She said she wouldn't miss it for the world
And all them young'uns squirmin' in the pews
Mr. Charlie in his lime green suit is a handsome man
Remarks widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '88
Just said Hello
It's a good day to let it go
CHORUS:
So let the angels gather, let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limousine
(Two people in)
Love is a beautiful thing
Daddy's waitin' with the bride
As she helps him with his tie she sees a tear
He says it's hot in here
He hugs his little girl and asks
How did you grow up so fast, God I wish
Your Momma could be here for this
You might also likeEverbody stands and smiles
As she comes walking down the aisle in her momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago and said their vows
I guess it's workin' out
CHORUS
BRIDGE:
A little table full of gifts
Catering is coverdish and the wedding band
Well that's on her hand
Tommy's teasing Lorali
Pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows a day will come
When the angels gather and the music plays
The preacher gets to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of the limousine
Love, two people in Love
It's a beautiful thing
Love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
Love, oh sweet Love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
Love, oh love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
