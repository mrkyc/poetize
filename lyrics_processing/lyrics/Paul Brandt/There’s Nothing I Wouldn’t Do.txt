Tears us apart and nobody ever wins
I know it just isn't right
And from my heart I'm tellin' you
I'm sorry for makin' you cry
I'll wipe the tears from your eyes
Please let me try again
To prove that my love is true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Swim across the deepest sea
To show you what you mean to me
Give the love that you've been missin'
Always take the time to listen
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Crawl across the desert sand
To feel the soft touch of your hand
No fire that I wouldn't walk through
To prove to you that my love is true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
You know you can lean on me
Things aren't so bad that we can't work it out
If there's one thing I believe
It's that trust will lead us through
Whatever it takes I'll be there
Lay down your worries and cares
That's what loves about
Me promisin' you
