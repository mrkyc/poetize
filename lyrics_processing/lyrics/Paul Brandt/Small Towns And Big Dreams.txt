A wheat field for a downtown kinda place
It was really not much around
You blink and you miss it
I never knew what life would bring
But I always had big dreams
I loved to play my guitar and sing
And every night I'd wish that
I'd get a shot on the Opry stage
And have people come and see me play
Blastin' on the radio waves
Enough to make my momma cry
Cause that's where I come from
That's who I am
Hard working and God blessed
Yes sir thank you ma'am
The best things around that I have ever seen
Came from small towns and big dreams
Small town went and grew up
But I never changed much by God's grace
Friends and family kept in touch
When I moved to Tennessee
You might also likeSing my songs and travel 'round
Met a girl and we're settlin' down
Wanna find a small town
Where we can raise a family
Cause that's where I come from
That's who I am
Hard working and God blessed
Yes sir thank you ma'am
The best things around that I have ever seen
Came from small towns and big dreams
Been around the world don't matter anywhere I go
Even here in Fort McMurray...Flinflon...here in Brandon..Thompson, Red Deer
Weyburn, Medicine Hat...
I've found my kind of folks
It's about you, and who you are
It's all a state of mind
And as I'm giving you my heart
I hope you find
That's where I come from
That's who I am
Hard working and God blessed
Yes sir thank you ma'am
The best things around that I have ever seen
Just look around, you'll see just what I mean
The best things around that I have ever seen
Came from small towns and big dreams

That's where I come from
That's who I am
That's where I come from
That's who I am
Small towns and big dreams
