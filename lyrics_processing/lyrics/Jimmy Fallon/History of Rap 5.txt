Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop
Make you say "Go Justin," and do the wop

Beats to the rhyme, the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid
So let's go

I'm glad you called, but I'm not home
But I'll be back before too long
You gotta speak your style, and your number too
And this is all you got to do
Wait for the beep
You gotta leave your number, gotta leave your number
Wait for the beep

Kick it

Wild thing
Wild thing

Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became a prince of a town called Bel-Air

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

What's your man got to do with me?
I got a man
I'm not trying to hear that, see

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true playa

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's definitely in the house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Death Row's definitely in the house

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3
Straight Outta Compton, a crazy motha--
(Hey hey hey, hold on a second
Wait wait wait
You're straight outta Compton?)
(Not straight
Yeah yeah, I'm Straight Outta Compton)
(Hey, out of curiousity, how does one get "straight outta Compton"?)
(Straigh--? Well, there's many ways to get--)
(Hit me)
(Thank you)

Big up di crew ina di area (murderer)
Still love you like that (murderer)

Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't this hit make my people wanna (jump jump)
Don't this hit make my people wanna (jump jump)
Don't this hit make my people wanna

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make you, jump, jump
Daddy Mac will make you, jump, jump
Kris Kross will make you jump, jump

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
(You're having girl problems?)
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

Move bitch, get out the way

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

Move bitch, get out the way

I got 99 problems, but a-- but a--

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team up in here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team up in here

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank)

Life we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

Like this
Now there's a backseat lover, that's always undercover
And we talk 'til my daddy say
It wasn't me, she was foolin', cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
(She told me to)
