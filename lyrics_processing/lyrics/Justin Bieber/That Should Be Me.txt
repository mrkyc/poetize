Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumours spreadin' 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause, baby, I didn't

That should be me holdin' your hand
That should be me makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me

You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
What you doin' to me?
You're takin' him where we used to go
Now, if you're tryna break my heart, it's working 'cause you know that
You might also like
That should be me holdin' your hand
That should be me makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me

I need to know, should I fight for love or disarm?
It's gettin' harder to shield this pain in my heart
Oooh

That should be me holdin' your hand
That should be me makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holdin' your hand, that should be me
The one makin' you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me givin' you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me
Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I never shoulda let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
