Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
(Woah, woah, woah)
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you
You might also like
There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
