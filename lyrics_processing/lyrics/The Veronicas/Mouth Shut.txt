I kept my mouth shut from the start
I guess I left you in the dark
You thought you knew me, but you don't
You say you'll love me, but you won't
When you find out who I am

I kept my mouth shut for too long
All this time, you got me wrong
Now we're in this way too far
I'm about to break your heart
Tear everything we had apart

'Cause I'm feeling lost
When I'm in your arms
The reasons are gone
For why I was holding on to you
I tried so hard
To be the one (Be the one)
I don't like who I've become

Won't keep my mouth shut anymore
I've had my share of closing doors
Now I know I'm not afraid
I know exactly what you'll say
But I'm sorry, it's too late
You might also like
'Cause I'm feeling lost
When I'm in your arms
The reasons are gone
For why I was holding on to you
I tried so hard
To be the one (Be the one)
I don't like who I've become

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(I kept it all inside of me for all this time)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Thought that I could make it work if I just tried)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(But I'm sorry to admit that I have lived a lie)

'Cause I'm feeling lost
When I'm in your arms
The reasons are gone
For why I was holding on to you
I tried so hard
To be the one (Be the one)
I don't like who I've become
I've kept my mouth shut for too long
Now I know that it was wrong
I wish I told you from the start
That this was never meant to last
We should've never gone this far
