I want you mine
'Cause when I see your eyes
I'm wanting you to stay
Why am I running away?
'Cause when you hold my hand
I try to pretend
I'm not feeling like I do
Do you feel it too?

When I close my eyes I see you
Don't tell me this is wrong

'Cause everything, everything makes me think of you
And everything, everything that I wanna do
I know you can see that when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you, do you want me to?

When I see you out
I lie to myself
I hang on what she says
It's perfect in my head
I wanna go too far
Find out who you are
I'm too close to turn around
I think I've figured you out
You might also like
And I want so bad to kiss you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong

'Cause everything, everything makes me think of you
And everything, everything that I wanna do
I know you can see that when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you, do you want me to think of you
And everything, everything that I wanna do
I know you can see that when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you, do you want me to?

Am I crazy?
I feel lost in time
You confuse me
Have I lost my mind?

'Cause everything, everything makes me think of you
And everything, everything that I wanna do
I know you can see that when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you, do you want me to think of you
And everything, everything that I wanna do
I know you can see that when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you, do you want me to?
