The lights are out and I barely know you
We're going up and the place is slowing down (Down, down)
I knew you'd come around
You captivate me, something about you has got me
I was lonely, now you make me feel alive (Alive, alive)
Will you be mine tonight?

Take me on the floor (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I can't take it anymore (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I can give you more (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch

My heart is racing as you're moving closer
You take me higher with every breath I take (I take)
Would it be wrong to stay?
One look at you and I know what you're thinking
Time's a bitch and my heart is sinking down (Down, down)
You turn me inside out

Take me on the floor (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I can't take it anymore (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I can give you more (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch
