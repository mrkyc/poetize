Wish I could say you're not the one
My heart hangs on, you're having fun
We can't be lovers and we can't be friends
But I still want you and I can't pretend
It fuckin' kills me that we're done

A little twist of the knife, yeah
A little salt in the cut, yeah
A little thorn in the side and it stings like hell

Feels so, cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you lookin' like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter
Cruel, the way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you know me like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it into winter

I'm making out like I don't care
But in her sleep I'd cut her hair
We can't be lovers and we can't be friends
But I still want you and I can't pretend
The way it hurts, it's just not fair
You might also like
A little twist of the knife, yeah
A little salt in the cut, yeah
A little thorn in the side and it stings like hell

Feels so, cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you lookin' like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter
Cruel, the way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you know me like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter

Once upon a time I thought that we were going strong
What we had would never move, no it would never fall down
No I've never been so wrong
No I've never been so wrong
Once upon a time I used to dream I'd be your wife
I could hear the bells were ringing, I was dressed in white
No, I've never been so wrong
No, I've never been so wrong
A little twist of the knife...
Cruel, the way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you lookin' like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter
Cruel, the way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you know me like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter
Cruel, the way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel, when you lookin' like that, oh
Cruel, the way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer, turn it in to winter
