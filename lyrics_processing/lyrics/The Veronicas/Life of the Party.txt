Everybody wants to be the life of the party
But I just wanna find somebody
Find somebody
Somebody

You used to be the life of the party
We were smoking loud like a Harley
You were playing games like Atari
You're not Ashton Kutcher so don't punk me
I was driving mad and smashed the rental
Old problems that we always have to wrestle
Being stone-cold to me, never gentle
But I still hang out with my ex-girls
Yeah, it's only retrograde, just let it be for a while
Some people do wanna be seen, but I could leave in the night
All these wolves in sheep's clothing, you don't see till they bite
All these sheep try to tell me what to speak in the mic

We'll have big coats like the Rolling Stones
Somewhere in the country we can call our own
My mum always told me that the good ones go
When the lights come on and you're all alone
When the lights come on and you're all alone
When the lights come on and you're all alone
My mum always told me that the good ones go
When the lights come on and you're all alone

Everybody wants to be the life of the party

Find somebody
When the lights come on and you're all alone

Used to be the life of the party
Drip, drip, cryin' in Versace
Medusa round my neck, guess she got me
Just when I thought nothing could stop me
Oh, I woke up alone, hotel beds are cold, yeah
I left you at home, I miss who I was there
When I didn't care
When I didn't care (You used to be the life of the party)

We'll have big coats like the Rolling Stones
Somewhere in the country we can call our own
My mum always told me that the good ones go
When the lights come on and you're all alone
When the lights come on and you're all alone
When the lights come on and you're all alone
My mum always told me that the good ones go
When the lights come on and you're all alone
