If I don't say anything, it's wrong
If I said it, it wouldn't come out right
It's been keeping me up all night
Half my life I've been told to shut up
So how am I gonna open up?
Wish you could just read my mind

If I shared all of me
Would you run away?
If I sugarcoated what I had to say in poetry
Would it make you stay?

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
You might also like
They say either way you'll win
If you're feeling it, why you gotta hold it in?
What is meant to be will be
But all their wisdom doesn't help me now
I'm scared and I gotta find out how to speak my mind
Without metaphors and prose and rhyme
But still make you mine

I hope you know what I mean when I'm acting mean
'Cause I don't say what I mean when I'm caught in between
I'm afraid the real you is alluding me

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
With you I'm ripped wide open at the seams
I'm not that tough
Wish you could hear the song inside of me
But it's not enough
And all the things I wanna say to you
Are written on my face

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Even if I stood alone
Didn't know how it was gonna go
Gotta get it off my chest
And hope for the best

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
