If you love someone
If you love someone

Wake up in the morning, take a breath and let it out
Just forget tomorrow's ever gonna come around
Everybody's medicating, taking time and waiting for the right time
In the short life, but it's your life
We can run around in circles we make or we could run straight ahead
Never ever let the moment pass by when all that matters in the end

If you love someone, then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest 'till you let it out
Let the words you dream come out of your mouth
If you love someone you gotta make a sound
If you love someone you gotta make a sound
If you love someone

When true love is staring you in the face
But the words that you're feeling never find their way
You're so invisible to the one you want
And you'd give anything to win their love
We can get lost in fears that we make for days that feel black as night
But there in the dark you find that the stars are shining their brightest light
You might also like
If you love someone, then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest 'till you let it out
Let the words you dream come out of your mouth
If you love someone, you gotta make a sound
If you love someone, you gotta make a sound
If you love someone

If you love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you love someone
If you love someone, yeah

If you love someone, then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest 'till you let it out
Let the words you dream come out of your mouth
If you love someone, you gotta make a sound
If you love someone, you gotta make a sound
If you love someone, you gotta make a sound
If you love someone

If you love someone
If you love someone
If you love someone
