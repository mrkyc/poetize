I'm gettin' tired of you pushin' me 'round
Draggin' me down, makin' a sound because you wanna
I guess that's why I like messin' with you
Puttin' you through a lesson or two, because I'm gonna

Before I go my own way
I just gotta say

Leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go
'Cause I know I'm better off on my own
So, leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown
Thinking about all the ways that I've grown
So, leave me alone
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)

There was the time I thought you were the one
Havin' some fun, gettin' it done, what an illusion
'Cause you were tryna take control of me
That couldn't be, I need to be free of this confusion
You might also like
Don't give me a guilt trip
'Cause I'm so over it

Leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go
'Cause I know I'm better off on my own
So, leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown
Thinking about all the ways that I've grown
So, leave me alone
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)

Don't turn around, and don't look back
I see right through all your selfless acts

Oh, leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go
'Cause I know I'm better off on my own
So, leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown
Thinking about all the ways that I've grown
So, leave me alone
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
I'll feel better on my own
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
