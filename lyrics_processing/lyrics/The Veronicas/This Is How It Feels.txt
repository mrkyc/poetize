You keep calling my phone non-stop
Don't you know I won't pick it up?
You never leave a message
Look how you've changed
You got nothing to say, getting in the way
You show up at my house
You're getting so obsessive
Like I have time for you

Wasn't it me you didn't want?
Wasn't it me who was hanging on?
Now I'm done, but before I go
I want you to know

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Oh, oh

You wanna meet up, to tell me why
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
That's just so you
And now I've moved on by myself
And maybe I won't forgive, I'll just forget you lived
And I hope it hurts
You might also like
Wasn't it me you tried to blame?
Wasn't it me you threw away?
But before you go, there's something you should know

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels (Oh-oh)
When the trust you had is broken
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

You taught me how to hate you, and I was so in love
And when I tried to save us, it was not enough
So what the hell is different? 'Cause now that I am gone
You're crawling back to tell me, I'm the one
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This is how it feels
Oh-oh, oh-oh

This is how it feels (This is how it feels)
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
When the trust you had is broken
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Do you only want me
'Cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'Cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
'Cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'Cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
Cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'Cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
'Cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'Cause I'm gone?
