I hate to say it, but they play this damn song in every club
But it's me, so I'll show love
But it's me, so show me love
And when I walk into the room, people stop and stare
It's like nobody else is there
You know it's me, not you
Who said anything about you?

Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard
And I get what I want, my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so popular
Pop-pop-popular

Most guys I dated got intimidated, so now I date up
If you know what I mean, so they shut up
If you know what I mean, so just shut up
'Cause I don't wanna give half away on the day we don't make up
If you know what I mean, when we wake up
If you know what I mean, when we break up
You might also like
Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard
And I get what I want, my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so popular

You always wanna be 'round me, so you know what it's like
When the world is at your feet, and you're V.I.P. tonight
You either got it or you don't, and I'm sorry you won't
Get there by using me, just go and do your own thing
