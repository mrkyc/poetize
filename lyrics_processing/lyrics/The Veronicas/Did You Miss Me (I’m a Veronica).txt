I'm a Veronica

Back with a vengeance, back with a song
All you motherfuckers got it wrong
I'm a villain, I'm the one
Yeah, I was born just to take you on
Open your eyes up, step in the ring
Float like a butterfly, bee I sting
I'm like Snow White with a gun
Shoot you down - bang bang, you're done

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?
I'm a Veronica

'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)

From my homeland to Hong Kong
By the time you find me, I'll be gone
Bet you never thought I'd hit like that
Looks like hell? Just got back
My best friend's my enemy
Oh, woe is me, I'll take them one by one
And if you get in my face, and you get a taste
Even God would run, son

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?

'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)

I'm on a mission to the stars
I'm the love child living life on Mars
I'm the next kid in line for the throne
Ascendancy; let it be known
Won't stop, gonna run this town
Gonna sit, sit down
Gonna bring you out
'Cause if I'm not where you wanna be
Then boy, step back off of me
Cause I don't need to follow you down
'Cause I'm so in demand
Don't know if I'm comin' or I'm goin'
Yeah, there's a glitch in your hitch, bitch
While my empire keeps growing
'Cause I'm so in demand
Don't know if I'm comin' or I'm goin'
Yeah, there's a glitch in your hitch, bitch
While my empire keeps growing
Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby, tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really that I was done? (I'm a Veronica)

'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
'Cause down under, we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners (oh-oh)
