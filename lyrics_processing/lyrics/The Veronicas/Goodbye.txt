Love in the dark, breakin' two hearts, that's what you said
Wanna know who you are, not goin' too far with you
Secrets we keep, no one can speak about us, babe
Pullin' me in, I never win, do you?

I'm still drunk at the bar, watchin' your every move
Imagining how good you taste, now we're standin' face-to-face
You should get in your car, baby, just drive away
I don't wanna hear you say all the things I wish you'd say

'Cause my love is waiting back at home
And I know and I know you and me, we could start a fire
Get too close, you'll burn my self-control
And I don't wanna get to the point that I just can't fight it
So goodbye to you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
I gotta say goodbye to you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
I gotta say goodbye to you

At the end of the night, why can't this all just be easy?
That look in your eyes, takin' me down, down, down
I'm so conflicted, tryna resist but I need it
Guess I'm addicted, I just keep runnin' right back

I'm still drunk at the bar, watchin' your every move
Imagining how good you taste, now we're standin' face-to-face
You should get in your car, baby, just drive away
I don't wanna hear you say all the things I wish you'd say

'Cause my love is waiting back at home
And I know and I know you and me, we could start a fire
Get too close, you'll burn my self-control
And I don't wanna get to the point that I just can't fight it
So goodbye to you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
I gotta say goodbye to you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
I gotta say goodbye to you
I wanna run away
I wanna run away

Get in your car, baby, just drive away
I don't wanna hear you say all the things I wish you'd say

'Cause my love is waiting back at home
And I know and I know you and me, we could start a fire
Get too close, you'll burn my self-control
And I don't wanna get to the point that I just can't fight it
So goodbye to you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
I gotta say goodbye to you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good
