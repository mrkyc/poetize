Hold your head up high
You're never wrong
Somewhere in the right, you belong
You would rather fight than walk away
What a lonely way to breathe the air
What an unlovely way to say you care
Now we're too far gone for me to save
And I never thought that we'd come to this

Maybe there's beauty in goodbye
(No one's wrong or right, you would rather fight, then you walk away)
There's just no reason left to try
(Now it's gone too far, look at where we are)
You push me away, another black day
Let's count up the reasons to cry
Look what you've missed, living like this
Nobody wins (Nobody wins)

Searching for the truth in your eyes
Found myself so lost don't recognize
The person now that you, you claim to be
Don't know when to stop or where to start
You're just so caught up in who you are
Now you're far too high for me to see
I'd never thought that we'd come to this
You might also like
Maybe there's beauty in goodbye
(No one's wrong or right, you would rather fight, then you walk away)
There's just no reason left to try
(Now it's gone too far, look at where we are)
You push me away, another black day
Let's count up the reasons to cry
Look what you've missed, living like this
Nobody wins

You never say you're sorry
Try to tell me that you love me
But don't; it's too late to take it there

Maybe there's beauty in goodbye
(No one's wrong or right, you would rather fight, then you walk away)
There's just no reason left to try
(Now it's gone too far, look at where we are)
You push me away, another black day
Let's count up the reasons to cry
Look what you've missed, living like this
Nobody wins (Nobody wins)
(Now it's gone too far, look at where we are)
