I wonder if you play the song we used to sing
I bet she likes it, too
And the only one thing you know how to cook
I'm sure she's sick of it, but still says it's good

It's been 5 months, 9 hours, 42 seconds since I left home
It's been 5 months, 9 hours, 42 seconds since I felt whole

Do you miss me in your sheets?
Do you miss me in your bed?
The way we talk all night, the way I give you head?
Do you think that she's the one or do you just pretend?
And when she says it's love
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead?

Your gold initials around my neck
One of a kind, does she have one yet?
And I bet you charge her rent to sleep at your house
And if she's ever late, I bet you kick her out (Six times)

It's been 5 months, 9 hours, 42 seconds since I left home
It's been 5 months, 9 hours, 42 seconds since I let go

Do you miss me in your sheets?
Do you miss me in your bed?
The way we talk all night, the way I give you head?
Do you think that she's the one or do you just pretend?
And when she says it's love
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead?

I underestimated how complicated you are
I don't miss being hated, I don't miss fighting your war

Bet you miss me in your sheets, bet you miss me in your bed
The way we talk all night, the way I give you head?
Do you think that she's the one or do you just pretend?
And when she says it's love
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
Will you think of me instead-'stead, 'stead-'stead?
