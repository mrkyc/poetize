Where are we going?
Where are we going?

In my waking days of wonder
All my ways of wrong and right
Without my dreams of clouds and thunder
I wander down this path tonight
All these dangers of destruction
Fill my breath with life and light
I drink it deep and think about us
On this path tonight

This path tonight
Where will it lead me?
Crumbling rock and stones on fire
This path tonight
You better believe it
I'm stumbling to my heart's desire
On this path tonight

I try to question all the answers
Try to answer all that's asked
I try my best to be myself
But wonder who's behind this mask
I'll take care of all my problems
Comfort in my soul's delight
I may not know just where I'm going
But I'm on this path

This path tonight
Where will it lead me?
Crumbling rock and stones on fire
This path tonight
You better believe it
I'm stumbling to my heart's desire
On this path tonight

What will I do with all these feelings?
Will my heart behave tonight?
This time is not like any other
Will I flee, or will I fight?
No one knows just how I'm dealing
With this heart that's not for hire
It's got me rocking, got me reeling
And I feel like I'm on fire

This path tonight
Where will it lead me?
Crumbling rock and stones on fire
This path tonight
You better believe it
I'm stumbling to my heart's desire
On this path tonight
Where will it lead me?
Crumbling rock and stones on fire
This path tonight
Well, you better believe it
I'm stumbling to my heart's desire
On this path tonight
This path tonight
On this path tonight
Yeah
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Down this path tonight
Down this path tonight
