I got something you might just wanna know
Something that will hit your spot make you feel so hot
Let's hope those pennies drop
So baby come and check this program D. A. Z. Mashin' up the slow jam

Wig-wam bam thank you ma'am, I need a girl I can smooth 'n' slam
She got to be on the scene, sweet 16 an' like ten-fifteen
I'm gonna show her a good time
I'm gonna go where the sun still shines
'Cause that's all I aim to do my 5. 5 kicks right at you
Now I'm in demand I look so nice
I wanna put the drop on Baby Spice
Cause she's got style and grace
I like to see her put her lips on my face
Oh yeah she's gonna take the mick
But I don't care cause I got a new trick
