For your love, oh
Ooh, yeah
Baby, I'm like a sad man
I knew I was wrong
But when I told you all those lies, huh
I was a fool to make 'em
I was a big fool
But you got to believe me when I said I loved you

For you love I would do anything, baby (Everyday hasn't been sunny)
Just for your love, just for your love (without you ever since)
For you love I would go anywhere honey (Huh, but then again every day hasn't been, cloudy either)
And just for you love I would do anything, baby (Just for your love, just for your love)
For your love, I would do anything (listen)

I see the tears I caused you to cry, oh
Now I know it was a mistake when I lied, baby (I lied, I lied, I lied)
Not a day goes by I don't wish to see your eyes
I wish I could bring you back my way, everyday for your love I pray

For your love, I would do anything, baby (do anything, ooh wee, baby)
For your love, I would go anywhere honey (there's nobody for my eyes, nobody for my eyes)
And just for your love I would do anything, baby (Just for your love, just for your love)
For your love, I would do anything (Listen, listen, listen baby)

It's been a while since I felt your embrace (since I feel, since I feel)
Things are so sad in my dreams, all I see is, all I see is your face, baby
I dream about the day you said goodbye, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
For your love, I'll climb any mountain, it doesn't matter, how high, baby, baby

For your love, I would do anything baby (Anything, baby, anything, baby)
For you love I would go anywhere, honey (I will go anywhere)
And just for your love, I would do anything baby, (you, you, you, you, you, you, just for you love, just for you love)
For your love, I would do anything (JoJo help me sing it, JoJo, JoJo, JoJo)

Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere (baby, baby, baby)
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere (anywhere)
Anything you want from me, anything you need from me
Anything you need and anything (Anything...)
Any song you want me to sing
If I can play it, baby darling, she'll sing (Just name the song)
Anything you want from me
I'll do it for you

For your love, just for your love, just for your love (anything, anything)
For your love (I would do, I would surely do, for you, I will climb any mountain)
And just for your love (I will climb the highest mountain)
For your love, I would do anything (I would do anything for you, baby, baby, baby)
For you love I would do anything baby
Just for your love, just for your love (anything, anything, anything, anything, anything)
For you love I would go anywhere honey (I would never hurt you) (I would never hurt you, I would never hurt you, I would never hurt you, baby, baby, baby)

And just for you love I would do anything baby, I'll do it for you
