Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

The look within your eyes, baby
It makes me wonder why, lady
You want to get with me, darling
When I thought we were just friends
Then you made your move on me
You started moving on me strongly
Even though nobody was around
Still had to tell you to slow it down

And we don't have to rush the night away
There's always going to be another day (yes, there will)
A time to make love and a time to play (oh)
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly
And we don't have to rush the night away (oh, don't rush)
There's always going to be another day (yeah)
A time to make love and a time to play (yeah, yeah)
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly (come on)

When I took you to my house, baby, you got buck wild
And kicked off your shoes then you started dancing
I said, "Come over here, have a little seat with me"
All I wanna do is watch a little bit of TV
You started rubbing on my leg, fingers in my hair
Then you got silly, said let's play truth or dare
I'm not in the mood, honey I swear
Then you got out of control, had to get up out of there

And we don't have to rush the night away (you don't have to rush, no, no)
There's always going to be another day (another day)
A time to make love and a time to play
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly (oh, oh, yeah)
And we don't have to rush the night away (you don't have to rush, no, no)
There's always going to be another day
A time to make love and a time to play
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly (you, you, you, don't rush)

Don't rush it, don't rush it (don't rush, don't)
Don't rush it, don't rush it
Don't rush it, don't rush it, baby
Don't rush it, don't rush it (ooh, ooh)
Don't rush it, don't rush it (oh)
Don't rush it, don't rush it, baby (oh, oh, yeah)

And we don't have to rush the night away (no, no)
There's always going to be another day
A time to make love and a time to play (no, no, no, no, no, no)
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly
And we don't have to rush the night away
There's always going to be another day (yeah, yeah)
A time to make love and a time to play (yeah, yeah)
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly (baby, yeah)
And we don't have to rush the night away (yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's always going to be another day  (be another day)
A time to make love and a time to play (time to love and there's a time to play)
What I'm trying to say, take love slowly
And we don't have to rush the night away (no, no)
There's always going to be another day (oh, yeah)
A time to make love and a time to play
