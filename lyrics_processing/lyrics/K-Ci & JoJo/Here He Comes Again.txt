Tell me he didn't break your heart
Tell me he didn't lie to you
Tell me there's no way that he set you up
Tell me there's no way that you'll let him use you
You'd think by now you'd know him by all his signs
So how could you be a fool?

Girl, here he comes again
Tellin' lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
You'll find out, you know he's no good
When will you learn
He's nothing but a user

It's not my place to say what to do, no
But I just can't stand when love abuses you
He's never gonna change, no no no
He enjoys seeing you in so much pain
So little girl, get up off your face
And hold your head up high
And tell him that you are through
You might also like
Girl, here he comes again
Tellin' lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
You'll find out, you know he's no good
When will you learn
He's nothing but a user

Girl, I know you want me
I see the look in your eyes
All you have to do is ask me
Don't think you're wasting your time
I am yours if you want me
All you have to do is tell me
Do you want me? Do you want him?
Look behind your back, he's comin' again

Girl, here he comes again
Tellin' lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
You'll find out, you know he's no good
When will you learn
He's nothing but a user
Girl, here he comes again
Tellin' lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
You'll find out, you know he's no good
When will you learn
