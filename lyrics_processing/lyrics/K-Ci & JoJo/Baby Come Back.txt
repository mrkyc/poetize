Baby, come back
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Baby, come back
Hey

I was a fool to let you go
I let you walk right out of my door
It was a bad mistake I made
And I regret it to this day
If I had a second chance
I promise, girl, I'll make it last
So tonight I'll erase my pride
If you let me back inside

Baby, come back (ooh, yeah, babe)
Baby, come back to me (oh)
I don't want to be free (and you know, and you know, baby)
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back to me (ooh, yeah)
I don't want to be free (oh)
Baby, come back to me
You might also like
Baby, over and over I try to forget you
But it seems too hard
My feelings for you I can't disregard
It's driving me so crazy that you're not my baby
Anymore, baby
All I want you to do is bring your love back to me

It's not about sex, baby
I know you're the best lady
Please have my baby
Forever my lady
It's not about sex, baby
I know you're the best lady
Please have my baby
Forever my lady

Baby, come back
Baby, come back to me (come on back)
Baby come back to me (I don't want to be free, I don't want to be free, baby)
Baby come back (yeah)
Baby come back to me (ooh, wee)
I don't want to be free (no, no, no, no, no, no)
Baby, come back to me
Baby, come back (come on back)
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby, come back to me
Baby, come back
Baby, come back to me (oh, woah)
I don't want to be free (yeah, I don't wanna be free)
Baby, come back to me (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Baby, come back
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Said I need you in the morning

Baby, come back to me
Baby, come back  (I need you in the midnight hour)
Baby, come back to me (yes I do, baby)

Baby, come back to me
Baby, come back (I need you with me right now, baby)
Baby, come back to me (ah come on, ah come on, ah come on)
I don't want to be free (I don't want to be free)
