Christmas time is so special
When you're kissing me
(Under the, under the)
Under the mistletoe
Exchanging love and gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you, and you holding me

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

Last year, Christmas
It happened without us
I was all mixed up and confused
I didn't know what to do, baby
I never thought I'd feel this way
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa wouldd pack love on his sleigh
And send it my way
You might also like
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

(You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)
What a beautiful time, beautiful time it is
(Oh, what a beautiful time it is, pretty baby, yeah)
A time to open gifts (Time to open gifts)
And play with all the kids (Hey hey hey)
Yes, it's Christmas
(Yes, it's Christmas time)
Yes, it's Christmas time again
(Yes, Christmas time again, baby)
Girl, I love you
(Girl, I love you)
Yes, I love you (Hey)
It's Christmas time again

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas
