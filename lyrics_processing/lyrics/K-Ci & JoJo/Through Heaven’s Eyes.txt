And though its color brightly shines
Can never see its purpose
In the pattern of the grand design
And the stone that sits up on the very top
Of the mountain's mighty face
Does it think that it's more important
Than the stones that forms the base
So how can you see what your life is worth
Or where your value lies?
Oh, you can never see through the eyes of man
You must look at your life
Look at your life through Heaven's eyes

Is less than a cool fresh spring
And to one lost sheep, a shepherd boy
Is greater than the richest king
Should a man lose everything he owns
Has he truly lost his worth
Or is it the beginning
Of a new and brighter birth?
So how do you measure the worth of a man
In wealth or strength or size, oh?
In how much he gained or how much he gave
The answer will come to ya
To look at his life through Heaven's eyes

That's why we share all we have with you
Though there's little to be found
When all you've got is nothing
There's a lot to go around
No life can escape being blown about
By the winds of change and chance
And though you never know all the steps
You must learn to join the dance
