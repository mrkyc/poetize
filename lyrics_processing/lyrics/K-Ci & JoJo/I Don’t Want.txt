I can't lie, I can't lie
I can't lie, I can't lie
I can't lie, I can't lie
I can't lie

I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself

As long as you keep doing to me
What you did to me the first day
I don't need nobody else
I don't need nobody else
I'm not looking for a girl
Because I already have a woman and I
Don't want nobody else
I'm happy with my baby and my baby is you

I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
I'd rather be by myself

When I called the other night
I didn't tell no lie
Baby, you know you're so right
I want you to be my wife
Can I be with you?
Every day, I wanna be near you
And baby, I won't front on you
You know that I want you, baby

I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself

Can't you see that I don't want
Anybody else but you and only you
Can't you see that I will never
Never love anybody else but you
I give my life to you
You're all I wanna do
Baby, come home to me
I feel so happy
I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I'd rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
