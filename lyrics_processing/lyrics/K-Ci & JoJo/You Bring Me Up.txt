Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh
Yo JoJo, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Isn't it funny the things you said and done to me?
You said you want me but now lady, I wanna be free
You lied to me, you said you never would play me
But I found out that you were lying all the time

Girl, you pick me up (ooh)
And you bring me down (Bring me down)
When I thought I found in you solid ground (oh)
You turn my smile (You turn my smile)
Into a frown (Into a frown)
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down (mm, you made me say oh oh oh)
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (JoJo help me, mm)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Eweee, ah ah ooh ooh, yeah yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Can I get a witness?)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (I could go on and talk a little 'bout me, listen, yeah)
You might also like
When I was up, girl, you brought me down
Played me like a clown, you thought I'd stay around
So you could, you could abuse me, take my heart and use me
And you see I'm still around for your talk and for your smile

Girl, you pick me up (You pick me up)
And you bring me down (Same time you bring me down)
When I thought I found in you solid ground (I thought I found in you solid ground)
You turn my smile (oh oh oh oh)
Into a frown (Baby)
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down (ooh oh oh oh)
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Help me say oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Say it say it say it yeah, say oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

There is something I have to say
Something I can't delay
You hurt me so bad
And you made me feel so sad
It's a feeling I can't explain
I won't let you wreck my brain
You said you'd never hurt me
But then you go and desert me, baby
Oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, you pick me up (c'mon)
And you bring me down
When I thought I found in you solid ground (uh huh)
You turn my smile
Into a frown
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
