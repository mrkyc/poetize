Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby, listen
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah, you

I was sitting at home
Thinking to myself
I started thinking 'bout you
How much I do love you, I really do
I would never trade you, never forsake you
'Cause nothing could be better
That's why I wrote you this letter
I love you always, lady

Last night (ooh)
I wrote a short letter (I wrote a short letter)
And it went this way (And it went this way)
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you (I love you, just thinking of you)
Love always (ooh)
Last night (baby)
I wrote a short letter (I wrote a short letter for you)
And it went this way (And it went this way)
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you (yeah, yeah)
Love always (yeah, yeah, ooh)
You might also like
Now I know I could've called
But it seem much better this way
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm so blessed your my lady, lady (you're my lady, you're my lady)
Now I know I can't wait until tomorrow
When you're in my arms again
Holding and kissing you
Doin' the things we love to do, until then

Last night (ooh)
I wrote a short letter
And it went this way (went this way)
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you (I love you, I'm just thinking of you)
Love always (baby)

You, baby, oh, baby
You, hey, hey, ooh
Last night (ooh wee)

And it went this way (went this way)
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you (oh, oh)

I love you, I love you, I love you
And there is nothin' that I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do it this way)
Just to prove that I really, really love you
And baby, I want you, I want you, I want you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And there is nothing that I'd rather do (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Than to love you (you, you, you, yeah)
I love you always (you, you, you, yeah)
