Mhm...JoJo, you're my brother
Can I talk to my brother for a minute yall?
Now JoJo, we done see it all, did it all, done it all, yes we have
Back against the wall
Standing in the middle at the crossroad
In and out of trouble, how we're still here, only Lord knows

When I walke through the fire, at my lowest moment
When the party's over, you was there for me
When nothing wasn't working, my soul started hurting
They thought we were over, you was there for me

Am I my brother's keeper? Yes, I am
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes, I am
Somebody tell me

Now can I talk to my brother for a minute, y'all? That's right
Now K-Ci, we done see it, we done did it, we done done it all
(And you know)
Baby mama drama, rehab life on a reality show
Between money and the fame, women in the game
How we're still here, only God knows
