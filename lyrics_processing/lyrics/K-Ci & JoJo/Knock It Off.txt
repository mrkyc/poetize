I'm loving your every thing
I'll do anything to make you feel good (feel good)
K-Ci's got that real good (real good)
And we can go all night
Wake up in the morning, you'll be like it's still good (still good)
Ooh yeah, still good
You better stop playing them games
Sexy ass soft and look at that frame
Goddamn (goddamn), goddamn (goddamn)
Over them body goings
Then you can leave and tell your friends
That man (that man), that man (that man), that man (that man)
He's got me going

I'm gonna take you to my room
And lay you down if you don't knock it off
(Girl, knock it off; baby, knock it off
Girl, knock it off, b-baby knock it off)
Feel my real at work
I'll be the man your friends be talking about
(Girl, knock it off; baby, knock it off
Girl, knock it off, b-baby knock it off)
