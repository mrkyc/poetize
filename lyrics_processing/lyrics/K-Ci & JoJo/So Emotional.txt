Whenever I touch you, whenever we kiss

You're so beautiful, yeah

You do to many, whatever it is you do to me
You make the whole world stop
And stand still (and stand still)
Now every time I see you walking by
I can see the reason why you're special to me
I thank God every day
Every time I see your pretty face

Whenever I touch you, whenever we kiss

Whenever you're around, I can't resist
It's so sexual
Whenever you do that thing with your lips
I get so emotional
You're so beautiful, yeah
