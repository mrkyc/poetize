But then again somebody out there might just will
Let me take my time and tell you, baby, oh
Ha ha ha, I feel good about telling you all of this, ha ha
Can I get a witness yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ever since I was a baby boy
I played with ladies like my toys
Always said I'd never fall in love
Don't want to care about a woman that much
Never thought I would find a girl
Who would change my attitude, now my heart doesn't care
What I had on my mind, especially when it come to you
Baby, you're the reason why, baby, baby

I won't never say never again
(Can I get a witness? Somebody tell me why, baby)
I won't never say never again

'Cause lovin' you, baby, has taught me a lesson
(Lovin' you, I won't never never)
No, I won't never say never again
