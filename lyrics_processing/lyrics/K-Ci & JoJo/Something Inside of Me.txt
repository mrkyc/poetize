If you should ever go blind
I promise I'll be your eyes
I plan to live and die right by your side
Because I love you so much
And I love you with my life, my life, girl

I feel it now more than ever before
It's real and too hard to ignore
I walk in my dreams behind you
And the wind blows your scent inside of me
Won't be afraid to love
As long as you let me in your heart
And build a life together
And share the joy of children forever

Something inside of me
That I want the whole world to see
There will always be a space in my soul
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me
Inside of me

My friend
The one who knows my passion
I can hardly look in your eyes
It takes my breath with just the simplest reaction
And you should stop thinking about it
And just let it start
And build a life together
Share the joy of our children forever

Something inside of me
That I want the whole world to see
There will always be a space in my soul
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me
Inside of me

Nobody can love you like I do
Place your hand on my heart
I know it beats for you
Said I don't wanna have a world without you lady
I said my life is so incomplete
Until I see you

Something inside of me
That I want the whole world to see
There will always be a space in my soul
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me
Inside of me
Something inside of me
That I want the whole world to see
There will always be a space in my soul
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me
Inside of me
Lady lady lady, my lady lady lady
