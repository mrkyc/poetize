I thought I left long ago
I wanted to ask you
You used to hug and there was no feeling behind it
Do you remember back in the days?
We use to laugh and play all night long
And if you do (If you do)
Tell me (tell me) how long, how long

How long do you need time away?
Hopefully not long you'll stay away
And I pray that everything's okay
Tell me, I wanna know how long
How long will you, you'll be away?

Now it hurts me so thinking about her
At night my bed is cold
And lonely without her
Can't explain what heaven knows
I'm crazy about her
If she come back she don't know
I said she really really don't know
So please, my lady, tell me how long

How long do you need time away?
Hopefully not long you'll stay away
And I pray that everything's okay
Tell me, I wanna know how long
How long will you, you'll be away?
How long do you need time away?
Hopefully not long you'll stay away
And I pray that everything's okay
Tell me, I wanna know how long
How long will you, you'll be away?

I miss you so (I miss you so)
