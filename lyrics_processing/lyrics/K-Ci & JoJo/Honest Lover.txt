Let's make love tonight, I'm in the mood to make love
Let's make love tonight, I'm in the mood to make love
Let's make love tonight, I'm in the mood to make love
Let's make love tonight, I'm in the mood to make love
Let's do it right, baby

Give me a reason, to love you again
I'm still not over, the pain you put me through
You know you were wrong
I tried to hide it, but it didn't work
I couldn't take it no more, so I had to move on
I'm moving on

I'm looking for an honest lover
Somebody that'll be there for me, I gotta find an honest lover
I'm looking for an honest lover
Somebody that'll be there for me, I'm moving on I'm moving on

You told me so many lies, you tried to convince me of your honesty
You see that wasn't good enough (Not good enough for me)
And I can't believe you betrayed me, and put our love in jeopardy
I can't believe that it was happening to me
I tried to hide it, but it didn't work
I couldn't take it no more, so I had to move on
I'm moving on

Give me a reason girl to take you back
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta be strong
Baby, you know you done me wrong, so I gotta keep moving on
I gotta go, there's no turning back to you

I'm looking for an honest lover
Somebody that'll be there for me, I gotta find an honest lover
I'm looking for an honest lover
