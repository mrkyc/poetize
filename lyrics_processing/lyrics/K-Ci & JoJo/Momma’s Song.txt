We gonna do something a little different for y'all
On this song because
Me and my mama was watching the news the other day and
We saw a lot of thangs that's goin' on in the world
And mama just happen to just come up with some lyrics to a song
She said, "I want y'all to sing this song for me on this CD
'Cause y'all never sang a song for me before"
And ah, this was written by mama
And this is what mama told me to tell y'all
She said

We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above

Look into the mirror of life
And tell me what you see
I see people all over the world
Who needs to know the meaning of love
Let me tell you what real love is all about
If you see a man down, don't step on him
Reach down and pick him up
Pick him up, give him a helping hand
You might also like
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above

Oh, see that mother over there
Strugglin' to survive
She has about five little children
No food or clothes to put on their backs
And what you should do
If you see somebody like that
You should go up to them
Lend them a helping hand
Offer a roof over their head
'Cause the world is in need of love like that

We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above

K-Ci help me, K-Ci help me
Tell 'em where we need love
USA, Africa, Bosnia, Ethiopia
Korea and China, even Iraq too
Even in Haiti
That's what we all need
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
That special love, the love from above
We all need that kind of love
