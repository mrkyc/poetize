It's Devant with the Hailey Bros
Waitin on you baby
You know what I'm saying
It's been a long time
They still waiting
Still waiting to get it on
Coming straight from the Dirty South
Oh, woah, oh
Baby, yeah

I'm telling you something, I think you should listen
I'm making an offer but it's your decision
The choice is yours, it's all up to you
So don't be a fool, you know who to choose, girl

Now every time I see you walking by with the other guys
I just wonder why can't that be I
Kissing your lips and rubbing your thighs
Waking up every morning by your side, tell me why

I'm still waiting for you to come feel ecstasy
On my knees, check my stees
Let me knock it with ease
I'm still waiting for the day when I can fill his space
When I can take his place
You can fill my face all around you, girl
Uh, huh, listen

Been meaning to tell you, I'm feining to smell you
It's nothing that you said, it's nothing you did
It's just the way you are, girl, you flip my lid
