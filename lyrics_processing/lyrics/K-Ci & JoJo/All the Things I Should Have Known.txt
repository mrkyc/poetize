Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby

If I had been there to wipe your tears
Then no one else would be around
If I had been there to cradle your fears
We'd still be together now
Wish I could be there to share your dreams
I wish that I could still be down, baby
But you are gone and I'm here alone
And I sure do regret it now
Oh yes, I do
Said I really do
Oh, I'm missin' you
Oh, I'm missin' you

Baby I, should've known
I should've cared just a little bit more
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellas
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go
Baby I, and I want you to know
If I could take it back you that I would
I'd give anything to get things back
Now that I know
All the things I should've known
You might also like
Should've been there with my baby every night
Been kissin' you and holding you so tight
How I wish that I could be with you right now
I'd give anything to see your smile
But I'm all alone and all the should'ves in the world
They won't bring you back and I'm the one to blame
I didn't know how to act or save the love
And I sure do regret it lady, lady lady lady

Baby I, should've known
I should've cared just a little bit more
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellas
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go
Baby I, and I want you to know
If I could take it back you that I would
I'd give anything to get things back
Now that I know
All the things I should've known

I promise I won't ignore you
Never ever, ever be alone
Just lean on me and my shoulder
Girl, I promise you, I won't let you fall
Yes, I do
I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Baby I, should've known
I should've cared just a little bit more
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellas
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go
Baby I, and I want you to know
If I could take it back you that I would
I'd give anything to get things back
Now that I know
All the things I should've known
All the things I should've known
All the things I should've known

All the things I should
The things I should
