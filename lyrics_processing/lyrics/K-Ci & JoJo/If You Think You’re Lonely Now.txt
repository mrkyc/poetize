I just wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers in the world tonight
And I expect that to be the whole world because everybody needs someone
Or something to love
Yeah

When it's cold outside
Girl, who are you holding?
You'll be holding me
Well, well, well, well, well
Said if y'all don't mind
Can I talk about this woman I have?
She's always complaining about the things she ain't got
And the things her girlfriend's got
But lady I will let you know
I can't be in two places at one time

If you think you're lonely now, ooh yeah
Wait until tonight, girl
Oh, you better wait 'til tonight, yeah baby
(If you think you're lonely now)
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone
(If you think you're lonely now)
Yes I will
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You better wait until tonight
You might also like
When skeletons come out of your closet
And chase you all around the room
Memories sound like a ghost
And you are scared talk to me, baby

(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you're lonely now
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Wait until tonight
Wait until tonight, baby, yeah, yeah
(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You better wait until tonight
(If you think you're lonely now)
Do you believe me baby?
(Wait until tonight, girl)

Ain't it funny how tables turn
When things ain't goin' your way, ha
When love walks out, pain walks in
You can't help to say

(If you think you're lonely now)
Think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
If you think you're lonely now
(You better wait girl, yeah)
Wait until tonight, girl
If you think you're lonely now
(If you think you're lonely now)
Hold on, ooh yeah
Wait until tonight, girl
I wanna testify
I wanna testify
I wanna testify to ya
I just got one thing to say
If you think you're lonely now

If you think you're lonely now
(Baby, yeah)
Wait until tonight, girl
(Share your feelings)
If you think you're lonely now
(Ooh yeah)
Wait until tonight, girl
(Oh, don't be a fool)
If you think you're lonely now
(Baby, please don't be a fool)
Wait until tonight, girl
If you think you're lonely now
