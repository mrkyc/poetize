We fell in love a year ago
Everything was fine
And then you started hangin' out late
All the time, all the time
I had to eat all alone
I had to sleep all alone
I had no one to call my own
'Til I fell in love with someone new

If you love me, and I love you, baby, why
You've been duckin' me
Late at night when it gets cold
I have no one to hold
I have no one to hold, I have no one to hold me
If I love you, and you love me, baby, why
Why do I have somebody new?
Now I got two, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Tell me
What am I gonna do, baby
JoJo, help me sing it

I ran into you the other day
Everything was fine (Everything was fine)
Until I saw you hangin' out
With another guy, with another guy
I knew you had someone else
That's why I found someone else
You tryin' to play me, but I guess
I guess you seen that I wasn't goin' for that

If you love me, and I love you, baby, why
Late at night when it gets cold
I have no one to hold
If I love you, and you love me, baby, why
Now I got two
What am I, what am I gonna do?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby
Oh whoa, oh whoa
What am I gonna do, baby
Yeah, oh whoa
What am I gonna do?
Baby, I gotta know
Need to know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
I gotta know why
What am I gonna do
Oh yeah
What am I gonna do
Oh yeah, and you know

If you love me, and I love you, baby, why
Late at night when it gets cold
I have no one to hold
If I love you, and you love me, baby, why
Now I got two
What am I, what am I gonna do?
If you love me
Tell me why
