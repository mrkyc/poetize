Yeah, yeah
Yeah, listen to me
I got something on my mind to tell you, yeah
Listen

It's three o'clock and you're still not home
You're already two hours late
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
But baby girl, you always disappoint me, yes, you do
And lately you've been bringing it home
That smell that you're wearing is not my cologne
But I put up with it 'cause I love you so
But baby, I just can't take it no more

Baby, you're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me
And I don't have a choice, baby
You're making me say goodbye
I can't take one more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay
It hurts so bad, I gotta leave

Girl, I know the signals on the phone
Two if I'm home and three if I'm gone
I suspected it a year ago
I confronted you, you told me I was wrong
The other night I couldn't fall asleep
I heard you whisper his name in your dreams
What kind of man would I be to stay?
There ain't no question, I gotta leave

Baby, you're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me
Now I don't have a choice, baby
You're making me say goodbye
I can't take one more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay
It hurts so bad, I gotta leave

I did the best that I could do for you, baby
But I guess my best wasn't good enough for you
How could you let him break up our happy home?
How could you say the words, "I love you"
When you don't mean a damn thing?
And ooh, you're gonna reap what you sow, baby
And it's gonna catch up to you
And it's gonna get next to you baby, baby
Baby, you're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me
Now I don't have a choice baby
You're making me say goodbye
I can't take one more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay
