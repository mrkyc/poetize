They're always running around
Telling me that I should be free
But there's no kind of way
I'ma gonna let them take your love from me, no
You see I'm not one who goes on
Speculations, hearsay, and gossip
But I'm a firm believer
In trusting, caring and loving

My love for you is so timeless (so timeless)
It's deeper than the depth of emotion (deeper than the depth)
And every day goes by, I'm finding (said I'm finding)
The reasons that I love you more and more

Now and forever will I love you and be true (baby, mmm)
Now and forever will I keep what we have new (Now and forever, mmm)
I will cherish, adore you (adore you)
Trust and give my all to you (all to you, babe)
Now and forever will I love you (you, you, you, I love you)

I'm not interested in starting all over again
To give you up on somebody else's words
Is not something I'd do
You see you can tell a tree
By the, by the fruit that it bears
And from where I stand
You see, my field is yielding

Wish we could sail away on the ocean (wish I could sail away, baby)
Float away on midnight dreams (oh, baby)
And we don't need a magic potion (we can't explain our love)
So we can live inside our dreams (oh)

Now and forever will I love you and be true (yeah, yeah, I will always love you)
Now and forever will I keep what we have new (oh, yeah)

Trust and give my all to you (yes, I will)
Now and forever will I, love you (I will keep loving you, baby, I'm only gonna love you)

You're everything I want in a lover (everything, yeah)
You're everything I need in a friend, yes you are (everything to me)
You're the shoulder that I'm leaning and depending on, baby
And I could never hurt you, no, you're everything to me

Now and forever will I love you and be true (oh, yeah, and you know)
Now and forever will I keep what we have new (now, now, I wanna cherish you)
