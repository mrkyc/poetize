Who is the God who said to the darkness
Let there be light and there was light
Who is the God who made the heavens
The sun and moon, the stars and sky
He is the one who's like no other
Omnipotent and oh so wise
Invisible yet ever-present
He is the holy God most high

This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
From now until the end of time
This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
From now until the end of time

This is the God who came down from heaven
Said let the children come to me
He healed the sick and walked on water
He conquered death to set us free
He is the one who's always loved us
Even when we walked away
It is His love that will ever hold us
Until the day we see His face
You might also like
This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
From now until the end of time
This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
From now until the end of time
Hallelujah (X4)

"Alright, are you ready
We're going to shout the names of God
Here we go"
"He's the holy One, the I Am
The Beginning and the End, the Infinite
All Powerful, All Knowing, Ever Present
Invisible, Miracle Working God
He's the Creator of the world, the Righteous Judge
The King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords"
"So, Who is this God?"
"This God, He's my God, forever and ever
He will be our God, even to the end
He's the Lamb of God, the Bread of Life
The Firm Foundation, the Bright and Morning Star
His name is Emmanuel, Redeemer, Wonderful Counselor
The Everlasting Father, The Ancient of Days
He's the Rewarder, the Healer, the Prince of Peace
The Hope of Glory, and the soon and coming King"
This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
From now until the end of time
This God, He is our God
Forevermore and evermore
He'll be our guiding light
