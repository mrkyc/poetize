Can't creep behind the back door stair
Don't matter, don't care
Tried to find a heart that wasn't there
But I took the highway to your soul
Rolling thunder swinging low
Take me further on down the line
Hope it finds you in your time, in your time
Find the wheel, carry on
Can't change the scene
Things are left undone
Don't matter, don't care
Tried to find a heart that wasn't there
But I took the highway to your soul
Rolling thunder swinging low
Gonna take it further on down the line
Going to find you in your time, in your time
Find the wheel carry on
Can't change the scene
Things are left undone
Don't matter, don't care
Tried to find a heart that wasn't there
