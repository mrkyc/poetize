I see myself and i'm not myself
Nowhere to stop, nowhere to go
And I just don't know of anything else
It's 4 o'clock in the morning but i'm wide awake
And thoughts of you prey on my mind
I know i'm outsmarted this time
I got in, but I can't get out that way
Baby you got me all caught up
You don't know what a maze you made
I got in a little deeper everyday
You know I don't wanna be found
Runnin' around in a maze you made
Faithful to a fault, until the end
You know i'll be there, follow anywhere
No exit sign, just another turn
And I might get burned but I just don't care
I'm tired of overthinkin' til I can't see straight
And visions of you weigh on my mind
There's no escaping this time
I got in, but I can't get out that way
Baby you got me all caught up
You dont know what a maze you made
I got in a little deeper everyday
You know I don't wanna be found
Runnin' around in a maze you made
You might also likeSo up and back and 'round the same corner I turn
And I get so high but then I feel the slide down to earth
Guess you're a lesson that I need to make work
But I can't learn, no I can't learn
No I can't get out that way
Baby you got me all caught up
You don't know what a maze you made
I got in, but I can't get out that way
You know I don't wanna be found
Runnin' around in a maze you made
Woah
Runnin' around
You know I don't wanna be found
In a maze you made
Woah, yeah
You know I don't wanna be found
