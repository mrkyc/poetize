On Friday night
Got my good shoes on
And i'm all right
I got this crazy feeling
Down in my bones
I walk in the room
And the party's on
Everybody dancing
To blue eyed soul
Then i saw you baby
Standing alone
There was magic in the air
I was trying not to stare
But you caught me
You caught me cold
Now there's nothing I can do
(but if you give me tonight) i'm gonna lay my burden down
(what i got on my mind) baby, it's you
(got this feeling inside) that you're feeling me too
So I'm making my move
(baby give me tonight)

And the vibe is real
We can make this happen
Tell me how you feel
You know my love is waiting, honey
Take the wheel
There was magic in the air
You were trying not to stare
But I caught you
I caught you cold
Now there's nothing you can do
(but if you give me tonight) i'm gonna lay my burden down
(what i got on my mind) baby, it's you
(got this feeling inside) that you're feeling it too
So I'm making my move
(baby give me tonight)
It was a flash
Happened so fast
You looked at me
I knew
That's all it took
To get me hooked
And now i'm following through
There's just no way
That I can stay
Stay away from you
Now I'm making my move
(but if you give me tonight) i'm gonna lay my burden down
(what i got on my mind) baby, it's you
(got this feeling inside) that you're feeling me too
So I'm making my move
I'm making my move
(but if you give me tonight) i'm gonna lay my burden down
(what i got on my mind) baby, it's you
(got this feeling inside) so I'm making my move
