New found freedom, making up for lost time
Dug a little deeper, moved it on down the line
Must've been sleepin', it's about time I opened my eyes
When I walk I walk with confidence
I hold my head up high
When I talk I've got a positive sense
Of who I am inside
New found freedom
Oh, let the light be my life
New found freedom
Oh, gonna spread my wings and fly
It's no secret where I've been before
Turned that corner standing at the front door
Starting down a new road leaving the other side
Gonna release it, breaking away the ties that bind
When I walk I walk with confidence
I hold my head up high
When I talk I've got a positive sense
Of who I am inside
New found freedom
Oh, let the light be my life
New found freedom
Oh, gonna spread my wings and fly
