You know, sometimes we have a tendencies, or should I say we forget
What a woman needs every now and then
That is if you wanna keep your thing together. Listen to me now)
Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better everyday
Then you got to stay on your p's and q's. If you don't, the woman you can easy lose
Whoa oa oa I, Oh I had a love, a love and I lost her
And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
Ohhh, a woman's gotta have it, I believe, she's gotta know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it, every time boy
She wants to know that she's not walkin' on shakey ground. Ohhhh, yeah
Well, think it over
Think it over
Think it over my brother. Don't take for granted the smile
On her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find
A tear trace
Maybe the girl might never say a
Mumbling word
But you gotta make sure that her voice is heard
Whoa ohhh ohhh I had a love

A true love and I lost it
