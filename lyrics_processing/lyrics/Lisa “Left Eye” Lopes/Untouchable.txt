(Untouchable)
Untouchable

Look at how you found me
I'm lookin' around me, sayin' these are my friends
It's a strange world, my enemies are my friends
More of the same street, same world, same problems
Is it different?
Same drama, same karma, same mama
Is it different?
The only difference is me
I see inside the truth
Feel bad you don't know the day gon' come
When God has taken you
I see the invisible spirits, walking along the physical mind
Of a crazy individual
Where demons still find it livable
I need a hug to hold my soul
Inside my body
I got this secret here yeah, I should have told somebody
Cause ever since, I've been saying things I never meant
It's like I was speakin' in tongues
The black breath in my lungs
I won't allow it
But the cowards live under the dirt in and the flowers huh
Ready to come up in the darkest hour
It ain't the courage of my persona
You wanna admire, it's the faith
Cause with the faith I can walk through the fire
Now feel me
You might also like
I know you feel me it's the untouchable (Untouchable)
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoing inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable (Untouchable)
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoing inside my soul

Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm sinking
Thinking, what it's like from on the other side
When I look at myself it's like my love had died
People thinking of getting richer
I'm using the blood of the loves that I lost recently
To paint a perfect picture
Can you see the future? Future endeavors
That'll make us better
Using the light from my wings to make us fly together
Guide my people to a place like what we imagined
My duty now is to God
There's no more beauty pageants
(But the creator) would give me the chance to thank Him
Me and you finally for what they made us
Is it a game that we still playing?
Look at us now, we really free
Paying society's debt but life we still obeyin'
Until then, I'll follow the path
Where will it lead
Much in between, ashes and dust
We must believe, trickery ain't trickin' me
I got tricks up my sleeve
They trying to mark me
I'm trying to make my mark before I leave (Let me breathe)
I know you feel me it's the untouchable (Untouchable)
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoing inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable (Untouchable)
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoing inside my soul

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable, make yourself presentable
(I will ride untouchable I will ride)

After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment
We b-ball in the game
Time to make y'all my military
Be prepared for the busters
I'mma let ya bitches that's scary
Get to hear me no questions
Visions of overpacked prisons
Millions of niggas thug livin'
Precious, three strikes, I hope they don't test us
And pull a heater ammunition is great (shh)
Move without a sound
As we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas just defenses
I'm hittin' fences to getting ghost
Who can prevent me from shooting senseless
At these niggas throats, only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds y'all remember me
Legendary live eternally then bury me in pieces
Cause they fear reincarnation, niggas screamin' peace
Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places, fake their fates then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder mothafuckas at a rate now quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on til' I die
Now I'm worldwide!
Niggas gossip like girls, they hide
No offense to Nas
But this whole fuckin' world is mine
Even if you blind
You can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Fiendin' for currency
The money be calling
Can you feel me dreaming
Seein' scenes of me balling
Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws bustin' while we rushin the Untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We outlaws rushin' 'em bustin'
We untouchable, untouchable, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul

Ya'll niggas never stop, you never drop, you never let me fall
Me 2Pacalypse
All I know how to do is ball, ball, ball
My crew, survived reincarnation
After I'm dead they'll rock and roll
And bring the funk to the whole nation
And you know each one of these fuckin' niggas
Have a gun with my name on it, untouchable
I spit the game so clear it's playin' on it, you know
When I'm dead
My niggas will ride for me
Untouchable (untouchable)
Untouchable (untouchable)
Untouchable (untouchable)
Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back
