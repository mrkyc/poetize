A quick story from rags to riches (Rags to riches)
Comin' to you from Supernova AKA Left Eye (Mhmm)
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em (Yeah) haha
I'm goin', I'm goin' (Love sucks)
From rags to riches ha ha ha ha (Never gon' wild out)
I'm goin', I'm goin' (Cause I can take it y'all!)
From rags to riches ha ha ha ha Come on, kick it off!

I started off as an army brat (Atten-hut!)
Seven months old class act
I was racing down the block
As a matter of fact haha
I could've been a track star, (I guess I am)
I stacked bars
Comin' through your system in them phat cars uh
Cross country isn't that far
It's like I'm in the race, don't know who you cats are
See? One day I fell from grace, landed in this place
My innocence erased from talkin' back to my momma's face
Like I was lost in space
Without a trace, uh cuttin' class, bein' Mrs. Fast Ass
Gettin' blasted with my dad, got caught up in the flash
My Nana goin' straight mad, had to make the dash
So I fell up in the streets
Did anything for cash
And anything to crash in anybody's path
Gave everything I had
Look at what I could grab (What was that?) check it
And it was just a bunch of rags

Ding ding the bell ring, landlord causin' a scene
Mama diggin' for her green, last dolla dolla bill
To pay for the phone bill, electric bill, water bill
How you feel when you make a mill?
And move your mama to a house on the hill
With picture framed TV's on the wall
Bar downstairs for when she wanna ball
A cell phone for when she wanna call
She ballin' out of control
With her own bank roll, I got her back though
One for the money and two for the show
Marble floors stayin' clean 600 green outside
Showin' them the many ways that God provides in life
I hope you see the bigger picture
And tell a story from goin' dead broke to gettin' richer
Knowin' I'm gettin' with you in this paper chase
Rags to riches all up in your face

I remember sellin' coke
Can't believe that I was poisonin' my folk
And let my throat be the antidote
Always kept my hopes high
Now mama don't cry, cause I'll be close by with the most high I was playin' Robin Hood in the hood
Little Red Riding Hood
Til' the barrel pointed where I stood. Yeah, stood but walked away Like I was absolutely positively sure I could
Attitude on fuck it
Two dollars in the bucket
And schemin' steady dreamin'
For a chance to make some duckets
Caused a little ruckus on the sideline
Fully reconstructed, every guideline
From the alley way to Cali, on the Grammy day
Went from disarray to mayday, mayday, mayday
Ran away from the sickness with the quickness
And went from rags to riches
I'm goin' from rags to riches
From rags to riches
I'm goin' from rags (I'm goin' I'm goin'!) (What?)
I bet you I'mma be the richest (Come on)

You know what I'm sayin'
Nuttin' but a quick story from rags to riches
(I'm goin' I'm goin'!)
To all my mournin' ghetto superstars out there
Much love! (From rags to riches)
I'm backin' everybody, East coast, West coast, Midwest
Everything you know what I'm sayin', it's all hip hop
Much love!
We all came from rags and went to riches
And the ones that's still messin' with them rags
You know what I'm sayin'
Keep your head up know what I'm sayin'
Somethin' bound to happen
