Now
Now what do you believe?
Who do you receive?
Where do you go next?
And through what exit do you leave?
The questions that I believe confessions go to He
Count your many lessons and the blessings that they bring
This is for my breed and all life that is conceived
Energy told me you manifest your destiny
What is energy?
It's what you eat
It's what you breathe
It's what you think
It permeates throughout your being
And serves a link
To all other energies
That's anything and everything
Moving light that you have never seen
And light carries information
Without hesitation vibrations glean
Through the constellation, manifestation stimulated
For better destination, total creation realization
And mental concentration
Alienated from the truth
Is why we conversate
Savin' the nation for the youth
Is for my observation

Are you free or are you guided? (Uh uh what?)
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love, love (Yeah uh uh uh)

Let's touch on Christianity
I question all humanity
Is God so full of vanity?
That children enter this family
Whom haven't yet to see that Jesus is the key
Or suffer this calamity (I cast you down for an eternity)
Insanity
You can call it what you want to
But the man in me
Separated from this false reality
Would never be the victim of casualty
For my lack of understanding physicality
Spirituality and immortality
No matter your status or nationality
What's your locality? Notice the fallacy
We all separated by principalities
Billions of galaxies and all you see is this
In a totality of eternal bliss
A life of sin, it's all of kin
Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love, love
Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love, love

You see, we like to make things complicated
You don't have to read books and go to church
To learn about God
And find answers
We don't know even have to talk to each other
You know if we all just be quiet
Then we'll realize that we can really hear each other
And then you'll realize that you already have the answers (haha)

Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love, love
Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love, love
Do you make, make your own?
Cause you're all on your own
Do you all make, make your own?
Cause you're all on your own
Do you make, make your own?
Cause you're all on your own
Do you all make, make your own?
Cause you're all on your own
Do you make, make your own?
Cause you're all on your own
Do you all make, make your own?
