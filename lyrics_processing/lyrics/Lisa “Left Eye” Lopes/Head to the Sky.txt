Keep on singing let's try
Keep on moving try

Keep your head to the sky
Live your life and reach high
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky
Live your life and reach high
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try

To all my little shorties coming up in school
Don't forget what they said about the golden rule uh uh
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"
Your life is what you make it, and that's true
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Let lesson number one be:
(You better watch what's coming out'cha mouth)
Cause while you're talkin' 'bout your friends
Know the messages you sent
Gotta real funny way of comin' back again
I know that life can be a (struggle, struggle, struggle)
You stayin' in and out of (trouble, trouble, trouble)
But the youths, killin' our youths
What's up with that?
You feelin' used and abused
Wanna strike back?
Then do yourself a favor
Take the anger, flip it around
(I'm telling you that He's the savior)
There's more to life than you may ever know
But you must recognize
(What it means to grow)
You might also like
Keep your head to the sky (Keep your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky (Your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry (Yeah uh huh)
You will make it if you try (Come on)

In the midst of all the confusion, burnt bridges turn into bruises
I conjure flames out in fusion, mental combustion to music
Compels the demons to shatter
Misconstrued the fantasy
Imagine the clear is to blaque
It's time to fault the unnatural
Copin' and dealin', makin' me feel like I'm about to burn any second
Losin' the feelin' like life is depressin'
Generations are burnin' and people ain't the same no more
For real cause he drops, she drop
What happened to the fall, we rise?
Instead of encouragement, we encourage pride
If you instill the blessings and return to now for no lie
Unfold your eyes, don't be blinded by the pain and the tears
You never dried
Realize peer pressures of our young adolescent
Bulletproof vestin'
And searchin' for questions
We tell them everything but the truth
For instance there's pride inside
Squash the bullshit and you'll be all right
And we'll make it to that other side
Keep your head to the sky (Keep your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky (Your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try

Now as we step into the light and grab the mic
Let's try to look for difference between wrong and right
You know they listenin' to everything that we recite
But if it's glistenin', that makes it a'ight
We got shorties on the blocks who know they Glocks
Believe it or not
We raised the last generation through Hip-Hop
Can't forget about Playstation, it don't stop!
What is wrong with the nation? It's flip-flopped
(But we can turn it all around, starting with the sound)
Spread love from the Rock 'N Roll to the Underground
We gotta take control of our mind, body, and soul
Never fall, never fold, never fold (For real)
Then let the truth be told, let it go
Let it show
Open your mouth, and let it flow
Into the depths of the blackest hole
(Where you find rainbows) and a pot of gold
Keep your head to the sky (Keep your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky (Your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky (Uh huh)
Live your life and reach high (Come on)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try (Yeah yeah uh huh)
Keep your head to the sky (Come on)
Live your life and reach high
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky
Live your life and reach high
Wipe your tears and don't cry
You will make it if you try
Keep your head to the sky (Your head)
Live your life and reach high (To the sky)
Wipe your tears and don't cry
