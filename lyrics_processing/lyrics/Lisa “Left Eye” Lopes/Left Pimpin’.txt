Ladies and Gentlemen!
Yes my fine gentlemen friends
Okay, we're gonna turn to the chapter in Eyenetics
Called Left Pimping
Everybody turn to Left Pimping
Now as you can see
It's located in a region near your man
Called untitled space

If it's yo man then why the hell is he chillin' in my ride? (Why)
He told you he was faithful, the nigga must have lied (Precisely)
The nigga must have tried
Just to abide
Your committin' stride
He put that shit aside
When I spread that like fungus (Lesson number one)
If size came with age
He's far from the youngest
That brother's humongous
Oh how the hell his tongue is (Number two)
Adoring cunnelingus
How I brung this ruckus (how I bring it like this)
It's jammin' like Smuckers
Fuck this
Wonderin' why he ask for cash when holidays arrive
But time is money (Get the Money!)
And his pockets don't survive
I'm quite the investment
Hot and incandescent
Cristal effervescence (We don't do Moet)
Makes my smile go crescent
I be big pimpin'
Try to stop my intentions
I'll leave your wig drippin'
You might also like
You be
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin'
Stop slippin' slippin'
Stay Left Pimpin' (Left Pimp)
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop bitchin' bitchin' (Come on)
And do the Left Pimpin'
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop slippin' slippin' (Come on)
Stay Left Pimpin'
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop bitchin' bitchin'
And do the Left Pimpin'

My pops said
Once you give a chick
All the dick you stuck
So I give 'em half
And try to stay one step up
Now you gotta know that I carry my game
Tight I'm tryin' to meet ya, feed ya
Fuck ya the same night
Beat it now the daylight
Mean tongue want me to see what it taste like?
I know you do
But I'm a pimp first
Watch what you ask for
Half Hispanic chicks call me Cock-hispaniel
Samples ain't free (uh uh)
Born Brett Pimp
For some of this here
You gots to pay me
Don't love y'all broads
Let y'all tongue massage this dick
Also balls
Give you back shots and big 4-door cars
Love how your head bob up and down like see-saws
See Ma I want you to understand somethin'
A man's compelled to be with more than 1 woman
As long as I keep you cummin' you shouldn't complain
You do you, I do me, simple and plain
Fam mover, hit hard like Zab Judah
Mack come on, I wrote the script with Mack Jr
We be
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin'
Stop slippin' slippin'
Stay Left Pimpin' (Left Pimp)
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop bitchin' bitchin' (Come on)
And do the Left Pimpin' (Left Pimp)
You'll be
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop slippin' slippin' (Come on)
Stay Left Pimpin' (Left Pimp)
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop bitchin' bitchin'
And do the Left Pimpin'

Did I forget to mention? (Listen up now)
Now we be bitchin'
But I'm short of Benjamin
If you a lame hoe
Lend ya man
So my regimen produces regiments
Of many men
Of many skins
From Black, Caucasian
Hispanic, Asian kin
If your body right, mind right
Pockets, can't be tight (Write it down)
Where you goin' tonight?
Where the moon is bright
Fly away hoe (Be gone)
Take flight
Outta sight
Cuz money on the side helps from outside
Reside in the ride chauffeur
Well I'll drive (Women)
Rims that be nice
More Benz than rice (Yeah)
System's too nice
Them new purple headlights be too bright
Engine of might
That screams like a bitch
About to lose they life
All these things come about
Due to the clout
These niggas I scout
Standin' strong and stout (Yes)
I bring out a spout
Cuz there's no drought
When the loot flow out
(Come on)
(Yeah)
(Huh)
(Left pimpin')
You be
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin' (Come on)
Stop slippin' slippin' (Everybody!)
Stay Left Pimpin' (Left Pimp)
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin' (Come on)
Stop bitchin' bitchin' (What?)
And do the Left Pimpin'
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how we be dippin' (Left Pimp)
Stop slippin' slippin'
Stay Left Pimpin'
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin'
Stop bitchin' bitchin'
And do the Left Pimpin'
