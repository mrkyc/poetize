(Who did this?) (Who did this?)
This Jam is dedicated to Moi
That's right you guys
It's Just For.....

Me
I believe in me (That's right)
Cause I take care of me (Me, me)
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family (Yeah, yeah)
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Everybody says they know me better than I know myself
But I don't know nobody else that's felt what I felt (Word)
Did what I did, or been where I been
But, have to defend myself again and again
Let it end where it begins, who cares what the cause is
Too many bosses cause divorces
And I don't take losses well (Nope)
I played with the team, but I'm Diana Ross, and not a Supreme
You think you got me all figured out, oh
So I'm so shallow the only thing I'm tryin to get is a bigger house?
(I don't think so) No! Part of my need is a company
Where I can hire out my own people, to live out their own dreams
So tell me, what's happenin to all y'all people with low self esteem
What, what, what, you want me to cry on your shoulder
So you can turn around and laugh and talk about it when it's over?

Me
I believe in me (Me, me)
Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see (Come on)
All I really need is me (Me, me)
Faith and family (Yeah yeah)
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

I done sold 30 mil, dated the man you wanted (Tell em)
When it got too convenient, I just gave it up (Word)
I don't need the stress, I don't need the pain (No!)
I do need the checks, but don't need the game
Oh my how could him and I, be the same (Who?)
When the house burnt down, only I took the blame (Say)
When the money got funny (Me me me)
I took it court (I remember that)
When most of y'all scrubs, wouldn't have even fought it
When the group had issues, I laid the thoughts (Really?)
I corrected the bad news, I heard in interviews (Talk to em)
How many of you really know Lisa? Not many
It's not contrary, it's fear, I don't know you either
I'm responsible for more than you'll ever know and see (Ever)
So many things you don't know, happened because of me
From Blaque to the designs, to the stage, that was me (Me X6)
So how could any of y'all be mad at me
Me (Me, me)
I believe in me (Come on)
Cause I take care of me (La la la la la)
It took so long to see
All I really need is me (Me, me)
Faith and family (That's right)
Has finally made me see (Uh huh)
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Everybody says all they want the truth
Well the truth is that I still got love for my group
But you don't really want the truth when it's concerning you
You want to hear that no one's doing better than you
You love to hear the pain (Pain)
You love to hear the struggle (Struggle)
You love to know that paradise
Has got trouble (Trouble)
The only trouble we ever had is you being involved
You gettin' involved, where you don't belong
When my faith started to waver, I felt was like I was done
I felt like Brian McKnight, I was back at one
The only one that was, the only one and ever (Ever)
The only one I need, the one and only me
Because if I ever told you we was on different planes
You would think that I meant, our flights ain't the same
My only crime was I was so blind
Didn't know I had everything that I wanted all the time
Me (Yeah, yeah)
I believe in me (Come on)
Cause I take care of me (Me, me, me)
It took so long to see
All I really need is me (Me, me)
Faith and family (Yeah, me)
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face (Come on! Everybody!)
All I need is me
I believe in me (Me, me)
Cause I take care of me (Uh huh)
It took so long to see
All I really need is me (Me, me)
Faith and family (Me, family)
Has finally made me see (Me, me)
No matter what I face
All I need is me
I believe in me (Me, me)
Cause I take care of me (Me, me)
It took so long to see
All I really need is me (Me, me)
Faith and family (Me, me)
Has finally made me see (Me, me)
No matter what I face (Me, me)
