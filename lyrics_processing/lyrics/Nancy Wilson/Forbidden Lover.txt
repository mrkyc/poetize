I'm overwhelmed by your love
It makes me question my love
What can I do to make it real good for you?
If you ask me for the world I'll give it to you
You make me crazy for love
You're all that I'm dreaming of
I see you everywhere
I want you to be there
I'm in your spell
Tell me how much will it take
For you to give me your love
You say me want me to be there
But how long must I wait?
I give you good love
To make you feel brand new
Now it's all up to you
Tell me, what can we do?
Such a forbidden love that's shared by two
This world will talk about me and you
Just say you will
I want you to be my forbidden lover
So we talk and we talk about it
Then we give in, we make love
How can a love so wrong turn out to be so strong?
When you say there's just no use holding on
So we toss and we turn over love
Should we wait for give in to love?
Is it stop or go?
Should I take it fast or slow?
