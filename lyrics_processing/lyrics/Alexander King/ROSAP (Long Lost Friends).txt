Skynyrd and Pac, Skynyrd and Pac, woo

They don't wanna show me no love
'Til they see that old school pull up
Now they love me like a long lost friend
And wanna ride shotgun in my shit

I got '65 Ford in my yard
Black drop top, man paint job is hard
Mustang engine dueled out pipes
'Cause where I'm from baby this is how the fuck we ride
20's on the back 19's on the front
And when I hit the gas man that motherfucker jumps
My whip game old school kick game so new
You can't even get these even if you know a dude
Everything custom slicker than some mustard
No keys to this bitch just a motherfuckin' button
When I start it you can tell that I ain't bluffin'
It's nothin' if you wanna come and bring a buzzard and run it, come on
You might also like
They don't wanna show me no love
'Til they see that old school pull up
Now they love me like a long lost friend
And they  wanna ride shot gun in my shit

Comin' down hard in this bitch, super chargin' my shit
Got a chip under the hood make it bark when I hit it
Davidson counties, crossin' them county lines
Pick it up, bring it back movin' like sticky pines
Killin' 'em in the quarter and makin' it jump
Got a chromed out tuned up deep down in the trunk
Sidewindin' them sidelines so I'm chasin' the checkered flags
Burnin' the tires up I'm out here showin' ass
Hatin' on me it don't make a fuck 'cause you waitin' on me
Shootin' out the game like Old Faithful on they face homie
There ain't wild women when I was in that bucket
Now its killin' on my old four wheeler, I love it
They don't wanna show me no love
'Til they see that old school pull up
Now they love me like a long lost friend
And wanna ride shotgun in my shit

See I just wanna kick it and represent the city
Make a millie spend it all on my dogs and some bitches
Two Thirty in the mornin' eyes on the prize
And right now my pupils are the size of a  dime
Clique full of hustlers, everybody fellows
Made a promise to my momma no more dope sellin'
I'm high as Willie Nelson, I'm sorry I can't help it
Main bitch postin' pics got the side bitch jealous
I'm sippin' and I'm slippin' I hope that I don't fall again
Drank so much syrup I may never have a cough again
Ayy bitch tell all your friends we got dick to offer them
Wipe your shoes off respect this old school you hopin' in, ho
They don't wanna show me no love
'Til they see that old school pull up
Now they love me like a long lost friend
