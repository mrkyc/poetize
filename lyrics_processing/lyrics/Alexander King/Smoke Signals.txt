I like you but you're crazy

Keep sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals
I'm burnin' a fire underneath like you just don't know
It's gettin' so hot got me jumpin' right out these clothes
I'm sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals

Good Lawd the farmer's daughter
Got my engine runnin' hot on the side of I-40
Bipolar hot then she cold
Back up and try to leave and then tell me she can't go
On a back road on sack the smoke
She don't need me at all but she still can't go
Every time we collide she right up out her clothes
Like a Ford on fire where we overheatin' coal

Keep sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals
I'm burnin' a fire underneath like you just don't know
It's gettin' so hot got me jumpin' right out these clothes
I'm sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals

Oh baby like smoke blows, uh
I take a pull down a back road, uh
Know I shouldn't be here but keep comin' back
Keep your hands to yourself boy nah none of that
Oh baby I'm hot 'n' cold and now you know
Ready to go whenever you wanna roll
Even though you already know it you show it
You locked on these lips baby we light and it then we blow it
You might also like
Keep sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals
I'm burnin' a fire underneath like you just don't know
It's gettin' so hot got me jumpin' right out these clothes
I'm sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals

I never felt so hot must be them northern lights
There's something hangin' in the air got me out my mind
You like that Texas tea, I feel it burnin' me
I think you're callin', callin' and I can see


Keep sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals
I'm burnin' a fire underneath like you just don't know (I see you burnin' girl)
It's gettin' so hot got me jumpin' right out these clothes (Let's go! I got the smoke)
Keep sendin' you smoke baby, smoke baby, smoke signals (Lemme talk to her)

Hot, hot, hot then she cold
She hot then she cold
Says she hot, hot, hot then she cold
Back up and try to leave her then tell me she can't go
Hot, hot, hot then she cold
Tell me she can't go
We just over here smokin'
We just over here smokin'
We just over here smokin'
O-o-o-over here smokin'
