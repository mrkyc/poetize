Well, yeah
Forever, forever, forever chasing forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever chasing forever

Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin' through the venetian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question: if the Prada dressin' and the Gucci
All got ghost, and a freeze on the lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it 'cause I'm askin' for real
Golddiggers gon' hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine or that other weather, when we chasin' forever, uh

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, let's stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
You might also like
Chasin' forever, a buckwild endeavorous scene
Are we pursuin' somethin real or just chasin' a dream
Or casin' the scene, 'fore I die, I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin' for sure
But I'm committed to growin' and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynchpin of love is trust
And taught me monogamy is a monoga-must
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gots to make together, forever

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, let's stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks, I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searching for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushing me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carats than even bugs could eat in a week
And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes, don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids calling you mom and calling me dad
Having more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Each and every day forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever, only you)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together don't you go nowhere)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Stay forever
(Forever, forever)
Each and every day
(Forever chasing forever)
Forever, forever, forever
With only you
