Now, Dad, this is a very sensitive subject

Just the two of us
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death 'fore I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just to get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night, I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
'Cause I knew I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord, please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringin' comedy
Every time I look at you, I think, "Man, a little me"
Just like me, wait and see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh 'cause you got your dad's ears and all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gon' be?
A general, a doctor, maybe an MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh, why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin' me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor and
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
And you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me and your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So, if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back, uh
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I, yeah

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin' times
101 Dalmatians on your CD-ROM
See, me, I'm tryin' to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust, life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day, some girl's gonna break your heart
And, ooh, ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life, people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
