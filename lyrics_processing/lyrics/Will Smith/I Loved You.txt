I thought you was the one hon, yeah, when I met you at the Freak Nik
Whoever thought you'd be the type to creep and keep secrets
My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'
The seeds that I sowed I can't believe you so deceivin'
Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle
One of your freak friends from the East end, she bad as hell
Half black and Indonesian, the one that taught you treason
Cupid shoot me on my heart, but damn, why you leave it bleedin'?

I gave you no reason to lie
But you chose to live untrue
Knowin' how I feel inside
There's no tellin' what I might do, 'cause I gave you

All my mind, all my soul from the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like

I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?
You might also like
As I think back to the beginnin', we was together
We both loved sports, long walks, and autumn weather
Both wanted kids and a family, a strong personality
I liked the way you handled me
Candles be lit, mood set, food set, "You ready yet?"
That's what you said while you was massagin' my ear
Now look here I could never leave you lonely
Cause the love you showed me had me feelin' like you already had known me
'Member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see
"Use your mind," is what you told me, kissin' me slowly
Never was the loud type, always on the low key
Pretty smile but rugged, damn, a brother loved it

Thought birds of a feather are 'sposed to fly together
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind, no
'Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a vulture, yeah
Came to steal my heart and then leave me to die

All my mind, all my soul from the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
