Light up the place

I see you there now
Smoking from your unseen fire
Walk in the place
Then the darkness erase

You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up

Light up the place
Get lit with it, what, you can't get with it?
This is my room, this is my tool
This is my rule
Get fly with it, all up in the sky with it
Can't see me climb, come meet me, ah
Get lit
Miami, we like to party
We smart and naughty and we get lit
My people, good before evil
Big Will the sequel 'bout to get lit
This track is my kinda wave
If you're on the same page, come and get lit
'Cause we ain't stopping till we, light up the place

We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We (light up the place)

Light up the place
I'm coming through with the fire that's letting you now
The light inside of me ether and it's gonna blow
All of my people are lit so don't get in our way
It's the kind of celebrity we need today
The force around me is strong, my light been burning long
I do this for, I do this for y'all
My alchemy is strong, make it right from wrong
Man, I do this for y'all

You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up
Light up the place
