Make way for Prince Ali

Say hey, it's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee

Ohhh

Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie
You might also likePrince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?

Why, Prince Ali

Fellas, he's got

He's got seventy-five golden camels

Woo, uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?

Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals, everybody help me out
He's got a zoo
I'm telling you

It's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, handsome is he
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Ali Ababwa
Never ordinary, never boring
That physique!
Everything about that man
How can I speak, weak at my knees
Just plain impresses
You yummy boy
So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
He got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys

And to view them he charges no fee

He's generous, so generous

He's got 10,000 servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Aaa-
We waitin' for you
We're not going 'til you go
You can do it
There it is

Prince Ali
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess was hot, where is she?
And that, good people, is why he got all cute and dropped by

With sixty elephants, llamas galore (For real!?)
With his bears and lions a brass band and more (What?)
With his forty fakirs (Oh!) his cooks, his bakers (Oh!)
His birds that warble on key (Oh!)
