I can't do it
Can't feel a thing, I'm numb
All I do is wait
Is there something wrong with me?
Honestly I don't
Get as high
When I medicate
And I can't go on like this

And oh, I blew it
I think I took out the fun
Empty as hell
Made me lose my attitude
I know I won't
Get as high
When I medicate
And I can't go on like this

I'm useless
Someone wake me up from this life, yeah

I wish that I could feel something
But the pills do what they do
I was dancing on the ceiling
Now I can't feel nothing new
And if you look real close you'll notice
I lost all my emotions
Is it better when I'm broken
Aiming for explosion
I wish that I could feel something
But the pills do what they do

Guess I'm okay
But I keep doubting
If It's better in grey
Hidin' what's real
My chemicals
Just ain't right
And so I medicate
For some peace in my mind

It's useless
Can I wake me up from this life, yeah

I wish that I could feel something
But the pills do what they do
I was dancing on the ceiling
Now I can't feel nothing new
And if you look real close you'll notice
I lost all my emotions
Is it better when I'm broken
Aiming for explosion
I wish that I could feel something
But the pills do what they do
Wish that I could feel something
(Wish that I could feel something)
I don't know who I am lately
Wish that I could feel something
(Wish that I could feel something)
But the pills do what they do

I wish that I could feel something
But the pills do what they do
I was dancing on the ceiling
Now I can't feel nothing new
And if you look real close you'll notice
I lost all my emotions
Is it better when I'm broken?
Aiming for explosion
I wish that I could feel something
