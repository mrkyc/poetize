If I call for you
Will it feed the flame
When it already breaks us in two
Cause I want a glance
Of how the story ends
But I already know the truth
What would I have to gain
If I had everything so few
But I'm relieved its yours
With my feelings on the line
I would do anything to fight
This raging force

But I won't go for more
I won't go for more
'Til the rain stops
Wouldn't go for more
Wouldn't go for more
'Til the haze drops

Find the light
And hold it close to you
But it's already too late for that
I could sing the notes
Hopeless as they sound
Their encouragement in my head (In my head)
Our lives down the drain
I would do anything for you
I can take the blame
My heart's on the line
I can't do anything but lose
This changing game

But I won't go for more
I won't go for more
'Til the rain stops
Wouldn't go for more
Wouldn't go for more
'Til the haze drops

I no longer cry thinking about you
When I do recall the days
I see your face smiley like I do

But I won't go for more
I won't go for more
'Til the rain stops
Wouldn't go for more
Wouldn't go for more
'Til the haze drops

But I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
What is in my heart
Let it ring through you
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
What is in my heart
Let it ring through you
But I won't go for more
I won't go for more
'Til the rain stops
I won't go for more
I won't go for more
'Til the haze drops
Go for more, for more, for more
