Yea, lost in the world
Like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire, no larceny
Please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to God that he choke
Never see the album drop
Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times
So often he'd hope
To slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it
I'd write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella faded
And got my foot to the floor
While I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain
Look at what I became, mayne

You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no, oh, yea
So listen to the sound of my voice
You better send him all my love
He's given me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound of the boys, huh!
A raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handling a choice
And I know that if

The raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
Because he has the wisdom not to fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes

You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to have so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Will never forget ye-yes so


Yea, that old me that you knew well is still in me
Somewhere, deep down there
Hiding in the corner is a nigga who cared
Believed he could change the world and he dared
Now he sits alone
Used to write poems but that's gone
It's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare
Or will I ride
