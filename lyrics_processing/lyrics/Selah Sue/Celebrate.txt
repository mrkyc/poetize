Look what you're doing to me
I think you know it, right?
I'm wide awake looking at the ceiling, stirring, feeling you tonight
My body's beggin' for you
I feel alive, feeling brand-new
Don't make me wait
We got nothing more to say

I wanted to be honest
I wanted for the longest
To tell you that I'm falling
I can't wait to celebrate you
I wanted to be honest
I'm done with all the talking
Replay it in the morning
I can't wait to celebrate your body

Celebrate you
Celebrate your body
Celebrate you
You know how to make me move

I'll let you sink into me (I'll let you sink into me)
I'll let you draw me close (Draw me close)
To have a taste of my lips
I'll take you on this journey with me now
Just keep on holding me tight (Just keep on holding me tight)
And see the dawn of a new day
I wanna play
While the sheets are pulled away

I wanted to be honest (Honest, honest, honest)
I wanted for the longest
To tell you that I'm falling (Falling, falling, falling)
I can't wait to celebrate you
I wanted to be honest (Honest, honest, honest)
I'm done with all the talking
Replay it in the morning (Morning, morning, morning)
I can't wait to celebrate your body
(You know how to make me move)

Feeling this
(?) don't be all over the internet
Wd don't be posting no photos got like 500 followers
(?) intellect (?) intimate (?) brain
She showed me my ignorance
Never had the ego of little man (?)
(?)
Feel like an Oasis but (?) Kennedy

I wanted to be honest (Now what you think now what you think about this?)
I wanted for the longest (How do you feel how do you feel about this?)
To tell you that I'm falling (I wanna be I wanna be your one wish)
I can't wait to celebrate you
I wanted to be honest (Now what you think now what you think about this?)
I'm done with all the talking (How do you feel how do you feel about this?)
Replay it in the morning (I wanna be I wanna be your one wish)
I can't wait to celebrate your body
You know how to make me move
