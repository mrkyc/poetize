Amen
I will praise the Lord with my whole heart
In the assembly of the upright
And in the congregation
The works of the Lord are great
Sought out of all of them that have pleasure therein
His work is honourable and glorious;
And His righteousness endureth for ever
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
The Lord is gracious, and
Full of compassion
He hath given meat unto them that fear Him:
He will ever be mindful of His covenant
He hat showed his people the power of His works
That He may give them the heritage of the heathen
The works of His hands are verity and judgement:
All His commandments are sure
They stand fast for ever and ever
And are done in truth and uprightness
He sent redemption unto his people:
He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
Holy and reverend is His name
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom:
A good understanding have all they that do His commandments:
His praise endureth for ever
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, etc.
Amen
