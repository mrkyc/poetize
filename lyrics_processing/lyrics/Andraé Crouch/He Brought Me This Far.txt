There's been some mountains that I had to climb
There's been some days when the sun just would not shine
And there's been some valley's that I had to go through
And sometimes I didn't know what to do... God said he's going to take me all the way
And I belive that he will

Ooh ooh ooh God brought me this far

Sometimes I carry burdons too heavy to bear
I think I'm hanging on a wing and a prayer
And God promised he'll always be there
He's going to take me all the way
Yes... yes he's going to take me all the way
