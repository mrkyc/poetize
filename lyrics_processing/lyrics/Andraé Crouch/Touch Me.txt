Is not the way it seems
Feels like my well has gone dry
I don't even know the reason why
My spirit's so cold
And all the news seems old
My soul is in misery
Woah, Lord, come and help me and touch me
Touch me
Lord Jesus, touch me one more time
How I need to feel Your rest one more time
Ohh, shower down on me
And let Your Spirit move me
Oh, Lord, please, Lord, touch me one more time
Oh, Lord, please, touch me one more time
Ohh
The way it used to be
It's not that way it seems
It feels like my well is gone dry
I don't even know the reason why
My spirit is so cold
Everything seems old
My soul is in misery
When You're passin' out blessings don't forget about me

I want You to shower down on me
Let Your Spirit move me
Oh, Lord, please, Lord, touch me one more time
Oh, Lord, please, touch me one more time
Touch me, touch me one more time
How I need to feel Your presence
Lord, one more time
I want You to shower down on me
