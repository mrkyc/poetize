Gotta go out and tell somebody
I can't keep it to myself
Somebody's lost, somebody's dyin
I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell somebody else
For they've got to know
That Jesus loves them so
Just don't keep it to yourself
Gotta go out and tell somebody
Don't keep it to yourself
Somebody's lost, somebody's dyin
Don't keep it to yourself
Tell somebody else
For they've got to know
That Jesus loves them so

We all have friends that
Cry and cry, cause they don't even know
There's a God who is willing help them bear their load
They don't know that He cares
And He'll see them through the darkest night
How will they find out
There's a God above who really understands
And He can heal broken hearts
If they jus give Him a chance
I must go, we must go
And let them know
Can't keep it to myself
Can't keep it to myself
(Somebody's lost) Somebody's dyin
Can't keep it, can't keep it
(Gotta tell somebody else)
They've got to know
Jesus loves them so
Tell 'em
Tell 'em
Tell 'em
Tell 'em
Gotta go and tell everybody
Gotta go and tell everybody
Can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody else
Gotta go and tell everybody
Gotta go and tell everybody
Can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody else
Gotta go and tell everybody
Gotta go and tell everybody
Can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody else
OH!
Can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody else
(Can't keep it to myself)
Can't keep it
I can't keep it
(Gotta tell somebody else)
Can't keep it
I can't keep it
(Can't keep it to myself, gotta tell somebody else)
Can't keep it
I can't keep it
(Can't keep it to myself, gotta tell somebody else)
Can't keep it
I can't keep it
(Can't keep it to myself, gotta tell somebody else)
Can't keep it
I can't keep it
