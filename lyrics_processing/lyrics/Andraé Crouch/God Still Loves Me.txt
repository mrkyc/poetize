Yes, Jesus loves me
That was years ago and now I'm grown
Yes, Jesus loves me
The city where I live, so many things have changed
They say nothing ever stays the same
The grass is brown, many buildings torn down
Oh, and people I've known, they're not around
But God still loves me
He still loves
After all these years
He still loves me
He always has
And He always will
He always has
And He always will
He known all of my mistakes
The promises I'd break
Still He loved me
Those times I'd disobey
Hear His voice and walk away
Still my God loved me
Oh, Satan tried to tell me, Andrae
Why don't you just throw in the towell I thought I wouldn't be around by now
But lingering in my ear
That melody I still hear
And it smooths my doubts
And calms my fears
That God still loves me, oh He loves me
My God still, of He loves me
After all these years He still loves me, He loves me
He always has loved me
Right now He still loves me
I'm so glad, oh God loves me
After all these years He loves me
God loves me, yes, He loves me
I said He still loves me
No matter what people say
My God still loves me
Oh yes He loves me
He always has
And He always will, yes He will
He told me He always has
I believe it when He told me that He always will
So glas about it
I thank the Lord that He loves me
When I started to run away
His love always brought me back
My God still loves me
Oh I can't deny it
His love took him to Calvary
Just for me
If I'd been the only one in the world
He would have died for me
I know He still loves me
When I'm up, when I'm down
When I smile, when I frown
When I'm weak, when I'm strong
When I'm right, when I'm wrong
Say I will, and I won't
Say I do, then I don't
When I win, when I lose
I know for sure, forevermore
That God loves me, yes He does
My God loves me
If I made my bed in hell
I know His love would find me there
He still loves me, yes He does
God loves me, He loves me
And there ain't no doubt about it
I've got to lift my voice and shout it
God still loves me
He still loves me
He alwys has
