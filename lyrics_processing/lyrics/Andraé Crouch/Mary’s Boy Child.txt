Now He was born in a manger in the town of Bethlehem
He was sent by the father as a meek and humble lamb
And then they called Him Emanuel hallelujah God with us
Hallelujah, Hallelujah cuz He came to save the lost
And He came unto his very own but they received Him not
And the devil had a vicious plan and nailed Him to the cross
Now the devil was rejoicing cuz He thought He had Him dead
But hallelujah he's alive again just like the bible says
Hallelujah, hallelujah He's aliiivvvvve
