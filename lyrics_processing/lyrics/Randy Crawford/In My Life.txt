In my life, what in the world am I gonna do?
How can this meaning and purpose, too
Be ours to share, if you're not there?
In my life, time could be running out for me
Could be saying what is left for me
To make better, to make right

In my life, I always knew love was the answer
It's been applied before, never left unnoticed
Thought by now, it's been more than apparent
What then would you say do we, do we give more?

Couldn't be saying, "Stay out of my life"
I won't be accepting one wrong for two
Fell head over heels in deep devotion
And that must count for something, too

In my life (In my life), what in the world am I gonna do?
How can this meaning and purpose, too
Be ours to share, if you are not there?
Could I have been so unkind
To have stumbled into the arms of another
Without being pushed there?
