If you know what you want
Let's put aside all doubt
Together we can rewrite history here and now
So take this notion
And spin our love emotion
And I'll be there right beside you
To comfort, help and guide
But wait one minute before we walk right in it
Are you sure what this is about
Please don't get me wrong
Do you understand
The meaning of this oath that you're giving me

(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you want me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you need me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you love me
(Are you sure)
Baby, baby are you sure
You might also like(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you want me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you need me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you love me
(Are you sure)
Baby, baby are you sure
Whooo

I can't hold back this feeling
I need you and I'm dreaming
Of staying here beside me
So you can do me right
If you're down with me
Then you got to give me reason
I should trust and know
You will always be around
But wait one minute
Consider if you're really in love
Or is this just an affair
(I need) I need a promise
I need a firm commitment
I need to let you know what you mean to me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you love me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you need me
(Are you sure)
Are you sure that you want me
(Are you sure)
Baby, baby are you sure
Repeat x3
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
I need a firm commitment
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
I need to know that i can trust you
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
I need to know that you really really love me
Oh baby are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
Are you sure, about us
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
I need to know that i can trust you
I need to know that you love me
Are you sure, are you sure
Are you sure, are you sure
Whoooo
