Come into my life, oh, I adore you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life
Come into my life, I'll open the door for you
Come into my life, boy, I adore you
And I will treat you right
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need
For you hold the keys to my life
Good times will flow for you, make our love strong and tight
Together as one not two, we'll shine like diamond ice
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need
Because I can brighten up your days
And when you're feelin' bad, I'll put a smile on your face
Can you tell me what price must I pay
To help you see things my way? To see things my way
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, oh, I adore you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life
For you hold the keys to my life
Good times will flow for you, make our love strong and tight
Together as one not two, we'll shine like diamond ice
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need
Because I can brighten up your days
And when you're feelin' bad, I'll put a smile on your face
Can you tell me what price must I pay
To help you see things my way? To see things my way
