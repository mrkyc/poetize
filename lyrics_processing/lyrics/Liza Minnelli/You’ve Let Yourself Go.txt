A stifled yawn, a can of beer, what an enthralling atmosphere
And yet the sight of us this way, helps me to say what I must say
It helps me to think a thought or two, to pass it right along to you
And just for starters you should know I think
You've let yourself go
Down through the years each sage repeats, grass never grows on busy streets
Which might explain that balding spot, were you a thinker, which you're not
And where's that slender youth I knew, I fear he's grown an inch or two
Not up and down my joy and pride but more precisely side to side
When at a party, now and then, you tell the same old jokes again
Or wear a lampshade for a hat, who could be wittier than that
With one too many you just might, pick some unnecessary fight
Though in the morning with the sun, you can't remember what you've done
If there's regret, it doesn't show, you know
You've let yourself go
You never care the way you dress, you stay unshaven, you look a mess
The smallest thing is too much to do, I even hold the door for you
And every rose upon the shelf, is one that I've supplied myself
It's not the same, I'm well aware, yet I need to see them there
I don't know why I say it now, why I don't hold my tongue somehow
But I just need to tell it all, no matter where the chips may fall
But as I sit and reminisce, there are so many things I miss
The reassurance of your touch, the gentle smile that said so much
You were my tender, thoughtful beau
You might also likeI couldn't hate you if I tried, and I still want you by my side
We oughta lay things on the line, perhaps the fault is really mine
And if it is, please tell me so, a seed replanted still can grow
