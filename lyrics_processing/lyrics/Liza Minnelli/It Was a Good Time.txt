I now pronounce you man and wife
It was a good time, it was the best time
It was a party, just to be near you
It was a good time, it was the best time
And we believed that it would last forever
We would stay together and share the laughter
With never ever a morning after
It was a good time, it was the best time
It seemed a short time, but such a good time
Since you're gone and won't be mine again
There are many stars that will not shine again
Except some time deep in my reverie
You return and then I remember when
It was a good time, it was the best time
It was a party, just to be near you
It was a good time, it was the best time
And we believed that it would last forever
Here we go 'round the mulberry bush
The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush
Here we go 'round the mulberry bush, early in the morning

Mama will stay near you, mama will be near you
Not your dad, that's too bad!
Good - bye - good - and I believed - ah-hah
Since you've gone and won't be mine again
There are many stars that will not shine again
Except some times deep in my reverie
You return and then I remember when
It - was - a - good - time, it was the best time
It was a party, just to be near you
It was a good time, it was the best time
