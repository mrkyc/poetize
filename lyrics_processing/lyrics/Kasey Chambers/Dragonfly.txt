I was an item when boys were in the corner
Flicking through the channels and waiting out orders
And it's all the same when you're taking aim
When you're picking at the links of another chain
And you went to the party and I was not invited
And everybody knows that the girls are one-sided
And the boys don't cry, neither do I
When you're picking off the wings of a dragonfly

Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else, it's true
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else but you

I would be a fool to not regret it just a little
But a high and a low make somewhere in the middle
Seize the day 'cause I'm ok
And I ain't gonna tell if you misbehave
I've done everything that you could ever imagine
I've screwed all of my friends but I'm not bragging
I wish 'em well, don't kiss and tell
'Cause I don't really want nobody else
You might also like
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else, it's true
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else but you
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else, it's true
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else but you

And once my mama told me
If I was good, if I was good
That all the boys would hold me
Like they should, just like they should
And you, you kinda liked it
When I was bad, when I was bad
So I let you inside it
And now she's mad, now she's mad

Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else, it's true
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else but you
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else, it's true
Oh, there ain't nobody else
There ain't nobody else but you
Oh, there ain't nobody else
