I threw a coin and it fell
Down the wishing well
And it sunk to the ground like a cannon ball
And you think I'm out of touch
I call you too much
Now words they just sound like a waterfall
I, I'm falling behind
My watch doesn't wind
So I'm keeping time with an hourglass
And you think I'm immature
And you seem unsure
Why we're spitting on cars from the overpass

If you ever really find it harder
Is it ever really hard to find
Said I love you like a broken record
Hung around you like a satellite
I like it when it rains in summer
I like a hole in my shoe
I like the smell of firecrackers
And I like that I love you
That I love you
You might also like
I, I told you with pride
Where all the stars die
Down on Hollywood boulevard
And you, you think it's absurd
That I've never heard
A single thing about Baudrillard

If you ever really find it harder
Is it ever really hard to find
Said I love you like a broken record
Hung around you like a satellite
I like it when it rains in summer
I like a hole in my shoe
I like the smell of firecrackers
And I like that I love you
That I love you
I love you

I tripped over my words
I lost all my nerve
When I asked you to ride in my motorcar
You, you kissed me just once
But only because
We fell in love on the monkey bars
If you ever really find it harder
Is it ever really hard to find
Said I love you like a broken record
Hung around you like a satellite
I like it when it rains in summer
I like a hole in my shoe
I like the smell of firecrackers
And I like that I love you
If you ever really find it harder
Is it ever really hard to find
Said I love you like a broken record
Hung around you like a satellite
I like it when it rains in summer
I like a hole in my shoe
I like the smell of firecrackers
And I like that I love you
That I love you
