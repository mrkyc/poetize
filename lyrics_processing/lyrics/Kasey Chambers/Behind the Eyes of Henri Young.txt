Sent him away in '38, California state, the case was tried
Henri Young was an orphan son, came undone when his sister cried
His time he'd serve, he'd stole for her
Free men until, five dollar bill
But the grocery store had a postal door, federal law had to intervene
And underneath all the disbelief was a petty thief who was just 17
He'd come at last, to Alcatraz
He'd come so far, with a weary heart

And as sure as my name is Henri Young, I never meant to hurt no one
I'd take back everything I stole, if God would come and save my soul
And then they'll hear these cries
An innocent man behind these eyes

Well, he stayed up late for the prison break, and he tried to escape, but the plan was blown
And he begged and prayed but the warden came, threw him away, down in the hole
For 19 days, he was meant to stay
But he disappeared for three long years
Well they headed down to the underground, where they let him out to return to his room
And when morning came he was never the same and he stabbed McCain with the handle of the spoon
From days gone past, to Alcatraz
From a man who steals, to a man who kills

And as sure as my name is Henri Young, I never meant to hurt no one
I'd take back everything I stole, if God would come and save my soul
And then they'll hear these cries
An innocent man behind these eyes

Well the year was told on the radio DiMaggio and the war was at its worst
Henri Young was an orphan son who came undone with murder in the first
Death by gas, in Alcatraz
Good man when he came, now who's the one to blame

And as sure as my name is Henri Young, I never meant to hurt no one
I'd take back everything I stole, if God would come and save my soul
And then they'll hear these cries
