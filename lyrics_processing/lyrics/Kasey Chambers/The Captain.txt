Well, I don't have as many friends because
I'm not as pretty as I was
I've kicked myself at times because I've lied
So I will have to learn to stand my ground
I'll tell 'em I won't be around
I'll move on over to your town and hide

And you be the Captain, and I'll be no-one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low just like your father
And if I tread upon your feet, you just say so
'Cause you're the Captain, I am no-one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
To you

Well I have handed all my efforts in
I searched here for my second wind
"Is there somewhere here to let me in?", I asked
So I slammed the doors they slammed at me
I found the place I'm meant to be
I figured out my destiny at last

You be the Captain, and I'll be no-one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low just like your father
And if I tread upon your feet, you just say so
'Cause you're the Captain, I am no-one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
To you

Did I forget to thank you for the ride?
I hadn't tried I tend to runaway and hide

You be the Captain, and I'll be no-one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low just like your father
And if I tread upon your feet, you just say so
'Cause you're the Captain, I am no-one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
'Cause you're the Captain, I am no-one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
To you

'Cause you're the Captain, I am no-one
