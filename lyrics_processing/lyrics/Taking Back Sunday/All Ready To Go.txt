You ran out lookin' for a fight
You left your head because sometimes
You know what's gonna happen next
You don't want nobody pushin' back, hey
Now I'm torn up about it
'Cause I know you can't help yourself
I know that evils breed in you
I've seen it in myself
I taste that devil's water
At home but didn't bother
Call it what it is
Let's call it what it is

Oh, I was livid and you weren't listenin'
It didn't matter 'cause you were leavin'
You were all ready to go (You weren't listenin')
You were all ready to go (You were leavin')
You were all ready to go
Already gone

Yeah, I remember last I saw you
In the hallway tangled up in blue
I was livid and you weren't listenin' (You weren't listenin')
But that didn't matter 'cause you were leavin'
Yeah, there's moments that I miss you
(Yeah, it happens all the time)
And at the moment that I miss you
(I just can't remember why)

My leg is getting really tired
I love this thing, it's so fun to play
This armoire is like really somethin' (I know)
