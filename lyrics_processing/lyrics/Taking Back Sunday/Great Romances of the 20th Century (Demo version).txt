A beautiful girl can make you dizzy
Like you've been drinking jack and coke all morning
She can make you feel high
Full of the single greatest commodity known to man
Promise
Promise of a better day
Promise of a greater hope
Promise of a new tomorrow
This particular aura
Can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl
In her smile, and in her soul
In the way she makes every rotten little thing about life
Seem like it's gonna be ok

September never stays this cold
Where I come from
And you know
I'm not one for complaining
But I love the way you'd roll
Excuses off the tip of your tongue
As I slowly fall apart (slowly, quietly, slowly)
Fall apart
This won't mean a thing come tomorrow
And that's exactly how I'll make it seem
Cause I'm still not sleeping
Thinking I've crawled home from worse than this
So please, please (please)
I'm running out of sympathy (I'm running out of sympathy!)
And I never said I'd take this
I never said I'd take this lying down
She says
"Come on, come on, let's just get this over with 
(I never said I'd take this lying down, let's just get this over with
And I've crawled home from worse than this)
She says
"Come on, come on, let's just get this over with
She says
"Come on, come on"
You always come close but this never comes easy
I still know everything 
You always come so close
I still know everything, I still know everything, I still know
You always come close but this never comes easy 
You always come, you come in close
I never said I'd take this lying down 
But I've crawled home from worse than this
If it's not keeping you up nights
Then what's the point 
I'm in your room
Now is this turning you on
Am I turning you on?
I'm in your room
Are you turned on?
I'm on the corner of your bed
I'm practically naked
Are you turned on
