I was living day-to-day
As the meetings, they would suggest
Sitting pretty, having one foot out that door
No, I didn't know how to act
Started runnin' and I didn't look back
Still feel the same way
Still don't know where I'm goin'
Oh, and then you let me in
Don't know how you did it other than you did

Cut your wrist and come and get you some
It'll work if you don't look down
Bought the ticket, now you're on the track
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back

I didn't know what I was looking for
And come to think, I wasn't looking at all
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long

Mama calling from the other end
"Someday, a woman's gonna need you most of the time"
No, I didn't know how to act
I started runnin' and I didn't look back
Still feel the same way
Still don't know where I'm goin'
But now I'm in it 'til the bitter end
You're gonna do me, then you do me like that

Cut your wrist and come and get you some
It'll work if you don't look down
Bought the ticket, now you're on the track
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back
You can keep it, but you can't look back

I didn't know what I was looking for (Can't look back)
And come to think, I wasn't looking at all (Can't look back)
I'm not the same man, not since you came in
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
Started runnin' and
You cut your wrist
You let me in

Don't know how you did it other than you did
I was there beside myself in my own skin
Unfamiliar, tried it on and liked the fit
Don't know how you did it other than you did
I'm gonna get you if it takes me all night long
Don't know how you did it other than you did (All night long)
I was there beside myself in my own skin (All night long)
Unfamiliar, tried it on and liked the fit (All night long)
Don't know how you did it other than you did (Long, long, long)
Don't know how you did it other than you did
I was there beside myself in my own skin
Unfamiliar, tried it on and liked the fit
Don't know how you did it other than you did
