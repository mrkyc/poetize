Well, I can't regret
Can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
And if we go down, we go down together
Best friends means
Well, best friends means
And I've got a twenty-dollar bill
That says you're up late night starting
Fist fights vs. the fences in your backyard
Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor
Soaking in sympathy
From friends who never loved you
Nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
"It's just what anyone would do"
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
"It's something unforgivable"

Well, I can't regret
Can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
Well, if we go down, we go down together
Best friends means
Well, best friends means
Well, you never knew
Well, I never told you
Everything I know about breaking hearts
I learned from you, it's true
I've never done it with the style and grace you have
But I made long-term plans
Based on these mistakes

Is this what you call tact?
(I won't lie)
You're about as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
(It keeps me up till ungodly hours at night)
(That's right, he said it...)
So let's end this call and end this conversation
(Best friends means, best friends means...)
(That's right, he said it...)
There's nothing worse...
Have another drink and drive yourself home
That's right, he said...
Getting what you deserve
I hope there's ice on all the roads
That's right, he said it...
The jealousy that became me thinking
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
That's right, he said...
That you always had it way too easy
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
"It's just what anyone would do"
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
"It's something unforgivable"

Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
