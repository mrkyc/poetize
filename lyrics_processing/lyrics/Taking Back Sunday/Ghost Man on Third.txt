Jynx me something crazy
Thinkin' if it's three then
I'm as smooth as the skin rolls across the small of your back
It's too bad it's not my style if you need me
I'm out and on the parkway patient and waiting for headlights
Dressed in a fashion that's fitting to the inconsistencies of my moods
It's times like these where silence means everything and no one is to know about this
It's times like these where silence means everything (So no one is to know about this)

It's a campaign of distraction
(Distraction)
Revisionist history, oh!
(And revisionist history)

It's a shame I don't think that they'll notice
(It's a shame, I don't think that they'll notice)
It's a shame I doubt they even care
(It's a shame, I don't think that they care)
No one is to know about this
It's a shame I don't think that they'll notice
(It's a shame, I don't think that they'll notice)
It's a shame I doubt they even care
(It's a shame)
Don't let me down
See Taking Back Sunday LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like
But whatever I have been gettin' myself into lately
Has been slicing inches from my waist
It's my face vs. the bottle (and thank god you weren't there)
And that's how bad could this hurt
Against I won't feel a thing
(And thank god you weren't there...)
I tell you all about  it's just not working out
(...to watch me hit bottom)
Not working out

It's a campaign of distraction

Better than
This is we why (We why)
We were taught so much better than this (So much better)
This is going anywhere (Than this)
We like to rewind (Better)
We were taught so much (So much better)
Better than, better than this (Better than this!)
