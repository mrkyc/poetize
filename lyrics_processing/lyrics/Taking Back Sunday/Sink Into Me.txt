Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Come on, tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget that
Things have gone so far
Yeah, tell me that you're better
And you'd rather just forget that
Things have gone too far

You're all I see, sink into me
Sharpen your teeth, sink into me
Sink into me (Sink in, sink in)

Well I'd like to see our roles reversed
To watch you hang on every word
I'd like to see you have your way
I keep my grammar well rehearsed
Correct each stutter, every slur
Come on and have your way with me

Now tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget that
Things have gone so far
You tell me that you're better
And you'd rather just forget that
Yeah, things have gone too far
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I'd like to be a note
The kind you could sing
But don't because you're shy
That way I'll live inside your throat
And hang from every word you spoke
