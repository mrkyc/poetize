I was there when you were bored
I was there when you were feeling scared
And you were not sure what for
I was there when you found out
And you were madder than hell
You were scared, I was scared, we were scared
Though I did not let that show
'Cause you got me if you want me
(Hey!)
You got me
It's right where I should be
I was there when you were worried
I was there when you were sick
I was there when you were positive
This was not happening
I was there with your father
Oh, he was madder than hell
He was scared, you were scared, I was scared
Though I did not let that show
'Cause you got me if you want me
(Hey!)
You got me
It's right where I should be

I was then when you were bored
I was there when you were feeling scared

I was there when you were feeling scared
And you were not sure what for
I was there when you found out
Oh, you were madder than hell
