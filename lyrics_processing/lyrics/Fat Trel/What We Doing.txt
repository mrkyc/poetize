Famous, what you know
Let's get it
(Famous beat)
Think I'm crazy, going crazy
Think I'm crazy, going crazy
Think I'm crazy, going crazy
Think I'm crazy, going crazy
Yeah, look

Okay, I'm thinking about
Copping them choppers and take it to T and them's house
And leaving 'em out, and shoot 'em for hours, then hop in the shower
Fuck me a bitch, I'm ugly and rich, if you let me I'll probably just fuck and forget
As real as it gets, I'll take me a trip, I'll play with a brick
I'm crazy as shit, I don't give a fuck, you lazy as shit
I see why you broke, you sleeping the most, I'm up and I leave
I go with the breeze, I cock it, and squeeze, I do it with ease
I make her believe, my paper is green, the fuck do you mean?
I stay with them hundreds, addicted to money, your bitch trying to fuck
But me, I just laugh, 'cause that shit funny, 'cause me, I don't want it
She see why I'm stuntin', I started with nothing, my bread, it was crumbin'
I was robbing the public, it really was nothing, but back to the subject
I'm a youngin' with money, first I pop me a molly, smoke dro by the onion
I knew it was comin', I knew it was you who be doing the stuntin'
You never was pumpin', why the fuck is you bluffin'? You never was pumpin'
Why the fuck is you bluffin', but you never was pumpin'?

Niggas with fullies ride 'round in the hoodies and Bentlys
Getting that dope money
Street money, I get, I get it
And flip it, and send it
It's bringing me more money
Smoking them Dutches and filling my lungs up with Cali
I'm plotting on getting the mail
Look at my ears, there's ice on my ears
Look at your ears, it's not like your ears
Bad bitch, thinkin' money, she a gold digger (Gold digger)
Thinkin' money too, I might as well roll with her
'Cause that's how it goes, Maybach, murder gang
You get murdered for change
So stay off the road, or just stay in your lane
I'm feeling the Ghost, I'm thinkin' I'm through
Just got a truckload, then got me a ho
My Rollie is gold, I pull up in a Rolls
Pull off in a 'Rari, you hating, I'm sorry
Now it's back to the thousands
The money is piling, I came from the violence
So niggas is wilin', and now it's "I need it"
Nah, nigga you keep it, I go get it myself
My gun in my belt, I'm drinking top shelf
Cooking dope like a chef, got stripes like a ref
So bitch nigga step, I'm shooting Southpaw, huh
I don't on my left, get you right with them shells
It's all for the cause
I think I'm crazy, cause sometimes I think about (Countin' thousands)
Going crazy, run up in a nigga house (You layin' down)
