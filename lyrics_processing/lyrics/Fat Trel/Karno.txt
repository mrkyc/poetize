I walk in the trap with a K
I am rocking Gevenchy and BAPE
Little bi get out of my face
I got some coke on a plane
Just bought a new snake for a king
Don't think you should swerve on my lane
Don't fuck until I bought a lamb
Don't thank me you out of saint
Shoot you in the face tryna take mine
I got shooters shooting from no baseline
Boy you must ... about time

Im on a strip and the prettiest hippie
The littlest thing I have ever seen
I saw your bitch she was hidious serious
I thouth she was a dream
Bouth a prescription and fill it up
Told the doctor all i want is the lean
Make no mistake and if you play bout my cake
I will hit you in the face with ass with a beam
I think I got me some bandz coming
Hundred round chopper your man running
Hit in the wood from a crash dummy
Sorry i tought you ...

Got you new bitch with some fast money
Bought her new tits now an ass coming
