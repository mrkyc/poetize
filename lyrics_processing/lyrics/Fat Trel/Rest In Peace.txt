Let's get it
(Maybach Music)

Rest in peace to my real niggas, in the field niggas
On sight drillers, and drug dealers, I deal with 'em
Wish I was still with them, smokin' dope and pop pills with 'em
I never kill or die, when his mama cry, I still feel him
I can't change over, drop top couple and a Range Rover
I can't help that I grew up with some insane soldiers
Murder death in my lifestyle, my momma pray for me cause my life wild
When I first touched thirty thousand, I was too high, couldn't come down
Let me give you the rundown, hustle to sun up to sundown
Too many niggas dead and gone so I'm never ever putting my guns down
I seen some friends killing best friends, a lot of real shit that I regret seeing

I ride with my niggas, I die with my niggas, I'm dirty with 30s and semis
A birdie is with me, I'm nervous I'm swervin', I pray and I hope Lord forgive me
You bussin', you hit me you must not forget to finish me, I'm takin' you with me
Young niggas don't play in my city, that shit not okay in my city
I love all my niggas, I'm with it, we did it, we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches, I kiss it, I lick it, I hit it the minute I'm with her
I love all my niggas, I'm with it, we did it, we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches, I kiss it, I lick it, I hit it the minute I'm with her

Them shooters is out at my grandmas house, I ain't been 'round this bitch in a minute
Police is lurking, these bitches is working, they servin' their pussy, I'm with it
Chrissy just called me, she told me she saw me, I told her come get me let's get it (Skrrt)
I'm coolin' Ricky, but then she come get me, I promise it's Sex in the City
I'm counting these commas, I'm tootin these llamas, the drama, I promise I'm with it
The Ruth's and the Chris, and the Beni and Hanas was nothing, I honestly get it
The Gucci and Louis I bought for my mama was honestly hundreds and fifties
I'm spendin' my money on weed, and lean, and choppers, and MACs with the beams
Ice on my chest, and my Rolex is mean, boy you cannot fuck with the team
I bet if you flex, that's a hole in your chest, you red and dead on the scene
I go like my bro, ain't got nothin' to live, but I got some killers and kids
That's murder for hire, my niggas on fire, 'cause that's what it is

I ride with my niggas, I die with my niggas, I'm dirty with 30s and semis
A birdie is with me, I'm nervous I'm swervin', I pray and I hope Lord forgive me
You bussin', you hit me you must not forget to finish me, I'm takin' you with me
Young niggas don't play in my city, that shit not okay in my city
I love all my niggas, I'm with it, we did it, we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches, I kiss it, I lick it, I hit it the minute I'm with her
I love all my niggas, I'm with it, we did it, we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches, I kiss it, I lick it, I hit it the minute I'm with her

Let's get it
Killers countin' straight cash
Homicide, duffel bag
Homicide, duffel bag
Careful, if you owe me, shooters on your ass
