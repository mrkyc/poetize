Bang, bang, bang
Haha

Fuck police, I smoke like I ride, and I ride like a G
And if I'm in the Chi', I'ma ride to the D, with a 9 on my side, on my side is a piece
I be young black nigga, love to roll the pack in the trap, fat nigga
Pull up with the MAC, wall to my back, roll another fat
Matter fact, better shoot back, nigga
Wait, he only eat if it's steak on the plate?
Its work with chicken, these niggas is straight
You thought I was new, but the truth is you late
You look a snake, and your jewelry is fake
I basically say I don't fuck with you niggas
Trust me, it's nothing to bust at you niggas
Niggas is snitching and bitches is watching
I rather just choose not to pop at your top
See all of the bitches I fuck, and the money I got
And I'm thinking, like, why should I stop?
Check in the bag, this shit getting sad
I'm running through bitches I knew I would have
Thinking of scooping a coupe or a jag
Scoop up the crew, do what we do
Go tell my ho pour a four in the two
Say somebody broke, and I know it was you
That ain't really what the real players do
Fuck a ho right for a day or two
Take the pussy from the hood
If the pussy real good
Then you know a real nigga gotta share you
And that's player, fool
Ride around my city like the mayor, fool
Keep this shit a hunnid, if I see it I'ma want it
Got a hundred round chopper
You ain't taking none from me
All I know is I'ma keep it 300
Quick feet, if a nigga sweet we comin'
Six feet, let 'em leak, layin' on his stomach
You don't really want it
Laying down, run it
Need money, everything money
Pull up on the scene, ain't a damn thing funny
Think shit a dream, how you never seen money?
Got the white with clean, dirty magazine money
Get money, fuck hoes
I'll peel a P-7 truck slow
Take a seven out the P puff dro
I ain't greedy take three, fuck four
Let's go, pop a molly, roll
How the fuck he say he ballin' and his Ferragamo stollen
Right wrist bright, bitch, Rolex, Rollie
Wifey come from Cali, but she don't know Kobe
I'm lonely sitting at the top
Big face watch in a big boy drop
Got one shot, you shoot I pop
Whether or not I'd advise you to stop
I be wild as a fool walking through the crowd, blowing loud with the crew
Roll the window down, hear the sound of the tool
Never come around 'cause my shooter, he a fool
It's me, it's you, get money what the fuck we do (We do)
Let the chopper hit him up that's cool (That's cool)
Let the coppers do what they do (That's true)
'Cause my Glock is matching my shoes (Shoes)
My swagger matching my boo (That's cool)
I done ran through half of her crew (True)
