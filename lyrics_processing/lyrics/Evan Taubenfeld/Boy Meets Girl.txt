La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
With a bang
She was there
Yeah she blew up off my cover
Wasn't looking for a lover
And I crashed
I fell a part
And now I'm picking up the pieces
No, they're not exactly reese's
But it's a start
Did you ever think I'd let you go?
You're the only thing I've ever known
Chorus:
It's like twisted sister
Meets mr. mister
It's like a rolling thunder
Meets a careless whisper
It's like jesus jones and the rolling stones in a game of twister
It's Like Boy Meets Girl!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And she went right
And I went wrong
By the time I turn around and look for her over my shoulder she was gone
I'll never know
How to make her favorite drink
And does she like the color pink
And hate her toes?
But did you think I'd let you go?
I Think I always knew that we'd grow old
You might also likeChorus:
It's like twisted sister
Meets mr mister
It's like a shout at the devil (shout, oh)
Meets a careless whisper
It's like Motorhead and the grateful dead in a game of twister
It's like boy meets girl
Bridge:
When I when I saw you, I could see
I wanna wanna have you lying next to me
I wish that I can take it back
Put you on my favorite track, and play ya on repeat
And every day since then is incomplete
Chorus:
It's like twisted sister
Meets mr mister
It's like a rolling thunder meets a careless whisper
It's like Fleetwood Mac, Biggie and 2-pac in a game of twister
It's like boy meets girl
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
It's like boy meets girl
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
It's like you and me girl(la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, )
You'll always be my girl (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, )
