Hey!
Hey!
I'm gonna make her mine
Just like that
She's gone
I think you're girlfriend's getting bored
She wants a ten, she got a four
You shouldn't leave her wanting more
I'll help her find it
I'm what she wishes you could be
When she's with you, she thinks of me
Now you can't give her what she needs
Hope you don't mind it
You're wondering why she don't want you
Goodbye!
Cause I'm better than you, better than you
At everything you do
You're out of time, I'm gonna make her mine
You might also likeI'm gonna take your girl from you
There's nothing that you can do
You're out of time, I'm gonna her make mine
I'm at her house the nights you're not
Lately that seems to be a lot
I know the way to hit that spot
It drives her crazy
And I take her places that you can't
And I'm not talking about Japan
Looks like she wants a different man
Go on and hate me
She tells you size just doesn't matter
I'm better than you, better than you
At everything you do
You're out of time, I'm gonna make her mine
I'm gonna take your girl from you
Ain't shit that you can do
You're out of time, I'm gonna make her mine
And you're just another average Joe (Oh no)
You outta let her go and be with someone more like me
And nothing you ever do or say will ever make that change
Yeah
I'm better than you, better than you
At everything you do
You're out of time, I'm gonna make her mine
Gonna take your girl from you
There's nothing that you can do
You're out of time, I'm gonna make her mine
I'm gonna make her mine
You better say goodbye
I'm gonna make her mine
