Who told my friends
That you got drunk and spent the night
With some guy you didn't know at all
And now you're so resistant
Your story's inconsistent
You swear you only kissed him
But i know it's a lie
You try to PG rate it
But that's not how it played in my head
Yeah you front like you been cryin
But i know that you're lying again
And this is the part when you disappear
It's a cliche' break-up here
Yeah we're D-O-N-E
Tell me how it feels to be the cheater of the year
And this is the part when you shed a tear
Let me make it very clear
That we're O-V-E-R
I know who you really are
You're the cheater of the year
I hope that you're happy
You've ruined everything we had
I want my Spinfire t-shirt back
You know what my stance is
I don't do second chances
And all those high school dances
I could have gone STAG
You tryin to explain it
But i ain't gonna play that again no
