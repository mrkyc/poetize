I was living like a player in a west coast town, yeah
I never thought that I would ever settle down
Always, one girl after the other
Didn't wanna be your boyfriend, all I needed was your number
Lemme share alittle bit of what I found
There were so many flavors I wanted to taste
But then Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21
Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
And then Katie she kinda had a thing with Stacy
And that was pretty fun, but lately
I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
The same girl every night
Some girls should come with a warning
And a dose of penicillin first thing in the morning
But last night that never really crossed my mind
Always, one girl after the other
I was hitting on your roommate, I was flirting with your mother
And now I guess I'm feeling it was always like that time
Like Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21
Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
And then Katie she kinda had a thing with Stacy
And that was pretty fun, but lately
I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
You might also likeI want the same girl every night
Who wants the same guy every night
In the same bed every night
Every single night
I want the same girl every night
Who wants the same guy every night
What a perfect fucking life
Every single night
So many flavors I wanted to taste
All those girls, well how can I forget those names
Like Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21
Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
But baby, you're the only one that can save me
I guess I'm in love, cause lately
I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
