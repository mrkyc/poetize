Don't know what's been taken
Can't find out, can't find out
Something inside is missing
What am I all about
I've been too scared to face it
Nothing that I can do
Watching it all start slipping
Guess my time's running out
Running out

Everything has been changing
Nothing good is around
Seems like it's been forever
Since when I knew myself
How did I let this happen
It's too late, now I'm through
I guess I'm finally breaking
This is me going down
Going down

Just want it back
My life again
Gotta find a way to start it over, yeah
Will I make it through?
Don't know what to do
Finally hit the bottom but it's not the end
No, no
You might also like
All I can feel is sadness
Can't get out, can't get out
Everyday is a battle
Think it's time for some help
Feels like everything I've done
Isn't right, isn't true
About to give it all up
This is me going down
Going down

Just want it back
My life again
Gotta find a way to start it over, yeah
Will I make it through?
Don't know what to do
Finally hit the bottom but it's not the end
No, no

I'm afraid of what's coming (coming)
I don't know how much more I can take, no, no
I'm afraid the end's coming (coming)
Everything feels so wrong
[Chorus:}
Just want it back
My life again
Gotta find a way to start it over, yeah
Will I make it through
Don't know what to do
Finally hit the bottom but it's not the end
No, no
Just want it back
My life again
Gotta find a way to start it over, yeah
Will I make it through?
Don't know what to do
I finally hit the bottom but it's not the end
No, no
Just want it back
My life again
Gotta find a way to start it over, yeah
Will I make it through?
Don't know what to do
Finally hit the bottom but it's not the end
