I'm the heat in the summer time
Everyone around me knows I'm on my way
You may not see it now
Lookin at my bank account
Girl you know I'm gonna fool the world some day
Cause when I get to where I'm going
I just don't think you'll be knowing
About the party that I'm gonna have
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
We'll have the biggest mansion on the block and that's a fact
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
And everyone's invited
California to Iraq
I'll be midas
As you'll be gold
You won't have to sell your soul
Always keep a pair of aces up my sleeve
I got game like Beckham man
Frank in catch me if you can
Won't you take my hand and come away with me
You might also likeWe will hit our destination
Life will turn into vacation
Everybody all together now
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
We'll have the biggest mansion on the block and that's a fact
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
And everyone's invited
California to Iraq
Everything I say is true
I would never lie to you
Trust me, love me, don't be crazy
'Cause I'd never hurt you, baby
All the cash in the world
Won't make me rich without you girl
Don't you know that we can rule the world some day
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
We'll have the biggest mansion on the block and that's a fact
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
And everyone's invited
California to Iraq
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
We're going to the hills and maybe never coming back
It's like that (it's like that)
It's like that (it's like that)
And everyone's invited
California to Iraq
Big Evil
That's right
And the Blacklist Club
Yeah
