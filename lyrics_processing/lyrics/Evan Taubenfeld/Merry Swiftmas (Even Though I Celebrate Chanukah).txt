But I've been pretty good this year
And I don't know if it matters that I celebrate Chanukah
But I hope you get my wish]
VERSE
Hey what do ya know it's time for Christmas
And I've been acting good all year
I never have been all that superstitious
But that don't mean I hate reindeer
So Santa, I don't know if you're listenin
I'm not quite sure how this works
I wanna good girl for huggin and kissin
Not a headcase who only dates jerks
PRE 1
I don't need more toys and shiny things
I just want a blonde who likes to sing
CH 1
So don't put a bow on a box
There's no need to send Megan Fox
I don't need big mansion
So lets nix Scarlett Johansson
They'll be teardrops on my guitar
If I end up with Amy Smart
So Santa for my gift, please send me Taylor Swift
You might also likeV2
So Santa when you come down the chimney
You can skip right past the kitchen
I know you're sick of all of the cookies
So got you Fearless Platinum Edition
PRE 2
And no one will mess with her when she's mine
And Kanye will watch his mouth next time
CH 2
So, I'm gonna have to refuse
If in comes Penelope Cruz
If she is a bad girl, sending her back
Cause Lindsay Lohan is wack (just like crack)
I'd rather have Jason Mraz (I'm yours)
Than be stuck with Cameron Diaz
So Santa for my gift, please send me Taylor Swift
BRIDGE
I know her and I are gonna fit...
Taylor Taubenfeld has a ring to it
CH 3
I'd rather be hangin alone
Than makin out with Emma Stone
Yeah I'd rather get a subpoena
Than kick it with Angelina
And yeah I'll probably she'd a few tears
If you mess up and send Britney Spears
