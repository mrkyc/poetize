In the same way that your father did
And throw a stone upon the river's lid
Watch the circles take you home
Blow the smoke and watch it leave your lungs
And high or not, think of what you've done
Have you not considered life beneath the thumb?
Or flying solo in your home?
'Cause sometimes it's who, not what you do
Just 'cause your father did doesn't mean that you should too
I don't want to lose you
Don't go away from here
Yeah, it's that sinking feeling of being alone
And it's the way it makes you screech
And pulls the skin off your bones
And I can't help but think, as I pick my mouth off the floor:
Will you still know me in a year?
Don't you think about your actions?
Counter-weight dire reactions?
Zero soul, you're a loser's son
But don't you go away from here
You might also likeYour mind's a minefield in a minor way
Don't just fall in like some mindless stray
"We're your friends, you see" is what they say
Don't you go away from here
Yeah, it's that sinking feeling of being alone
And it's the way it makes you screech
And pulls the skin off your bones
And I can't help but think, as I pick my mouth off the floor:
Will you still know me in a year?
In a year, in a year?
Yeah, it's that sinking feeling of being alone
And it's the way it makes you screech
And pulls the skin off your bones
And I can't help but think, as I pick my mouth off the floor:
Will you still know me in a year?
Yeah, it's that sinking feeling of being alone
And it's the way it makes you screech
And pulls the skin off your bones
And I can't help but think, as I pick my mouth off the floor:
Will you still know me in a year?
