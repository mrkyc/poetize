Hide your face with your heavy woolen hood
Don't worry chum, the wind will pick up soon
They'll be gone, we'll be free, walk on
Gulp down the salt sea air and taste the coast
The land that brought you up, taught you the most
And named your name, gave you chances no one knows
You're with me, climb that tree, climb on
Days go by, but I'm behind
I've got to pick up my feet, keep moving
There's no need to worry
We're not in any hurry
You, boy, are home
Rest your nose upon the cheeks of the ones you love
Smell sickly sweet breath when the morning comes
And you brush your thighs with your fingers and your thumbs
Drool away, count the days, till it's gone
Days go by, but I'm behind
I've got to pick up my feet, keep moving
There's no need to worry
We're not in any hurry
You, boy, are home
You might also likeBack alone, like a stay at home bum
You drink until you're met by midday sun
And dance until your very bones are numb
At least you're free, come with me, come on
Days go by, but I'm behind
I've got to pick up my feet, keep moving
There's no need to worry
We're not in any hurry
You, boy, are home
Days go by, but I'm behind
I've got to pick up my feet, keep moving
There's no need to worry
We're not in any hurry
You, boy, are home
You, boy, are home
You, boy, are home
