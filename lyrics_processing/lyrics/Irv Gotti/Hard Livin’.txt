Young Merc
For all my youg niggas (All of my young niggas)
On the block, Naa mean (On the block)
Going hard (Blow hard nigga)
Yo I was raised in poverty (in poverty)
Yeah, life was hard
Growin up 'round, killaz and hust-lers
I used ta, sit on the porch
Watch pops smoke luports
Trying when he was going to get his next bag to snort
I just sit back, deep in thought like (man)
Wishin I had a plan to make him a better man
But I can't, but that's what made it worse
Then I started smokin weed and hustlin work
I turned to the streets, fifteen, mind on cash
Highschool fliest nigga in the class
Why all y'all was studyin trying to pass
I was tryna, get the pass, to cut out and get ass
I was always ahead of my time
Neighbours in the hood said I be locked up
Or dead by twenty-five
But still I, Ride, wit my head high
Knowin I'm a young thug and I will survive

Word to god, Yeah
I was only twelve when I first went to jail
Locked up and sparked it, fucked up and heartless
My moms had a habit, heron and acid
A bad lil' basterd always needed my ass kicked
A five member family living in one room
Cookin on hot plates, eatin on plastic spoons
I don't esagerate, or imaginate
I had to go to jail to graduate
Growin up in Foster homes, You Fosters own
I had to get up, get out and get my own
Niggas was throwin bricks I'm tossin stones
Then I floss the chrome, the boss is home
But the block is gone, the cops is wrong
Yellow got paralyzed, Little Jemel died
Put me in hell and I still rise
Put me in the chair I'll fry
Do my whole twenty-five
