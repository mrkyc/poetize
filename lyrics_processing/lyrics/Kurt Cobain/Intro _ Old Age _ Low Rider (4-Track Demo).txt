Ah, ochay, ochay

Yes I'm breathing
Filthy hands, hey, hey
Read to me, hey, hey-hey
Miss me, hey, hey, hey
Prefer me sad, hey, hey
And I wouldn't break
She wouldn't miss me
She wouldn't miss me



And I am afraid
It's a fire; our house is gone
And I refrain
Are you God, are you God
Get away, no more
And now your fingers meet the floor
And now I can barely be alone
And now I am one to obey me
Preach me fire and lead the way
You silent bit and I will say
"Is he in front of me or away?"
And now, and now, hey
You might also like
Keep it down to one more spacious
One more howl and I feigned my service
Someday I'll find my way to something
It's not hard to relieve my service
Come inside of her inner circles
Someday I won't be high, no way, it's over

She seems to read minds
And I'm deaf, dumb and blind
Weigh the fame I use
She's the same

Old age
Old age
Old age

Some are killed and some are wounded
Some were kind and I feigned my service
Someday I won't find my way, its over
Its not fair, he believes my servants
One more hour in the week, my servants
Someday I'll allow my way to something
She seems to read minds
And I'm deaf, dumb and blind
Face the face in the mirror
We survey

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

'Cause you're just afraid to see you're all weird
Come a higher way, I'm begging to see

One more hour and I face my service
Come on down to relieve my servants
Someday I will have found my way to something
Second there, It will feign my service
One more howl and I won't be serviced
Someday I will have found my way to something

She seems to read minds
And I'm deaf, dumb and blind
Weigh the fame I use
Jesus saves
Old age
Old age
Jesus saves
Old age
Old age
Old age


Take a little trip, take a little trip for me
Do do do do do-na na
Do do do do do-na na
Low ri-der, it's a low rider
Do do do do
Okay
