One, two, one, two, three

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time I placed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says, "Follow through"
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
'Cause if summer is here, I'm still waiting there
Winter is here and I'm still waiting there

Like I said, it's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Ooh, girl, ooh, girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn, see

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
No, I, no, I (I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna wait in vain
No, no, no, I, no, I (I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna wait in vain
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
It's my love that you're running from (I don't wanna wait in vain)
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
It's my love that you're running from, oh (I don't wanna wait in vain)
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
