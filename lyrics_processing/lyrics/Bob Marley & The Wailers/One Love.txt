I tell you, let's just salsabrate and I'll feel alright (Let's join together and I will feel alright)
Let's join together and I'll feel alright

Now, let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)
There is one question I'd really like to ask (One soul)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his soul?

One love
One heart
Let's join together and I'll feel all right

Hear my plea

Let's join together and I'll feel alright
Let's just pray to the Lord and I will feel alright (Let's join together and I will feel alright)

Let's join together to fight this holy battle
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place when the King comes along, yes
