Go

The first thing that you feel is a rumblin'
The next thing you know, everything starts crumblin'
Stumblin' and you're trying to escape
So you want to get away from your faith but you can't
But wait! Oh, no, ain't no discounts
Each and every one of y'all get the full amount
Of the lyrical gumbo, not mumbo
When it's stronger than a coffee jumbo
The black buffalo from the DTX
Cape on my back and the "T" on my chest
Am I up to the test? Aw, yes
With my brand new style
So fresh

Some folks tryin' to say I mowed off, showed off
Got on my horse and rode off
Through a cloud of dust and the tumbleweeds
Make way for the buffalo stampede

Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
You might also like
Your whole world can change in the blink of an eye
Try not to cry, through the pain and the pride
And the loneliness, and the phoniness
All I want is the truth, can you show me this?
But you're here to hook beats, your pace quickens
And you're cluckin' around like chickens
The Buffalo is on a roll
Now you know, like I said before
So tell your mama and them, save your drama for them
Tell all your kin folks, your cousins and your friends
And get on over to the Ponderosa
Move your body and your booty like you know you're supposed to

Some folks tryin' to say I mowed off, showed off
Got on my horse and rode off
Through a cloud of dust and the tumbleweeds
Make way for the buffalo stampede

Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness

(One, two, three, four)
From Little Big Horn to Wounded Knee
The Trail of Tears is where you'll never find me
And like ol' cheese boy, you know I'm outlasting
You know I got a handle on the topic that I'm grasping

Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
Run and flee, The Buffalo is here
Sick with this, with my country hickness
Runnin' full gallop like a horse in the Preakness
