Well, I'm three weeks late on my credit card payment
The lady on the phone said she wants to make arrangements
"Put a little down, Can you pay a little on it?"
My wallet's too flat, couldn't pay if I wanted
They're callin' on my job, I'm gettin' letters in the mail
The haters in the hood all hopin' that I fail
My pocket's on Slimfast, tank on empty
Used to have friends said they wanna stick with me
Dogs in my stomach, 'cause now I'm getting hungry
Really under pressure wanna talk to my mommy
People on the corner askin' me for change?!
Gotta find me a job with a higher pay range
I've gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot, that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin' (What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'

The dang landlord's knockin' on my front door
Said he wants the rent from two weeks before
I want to make a call, huh I can't use the phone
That was late too, couldn't get a dial tone
Got snow on my TV, no mo' cable
Gotta use my strats, keepin' food on my table
My car note overdue, the bank's talkin' repo
Gotta take my girl to the matinee show
I'm makin' sure she takes a purse big as a tent
Sneakin' in candy bars for 89 cents
I take her to the buffet later in the evenin'
All you can eat, gotta maximize your feedin'
Gotta tough time trying to pay my bills
If I hit the jackpot that'll cure my ills
My credit is a joke and the banks ain't lendin'
Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin')
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What am I?, What am I, What am I?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(What what what?)
Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
(Sho' nuff!)
See we live in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'
Livin' in a world of false pretense
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
My credit is a joke, the banks ain't lendin'
I ain't broke yet but I'm sho' nuff bendin'

Well he ain't broke yet but he's sho' nuff bendin'
