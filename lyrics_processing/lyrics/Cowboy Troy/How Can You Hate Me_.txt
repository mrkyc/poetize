What day? Attention
Permission to cut loose
And shake your butt granted
You know what?
There's no way you could of planned it
The buffalo is still here
The haters can't stand it
Do you hate me cause I'm larger than you
Or cause I'm stronger
Or that I work harder than you?
Or the fact I have the power
To react and choose not to
And that is my tool
Boom I got you
Do you hear my understanding of economic policy
Or the fact that I vote
Be careful now don't choke
On the fact I can read in the first place
Some of ya'll demands
Since my very first birthday
(How can you hate someone you just don't know)
You come and see the show
It's gonna be for full fledged
Buy the whole seat
Only 90 bucks a head
The more you hate you know the less love grows
The black buffalo commin out the box
Kicks and rocks
From your head down to your socks
Some people do things to be legendary
But wind up notorious and excindiary
You wanna hate me
You better hate harder
You wanna put out the fire
Bring more water
Some may represent back in the past days
Wantin' me to cross over like I'm on a fast breaks
Speakin my selection makes it hard like rambo
Some of yall say a train
Nothin but a sand boat
Big and rich with the bet
They really took a gamble
Now I'm giving nay sayas
More than they can handle
Fifteen years I used to rap for freesy
Now I'm thankful for the cords
When your pay to sees me
Indeed I declare I ain't like ofry wims
Couldn't picture your neck
From here to san demas
Act like I'm a farmilliar man
Go on recognize me
Batton down them hatches
When they start to super size me
(How can you hate someone you just don't know)
You come and see the show
It's gunna be for full fledged
Buy the whole seat
Only 90 bucks a head
The more you hate you know the less love grows
The black buffalo commin out the box
Kicks and rocks
From your head down to your socks
How can you hate me
-cool guitar solo-
I was Branded a sell out
Before I sold out of concert
Speakin the truth
So it's bound to make your mind hurt
The slaves were freed in the 1860's
But some fokes still think
They have a right to get me
They wanna take me out to a lead buffay
Gimme a new necktie and tie it the old way
People I never met wanna take me body surfing
Behind a pick up
Ya that's disturbing
And when my family finds out
It's a little un nerving
You need to wash up for supper
If you're eatin what I'm servin
Whatup kin foke
Whatup cuz
Ain't a man alive who can do what I does
(How can you hate someone you just don't know)
You come and see the show
It's gunna be for full fledged
Buy the whole seat
Only 90 bucks a head
The more you hate you know the less love grows
The black buffalo commin out the box
Kicks and rocks
