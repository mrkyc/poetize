If you don't wanna love me
Then I'll find somebody else who will
Find another kind of thrill
Find another way to fill this loneliness
[Verse 1 - Cowboy Troy)
A married couple with kids and a family pet
He takes for granted that it's all good, and things are set
But she feels no passion in the romance
It's been a year since they had their last slow dance
Even worse her husband treats her like an ornament
Every other week the kids have a tournament
A team meeting or somewhere they gotta be
But her heart's screamin', "Hey what about me?"
Unbeknownst, another hound is in the chicken coop
And he's makin' moves like a player to the hoop
She met him at the gym or was it at the grocery?
It doesn't matter 'cause you know where it's goin' B
'Cause last year, her mister got caught cheatin'
So she figures this is gonna make 'em even
He thought she'd wait like all the times before
Until he found the note she left for him hanging on the door
It read...
 (Cowboy Troy)
If you don't wanna love me
Then I'll find somebody else who will (I'll find somebody else who will)
Find another kind of thrill
Find another way to fill this loneliness

She's sixteen, callin' home to her mama
Afraid to talk 'cause she scared of all the noise and drama
She's been gone for a week and a half
All she wants is something to eat and a nap
Cause she's a runaway (runaway, runaway)
Sleepin' under bridges and sleepin' in alleyways
Afraid to go the shelter so at night she prays
That hopefully she's gonna see some better days
Meanwhile Mom and Dad are really frantic
When they saw her clothes were gone
You know they really panicked
Thoughts in their mind, "Did she run to the border?"
Or even worse "Will she be a case on Law and Order?"
The silence in her room screams of not feelin' wanted
Of not being good enough it almost seems haunted
All her pain soon will be known
When she leaves her Mom and Dad a message after the tone and says....
 (Cowboy Troy)
If you don't wanna love me
Then I'll find somebody else who will (I'll find somebody else who will)
Find another kind of thrill
Find another way to fill this loneliness

If you really wanna know me
I guess you better show me
Is it real or is it phony?
Just love me or leave me alone
 (Cowboy Troy)
If you don't wanna love me
Then I'll find somebody else who will (I'll find somebody else who will)
Find another kind of thrill
