Hey, Git-R-Done! This is Larry the Cable Guy, by God!
I've never won a Grammy award, but Barbra Streisand
Took her top off one time and won a SAG award!
Ha ha! That's funny, I don't care who you are!
Hey, enjoy this song by Cowboy Troy, a good buddy of mine!
Git-R-Done! By God, Troy, GIT-R-DONE!

YEE HAW!!!!! (chainsaw sounds)

If you don't know, better ask somebody
Get on the floor and grab that hottie
If you don't know, better ask somebody
Get on the floor and grab that hottie
If you don't know, better ask somebody
Get on the floor and grab that hottie

Better hurry up, don't waste your time
You know what to do when you hear my rhyme
You're bouncin' up and down like a kid on a seesaw
Steady groovin' word to your meemaw
Right now put 'em in the air
Wave side-to-side, scream "Aw yeah!"
Gotta work tomorrow y'all
But tonight I'm gonna party

Like it's my last yee haw! Gonna scream and shout!
Like it's my last yee haw! Gonna burn down the town!
Like it's my last yee haw!

Get on the dancefloor, girl, ya heard?
Hands on your knees, arch that back
Shake that badonkadonk and make it clap
Aw now, here we go
Get on the dance floor and get low
Sweat drippin' all down your clothes
'Cause where it stops no one knows
Like it's my last yee haw! Gonna let it hang out!
Like it's my last yee haw! Gonna scream and shout!
Like it's my last yee haw! Gonna burn down the town!
Like it's my last yee haw!

If you don't know, better ask somebody
Get on the floor and grab that hottie
If you don't know, better ask somebody
Get on the floor and grab that hottie
I gotta work tomorrow y'all
But tonight I'm gonna party
