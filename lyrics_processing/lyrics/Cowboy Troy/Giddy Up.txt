We gonna rock this party all night
I'm here with my cousin
And everybody is buzzin
Gonna take a cab home tonight
Giddy up!
Shorty rocks slow motion
Lookin like a pro with the rodeo
Giddy up! Put your hands up high
Break it down low and shake your rawhide
Giddy up! Now do-si-do
With my girl I own the dance floor
Tell the DJ to turn it up
Cause we gonna party until the sun comes up
Take them down, pour it up
Take them down, pour it up
Drink them down all night
Hy, ladies!
Heres what you'll find
Hair and nails up in the line
Got room on your credit card
Celly charged up
Cowboy boots and a pair of skintights
Pour me something to get my mind right
Got a DD that will get you home
Ja tu sabes mi hija
You already know
Shorty rocks in slow motion
Lookin like a pro with the rodeo
Back it up!...
Fill it up!
Shes thirsty
Shot no 4 when you know is up
Barefoot on the bar
Like "that's my song!"

Drink them down
Call it out, 'nother round
Drink them down all night
Now we got the point elevating
A good night and we celebrating
Here come the models, here come the cougars
Here come the waitress with a tray full of shooters
Like reality shows on your TV set
Frat boys getting rowdy
Drink it all, it hurts
A young dealer with a 80 stash
Tryin to get a young kid by flashy cash
Hey kitty cat, let me howl at you a little bit
You're kind of cute, your body is my kind of thing
Pack the lines out at the door
Keep that liquor flowin
We gonna rock this party all night

With my girl I own the dance floor

Cause we gonna party until the sun comes up
Pour it up, take them down
