They said when I was younger
I had some kind of sickness
See how I have weathered
You tell me if I'm better
If my mother had her way, her
Her son would be a preacher
You looking for redemption
We're bringing that old fashioned healing

Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
You won't like me
Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
It's not like me

Boys will be boys who like boys who dress like girls
And that's alright
We're hanging with the boys that look like girls tonight
Girls will be girls who like girls who dress like boys
And start a fight
We're hanging with the girls that look like boys, all right
You might also like
Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
You won't like me
Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
It's not like me

If my mother had her way, her
Her son would be a preacher
You looking for redemption
I bring that old fashioned healing
I don't care if you're a Christian
Or a Hare Krishna
Who gave you the right to judge another's lover?
Now's the time for changing
So keep the hate from creeping in
Cause the bed that you're building
Is the one you gotta sleep in

Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
You won't like me
(Come on, come on)
Don't make me put 'em up
Don't make me put 'em up
It's not like me
Boys will be boys who like boys who dress like girls
And that's alright
We're hanging with the boys that look like girls tonight
Girls will be girls who like girls who dress like boys
And start a fight
We're hanging with the girls that look like boys, all right
Don't make me put 'em up
