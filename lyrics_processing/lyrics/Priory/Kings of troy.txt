There's not a thing that they can do
'cause I'm the one who's always been here by your side
I swear to God I'll never try to make you cry
Oh no, I won't
Well come on, I hope I sing it right
'cause girl I want to lay you down
Well come on, I know you feel it right
Alarms you know they're gonna sound
We took all our broken pieces
And like a puzzle they somehow fit
I know this world can be so vicious
We won't let them win
You keep your love right here with me
Girl, the only one i see
'cause you're the one who's always been here by my side
I swear to God that I can see it in your eyes
You know it's true
Oh oh the kings of troy it all means they are falling
Oh oh the pretty boys outside your window they keep calling
Come out and play
Well we will lock the door and we will pull the shades
Well come out and play
But inside with me you always choose to stay
I can't believe
You might also likeI cannot believe you choose to stay here
I cannot believe you choose to stay here
With me
Well come on, I hope I sing it right
'cause girl I want to lay you down
Well come on, I know you feel it right
Alarms you know they're gonna sound
Well come on, I hope I sing it right
'cause girl I want to lay you down
Well come on, I know you feel it right
Alarms you know they're gonna sound
Well come on, I hope you feel it right
Well come on, I know you feel it right
Cause you're the one who's always been here by my side
I swear to God I'll never try to make you cry
