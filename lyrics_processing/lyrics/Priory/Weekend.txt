And all the kids now
They come runnin'
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
And all the parents
They keep calling
But there's no answer
Cuz it's the weekend

Working class to the bone
And I know you're tired of hearing it
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
This right here is the D.O. proletariat
It's the weekend
Come on the weekend

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait 'till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I just might lose my way
But I'll never get downhearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
You might also like
And all the kids now
They come runnin'
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
And all the parents
They keep calling
But there's no answer

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait 'till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I just might lose my way
But I'll never get downhearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy

Rest when we're old
Should do as we're told
But I just can't help it
I'll reach for the stove
The night closes in
Now for the second act
Tell our friends go ahead
Cause we're hanging back
Youth like a spark
It lights up the dark
We unlock the mystery
I knew that you'd miss me
My mouth on your neck
Your touch on my cheek
Let hands guide the way
As we play hide and seek
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do
My arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true
These arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait 'till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I just might lose my way
But I'll never get downhearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait 'till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I just might lose my way
But I'll never get downhearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
