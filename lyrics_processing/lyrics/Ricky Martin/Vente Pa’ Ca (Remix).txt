Say you like me one more time
And I won't care about the troubles in my life
Say you want me, you'd be mine
When the sunlight is reflected in your eyes

Oh, baby, I, I wanna know, are we for real?
Some kind of dream (Some kind of dream)
I, I wanna know
Now can you feel the way that I feel?

If you want me like I want you
Baby, I won't live without you
We've been 'til the morning light
If you thinking what I'm thinking
And you're drinking what I'm drinking
Then it's all right
If you want me like I want you
Baby, I won't live without you
Let our dreams come true tonight
Vente pa' ca, vente pa' ca, vente pa' ca

No tomorrow, just tonight
Yet together, we can leave the world behind
In the starlight, we will shine
Secret lovers in the secret paradise
