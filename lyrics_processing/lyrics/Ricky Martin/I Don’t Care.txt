Crack, crack, crack
I don't care that's what Ricky says

I don't care, I just want to be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just want to be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

You promised me
We'd always be
You'd never let me go
You took the ring and all the things
That came with being my girl
A tragedy as I walked through that door
He had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
See Ricky Martin LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also like
It was like a movie
Too real to me
That just can't be my bride to be... No!
I was shocked as could be
Never thinking one day
I'd take this blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving... Whoa!
I've never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

I don't care, I just want to be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just want to be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

The crazy part was that he
Just kept going
'cause she was the only one
That had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I've fallen so in love
With someone I'd known for years
And not even know that
She'd be the one
To reveal my worst fears
It was like a movie
Too real to me
That just can't be my bride to be... No!
I was shocked as could be
Never thinking one day
I'd take this blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving... Whoa!
I've never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

I don't care, I just want to be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just want to be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to
I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to
Should I leave, should I go, should I break apart?
My mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you a sleaze, you're a slut, a ho
Now you wanna have a change of heart - damn!
Who'd have thought that you would deceive me?
Love of my life, you my queen like Evie
And you didn't even tell me you leaving
I had to hear about it on Escandalo TV
Now who's this man creeping in the back door
'Bout to hit him with the fo' fo' fo'
I know you keep saying that you loving me so
But why the hell are you crushing him for?
Goddamn now
I don't care, that's what Ricky says
And if I catch him then this kid'll be dead
I don't play that, mami
Now back to the 'jects you go
I left your Reebok's by the front door
Kick rocks

I don't care, I just want to be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just want to be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Sorry, baby
