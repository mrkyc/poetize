I can tell that you're a sinner
From behind your angel ah-ah-ah, e-ah-eyes
A beautiful deceiver
But I can handle anyth-i-i-ing you try

Your finger's on my trigger
You play it like a winner
You're pulling me in ti-i-i, ee-ight
Let's stop talkin' about it
Just stop thinkin' about it
Let's get crazy about it
(Crazy about it, crazy about it)

I got you now
I'm going to take you to the edge tonight
I-I-I'll show you how
So won't you come with me tonight?
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come with me tonight
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come with me tonight
