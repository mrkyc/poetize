(Oh, every day, every day it's sunshine)

Talk to me, tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse, and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb, yeah baby
Talk to me, tell me your sign
You're switching sides like a gemini
You're playing games and now you're hitting my heart
Like a drum, yeah baby

Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Til she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me that a woman's
Got one thing on her mind

Talk to me, tell me your name
I'm just a link in your daisy chain
Your rap sounds like a diamond map
To the stars, yeah baby
Talk to me, tell me the news
You'll wear me out like a pair of shoes
We'll dance until the band goes home
Then you're gone, yeah baby

Well if it looks like love should be a crime
Then better lock me up for life
I'll do the time with a smile on my face
Thinking of her in her leather and lace

She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me that a woman's
Got one thing on her mind
Man, if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Till she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs
She moves, she moves
She bangs, she bangs
