I see you standing over there
You look around without a care
I pretend you notice me
I look in your eyes
And what ya see...

Is made up in my mind
Am I just wasting time?
I think this could be love
I'm serious

What if we were made for each other?
Born to become best friends and lovers
I wanna stay right here in this moment with you
Over and over and over again
What if this could be a real love?
Love, love, yeah

I write our names down in the sand
Picturing all our plans
I close my eyes and I can see
You, and you ask, will you marry me?
