Midnight bottle
Take me calmly through my memories
And everything will come back to me
Midnight bottle
Make it real
What feels like make believe, so I can see a little more clearly

Like every single move you make, kissing me so carefully
On the corners of my dreaming eyes

I've got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight
A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and everything's all right
If only for tonight

Got a midnight bottle
Drifting off into the candlelight
Where I can find you any old time
Midnight bottle
I forgot how good it felt to be in a dream
Just like you had me

'Cause lately I've been stumbling
It feels like I'm recovering
But I think it's only for tonight

I got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight
A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and everything's all right
If only for tonight

If only for tonight
Oh, if only for tonight
If only for tonight

I got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight
A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and everything's all right
If only for tonight, yeah
Midnight bottle
Take the time away
