There were more good days than bad
More smiles than tears
We were more happy than sad
When we were us, we were fierce
Somewhere along the way
Lovers drifted apart
And even though I didn't stay
You have a place in my heart

I know it wasn't perfect
But lovin' you was worth it
There's still sweetness in the memories
Even after all the hurting
Even after all the long nights, not quite knowin' if it felt right
I wouldn't change a thing
I know it wasn't perfect
But lovin' you was worth it

You'll always be someone I miss
And never would regret
Every touch and every kiss
Were the kind you don't forget
I can't put my finger on
The reason it didn't work
We didn't do anything wrong
The fire just wouldn't burn

I know it wasn't perfect

There's still sweetness in the memories
Even after all the hurting
Even after all the long nights, not quite knowin' if it felt right
I wouldn't change a thing
I know it wasn't perfect
But lovin' you was worth it

Lovin' you was easy, lovin' you was nice
But lovin' you was one side of a life
Leavin' was a heartbreak, closin' of a door
Can't blame us for wantin' somethin' more
It wasn't just me I did it for

I know it wasn't perfect
But lovin' you was worth it
There's still sweetness in the memories
Even after all the hurting
Even after all the long nights, not quite knowin' if it felt right
I wouldn't change a thing
I know it wasn't perfect
But lovin' you was worth it
Ooh, oh
No-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
I know it wasn't perfect, perfect, I know
Mm
I know it wasn't perfect
