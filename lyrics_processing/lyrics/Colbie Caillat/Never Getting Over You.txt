You want the end to be easier than the start
I was a hopeful heart that you shattered apart
You wanna say goodbye and disappear
Don't wanna watch when I break down into tears
I won't try to make you stay, I won't even try to
Change your mind

So take a good look at the pain in my face 'fore you walk away
Memorize all the hurt in my eyes and what I say
I'm gonna give you what you wanted, but my heart will never stop
Tell you that I'm fine even though I'm not
You're gonna know for the rest of your life this is true
I'm never gettin' over you, you
I'm never gettin' over you, you

I won't pretend that I won't find someone else
You'll be a closed book sittin' there on the shelf
I'll never have to open it again
To know the pages of the words of what could've been
I know where you're gonna be, where you're always gonna be
Right in front of me

So take a good look at the pain in my face 'fore you walk away
Memorize all the hurt in my eyes and what I say
I'm gonna give you what you wanted, but my heart will never stop
Tell you that I'm fine even though I'm not
You're gonna know for the rest of your life this is true
I'm never gettin' over you, you
I'm never gettin' over you, you

So take a good look at the pain in my face 'fore you walk away
Memorize all the hurt in my eyes and what I say
I'm gonna give you what you wanted, but my heart will never stop
Tell you that I'm fine even though I'm not
You're gonna know for the rest of your life this is true
I'm never gettin' over you, you
(Not over you, not over you, not over you)
I'm never gettin' over you, you
(Not over you, not over you, not over you)
I'm never gettin' over you

Not over you, not over you, not over you
