You're stuck on me and my laughing eyes
I can't pretend, though I try to hide
I like you, I like you
I think I felt my heart skip a beat
I'm standing here and I can hardly breathe
You got me, yeah, you got me
The way you take my hand is just so sweet
And that crooked smile of yours, it knocks me off my feet

Oh, I just can't get enough
How much do I need to fill me up?
It feels so good, it must be love
It's everything that I've been dreaming of
I give up, I give in
I let go, let's begin
'Cause no matter what I do
Oh (Oh), my heart is filled with you

I can't imagine what it'd be like (Oh)
Living each day in this life
Without you, oh, without you (Oh)
One look from you, I know you understand
This mess we're in, you know, is just so out of hand

I hope we always feel this way (I know we will)
And in my heart, I know that you will always stay

Oh, I just can't get enough
