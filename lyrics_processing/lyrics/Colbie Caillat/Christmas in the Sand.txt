I love Christmas in the snow
But Christmas in the sand, oh, man
I tell you that's where it's at
Hawaiian Tropic on my skin
Candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
Could've been my childhood fantasy

But I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said, "You look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice"
He was soaking wet, but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said, "It's Christmas in the sand"

I must've had too much to drink
'Cause Rudolph's nose was shinin' green, I think
He was playin' reindeer games on me
Well, Santa only called him once
But you should have seen him run, so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
Could've been my childhood fantasy

But I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said, "You look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice"
He was soaking wet, but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said, "It's Christmas in the sand"

Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
Christmas in the sand

Don't need your winter coat, don't need you winter hat
Just grab the one you love and say, "You're never coming back"

And you'll see Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he'll try too soon
He'll laugh so hard that he can barely breathe
It's what he did to me (It's what he did to me)
He said, "You look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice" (Sure you're nice)
He was soaking wet, but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said, "It's Christmas in the sand" (Christmas in the sand)
Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa-oh-oh
