Let's pretend we never broke up
Pretend we didn't do it all wrong
Let's act as if we didn't quit
And when it got hard, we held on
Let's pretend you gave me your all
Pretend I didn't need more
And that we're still sittin' in a countryside kitchen
Red dog sleepin' on the floor

Guess I still got some feelings
Honey, do you feel like dreaming?

Of that first summer night in the back of your truck
Kissin' in the moonlight, stars above
Dancin' in a field with the radio on
The moment we found our favorite song
Burnin' like a fire that would never go out
Heartache wasn't somethin' we were thinkin' about
That forever kind of feeling that we found back then
Was love, it wasn't pretend

Let's pretend you opened up
Pretend I didn't shut down
'Cause I can't pretend that it don't hurt
And that I don't miss you now

(Ooh)
Ooh, yeah
(Ooh)

Do you feel like playing along?
Like goin' back before you were gone

To that first summer night in the back of your truck
Kissin' in the moonlight, stars above
Dancin' in a field with the radio on
The moment we found our favorite song
Burnin' like a fire that would never go out
Heartache wasn't somethin' we were thinkin' about
That forever kind of feeling that we found back then
Was love, it wasn't pretend
Oh, no
It was love

It was love, it was love back then
It was love, it was love back then
It was love, it was love back then
It was love
It was love, it was love back then
It was love, it was love back then
It was love, it was love back then
