I'm just gonna say it
There's no using in delaying
I'm tired of the angry hangin' out inside me
So I'll quiet down the devil
I'm gonna knock him with a shovel
And I'll burry all my troubles underneath the rubble
When I'm alone in my dark dark room
I have to tell myself to...

Think good thoughts
Think good thoughts
Imagine what the world would be if we we we we'd just
Think good thoughts
Starve the bad from feeding

Oh, I won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy
Promise to myself that I won't let it get the best of me
That's how I want to be
Na, na, na, na...

I'm not saying that it's easy
Especially when I'm moody
I might be cursing like a sailor
'Til I remind myself I'm better
'Cause words can be like weapons
Oh, and you use them, you regret them
Oh, but I'm not gonna let them take away my Heaven
And when I start feeling blue
I remember to tell myself to...

I just think rain on a summer night
Stars fillin' up the sky
Sun shining on my face
Making a secret wish
Finding my happiness
That always makes me hold my head up high
I wanna hold my head up high

Oh, I wanna think good thoughts
(Oh, imagine what the world would be if we we we we'd just)
I wanna think good thoughts (Wouldn't that be something?)
Oh, I won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy
Promise to myself that I won't let it get the best of me
That's how I want to be
