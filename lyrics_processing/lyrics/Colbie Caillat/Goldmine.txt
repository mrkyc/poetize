If all I had was a dollar and your bright smile
I'd have a dollar more than I would need to get by
'Cause I'm a billionaire if you count every sunrise
Wakin' by your side, and every good night
If all you had was the way that I love you
You'd have more honey than the honey bees in June
I'll keep you laughin', keep you smilin', keep your dreams true
Long as I have you, nothin' we can't do

Fly me
Back to the moon, where you took me
The very first time that you kissed me
In the sweet starlight, of your endless eyes, when you lit this fire
Feels like
We're sittin' on top of a goldmine
Flame so bright that it won't die
In a billion years, it'll still be here
'Cause our love is a goldmine
Yeah, our love is a goldmine

If everything we ever owned disappeared today
We'd build a castle in the sand somewhere far away
Don't need no money, no TV, don't need no microwave
Just the ocean waves, and the love we make

Flame so bright that it won't die
In a billion years it'll still be here
'Cause our love is a goldmine

We'll be rich in wrinkles, old and gray
When the risin' tide sweeps us away
Until then
