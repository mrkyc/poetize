The little things you do to me are
Taking me over, I wanna show you
Everything inside of me, oh
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beating

My feet are stuck here, against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Back up, back up, take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off, without you, boy

And every time you notice me by
Holding me closely and saying sweet things
I don't believe that it could be
You speaking your mind and saying the real thing

My feet have broke free, and I'm leaving
I'm not gonna stand here, feeling lonely, but
I don't regret it
And I won't think this was just a waste of time

Back up, back up, take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off, without you, boy

Don't just leave, me, hanging on
Don't just leave, me, hanging on

The little things, you do to me are
Taking me over, I wanna show you
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beating
My feet are stuck here, against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by
Don't just leave me hanging on

Back up, back up, take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
(Don't just leave, me, hanging on)
If I'm better off, better off, without you, boy
(Don't just leave, me, hanging on)

Don't just leave, me, hanging on
Don't just leave, me, hanging on
(The little things, all the little things you do to me)
Don't just leave, me, hanging on
(Driving me crazy, crazy, yeah, yeah, driving me crazy)
Don't just leave, me, hanging on
