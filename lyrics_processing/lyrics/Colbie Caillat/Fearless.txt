If that's the way you love
You've got to learn so much
If that's the way you say goodbye
Then this is how it ends
And I'm alright with it
You're never gonna see me cry
'Cause I've cried

So go on, go on and break my heart
I'll be okay
There's nothing you can do to me
That's ever gonna bury me
So go on, go on and leave my love
Out on the street
I'm fearless
Better believe I'm fearless, fearless
So, oh, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, oh, whoa, oh-oh, whoa

If this is how it hurts
It couldn't get much worse
If this is how it feels to fall
Then that's the way it is
We live with what we miss
We learn to build another wall
'Til it falls (Falls)
