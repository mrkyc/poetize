Low, when you're feeling low
And you just don't know where to run to
Broke, if your heart's been broke
And you feel like you're all alone

If you need something to believe in
If you're looking for a light to guide you home
Just look inside
Your light is shining brighter than you know
And you should know

I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always gonna build you up
When you're feeling lost, I will always find you love
I'm never gonna walk away
I'm always gonna have your back
And if nothing else, you can always count on that
When you need me, I promise I will never let you down

Laugh, I will make you laugh
If you ever feel like crying
Close, I will hold you close
You won't be alone anymore
