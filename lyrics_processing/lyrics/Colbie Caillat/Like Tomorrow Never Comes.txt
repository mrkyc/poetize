There's so much that I never knew, but I'm still learning
Always planning dream after dream and wanting more things
All the best things in life are free
We'll be happy wherever we'll be
So how about right now?

Let's stay up from dusk 'til dawn
Lie here 'til we see the sun
Curl up inside your arms; right here's where we belong
We're the lucky ones, living life forever young
Get lost up in the love; just love
Like tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes
We'll stay forever young, yeah, yeah
Like tomorrow never comes

Windmills turning, our hearts are burning
Red like sunrise
Kisses from the hot summer morning
Live the good life
Who knew that life could taste so sweet?
I've got all that I'll ever need
Right here, right now

And if you haven't found love, know that you will find it
It might take a while; you could be right beside it
Don't know what the tide brings, but that could be a good thing
But what if this is the night?

Let's stay up from dusk 'til dawn
Lie here 'til we see the sun

Get lost up in the love; just love
Tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes
We'll stay forever young, yeah, yeah
Like tomorrow never comes
