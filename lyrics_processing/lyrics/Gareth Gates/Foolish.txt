One last fix with a kiss is worth riskin' suicide
'Cause I'm livin' for the mo, I'm livin' for tonight
I clean forgot she left me paralyzed
When I'm touchin' her hand it's a blast from the past
See the strange deja vu, yeah I know it won't last
She turns me on I can't just go on a fast
Keepin' my mind off her is one mighty task
Oh (oh) I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Feels like I'm loosin' my mind again (loosin' my mind)
Now I'm right back where I started (where I started)
I've gotta mend this broken heart of mine all over again
I've been foolish (foolish) foolish (foolish)
Foolish with my hands held high (hands held high)
Girl I've wound up where I started
I'm pleadin' guilty to a crime that my heart just cannot deny
Time is healer how easy we forget
All the misery and pain that one person can inflict
Seems I suffer from a case of selective memory
I clean forgot how she walked all over me
No-no-no - can't help myself in the end I'm just a man
With my sentimental needs for your tender lovin' hands
I'm lyin' when I say there's no strings attached
When I look at her I swear my mind goes blank
You might also likeOh (oh) I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Feels like I'm loosin' my mind again (loosin' my mind)
Now I'm right back where I started (where I started)
I've gotta mend this broken heart of mine all over again
I've been foolish (foolish) foolish (foolish)
Foolish with my hands held high (hands held high)
Girl I've wound up where I started
I'm pleadin' guilty to a crime that my heart just cannot deny
For one touch
For one kiss
What do I stand to loose
Baby loosin' my mind is better than loosin' you
Somebody tell me why do I gotta choose
I'm all excited but keep gettin' the blues
Oh (oh) I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Feels like I'm loosin' my mind again (loosin' my mind)
Now I'm right back where I started (where I started)
I've gotta mend this broken heart of mine all over again
I've been foolish (foolish) foolish (foolish)
Foolish with my hands held high (hands held high)
Girl I've wound up where I started
