I've played around
Moving from one to another
I've been a fool, yeh
I've been unkind
But being with made me discover
That trust and honesty
Is all I really need
And I should never let it slip awys
(Coz girl)
Seeing you shine by the candlelight
Got me up til it feels so right
So good that baby I
I don't want this night to be over
Stay right here, oh, please don't leave
Lets star in our own love scene
Then chill and spend the night
It's too soon to say goodbye
It's too soon to say goodbye
Darling, I know
You're type who goes slow
And trust when I say
I don't mean to rush
But give it some thought
If you're all alone
You're just gonna wish
That I was there too
Imagine you and me
As close as two can be
We can let it flow for eternity, girl
