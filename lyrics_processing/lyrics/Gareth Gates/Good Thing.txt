You got to keep moving for your own protection
Now that kind of love just ain't enough
You turn the tables on my whole world baby
You take away all the heartache bad love gave me
Can't you see what you've done in my life?
And make that pure connection
Changed my whole perceptionof love
You're the fuel in my fire
My fever burns high
Don't be scared of desire; its a good thing
When we come together, you can't stop this good thing
No you can't put it out
When we come together, try to stop this good thing
And it will burn you down
I'm kinda warming to this new sensation
Cause every day is like a revelation
Just show me something i never knew about me yeah
My friends can't lead me into no temptation
Cause baby you'll give me everything i'll ever need
Fooling you make a fool out of me
(There's not a chance i'll take, Cos i will never have to fake it with you)
