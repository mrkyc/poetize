Is it making your dreams suggest things you can't fight?
If you call me one time, two time anytime that you want
Got a certain, sure-fire remedy to get you off
So take my hand and rock with me
To the sweetest symphony
Your body pleads to feel the way it feels
Just trust me more than any heart you saw
I'll give you all the love you're waiting for
Now baby you can dance my way downtown
Little skin on skin sure can be found
Maybe you are all alone
Can't do it on your own
I'll show heaven at the speed of sound
Now baby if you come, come on
Come on come on downtown
Come, come on come on downtown
Is the temperature hot enough for you to play?
Is it making your dreams suggest things you can't say?
If you ask me one time, two time anytime that you like
Got the perfect way to alleviate your stress tonight
