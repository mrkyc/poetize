Oooooooh aaaaah
Yeah
Got a feeling that you want it
Simply by the way of looking
You're throwing me sideway glances all night long
Now you wanting my attention
Talking to me, lip sinkin
I think I know what your thinking
Am I wrong?
That look in your eyes
Shows me what could be mine
Oohooh girl I feel it the beat inside
Tonight we'll dance like starcrossed lovers
When the party's jumpin' and the music's pumpin'
Make me wanna freak my baby
When the groove is hot, I don't wanna stop
I just wanna drive you crazy
You are the one, let's move it
'Cause you turn me on, I'm like a loaded gun
Just wanna be the one
To freak my baby
You might also like(Gotta be there)
Is it my imagination
I swear that I could be dreaming
I never thought we could dance in perfect time
So now you've got my attention
Tell me where you wanna take this
'Cause I just wanna hold your body next to mine
That look in your eyes
Shows me what could be mine
Oohooh girl I feel the beat inside
Tonight we'll dance like starcrossed lovers
When the party's jumpin' and the music's pumpin'
Make me wanna freak my baby
When the groove is hot, I don't wanna stop
I just wanna drive you crazy
You are the one, let's move it
'Cause you turn me on, I'm like a loaded gun
Just wanna be the one
To freak my baby
Freak, freak, freak my baby
Freak, freak, freak, baby
Freak, freak, my baby
That look in your eyes
Shows me what could be mine
Oohooh girl I feel the pain inside
Tonight, tonight
When the party's jumpin' and the music's pumpin'
Make me wanna freak my baby
When the groove is hot, I don't wanna stop
I just wanna drive you crazy
You are the one, let's move it
'Cause you turn me on,I'm like a loaded gun
Just wanna be the one
