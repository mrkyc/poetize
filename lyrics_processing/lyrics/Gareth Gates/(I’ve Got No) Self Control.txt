You're my one temptation
I never felt before, I feel a strong attraction, a strange reaction
It leaves me wanting more
I'm outta my mind, I'm outta my head
I'm loosing my heart, I'm easily led
Like nothin' before, as good as it gets
You're makin' me hot, you're makin me sweat
I've got no, no self control
When I'm with you, oh, what I'll give you baby
I've got no, no self control
When I'm 'round you, I'm loosin' it all for you
I'm under no illusion I'm in such confusion
I can't help myself I think I need protection from a deep affection
Don't want nobody else
I'm fallin' apart. I want you to know
The more you resist, the deeper I go
The longer I wait, the weaker I get
You're making me hot, you're makin' me sweat
I've got no, no self control
When I'm with you, oh, what I'll give you baby
I've got no, no self control
When I'm 'round you, I'm loosin' it all for you
I've got no, no self control
When I'm with you, oh, what I'll give you baby
I've got no, no self control
When I'm 'round you, I'm loosin' it all for you
I've got no, no self control
When I'm with you, oh, what I'll give you baby. I've got no, no self control
When I'm 'round you I'm losin' my head now

I'm fallin' apart. I want you to know
The more you resist, the deeper I go
The longer I wait, the weaker I get
You're making me hot, you're makin' me sweat
You're making me hot, you're makin' me sweat
I've got no, no self control
When I'm with you, oh, what I'll give you baby
I've got no, no self control
