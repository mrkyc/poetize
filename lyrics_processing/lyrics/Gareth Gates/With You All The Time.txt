I watch you from the dark
I'm every breath
I'm every dream
I've known you forever
I've followed you everywhere
I'm every scar
I'm who you are
When you think your alone
When you cried 'cause the world's unfair
You can rest assure, I'm always there
Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
Know that I'm with you, I'm with you all the time
Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you
Know that I'm with you
I'm with u all the time
I walk ur every road
I'm laughing when you smile
And when you cry, I cry to
I made you a promise, that I shall forever keep
Your on your own, but not alone
You might also likeWhen you're down when your out
When the world tells you that no-one cares
You can rest assure, I'm always there
Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
Know that I'm with you, I'm with you all the time
Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you
Know that I'm with you
I'm with u all the time
Save a little love for me and you'll see
Save a little love for me and you'll see
Save a little love for me and you'll see
And you'll see
Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
Know that I'm with you, I'm with you all the time
Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you
Know that I'm with you
