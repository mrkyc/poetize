Final call, you board the train
Heading for tomorrow
I wave goodbye to yesterdays
Wipe the tears, you hide your face
Blinded by the sorrow
How can I be smiling like before
When baby you don't love me anymore
Say it isn't so
Tell me you're not leaving
Say you're changed your mind now
That I am only dreaming
This is not goodbye
This is starting over
If you wanna know, I don't wanna let go
So say it isn't so
Ten to five, at least we've tried
We're still alive but hope just died
As they closed the door behind you
Whistle blows and tons of steel
Shake the ground beneath the wheels
As I wish I'd never found you
You might also likeHow can I be smiling when you're gone?
Will I be strong enough to carry on?
Say it isn't so
Tell me you're not leaving
Say you've changed your mind now
That I am only dreaming
This is not goodbye
This is starting over
Say I'm not wide awake
If you wanna know, I don't wanna let go
So say it isn't so
Miles and miles to go
Before I can say, before I can lay my love for you to sleep
Oh darling oh
I got miles and miles to go
Before anyone will ever hear me laugh again
Say it isn't so
Tell me you're not leaving
Say you've changed your mind now
That I am only dreaming
This is not goodbye
This is starting over
Say I'm not wide awake
If you wanna know, I don't wanna let go
So say it isn't so..
Say you've changed your mind now
That I am only dreaming
That this is not goodbye
This is starting over
Say I'm not wide awake
If you wanna know, I don't wanna let go
So say it isn't so
If you wanna know, I don't wanna let go
