I'm not your everyday average celebrity
I don't complain about the life I live
And I appreciate the lovin' that your showin' me
I believe what you give is what you get
Everytime they wanna bring the heat
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this
So you know I'm embracing it
Oh yeah
Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
If you wanna see, If I'm down
There's enough of me, to go around
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
Keepin' both feet, on the ground
There's enough of me to go around
I never hesitate if you want an autograph
I'll go and sign my name across your heart
So quote me wrong all day the only thing I'll do is laugh
You write the script you know I'll play the part
Everytime they wanna bring the heat
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this
So you know I'm embracing it

There's enough of me, to go around
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
Keepin' both feet on the ground
There's enough of me to go around
I got more than enough to give
What's the use in holding back
I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna make the best of all I have
And share myself in everyway I can
Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
If you wanna see, If I'm down
There's enough of me, to go around
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
