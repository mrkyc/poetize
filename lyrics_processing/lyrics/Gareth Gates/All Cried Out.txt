Came everyday with the sunrise
It's been that way as long as you've been gone
I thought the day would start same as the others falling apart
I thought I barely would be hanging on
Something's changed
Feels so strange
Swimming through an ocean of pain
Then suddenly here's the sun
Maybe I had enough of ya
Maybe I'm tired of dreamin of ya
Maybe I've gotten over your goodbye by now
Baby I couldn't live without you
Not when I think a bout you
My eyes are dry somehow
Maybe I'm all cried out
(i'm only human)
All cried out
(of flesh and blood a man)
I don't know what it is
Why I'm no longer missin your kiss
Feels mysterious and so damn good

Baby I couldn't live without you
Not when I think a bout you
My eyes are dry somehow
Maybe I'm all cried out
(i'm only human)
All cried out
(of flesh and blood a man)
My heart has finally walked away
It's gone from the scene of the crime
It's finally found the perfect place
For leaving you far behind
Baby maybe I
