This old Mexican cowboy at the bar
Looked a hundred years old
He had a million dollar smile
And his withered brown skin shimmered like California gold
He said, "I'm a little short on cash, but I'm long on life"
"For a shot of tequila, I'll give you some dang good advice"

He said, "Don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun"
"Don't argue with a woman while she's holding a gun"
"Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes"
"Vaya con dios" said the old vaquero

Well my heart sank
The more he drank, the more he poured out his misery
How he lost her after forty seven years
And his tears started flowing like the Rio Grand-e
He started speaking in Spanish then he kissed his rosary
Said "Por siempre mi amor", his one more to her memory

He said, "Don't live you life like a sad country song"
"A fool on a stool is still a stool, right or wrong"
"Pride is a bandito breaking hearts as he goes"
"Vaya con dios" said the old vaquero

I walked over to the corner, turned the old jukebox on
When I turned back around like a ghost he was gone
So I paid his tab, called a cab, called it a night
And came straight home to you
As we laid there in bed I told you all the things he said
We laughed, we cried, and I held you the whole night through
You know I think of him often, out there all alone
Maybe he was an angel, or just an old man from San Anton

He said, "Don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun"
"Don't argue with a woman while she's holding a gun"
"Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes"
"Vaya con dios"

He said, "Don't live you life like a sad country song"
"A fool on a stool is still a stool, right or wrong"
"Pride is a bandito breaking hearts as he goes"
"Vaya con dios" said the old vaquero
He said, "Vaya con dios"
