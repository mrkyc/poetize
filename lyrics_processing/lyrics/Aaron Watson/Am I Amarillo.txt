If you don't care, I'd like the rocking chair
It would mean a lot to me, it kinda fits me perfectly
And that picture book from those trips we took
I'd like to keep a few keepsakes to help when my heart aches

So let me put it all out on the table
Girl, I've got my suitcase by the door
You just say the word and I'll be long gone
If home ain't where your heart is anymore
You know I could be there by the morning
So long, adios San Antonio
Am I right or wrong?
Am I moving on?
Am I Amarillo?

Pack the garage, saddle up the Dodge
Fix the horse trailer taillight and I'll be gone tonight
One last love you, head towards Plainview
Stop and hang with my ol' friend
Get three sheets to that West Texas wind

So let me put it all out on the table
Girl, I've got my suitcase by the door
You just say the word and I'll be long gone
If home ain't where your heart is anymore
You know I could be there by the morning
So long, adios San Antonio
Am I right or wrong?
Am I moving on?
Am I Amarillo?

So baby, let me put it all out on the table
Girl, I've got my suitcase by the door
You just say the word and I'll be long gone

You know I could be there by the morning
