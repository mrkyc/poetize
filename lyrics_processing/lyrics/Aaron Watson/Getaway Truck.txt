They say you never know what you've got till it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair hands in the air
Singing so long good luck
I want to set your heart free
Ride with me
I want to be your getaway
Heart free ride with me
I want to be your getaway truck

1989 Cheyenne Chevrolet
5 speed single cab
Bench seat, faded grey
Turned over twice ain't too nice but it knows how to run
Girl I'll get you out with a bang like a bullet from a gun

They say you never know what you've got till it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair hands in the air
Singing so long good luck
Girl, I want to set your heart free
Ride with me
I want to be your getaway
Heart free ride with me
I want to be your getaway truck

I ain't afraid to get stuck
I got a four wheel drive kinda heart
My love is tough enough to carry any load
