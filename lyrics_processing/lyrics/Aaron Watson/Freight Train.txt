I'm gonna give 'em that two, four, foot on the floor
Like an outlaws boys on the day before
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for
Doin' my thing, singing my song
Right on track I'm chugging along
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train

On a wing and a prayer and a glorified greyhound bus
Flying down the road running 9-0 and kicking up dust
Drinkin' truck stop coffee countin' birds on those telephone wires
Burnin' the midnight oil and the tread off these old goodyear tires

I'm gonna give 'em that two, four, foot on the floor
Like an outlaws boys on the day before
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for
Doin' my thing, singing my song
Right on track I'm chugging along
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train
See Aaron Watson LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
And sometimes my mind is a million miles away
I know you're sound asleep at home while I'm on this stage
And I'm missing you wishing I was kissing you everyday
But girl I gotta keep rollin', rollin' like an old freight train
And its a mighty lonesome sound when there's not soul around
To help you ease your pain ,but you gotta keep rollin'
Rollin' like an old freight train

I'm gonna give 'em that two, four, foot on the floor
Like an outlaws boys on the day before
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for
Doin' my thing, singing my song
Right on track I'm chugging along
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train

Comin' on down the line
Feel that diesel engine whine
Smell the smoke stack
Hear the gears grind
Full steam ahead
Halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back
Going clickity clack down the railroad tracks
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train
Just like an old freight train
