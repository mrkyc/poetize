Well it's pretty much understood
Rainy days are just no good for leaving
No need in mixing misery and gin
So it goes for icy days
Heartache and slick highways
No time to wait, you're gonna break if you bend and bend again

But a fresh new start
Will warm your heart
Like the sun breaking through a cloudy sky

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Bye bye
Bye bye

No need in naming names
Players love playing games
And he played your heart like a little violin
It's a brand new rhyme and riddle
It's your turn to play that fiddle
And that same old song and dance is coming to an end

'Cause a fresh new start
Will warm your heart
Like the sun breaking through a cloudy sky

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Bye bye
Bye bye
If he really wants a goodbye kiss
He must be out of his ever-loving mind
Yeah if he really wants a goodbye kiss
You tell him to go kiss it where the sun don't shine

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry

You're out like a light, like a red-eye flight
Like two tail lights in the dust of midnight
He's out of mind, you're out of sight
That ship has sailed, that ship don't fly
You're gone like a train, like a west-bound train
With a one-way ticket, drinking cheap champagne
Flush it down the drain 'cause there's no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
