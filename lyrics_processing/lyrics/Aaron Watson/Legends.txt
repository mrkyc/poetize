Willie's riding shotgun, Wayon's sleepin' in the back
Billy Graham is preaching about Jesus Christ with the Man in Black
Lennon's talking politics, Dylan's mumblin' on his phone
Ol' Kristofferson says turn it up Merle that's a Tom Petty song
Yeah

No, Elvis ain't dead, he just got tired of the velvet and the press
He's hangin' out with Emmylou and Gram Parsons on a boat out in Key West
And speaking of Memphis, the best blues band in town
Plays every Tuesday night, Stevie Ray and Jimmy tune it up and burn it down

Just like my heroes I'm as free as the wind
Singing those old songs just like they did back then
Some are here and some are gone
Old habits die hard and legends live on and on

Somebody said they saw Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain
At a little dive thirty miles outside the east side of LA
Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper
Are all hangin' out at Night Hawks drinking whiskey with Eddie Hopper

Just like my heroes I'm as free as the wind
Singing those old songs just like they did back then
Some are here and some are gone
Old habits die hard and legends live on and on and on
Legends live on

I had dream one night, one day I was at this South Texas cafe
Playing 42 with Townes Van Zandt and Ernest Hemmingway
We had Hank on the jukebox, burning that pipe tobacco slow
My ol' man chimed in and said "Kids these days need to dig deeper to find their soul"
Can I get an amen?
Dig deeper to find your soul
Better pick up that shovel and get to work

Just like my heroes I'm as free as the wind
Singing those old songs just like they did back then
Some are here, some are gone
Old habits die hard and legends live on and on
Just like my heroes I'm as free as the wind
Singing those old songs just like they did back then
Some are here and some are gone
Old habits die hard and legends live on and on and on
