Defying odds, I'm defying gravity
Rising above all the negativity
I've got a long list of things that they said I couldn't do
I didn't know I couldn't fly therefore I flew
So, I scratch and claw, chisel and chip
With a heart-shaped hammer and a good firm grip
Keep on swinging, climbing those charts
Sharing that soul 'til you're touching those hearts

I don't wanna waste even one breath
Don't wanna waste time being scared to death
So take that leap of faith
Go and shake your fear of flying
'Cause if you don't believe then you won't
So keep on losing until you don't
You know you get just what you give so
Live or die trying

You gotta work your hands to the bone
And keep your dreams to the grindstone
If it was easy there'd be nothing to it
Daddy said if it was easy everyone would do it
I've had doors slammed in my face
I know well the taste of last place
You get back up fighting when you fall
The worst thing you can do is do nothing at all

I don't wanna waste even one breath
Don't wanna waste time being scared to death
So take that leap of faith
Go and shake your fear of flying
'Cause if you don't believe then you won't
So keep on losing until you don't
You know you get just what you give so
Live or die trying

'Cause you know fame is just a name that's gonna fade away
Long to be forgotten once it's chiseled on your grave
Fortune is a frame of mind so don't sell your soul
There ain't no luggage rack when it comes your time to go
Say a prayer for the weary, broken-hearted and the poor
Say a prayer for the rich and greedy always wanting more
Make a wish upon a star, blow a kiss up to the moon
And live your life for those who got their wings too soon

I don't wanna waste even one breath
Don't wanna waste time being scared to death
So take that leap of faith
Go and shake your fear of flying
If you don't believe then you won't
So keep on losing until you don't
You know you get just what you give so
Live or die trying
You know you get just what you give so
Live or die trying
