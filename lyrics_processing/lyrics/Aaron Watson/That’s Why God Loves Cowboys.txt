He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Someone who knows the blessings of a good hard rain
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
Soft as the wind, yet bold enough to bless his name

That's why God loves cowboys, I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tendin', the fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all its creations
From the horses they ride to those broken hearted honky tonk angels
Oooooh
That's why God loves cowboys

He knew they'd need room to breathe and freedom
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies
He was there when he heard those prayers coming from Cheyenne
Right beside that young man on his last ride

That's why God loves cowboys, I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tendin' and the fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all its creations
From the horses they ride to those broken hearted honky tonk angels
Ooooooh
That's why God loves cowboys

Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than the love of a woman to weather life's storm

That's why God loves cowgirls, I believe there's a place in his heart

From the horses they ride to those broken hearted honky tonk heros
