Well, that golden halo doesn't go so well
With my red bandana and blue jeans
God knows when I'm good, I'm good
And when I'm good, it's seldom, so it seems
So they say fools play with fire
I'm trying my best to not get burned
While I soak myself in gasoline
One would think by now I might have learned
But I've never learned

No, I'm not the man they think I am
It weighs heavy on my heart and mind
Yes, I stumble every step along the way
Like a wino who can't walk the line
It's like tightrope walking on a windy day
There's heaven in her eyes and hell to pay
And I'm solid as a rock and sink in sand
Trying like the devil to be a good man

So beware of broken glass
Should you stare into the window of my soul
And judge me not, I'll only bare it all
So you know that you are not alone
You're not alone

Oh my God
Feed me the crumbs that fall upon your floor
As those saints walk through your pearly gates
Lord, let the sinner crawl through your backdoor
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

No, I'm not the man they think I am

As I stumble every step along the way

Trying like the devil to be a good man
