Yeah, this one goes out to the dreamer always out there aiming high
Don't you let 'em clip your wings or say that you can't fly
This one goes out to the loser losing time and time again
And time again keeps on believing that someday they're gonna win
When nobody knows your name, nobody knows your face
Everybody counts you out long before you start that race
You can let 'em place their bets, let 'em laugh and drink their wine
Let 'em eat their words when you're first to the finish line

Today's your day in the sun, you're rolling like a young gun
Now it's your time to ride, let your dark horse run
They can't measure your heart, they can't tear you apart
You're finally catching your stride, let your dark horse run
Through the fire and barbed wire
You're a runaway train, there's no turning back

This one goes out to the girls, go show the world you can
Never let 'em hold you back just because you aren't a man
This one goes out to those underdogs who aren't afraid to bite
Change the game, break the chain, get off that porch and fight

Today's your day in the sun, you're rolling like a young gun
Now it's your time to ride, let your dark horse run
They can't measure your heart, they can't tear you apart
You're finally catching your stride, let your dark horse run
Through the fire and barbed wire
You're a runaway train, there's no turning back

I rode into town with a dream and a song
But they told me that I just don't belong
And the fable of a label that stomped on my heart
Added fuel to the fire, added soul to my art
So I went back home like all those outlaw boys
Bought a van, got a band, making my brand of noise
So, I built with my hands my own destiny
And I became what they said that I couldn't be
I got a chip on my shoulder, but it doesn't weigh me down
I got a chip on my shoulder, but it doesn't weigh me down
I got a chip on my shoulder, but it doesn't weigh me down
It whispers "Get back up" when I get knocked on the ground

Today's your day in the sun, you're rolling like a young gun
Now it's your time to ride, let your dark horse run
They can't measure your heart, they can't tear you apart
You're finally catching your stride, let your dark horse run
Through the fire and barbed wire
You're a runaway train, there's no turning back
Let your dark horse run
Through the fire and barbed wire
You're a runaway train there's no turning back
Let your dark horse run
Let your dark horse run
