They would put me in bed, tuck me in tight
Say my prayers, kiss my hand, make me feel safe at night
Walking out, holding hands, barely crack my door
Turn the Opry on and waltz across the floor
I'd sneak over to the light and I'd take a peek
They kept dancing all night even if the signal got weak

I can still see your
Ooh, silhouettes swaying across the wall
Ooh-ooh, no, we didn't have much
Then again, we had it all
They made that little house a home
Full of heart and soul
Just like a love song on country radio

They could sing 'em all, two-part harmony tune
Like Loretta and Conway, Johnny and June
I could hear mama laughing as daddy swept her off her feet
You know the sound of love has never sounded so sweet
And thirty years later, I've got three kids and my wife
Their love songs, a legacy, the soundtrack of my life

I can still see your
Ooh, silhouettes swaying across the wall
Ooh-ooh, no, we didn't have much
Then again, we had it all
They made that little house a home
Full of heart and soul
Just like a love song on country radio

Ooh-ooh

And they'll sneak over to the lights
And they'll take a peek
And we'll keep dancing all night
Even when the signal gets weak

And someday they'll see
Ooh, silhouettes swaying across the wall
Ooh-ooh, no, we didn't have much
Then again, we had it all
They made that little house a home
Full of heart and soul
Just like a love song on country radio

Silhouettes swaying across the wall
No, we didn't have much
Then again, we had it all
Ooh-ooh
