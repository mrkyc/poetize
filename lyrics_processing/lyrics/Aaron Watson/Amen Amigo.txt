We sat beneath that ol' Dos Equis neon light
That stucco wall has stories we'll never tell
Jimmy spent three days in that ol' Mexican jail
The boys of summer disappeared that fall
As the years flew by, we grew up after all
Real life is running and gunning to no end
It's time we take it on back, way back to way back when
Can I get an amen amigo hey why don't we go
Check out the world somewhere south of the Rio
Bring the girls, have a ball, up all night, no last call
Then sleep in until ten, wake up and do it all again
Good friends are good for the soul, can I get an amen amigo
I miss ol' Ma Crosby's Restaurant and Bar
I miss the queso and the guaco and those gut string guitars
It's time we load that hitch, it's time we ditch this town
Set sail before the sun goes down
Can I get an amen amigo, hey why don't we go
Check out the world somewhere south of the Rio
Bring the girls, have a ball, up all night, no last call
Then sleep in until ten, wake up and do it all again
Good friends are good for the soul, can I get an amen amigo

I miss those cheap sunshades, I miss those flip-flop feet
I wanna go back there, I wanna cast that reel
Wanna hear my brown-eyed girl sing Margaritaville
Can I get an amen amigo, hey why don't we go
Check out the world somewhere south of the Rio
Bring the girls, have a ball, up all night, no last call
Then sleep in until ten, wake up and do it all again
Good friends are good for the soul, can I get an amen amigo
Can I get an amen amigo, hey why don't we go
Check out the world somewhere south of the Rio
Bring the girls, have a ball, up all night, no last call
Then sleep in until ten, wake up and do it all again
Good friends are good for the soul
I'm saying good friends are good for the soul
Let me tell you good friends are good for the soul
Can I get an amen amigo
