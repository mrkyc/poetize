I've been heart broken, broke down
Hard up and hard fought
Misunderstood, misguided
And I've missed by a longshot
I understand firsthand
I've been where you been
Don't you forget
Every sunset will become a sunrise soon again
So be bold and be brave
And beware of those schemes
Stay razor sharp and find your mark
As you go chase your dreams
Watch out for those dangers
Always dancing in the dark
When the shadows of the nights shoot out the lights
I know you'll be the spark

So promise me before you go
Follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back and let it fly

Good things come to those who pray
So don't you chalk it up to chance
And never let your arrow be led by arrogance
Fill your quiver full of courage
Show this world you're heaven sent
Keep a good head on your shoulders
Every arrow needs a fine piece of flint

So promise me before you go
Follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back
And let it fly on the wings of an angel
Let it fly with the grace of a dove
Through the lightning and thunder
Never aimlessly wander
Let it fly with kindness and love
Let it fly with kindness and love
Let it fly
Let it fly
Promise me before you go, follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back and
Promise me before you go, follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back and let it fly

So stand firm in your faith as you raise up your bow
