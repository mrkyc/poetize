Told you I'm moving on to bigger and better things
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on, and on, and on

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I've changed like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messin' with these LA girls?

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls
(What?)

I miss the days we'd take the Greyhound to NYC (NYC, ooh)
Wish I could've seen that it was perfect how it was (Listen)
I don't want this to be the way you remember me
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong (Ooh)

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world (Only you in my world)
But you say that I've changed like the East Coast weather (Oh)
How the hell did I get caught up (Caught up)
Messin' with these LA girls?

Here we go messin' with these LA girls

One, two, three
Talk to me like, ah-ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh (Oh-oh), ooh-ooh
Quit messin' with me, baby
Ah-ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, (Oh-oh), ooh-ooh
(Da da da da da da da)
