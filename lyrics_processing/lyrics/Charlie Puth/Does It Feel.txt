Tell me lies like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone (Yeah)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better? Whoa
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

Ain't no way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
There ain't no way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone (Don't hang up the phone)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
You might also like
