Oh, the way that you dance on me makes me not wanna leave
You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
Oh, right now, we're in a rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery (Hey!)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

Ooh, girl, do you think they'll notice if we slip away?
Maybe tomorrow, they'll all have something to say
Oh, right now, we're in the rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate (Oh-oh)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (Me and you) and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room ('Nother room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (Me and you) and these empty cups

All of these empty cups
Baby, all of these empty cups

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (Me and you) and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room ('Nother room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (Me and you) and these empty cups
(On your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you)
All of these empty cups
(If you wanna like I wanna, let me take you to another room, oh, baby)
Like it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen (Television up)
(No one listening)
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
