One, two, three, four
Ooh, oh, yeah

Why are we lookin' down on our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love all that we got? Mmm
Don't we know everyone's got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together, we can make that change

Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around, oh-oh, oh
What a waste, another day
Another good one dyin'
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can't we just get along?
If lovin' one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can't we just get along? Mmm

What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothin'
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

I know we could break apart
We don't have to go that way
Not today, ooh

Yeah, why can't we just get along?
If lovin' one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to get close to ya? (Oh, oh)
