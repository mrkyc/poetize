I said this time next year
I'ma be the one who do everything and more
You said, "I couldn't do", this one's for you
And this time next year, I'm gonna be stronger
A little bit taller, top is my only view (One, two, Scooby-Doo-Doo)

I'm kickin' in the door now, better get out my way
Never really saw me comin', you left with nothing to say
This for everybody who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes and take a good look at me now

Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

This time next year, I'ma walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see, gonna see me
And I'ma call every girl that turned me down and tell 'em now that I'm just too busy
'Cause I don't have the time

And it's funny how my so-called friends who've always left me alone
Are suddenly running into me and blowin' up my phone
You might also like
I'm kickin' in the door now, better get out my way
Never really saw me comin', you left with nothing to say
This for everybody who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes and take a good look at me now

Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh, baby
Take a good look at me now
(Take a good look at me now, now, now)
Take a good look at me now

Oh, look at me now
Whoa, this one is dedicated to all of the people who said I would be nothing
Just look at me now, look at me now, look at me now

I'm kickin' in the door now, better get out my way
Never really saw me comin', you left with nothing to say
This for everybody who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes and take a good look at me now

Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
