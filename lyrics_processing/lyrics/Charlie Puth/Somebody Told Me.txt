I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, "Who is that, babe?"
And the way you said, "Nobody"
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been givin' it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now, you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that
You were my girl (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You might also like
Lately, you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't addin' up
But I just go blind when you look into my eyes
Every time that I try to confront you (To confront you)
There's always somewhere you gotta run to (Gotta run to)
The warning signs
They were more than just warning signs (Oh-oh-oh)

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love (You were half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

('Cause) Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now, you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that
You were my girl (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were my girl
Maybe I should have noticed (Ooh)
You were just half in love (Ooh, you were half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
That I'm not the only one (You were my girl)
Yeah
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you (Believed you)
You were my girl (My girl)
Somebody saw you with him
Now, you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend (Ooh)
Can't believe I believed that (Believed that)
You were my girl
'Cause you were mine (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Hey, you were my girl
Maybe I should have noticed (Ooh, ooh)
You were just half in love (You were just half in love)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
