I got a situation, this girl been stressin' me
Sayin' she better be the only one (Ah)
My life is complicated, she's only twenty-three
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over
The harder she makes it to go
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to (Ooh, ooh)

She knows just what she doin', she f**kin' with my head
Wrappin' her legs so tight around my waist, ah
Two in the afternoon, but we still ain't out of bed
No matter what, she always gets her way

Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over (Whoa)
The harder she makes it to go (You make it so hard)
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work (Oh)
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to (Ooh, ooh)
Even though I want to (Ooh, ooh), oh-oh, yeah

You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
You've got to slow it down
You don't know what you're doin' to me now
You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
Oh
You've got to slow it down
Oh

Girl, you gotta slow it down (Slow down, yeah, yeah)
(Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you (I'm not tryna fall, baby)
Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down, ooh)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to (Ooh, ooh, woo)
