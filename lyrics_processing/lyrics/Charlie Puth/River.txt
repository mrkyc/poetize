Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me, river, river, no
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me, river, river

Look, you can play it cool
Act like you don't care
But, river, don't be cruel
You're pushin' me away
Don't want to get hurt
So you hurt me first
With the words you say

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
From our love (Run, run)
You might also like
Look, darlin', don't give up
When the water's rough
Where you gonna go?
My heart is your home
But nothin' is as cold
As runnin' on your own
So, river, don't you rush

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
From our love (Run, run)
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me, river, river, no
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me, river, river, no
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me, river, river, no
Don't run from me, river

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Oh, river (River, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
Don't run (River, river)
From our love (Run, run)
Oh, river (River, river)
(Don't run from me, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
(Don't run from me, river, river, no)
Don't run (River, river)
(Don't run from me, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
(Don't run from me, river, river)
Oh, river (River, river)
(Don't run from me, river)
Don't run (Run, run)
(Don't run from me, river, river, no)
Don't run (River, river)
(Don't run from me, river)
From our love (Run, run)
