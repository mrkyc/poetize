I got these girls tryna lock me down
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

Now, I don't know where to go
After you loved me this way
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay? Oh

You tell me I'm too young, but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the '90s
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Ooh)
You might also like
You told me you needed a perfect guy
That'll make your parents proud
Guess you still ain't found him yet (Why?)
'Cause we're still messin' around (Oh)
And now, you watch me put in all this work
Just to say it won't work out (Work out)
You never took me seriously (Took me seriously)
Now, what the hell is that about?

Now, I don't know where to go (After you loved me this)
After you loved me this way (After you loved me so)
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay? Oh

You tell me I'm too young, but (Young, but)
I gave you what you wanted (What you wanted)
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me (Beside me)
'Cause I was born in the '90s (In the '90s)
Baby, how dare you treat me just like (Just like)
Like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Ah, ooh)
Baby, don't you treat me like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Ah, ooh)

Uh, you tell me I'm too young, but (Young, but)
I gave you what you wanted (What you wanted)
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me (Beside me)
'Cause I was born in the '90s (In the '90s)
Baby, how dare you treat me just like (Ooh)
Like a boy (Go and treat me like, hey)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Boy, ooh)
Baby, don't you treat me like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy

Just like, like a boy
