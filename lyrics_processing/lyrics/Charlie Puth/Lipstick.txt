Come and put your lipstick on my neck and my body (My baby)
Just to show these bitches that you're mine (Mmh-ooh)
Lipstick on my collar, show 'em you ain't no hobby (My baby)
You're the one who gets it all the time (Ooh-ooh)

Baby, I think it's time we post a picture
Tell your momma and your sister you got a man
'Cause I'm your man (Yeah)
And lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout the future
We can make it more than rumors
That I'm your man 'cause I'm your man (Yeah)

So you can go ahead and be selfish
Baby, there ain't no reason to be jealous
Yeah, if you really want it, you don't gotta hold your tongue

Come and put your lipstick on my neck and my body (My baby)
Just to show these bitches that you're mine (Mmh-ooh)
Lipstick on my collar, show 'em you ain't no hobby (My baby)
You're the one who gets it all the time (Ooh-ooh)

Baby, I know this might sound kinda crazy, but
What would you want to name the baby?
No, I'm just playin', but I'm just sayin'
The moon, the stars, I'll raise the bar
I stay kissing you in public and holdin' your hand
'Cause I'm your man
You might also like
So you can go ahead and be selfish
Baby, there ain't no reason to be jealous
Yeah, if you really want it, you don't gotta hold your tongue (Yeah)

Come and put your lipstick on my neck and my body (My baby)
Just to show these bitches that you're mine (Mmh-ooh)
Lipstick on my collar, show 'em you ain't no hobby (You ain't no hobby)
You're the one who gets it all the time (Baby, no, ooh-ooh)

Listen
I've been wantin' to say this for a long time now
And it feels like, ah
It feels like the only way I can do it is

You got the kind of lips that I like (Sing it)
Tell me, do you wanna taste?
Don't you know that you're not the type that's only one night, no?
Baby, I can make you stay
One more time, you got the kind of lips that I like (Sing it)
Tell me, do you wanna taste?
Don't you know that you're not the type that's only one night, no?
Baby, I can make you stay
Everybody, now
Come and put your lipstick on my neck and my body (You're my baby)
Just to show these bitches that you're mine (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
Lipstick on my collar, show 'em you ain't no hobby (My baby)
You're the one who gets it all the time (I wanna, wanna say it one more time)
Come and put your lipstick on my neck and my body (My baby)
Just to show these bitches that you're mine (Mmh-ooh)
Lipstick on my collar, show 'em you ain't no hobby (My baby)
