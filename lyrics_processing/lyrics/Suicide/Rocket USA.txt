Shooting on down, I'm on my way
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's nineteen hundred seventy seven
Whole country is doing a fix
It's doomsday, doomsday
Ah
Riding around, riding high
Riding around with my babe
Riding around in my Chevy '69
Speeding down the skyway, ooh
Speeding down the skyway, ooh
Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down, on my way
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's doomsday, doomsday
Ah, c'mon
Speeding down the skyway
One hundred miles per hour
Gonna crash
Gonna die
Ooh yeah
And I don't care
