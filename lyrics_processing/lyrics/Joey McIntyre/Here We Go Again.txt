That this has come to an end
Just when I thought I was out
They pulled me back in
It always happens like this
Just when I start to forget
I try it on all over again
And it fits so perfect
Back in headlights
In the paper
Hangin' on, he's such a loser
When is that kid ever gonna grow up?
No, I don't wanna grow up
Here we go again
I'm a man on a mission baby
Here we go again
Are you gonna be there for me now?
Here we go again
La, la, la, la
Here we go again
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we, here we go again
Here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
You might also likeI don't know if this is for me
Am I at the wrong party?
If I am, I'm not gonna leave
Cos it's screaming my name
Back in headlights
See what he did?
Coming up, he's such a cool kid
No, that boy won't ever give up
I'll never give up
Here we go again
I'm a man on a mission baby
Here we go again
La, la, la, la
Here we go again
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we, here we go again
Here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
I think it's time to get out of here
No one seems to know me now
Then you push me back and you push me forward
To where I wanna go
Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Here we go again
I'm a man on a mission baby
Here we go again
La, la, la, la
Here we go again
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we, here we go again
Here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
La, la, la, la
Here we go again
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we, here we go again
Here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
Here We Go Again X4
