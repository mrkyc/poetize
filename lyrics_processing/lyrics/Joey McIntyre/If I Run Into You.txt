Probably say that everything is okay
Say I met someone knew, it's really going well
Funny I should see you today
And I'd tell ya all the things I got going on
Working on a deal for my new hit song
Even though it really shouldn't matter too much to me
If I run into you, If I run into you
Yeah here's what I'd do
I'd say, "Listen I'm having a really crazy week
And I can't talk right now, but I'm glad we're doing
Our own thing 'cause I think it's best for us, don'tcha think?"
See ya!
Wouldn't wanna be ya
If I run into you, here's what I'd do
Probably put on my shades, and act real cool
And I wouldn't understand a thing you say...
Like, "I want it that way."
And you'd tell me all the things you got going on
Found a new man and he turns you on
Even though it really doesn't matter too much to me
If I run into you, If I run into you
Yeah here's what I'd do
I'd say, "Wow you're looking kinda different
You do something funky with your hair?
...and that tattoo? oh, it's temporary?!"
