NYC girls
They're the P.Y.T.s of the world
If you get an NYC girl
Better keep that girl in your world
On Delancy street, out on Houston steet
All the girls you meet knock you off your feet
New York City is where I wanna be
When I look at you on 5th Avenue
Oh you look so fine gettin' on your groove
You're so New York no place l'd rather be
And all the little girls say what they wanna be
(Chorus)
All the girls I found come from all around
But the best I've had come from this here town
New York City is where I wanna be
And all the little girls say what they wanna be
Stand clear of the closing doors
Gotta get going gotta go for yours
Everybody try to get inside
Do what'cha gotta do to stay alive
Stand clear of the closing doors
Gotta get going gotta go for yours
You might also like"where's this train going man, ya gotta understand
I gotta see a girl, she's my biggest fan
I gotta see her on the west side
She's got the 9-5 and she looks so fly...
So, buddy tell me where I gotta go
Is it the A, the B, the C, the J, the M, the Z, the N, the R...
It ain't too far to where I gotta go
To see this girl who sweats me so"
Stand clear of the closing doors
Gotta get going gotta go for yours
NYC girls...
(chorus)
All these New York girls come from all around
From the San Fran shores to Boston town
In every girl there's a little NYC
And all the little girls say what they wanna be
NYC Girls
NYC
NYC
What I do for New York City girls
