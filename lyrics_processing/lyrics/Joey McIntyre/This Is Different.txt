You're driving me mental
My mind got me on the run
Coz you're so special
I walk around singing your name in my songs
I've been looking for a girl for so long
Someone who looks and act just like you
Well I was younger I had them coming through the backdoor
Then I found my lovers on the dance floor
Now I'm older and I'm looking for something more (This is different)
Girl I know I your bigger than Madonna
To be you boyfriend it would be a honour
My friends say I'm crazy but baby I know
This is different
Hit me baby one more time
And move your body, closer can't you read my mind
Now you've got me
I know about your ex and money he made
He was singing my songs in the 3rd grade
So glad you finally said bye- bye Oh.....
Girl I know I your bigger than Madonna
To be you boyfriend it would be a honour
My friends say I'm crazy but baby I know
This is different

I will wait, for you to be my lover
This time may just might be my last
I begin now
Slow down, lets not go to fast
Girl I know you're bigger than Madonna
To be you boyfriend it would be a honour
My friends say I'm crazy but baby I know
This is different
Well I was younger I had them coming though the back door (all day long)
Then I found my lovers on the dance floor
Now I'm older and I'm looking for something more (Looking for something more)
Girl I know I your bigger than Madonna
To be you boyfriend it would be a honour
My friends say I'm crazy but baby I know (I know I ain't crazy)
Well I was younger I had them coming through the backdoor
Then I found my lovers on the dance floor
But baby believe me when I say
