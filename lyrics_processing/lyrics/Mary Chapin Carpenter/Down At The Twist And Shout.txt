Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was going to go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets
Because I'm never going to come back home

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight
See Mary Chapin Carpenter LiveGet tickets as low as $652You might also like
They got a alligator stew and a crayfish pie
A Gulf storm blowing into town tonight
Living on the delta's quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
But here up north it's a cold cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says, "BeauSoleil is coming into town"
Baby let's go down

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 1910
You going to feel a little bit young again
Well you learned to dance with your rock and roll
You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-do-do
When you hear a little Jolie Blon
Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
