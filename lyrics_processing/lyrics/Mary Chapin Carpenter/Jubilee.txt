I can tell by the way you're walking
That you don't want company
Well, I'll let you alone
And I'll let you walk on
And in your own good time you'll be
Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree
And with all of them made
We'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go
There's only so long
You can take it all on
And then the wrongs gotta be on its own
And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see
Is the wreckage and rust
That you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear
Your name being called
Like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears
They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were just up to me
I'd take hold of your hand
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name
That you haven't been able
To come to the table
Simply glad that you came
And when you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea
Just scanning the night
For that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears
That it's habit alone
That keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here
Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree
May we all be considered
Then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee
Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be
When we look back and say
Those were halcyon days
