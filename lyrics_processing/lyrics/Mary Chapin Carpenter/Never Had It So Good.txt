No one's got to tell me it's over
I could see it from miles away
No one's got to tell me
What I don't already know today
No one's got to tell me they've seen you
On the town with an old girlfriend
No one's got to tell me
You look like you've fallen in love again

'Cause you're out of my life now
With a wave of her hand
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad
Now you can do what you want to
And never feel sad
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad

No one's got to tell me the difference
Between me and the one who's returned
No one's got to tell me
You never really got over her
No one's got to tell me they've seen you
Looking like a brand new man
No one's got to tell me
You look like you've fallen in love again

'Cause you're out of my life now
With a wave of her hand
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad
Now you can do what you want to
And never feel sad
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad

So you just go where you go
And do what you do
And be who you want to be
But when she burns you again
And your phone doesn't ring
Baby, it's me

'Cause you're out of my life now
With a wave of her hand
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad
Now you can do what you want to
And never feel sad
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad
You never had it so good, babe
I never had it so bad
You never had it so good, babe
