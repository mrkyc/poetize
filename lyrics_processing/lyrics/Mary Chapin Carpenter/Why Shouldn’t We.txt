We believe in things that we cannot see
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Hands that heal can set a chained man free
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
And we believe in peace within every heart
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Burning brightly, brightly in the dark
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling, feel your spirits rise
Come on children, open up your eyes
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate
Allah hears your prayers, it's not too late

And we believe in things that will give us hope
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Let your voice be heard, celebrate your vote
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling, feel your spirits rise
Come on children, open up your eyes
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate
Allah hears your prayers, it's not too late

We believe in things that make us all the same
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Love belongs to all, in deed and name
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
And we believe in things that can't be done
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Lift up your heart, put down your gun
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
We believe in things we're told that we can't change
Why shouldn't we?
We had heroes once and we will again
Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling
Come on children
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate
Allah hears our prayers, it's not too late
So come on darling, feel your spirits rise
Come on children, open up your eyes
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate
Allah hears your prayers, it's not too late
