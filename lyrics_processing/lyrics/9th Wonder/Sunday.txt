Man, I never liked Monday
She was always too stressful for me
Tuesday was cute, Wednesday was the real freak
Hump day, you know what I'm sayin'?
Keep in the Rolodex
Thursday, she was fine, but I always wanted to jump off for Friday and Saturday
But God introduced me to Sunday
And I knew Sunday was special

On Sundays
I always
Like to watch the ballgames
And stay all day
Ch-ch-chilling at the park with
A couple of my homies
Watchin' people walkin'
Everybody's talkin', laughin' (runnin')
It's funny
Who you bump in-to when you take the long way
Everybody's hungry, propane's got the grill smokin'
It feels like a 100
But it's okay
It's lovely (how we) that way (until) Sunday

We at the car wash, trippin'
Got the chrome wheels, spinnin'
Lemonade, we sippin'
All the kids, skippin'
Granny is cookin'
Can't wait till Sunday
Parlay, all day
Sunday

The pool is open
Makes me wanna jump in, call my peeps and they are comin'
It's gon' be on and poppin', music's playin', heads are bobbin'
We sippin' on some Kool-Aid
Everything is everything
It's just like the old days
With your family
Celebrate, you work all week, it's time for a break
Kick back and, relax your feet, pass the cornbread
Collard greens and chicken, stand outside and smell the kitchen
We gon' be dancin' (soon as) you turn (on that) music

That's when it all goes down
Super Bowl barbeques, friends and family around
God's day off, six days of puttin' in work
Hear a word from the pastor at the A.M.E. church
It's such a beautiful day out, I'm dressed to the nines
Walkin' down Fordum Road every lady's a dime
(On Sundays) I give my momma a call
Let her know I'm doin' alright, no problems at all
(You got your rent paid) Check
(Your lights on) Yup
You taught me how to walk so I ain't missin' a step
I'm a grown man now with a bad case of Mondays
Steady reminiscing on an old Easter Sundays
New clothes, hard boiled eggs, Easter baskets
Wishin' I could go back and relive the classics
Oh well, them days are done
But hey, I can't complain there's more Sunday's to come
Ya know?
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days, I sit and wish I was a kid again

We at the car wash, trippin'
Got the chrome wheels, spinnin'
Lemonade, we sippin'
All the kids, skippin'
Granny is cookin'
Can't wait till Sunday
Parlay, all day
