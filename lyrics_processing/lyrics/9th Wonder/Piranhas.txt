Yo wassup
Yo man, you're biters, all your homeboys are biters
Y'all wack, so what's up with that?
Man what are you talking about I never stole no moves from you
All your moves ain't worth the pit
So what's up with that? Punk

Man, these cats drama like the plot you find in soap ops
I watch 'em fuss and fight to stand up on the soap box
Y'all understand cause you probably know piranhas
Same biters do the same shit, probably up on your block

A bunch of no nah's, get it? Nonna's
That means they don't know shit, plus they pockets don't got no guap
They feel me cause I'm really just the man that pappy made
Cassius Clay, Brooklyn freshly motor, pape mache
If 9th is 9th that's aight just call me 10th Won
I quote the Bible or some Biggie now and then but
Real is real, y'all got Mr October
I'm colder than the day they celebrating in December
I'm not a freshman, more like a X-Men
War dog for stories and stories you should invest in
I be good in DC where Bably calls the shots
Or a mile up the street where there's crack up in they socks
Badder than you was to get a slapping from your pops
Fresher than that reefer that you stashing in your crops
If you aren't familiar ask them rappers that you biting
From Cali out to Brighton I'm so strapping that they jock

I'm at home bench pressing the floor
Build muscle off the carpet, you wish you had the heart for this
But you were dead wrong, arrest cardiac cards black
Call spades, holler dominoes, the tables break
I pray in safe while they gamble high stakes
Irate when they break the safe, you should've played it safe
You should've stayed awake, ha but the game's got a Lord you never seen
Plus the pole is tryna make a scene
We call it lights, camera, action; acting for the sake of being active
With no motivation plus passion
Passive aggressive, I'm past it
Gas to win sprints, Built of breath control, so go ahead and track it
Carpal tunnel, for the plagiarists
The paragraph that made ya kid indent your whole fucking cranium
Until they hit the stadiums and make it big, and make it with
Or without any route, for the majors, make the paper man
