They got me feelin' like, I gotta get the light
Plate never lookin' lite, Animal appetite

You know the world is ours I kill em with plenty bars
All I do is eat, Remember I used to starve

To get to where we are you gon' need more than a car
They kneeling at my feet they lookin' at a star

These niggas sellin' out, I'm not for sale at all
Sound like they in a drought do anything for some clout

Just tryna build a buzz, light years ahead of cuz
You thought I wouldn't buzz bitch who you thought it was?

They must be trippin' right, can't let these niggas slide
I tell em' kick rocks these niggas must be high

Talkin' Demi Lovato, we a tough act to follow
They never use they heads, these niggas sleepy hollow
You might also like
We celebrating wins, yeah we poppin' bottles
You only live once, you niggas know the motto

I know the motto, I modeled it till there's no tomorrow
They in my shadow like pacifiers and baby bottles

Foot on the throttle, I'm lane switchin' my drive crazy
These other niggas they lack vision they eyes lazy
 
I've been waiting my whole life for this
It's on sight for this, risk my life for this
Know my worth, I might raise my price for this
Ain't no hype for this

Who you know flow better spit shit so clever fuck the weather
Even if the bitch cold won't sweater

Nope never, If I see one imma go get her, she see king got a dream wanna be Coretta
Not in it for the fame bet you still know the name
Crazy what these nigga do for dollar bills and a chain

I keep a bald fade 2 blade with the grain
Its a shame superfly kittyhawk with the plane

I'm up 30,000ft with the world beneath my feet flyin'
Don't try and compete nigga this is elite rhyming

He ain't lying, whether corporate or keep iron
On hill of Lauren from here I can see Zion

3 from the ark shoot 3 through your heart
Niggas bumpin' they gums, we ceasing the talk

Aw, You thought we wasn't gon' connect  no hope with the goat
I promise it ain't a threat

I put the gun to you, I let it sing you a song
It's a duet you know king had to bring me along
True, that's right Swank these other niggas is pawns
We in the building, let these other niggas play on the lawn
It's like
 
I've been waiting my whole life for this
It's on sight for this, risk my life for this
Know my worth, I might raise my price for this
