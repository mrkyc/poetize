Boy, you got me knocked out, laid up, love sick over your love
You got me wondering what the hell I was thinking of
When I was pushing you away with my silly games
And all the while you were trying to say I should have some faith
And now boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name, you got me screaming your name
I'm like boy

Oh boy, love is what you gave me (oh boy)
Oh boy (oh boy), why can't you forgive me
I've changed (I've changed), you'll see it's true
I'm sorry, now I'm being cool

Boy, I got you messed up by these lame ducks that's running around
And so I couldn't see how I hurt the good man I found
You are a blessing and the best thing to come to my life
And it's a shame that it took me so long to realize
I couldn't put my trust in you cause I was afraid
And now I'm begging and I'm praying it's not too late
I'm like boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name, you got me screaming your name
I'm like boy
You might also like
Oh boy, love is what you gave me (oh boy)
Oh boy, why can't you forgive me
I've changed (I've changed, baby I've changed), you'll see it's true
I'm sorry (so sorry), now I'm being cool

So cool lady boo, you are too crazy
Peep the new you, errr, what you been doing lately
Me, I've been maintaining, doing my thing
Though the sunshines but now you had me dancing in the rain
With me being confused with all your dubious ways
Or was it jealousy that fueled all your dubious games
My first thought, she's too cute, I stuck around and played
Fast forward, she's a cuckoo, I had to step away
And regroup the pieces of my sacrifice and change
Cause you can't change a person, they have to see the game
And you just couldn't see it, blinded by my freedom
Girlfriends in your earpiece saying you shouldn't be with him
Had you think-thinking I was cheating
Following the lead of their misery, you should have been the leader
And held me down like 9th on the wheels of the True School
Lady we are too through, now you're being cuckoo

Ooooooh (oh boy, I've changed)
I'm being cool now (and I swear)
I'm being coo-oo-oo-oo-ool (and I swear, and I swear baby)
I'm being cool now (now I'm being cool)
I'm being coooooool (oh boy, oh boy)
I'm being cool now (and I swear, and I swear baaa-aa-aay, yeah-ea-eah)
I'm being coo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Ohhhh-woah-woooah)
I'm being cool now (Ohhhhh, now I'm being cool)
Oh boy (oh boy), love is what you gave me (oh boy)
Oh boy (oh boy), why can't you forgive me
I've changed (I've changed, I've changed), you'll see it's true
I'm sorry (so sorry), now I'm being cool
