(Yo, shorty wop
Come on, man)
Yeah, yeah
You already know, man, for real, man
From the projects, man, all the way to motherfucking
The other side of the world, and shit
You know, 9th Wonder on the track
Big, big boy style, you already know
Louis Rich man

From the Benz to Impalas, a fistful of cash
A bank account, mad thick, quick to hem you and blast
Instead of maxing in the winter, I'm in Japan with my kin
Hydro spraying a blunt, while Duke do the glasses
It's evident we're comical
Quick to change up the slang and bring the beef to you, just like McDonald's do
Fronting raw, sit behind the bulletproof wall
Count my money, go to war, pull out while fucking my brawd
I'm no industry nigga that suck dick
I only write checks, get out of line I'm striking the WIC
Pull a viper out, stunting on the beaches
Ocean pacific gear, shower foxes on in their clich
Run the world with my girl, it's like Sex and the City
Double Aston, rub my dick, fuck with my titties
Yo bitches that love you, that's wonderful, what it do now?
But don't pretend it don't look comfortable
You might also like
(Just pretend) But don't pretend it don't look comfortable
But don't pretend it don't look comfortable
(Just pretend) But don't pretend it don't look comfortable

Ayo, back to blowing holes in the microphone pole
I do it easy, with 41 years of my soul
I run around high, and use it like a lullaby
Gone with the wind, with Asics on my feet, you can smell the Glock
Cousin stay buzzing, from here to Toronto
Then from there to Buenos Aires, sunk in the congo
All kind of colorful brims, trend big, what it do, yeah
You got money? You welcome to share, keep change
Dwell on recollection, reflections for days
And slanging gats in the buildings for sections
Swim through money like I'm Jewish
Cruising around salt waters, flows don't blow through no sewers
You hungry? Hit me on the hip, you smell me?
Fake niggas sitting on my whip, you tell me?
And I got it from here, stay winning, respectable real
Rugby rap on the low, no pretending

Rugby rap on the low, no pretending
Rugby rap on the low, no pretending
Rugby rap on the low, no pretending
Call me Reezy, short for Big Remo
Call up a breezy, tell her to send in 3 more
As in kilos, pies be gambinos
Auto-pilot, I'm on grind, no sleep mode
Auto signing, no diamond, wood piece on
Dezzy underneath arm, in case I gotta beast on em'
You soft like a threechon, pussy get beat on
Cherry street fairy around the way, I'm legendary nigga
Ask around the three-four, I run with the billas
Dealers, killas, llamas, gorillas, pretenders
Fake niggas, you ain't get the memo?
Try to form an alliance with the lion out of Carolina
I can speak for em', the jays that I unleash on em'
And they don't capeesh, they hem'd up to cease
So I respect the street, it's not a game or pretend shit
