Yo
Yo

Know I gotta be the bigger person
Twenty feet over walls, curtains
I stand tall, two and a half Ervings
Julius magic, we made their Merlin
Got me up early here this morning, urgent
Sick, asserting, a family, we birthed it
Turban, wrapped my head around it, Berlin
Walls, you look between our plans and all
Searching for answers whether big or small
Why you want a piece? Bounce, basketball
Have I become old news? Analog
In a digital world, so fashion fall
Out of love, night flights, no gas at all
And 'til we crash, burn, awaiting calls
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
I'm over it, off the wall like Mike
Your attitude's rude, that and all the fights
Tryna figure where you were, away from home last night
Rolodex into memories, recall your type
Once before I met around 2004
I told myself "Dang, yo, never no more
I'm too tall, above average to ever fall short"
Twenty feet, tall as balconies
We over-stand walls, Rap, 9th and E
No lessons, we learn of the birds and bees

My love, what did I do
To make you fall so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A twenty-foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall

Ooh, hey, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Yeah, yeah, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall

My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Then you, you built a wall
A twenty foot wall, so I couldn't see
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
But if I get off my knees
I might recall I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Oh, hey, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Yeah, oh, Lord, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Oh, hey, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, I'm twenty feet tall
