Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life

Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up

Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up

Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh

Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Oh, don't they make you get up
Ah yeah, they make you get up

Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
