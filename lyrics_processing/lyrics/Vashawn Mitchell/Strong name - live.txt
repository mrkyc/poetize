God my God
I know we tried to define you
Attempted to describe you
It's hard to exemplify your word
Even I call you great
And there's nobody greater
But sometimes I just should call upon your name
In your name there's safety and security
And whosoever calls on you can be saved
Oh God, your name has so much strength
Your name alone is strong
(For you are God) You are God
(There's no one like you, you are God) You are God
(Your name is strong, I need you, you are) You are God
(The one and only God) God my God
Heaven and earth shall away
But your name will remain
And every one will declare that you are God
(Yes heaven and earth )
Yes heaven and earth shall pass away
But your name will remain
And everyone will declare that you are God
For you are God (You are God)
Yes you are, yes you are
The one and only God (You are God)
You are God
Your name alone has strength
Your name alone
Your name alone is strong
You are a strong tower
Your name alone has strength
God my God (God my God)
Your name has power
Your name is a strong
Just call his name (God my God)
Your name is a strong tower
Your name is a strong tower
I run in and I am saved
I run in and I am saved
God my God
God my God
Your name alone is strong
Your name alone is strong
Your name is a strong tower
Your name is a strong tower
Yes Lord
I run in and I am saved
I run in and I am Saved
God my God
God my God
God my God
God my God
Your name, it saves
God my God
Your name it, heals
God my God
God my God (God my God)
God my God (God my God)
I will call on your name (God my God)
I will call on your name (God my God)
Your name has power (God my God)
Your name is strong (God my God)
