Oh, running to the church, yeah, you gotta get back
You're gonna miss the show, you're sitting in the front row
Mmm, call your brother up and
Oh, for far too long, I sat around to die
Laying by the pool, drinking rum with dime bags
Mmm, call your brother up and
Mmm, and let him know

Oh, all of your friends are at the cellar door
We're gonna have to get you there before all the beer is gone
Oh, gotta get a dance in
Mmm, before the show
Call your brother up and
Mmm, let him know
Call your brother up and
And let him know

Oh, gonna lift you up 'til our feet don't touch the ground
Let's go tell the others now so we can all float around
Mmm, we'll melt into the night
Oh, I don't wanna be the one to wait around to die
I wanna look up, so I can see the blue sky
See the blue in your eyes

Oh, how many times does it take to get
Your feet back on the ground?
We gonna get down (Get down)
Oh, gotta get a dance in (Gotta get down)
Mmm, before the show
Call your brother up and
Mmm, let him know

If you call me, you will know me
If you call me, I'll be there
If you call me, you will find me
