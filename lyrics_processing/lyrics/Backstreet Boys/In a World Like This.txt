You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm yours
You found me heartbroken, heartbroken
On the floor
Became my salvation, salvation
Through the war, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

In a world like this where some back down
I-I know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I-I know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this when nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you

And now I'm free falling, free falling
In your eyes
You've got me still calling, still calling
No surprise
I never knew I could love 'til the
End of time, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling
By your side
You might also like
In a world like this where some back down
I-I know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I-I know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this when nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you
Yeah, in a world like this

You got me wide open, wide open, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling

Hey-yeah-yeah!
Yeah-yeah!
In a world like, in a world like
'Cause I got you!
In a world like this...

In a world like this where some back down
I-I know we're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I-I know we gotta take it (in a world like this!)
In a world like this where people fall apart (they fall apart)
In a time like this when nothing comes from the heart
(It comes from the heart)
