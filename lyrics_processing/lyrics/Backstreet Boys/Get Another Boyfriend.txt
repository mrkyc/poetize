Get another boyfriend
Backstreet
Check it, huh!
Hey!

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be the last to know
What it's all about?
Let's talk about two
You say he's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know

I'm telling you, he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (come to an end)
Get another boyfriend
You might also like
Let's talk about what ('bout what)
He's done (he's done) to become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds
Pearls or party dresses that turned you on?
I've seen it before, don't take anymore
Free too, you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
STOP acting like you're giving up

I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you're giving up

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
(Must come to an end!)
Get another boyfriend (get another boyfriend)

W-W-W-Why? (yeah)
W-W-W-Why? (get another boyfriend)
W-W-W-Why?
W-W-Why?, STOP!
Hey-yeah-hey-ah!
Hear me out, you must know
(You must know)
What it's all about (baby)
He's just a player in love (oh-oh-oh-oh)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Listen, I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothing that he's worthy of
(Ain't nothing that he's worthy of)
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love (of love!)
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
(Get another, get another boyfriend)
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (come to an end)
