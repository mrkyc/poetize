(Oooh-yeah)
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you (anything)
Anything you want me to
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh) Hey baby

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you (for you)
You might also like
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (see yeah)
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Hey baby, (hey!) hey baby
Hey baby (oh yeah)
Hey baby, (hey baby) hey baby (whoo!)
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to (oh yeah)
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (I can see)
Is all I'm ever gonna need (yeah)
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true, I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you
(I'd go anywhere for you, anywhere)
Anywhere you ask me to (I'll do anything)
I'd do anything for you (oh, whatever you want me to)
Anything you want me to (oh baby, yeah!)
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need

There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
