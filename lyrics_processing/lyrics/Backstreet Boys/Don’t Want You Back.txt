(Do-don't want you back)
Hey-yeah, oh-yeah

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe
But I should've known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
(Do-don't want you back)

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
I-I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blinded so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
(Realize, hey-yeah!)
Like all the hundred-, no, a thousand lies
You might also like
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go (yeah-hey!)
I-I don't want you back (back, no!)
I-I don't want you back (that's right)

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't you back, that's all I know
(Don't want you back, don't want you back)
All I can say, don't want you back
You know you gotta go (oh-oh-oh!)

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
(Don't want you back)
That's all I can say (don't want you back)
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
(Oh, gotta go, oh-oh-oh)
I-I don't want you back
Don't want you back, that's all I know
Back (oh-no), back
That's all I can say
Don't want you back (back, no!)
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go
