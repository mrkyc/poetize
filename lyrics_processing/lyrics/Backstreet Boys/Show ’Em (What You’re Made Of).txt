I've seen it all a thousand times
Falling down, I'm still alive
Am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water's high
No need to swim, I'll learn to fly
So high, so high

You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you

When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for ya
Just show 'em what you're made of

Gloves are off, ready to fight
Like a lion, I will survive
Will I? Will I?
Gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone
Don't be afraid, it's gonna be alright
You might also like
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you (whoa-oh!)

When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for ya
Just show 'em what you're made of

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just show 'em what you're made of
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just show 'em what you're made of

You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of)
When sunlight is fading (oh-oh-oh)
The world will be waiting for ya
(For you, for you)
Just show 'em what you're made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of)

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
