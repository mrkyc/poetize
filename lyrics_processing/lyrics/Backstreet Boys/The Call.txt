"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"W-Wait? Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"

Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
