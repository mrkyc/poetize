You're the one I need
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Hey, baby love, I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute, every hour
My heart is crying out for you
I feel in Heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me
You drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin' and I want it right now
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Oh baby, you're so fine, I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me, you're my ecstasy
You're the one I need
Bang, bang, bang, here we come, here we slam
It's the Fun Factory with the B S B's
Y'all you guys, get on your knees tryin' to scream or touch me, please
Backstreet Boys, are you with it? A J, hit it
Come on, girl, and get down
Smack it up, flip it and move it all around
Here it is if you wanna get with this
Put you at the top of my list, oh
I feel in Heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me, yes
You'll drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin' and I want it right now
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Oh baby, you're so fine, I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips taste so sweet
You're the one for me, you're my ecstasy
You're the one I need
I feel in Heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me, yeah
You'll drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin', baby, and I want it right now
You're the one for me, you're my ecstasy
You're the one I need
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
And move it all around
Get down, get down
