The time has finally come to say my piece (Save)
With the funky hip-hop swing (A funky swing, I might add)
Oh, check it (Uh)
No holding back now
Is the time to get busy
So take me (Haha) to the bridge

I worked hard for mine (I work hard for mine)
Spending all my time (Spending all my time)
To give you what you need (Yeah, come on, come on, come on)

So if you're down with the funky flavor
Throw your hands up
And if you got the fever for Aaliyah
Throw your hands up
And if you down with Blackground
Throw your hands up
And if it got soul, let me see your hands up
If you got bass in your jeep
Throw your hands up
If you're not down with the crack
Throw your hands up
And if you think you're hype enough to swing it
Throw your hands up
And if you're down with the second chapter
Throw your hands up, uh

Take in no shorts when it comes down to shows

So take me to the bridge (Haha)

I worked hard for mine (I work hard for mine)
Spending all my time (Spending all my time)
To give you what you need (Where you at, where you at?)

So if you're down with the P-A
Let me see your hands up
And if your head's bobbing to the track
Throw your hands up
And if you got loot in your pockets
Throw your hands up
And if you're not foul
Let me see your hands up
And if you're protected and you know it
Throw your hands up
And if R. Kelly's record sharp
Let me see your hands up
And if your body's swinging to the track
Throw your hands up
And if you want some more of the flavor
Throw your hands up
