Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give, it can't be replaced
See no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
I wanna please you in anyway I can
I wanna share my world, don't you understand?

Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

Turn me inside out, make my heart speak
Need no one else, you're all I need
Personality and everything you do
Makes me love everything about you
Your smile, your style is so fly, I can't deny
I got a crush on you and that is true indeed
And I'm diggin' you, you make me believe
You might also like
That your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires, oh
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything, 'cause

Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on, and on, and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long, baby
