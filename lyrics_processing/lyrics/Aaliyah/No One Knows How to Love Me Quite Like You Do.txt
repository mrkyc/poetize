No one knows how to love me quite the way you do

'Liyah, you're the only one for me
'Liyah, you're the only one for me
'Liyah, you're the only one for me
The one for me, the one for me

No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do

When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you place my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority

(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
('Cause I like it) 'Cause I like it, babe
Don't stop, 'cause no one knows...
You might also like
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do

When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your paradise

(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
('Cause I like it) 'Cause I like it, babe
Don't stop, 'cause no one knows...

No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do

Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spittin' tracks, as if it was tobacco
It's the 90's, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "buh" you say "-lieve that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you
Uh, forever my man
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do
No one knows how to love me quite like you do

'Liyah, you're the only one for me
'Liyah, you're the only one for me
'Liyah, you're the only one for me
