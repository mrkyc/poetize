As I'm strollin' down the block with really nothin' on my mind
Laid back and I'm just thinkin' of old times
Pop in a Isley Brothers tape and I'm maxin'
Peeping through my side view, checking out my waxin'
Hey, I gotta say
Today's a good day for me to live around the way (ho)
Time to hit the 6-4
And pump the bass at 'em just to let 'em know
Aaliyah's in the house, so I think you'd better check my flow
Hello, hello
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go, from the 1 the 2 and to the 3

Young nation under a groove

Young nation under a groove

I check my cellular because my beeper's beepin'
Booty calls are creepin', fellas on the corner peepin'
Me (wassup); time to set it off
And so I pick up my girls and hit the strip just because
Jazz array hey, it's Saturday and
The sun is blazin', it's so amazin'
And if you are a YNP
And you're rollin' with the BGE
Congratulations
I know I got the skills to make you trip
R Kelly's flipping tracks, so grab a hold and don't you slip
The negative young nation that steps to me gets dealt with
So raise your hands if you're sure
Are you a young nation?

Well, 6 o' clock rolls around and now I'm steppin'
Stop to get some dressin', to the mall I'm flexin'
You know to get them funky croaka-sacks
Tonight I'm hittin' the town, ain't holding nothing back
Hey, well alright
Tonight is the night
Well I'm in the mood for celebration
Or even some jazzy conversation
Hey, it's okay
Here I come, so make way
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the 1 the 2 and to the 3
