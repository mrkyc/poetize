No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do (No)
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you (Of you)
And no way can I forget the things you do, no

You're on my mind all day and night
You're all I'm thinking of
The way you treat me right
My days with you (With you)
Are here no more
We've had some good days
But I know this for sure

No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do, no

We've got a special thing I never could explain
Straight up, the way I feel
It doesn't seem real
(You know) I never hurt you
(So don't go) Don't go nowhere
'Cause you know that this heart
I'll always share
You might also like
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do, no
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
(You're always on my mind)
And no way can I forget the things you do, no

You said your love was true
But I don't see that now
You left me all alone
Broke up this happy home
Why'd ya have to lie?
Why must it be this way?
Well, all I have to say
Is I'm gonna be okay

No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do

My love goes on, and on, and on
My love, on and on, and on
My love goes on, and on, and on
My love, on and on
My love goes on, and on, and on
My love, on and on, and on
My love goes on, and on, and on
My love, on and on
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you (No, no, no, no)
And no way can I forget the things you do
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do
(Got me goin' crazy, baby, baby)
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do
No days go by that I'm not thinking of you (My love, my love)
