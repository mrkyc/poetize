Hmm, it's whatever
It's whatever, yeah
Ooh, oh
Whatever

Just like the birds that whistle in the trees
Hid in the leaves, so happily
Well you're my tree
And through the storms, you've stood strong for me
Kept me warm as can be (Warm as can be)
Like a candy, to an apple
Oh, we go together
You're so sweet on me (Oh, so sweet)
I can say that I do believe this is destiny
It keeps calling me

Now it's me and you (Mmm), you and me
And it's whatever, whatever you want it to be
I'm telling you (I'm telling you)
If it's up to me (Yeah)
Whatever is whatever
It's whatever with you and me
(Whatever, it's whatever)
You might also like
Just like a breeze in the middle of a summer's eve
When you come through
You come for me (Ooh, you come for me)
If I'm a drink, you're my lemon squeeze (Ooh)
Oh, you got flavor boy, you go good with me
So boy, don't play or tease me
Ooh, keep me together
You got what I need
Now it's getting late (Getting late)
It's after three (It's after three)
So quit your stallin', my body's callin', oh

Now it's me and you (Now it's me and you)
You and me (You and me)
And it's whatever, whatever you want it to be
Ooh, I'm telling you (I'm telling you)
If it's up to me, whatever is whatever
As long as it's you and me

Whatever is whatever
So whatever, it's whatever (Whatever)
It's your world (Mmm)
I'll put that on everything, yeah
It's your world (Your world)
Your world, yeah
Oh, now it's me and you (Me and you)
You and me (You and me)
And it's whatever you want it to be (You want it to be)
I'm telling you (Telling you)
If it's up to me (Up to me)
Whatever is whatever (Yeah)
Whatever is whatever, baby (Baby)

Baby (Baby)
Baby (Baby)
