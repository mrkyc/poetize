Hey, yeah
Yeah, hey, yeah
Oh

You wanna handcuff me
But yo, I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy
But yo, I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna wall around me
I swear, I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo, I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)

Incarceration's what I'm facin' when I'm with you
You're watching my every move, tryna to pick up on some clues
Oh, we play twenty questions every time I walk in or out the door
What do you bother for? (What do you bother for?)
Get comfortable, it's yours
It's gonna take (Take) T-R-U-S-T
To keep our L-O-V-E (It's gonna take)
It's gonna take (Take) T-R-U-S-T
To keep our L-O-V-E crackin'
Stressin' and second guessin' me time and time again
We go from lovers back to friends
Got to put this to an end (Hey-yeah)

No justifications for your actions
Should have been somewhere relaxin'
Don't compare me to your last one

A sassy one, I'm a classy one

Seems like that should make you happy, hun
