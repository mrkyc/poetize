You and me got a street thang goin' on

Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever
Cause this thing we've got is very rare, yeah
So don't ever go nowhere
No, because

You and me got
A street kinda thang goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me, so there's no doubt in my mind, no
Boy this love we have is oh so real, oh yes it is
That's why I'm never goin' nowhere, no
Because

You and me got
A street kinda thang goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever
