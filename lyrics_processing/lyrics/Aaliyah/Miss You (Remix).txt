Sup Baby Girl (Ohhh)
Thought I had to talk to you again
Been a long time, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you
Rashad is missing you, your Mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no)
Your Pop is missing you, Dame is missing you
Damn, we missing you ...
 + (Aaliyah)
All we listen to is all the different yous
Four page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party poppin'
We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the Roc
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates? (I miss you)
Well, Dame told me tell you, he's doin' well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you looking over us
Our little angel, but you know what
 + (Aaliyah)
Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you
Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you
Damn, we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview
Now he's dissin' me, 'cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude
'Cause of your memory, I won't bring it to pistols
But he got issues, enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents' pain
But I know God's protecting you
You used to read Seat of the Soul, I know God perfecting you
All the extra hue, the darker texture you are, the more intellectual
You are so professional, our little purple star
Too good for earth you are (I miss you)
 + (Aaliyah)
Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you
D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Kidada's missing you, Shock is missing you
Carline is missing you, Tiny's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

By the way, Big, we missing you, Pac, we missing you
We feel your presence just not in the physical
All across the world, blocks is miserable
Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous
And they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
I swear, in hip-hop, if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more; y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man, tryna follow y'all down memory lane, man
Big, you'd be ashamed to see New York gang bang
Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain
But I guess that's the issue
And it proves how much niggas really miss you
 + (Aaliyah)
Pun we missing you, Big L we missing you
Left Eye we missing you, Jay we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, (Yea) the list goes on
The world is missing you, the hood is missing you
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you) Know I mean?
Miss y'all (I miss you)
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldiettes
All across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down
Y'all living in our memories forever
Never gon' let y'all go
 + (Jay-Z)
I can't be no more (We not remembering your death, though)
Since you went away I don't really feel like talking (We celebrating your life, know I mean?)
No one here to love me, baby do you understand me? (Yes, yes)
I can't do a thing without you (Yes)
(Damn, we missing you)

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
