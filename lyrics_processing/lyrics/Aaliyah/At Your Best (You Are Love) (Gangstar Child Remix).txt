When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see, yeah
One-two checka
Baby, let me know what's up
You might also like
But at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
(Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know)
Let me know
(Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know)
Let me know

Ah yeah, this is for the steppers
This is for the steppers
This is for the steppers
Strictly for the steppers, yeah

When you feel what you feel
How hard for me to understand
Oh so many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, boy, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
I'm all about
One-two checka
Baby, let me know what's up
Oh boy, at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
