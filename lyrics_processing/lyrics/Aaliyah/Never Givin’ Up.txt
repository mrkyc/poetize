Mmhm
Mmhm, yeah
Aaah, hey, oooh

Never givin' up on this love
(Never givin' up on this love)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(Hey)

Sittin' here in this empty room
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Thinking 'bout all the changes
We been through, oh
And I know it might sound crazy
But I'm still lovin' you
In spite of all the simple things
We been through, we been through
The way you make me feel I can't explain
But I love what you do, what you do to me
When we're makin' love, you're drivin' me insane
See, I can't go no higher

Never givin' up on this love
(Hey, oh)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(You're always on my mind, all the time)
Never givin' up on this love
(I'll always be there, baby)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(Well, well, well)

Feels so strange when I was on the train
I cracked a smile on every thought of you
The things that you do
Makes me feel so good inside
No need to lie, I'm on your side
Ooh, no need to lie to you
I'm givin' my lovin' to you day and night
Aaliyah, I'm gonna be lovin' you, oh

Oh, baby girl
I got what you want!
I got what you need!
It's all in me!
Oh, oh, I'm
No, I'm never ever ever
Givin' your love away
I gotta keep it to myself, no

Tavarius, if you say what you think
And you mean what you say
My love, my love will be here always
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
A feeling I can't deny
That angels watchin' over us and our love
Angels watchin over you, over me
(Baby)
Angels watchin over you, over me
(Over you and me, hey)
Angels watchin over you, over me
(Over you, watchin' over you and me, baby)
Angels watchin over you, over me
(Oh, and I gotta thank the Lord for givin' you to me)

Never givin' up on this love
(Oh, oh, yes I do, yes I do, oh)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(See, they can take my prized possessions, baby)
Never givin' up on this love
(Don't take your love away from me, oh, oh-oh)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(Oh, yeah-yeah, I said I'm never goin' away)
Never givin' up on this love
(No way, no way, no way, no, no, no, no)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(No)
