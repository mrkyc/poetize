Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-yeah-yeah

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

When we hooked up
We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?

'Cause I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
See sugar, I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
Sugar, I don't wanna be alone

Do you realize?
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you
Be without you, I can't even breathe without you
I can't feel without you
Deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down
Don't wanna go out
'Cause I can't ride without you
Feel like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
Said, I can't live
Live without you, live without you
I can't go
Go without you, go without you
Said, I don't wanna be alone
Said, I can't be
Be without you, be without you
Said, I can't live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
Said, I don't wanna be alone

How can this be?
That it's not workin' out (That it's not workin' out)
We vowed to be always together (Yeah)
It's hurtin' me that we don't talk no more
It wasn't supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong?
We both made mistakes, we gotta carry on

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be (Hear me)
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone (Yeah, baby)

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live (Do you hear me?)
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go (Baby, are you listening?)
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone (What you do to me, what you do to me?)

Mmm
Don't wanna be
