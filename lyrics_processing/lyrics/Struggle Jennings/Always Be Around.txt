The coffee's too strong add some more creamer
I just figured out how to work all these buttons on the Beemer
Mama was a dreamer, daddy was a realist
So I had no choice in life but to go and kill this
Let 'em see my dreams turn into reality
I just wish I coulda done it 'fore my dad's fatality
He's in the clouds singin' no more pain
I'm on my knees screamin' no more rain
I'm soakin' wet, it's like five shells an I'm playin' roulette
It's so hard livin' with the regret, I got set up
But don't let up, they tell me keep my head up
It's hard when your dealin' with these Feds to not get fed up
Gotta get my bread up, take it out the oven
Uno mas amigo, gimme baker's dozen
Yeah, let me enjoy the last supper
All my people suffer, let the water bubble

I'll always be around and around and around
Shovel dirt on my name but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' take me out the game but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' knock me off my feet but
I'll always be around and around and around
I live forever in these streets

Yeah, these people think that I'm supposed to be
Somethin' that I'm not, but I'm not so whatcha want from me
Tryin' to get close to me, hang around me like my rosary
Take me out the car, put me away like your groceries
Hang me out to dry like your laundry, get a load of me
I been on trial my whole life, it ain't no foldin' me
My life is in they hands an I know they could let go of me
But there's more to see my seeds been growin' in her ovaries
So it's not over for me, my legacy gon' carry on
Gotta full house, tight fit, not no Derion
Came from the struggle, rise from the rubble
We'll make it out these streets baby, let the water bubble

I'll always be around and around and around
Shovel dirt on my name but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' take me out the game but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' knock me off my feet but
I'll always be around and around and around
I live forever in these streets

I'm from the slummo, hood of the Gummo
Cops askin' questions we look at 'em like "I dunno'"
No opportunities knockin', that's police at the front door
Layin' down no mo', turnin' back is a no go
Givin' up is a no no, we deserve a shot too
So we walk around with guns just like the cops do
Yeah, two wrongs don't make it right
But I'll be damned if I go out without a fight (I'm an outlaw)
Son of the righteous, covered in the lambs blood
But when you look at me all you see is a damn thug
Look closer, don't let the world command you
I might bend but won't break bitch I'm bamboo
I'll always be around and around and around
Shovel dirt on my name but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' take me out the game but
I'll always be around and around and around
They tryna' knock me off my feet but
I'll always be around and around and around
