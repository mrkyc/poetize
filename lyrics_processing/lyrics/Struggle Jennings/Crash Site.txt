Well, let me tell you 'bout my  past life
I was broke running' on E with the gaslight
Life a wreck but I was dancing at the crash site
Came from nothin' had to hustle get the fam right
Did my time like a man, yea you damn right
Life darker than my heart in the black night
Lit a wildfire baby this the campsite
Raise ya guns or put ya hands high
Ain't no time for you to stand by
Welcome to the crash site
Nothin' left but the survivors, and them til the death fighters
Love and loyalty's required
Where them killers gone kill 'em, angels gone feel 'em
All My dogs off the chain sick, get 'em welcome to the crash site

I've been rolling all alone just picturing
Rearview mirror on a steel horse, in the sunshine motor blistering
Still cold as the winter wind
A lot of people back at home still wondering
When and where, I don't really know where I'm rollin'
All I know is I don't owe a them motherfuckin' cent to them
Not a penny not a sentiment
Here we go

If my motor don't run, Imma get out and run
If I run up out of gas, all I do is just laugh
I crash, till I crash, Imma ride
If my life is on line, all I got is this time
Imma hold that motherfucker, Imma push that line
I crash, till I crash, till I crash

Mama had that witchcraft way back in the sticks
So I became a naturalist with the Chevy wheel
Holistic 'cause them boys grippin' polished wood
Holy Water in the Dixie cup, on that for real
Dropped a verse and ran up out the booth, I caught the ghost
Targets on us catching shit and I Just made the kill
Snipers nest up on the porch, I'm looking at these cowards
Shower love and empty shells, about to break a deal
The drums never empty, 'til these punks never really they'll succumb to the wave I make my own and ride it plenty
I'm a Slumerican, made man arrogant
When I need to be I don't expect to get a severance
Apology when I'm wabbling up out the chair again
Want to get a photo, maybe no maybe I'm there again
The fame don't cherish it, fame's only carrying the work
I put into but I do it like a champion, for me
And that's good enough for me, If that good enough for you
I suggest you let it be, I do anything for love except for give you everything
So I keep it dolo, in the mainstream, Yea, Yelawolf
I've been rollin' all alone just picturing

I crash, till I crash, till I crash

Let me tell you 'bout my right now
I done took too many hits to end the fight now, 80 yard line with no times out
I can see the end zone, I can hear the crowd loud
Welcome to the crash site, made it through another last night
So proud of where we came from, show ya what me made of
Only god can save us, we are the crusaders, what are you afraid of
I've been rollin' all alone just picturing
Rearview mirror on a steel horse, in the sunshine just blistering
Still cold as the winter wind
A lot of people back at home still wondering
