Life took a turn for the better, I'm on the right road
I'm weighed down, I've never carried a light load
A lotta' turbulence, bumpy ride on my flight flown
I cause a light show every time that the fights on
You gotta feel me, it's my life that I fight for
Can't forget where I been, no tellin' where I might go
I was flyin' no string so the kite's gone
Searchin' through the pain in my story for the right song
While the night's long, but the day's gone
She told me she had had enough, just to stay gone
If I could carry more than C notes I'd sing songs
Awards Im'a' bring 'em home
We'll wake up till the dream is gone

Fiddle's don't make violins
Hotel rooms don't make homes
Can't turn water into wine
Can't make a rock from a rolling stone

Papa's a rollin' stone, mamma's a real angel
Walkin' behind untangled the web that I had tangled
Back an forth across the net like ping pong
I'm at the door, you hear the doorbell, ding dong
The smoke's chokin' me, tell 'em clean the bong
You got more obstacles for me to jump, then bring them on
I'm in the field suited up with my cleats on
Tryna' get up out these streets but keep writin' these street songs
The heat's on, it's too hot? Hop up out the skillet
You say you Bennet, if you ain't in it then you can't feel it
I tell the truth in every song so I'm incriminated
This is me goin' toe to toe, I'm not intimidated

Fiddle's don't make violins
Hotel rooms don't make homes
Can't turn water into wine
Can't make a rock from a rolling stone
(But I ain't changin' regardless)

Fame ain't gon' change me, money ain't gon' make me
Only doin' what you would if you could so don't hate me
I'm carryin' ten times of my weight, it won't break me
I'm somethin' new so they don't quite know how to take me
I'm in a good space, like "fuck what they say" lately
Hatred is an ugly trait an they afraid to face me
You'll never find another me so don't replace me
Embrace me, I'm up against the world, standin' bravely
Maybe just maybe, one day they'll pay me
The respect that I've earned on the daily since the eighties
Over a thousand songs that I may never sing
Cause they tellin' me right now freedom's bell may never ring

Fiddle's don't make violins
Hotel rooms don't make homes
Can't turn water into wine
Can't make a rock from a rolling stone
