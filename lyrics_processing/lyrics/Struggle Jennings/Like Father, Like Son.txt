His father was a gambler
Alcoholic
Drunk bastard, whatever you want to call it
Don't like the way he treating mumma cheating in the lights
Find himself becoming the same guy he despised
Good ole boy,  an old road runner
Pistol on his waste, he's ready to throw thunder
Told him living like that he won't last that long
Living an outlaw's songs and trying to prove 'em all wrong
From the poverty line but taking pride in his hood
Fell in love with a rich girl from Brentwood
They had a son, he made a promise to change
He wrote that promise in chalk and it was lost in the heavy rain

Heavy rains that fall upon me
As I make my last request
Things my daddy did before me
They're still ringing in my head
Like father

He lost his job and his wife in the same week
Whiskey breath claimed defeat when the pain speaks
Phone rings, suicide by gun
He'd been fighting demons and the Devil had won
Survived by mud filled and a couple of sons
Blood-filled bullet holes where the picture hung
Too much to bare, mumma cries that it ain't fair
Questions linger in the air
Answers just ain't there
On her knees as she pleas "Lord, why?"
The boy steps up with a look in his eye
As the chapter ends, another saga starts
I became a man with the last beat of my father's heart

Heavy rains that fall upon me
As I make my last request
Things my daddy did before me
They're still ringing in my head

Rabble-rouser, playing with Peter's gun
Might've hit a home run if I was Jeter's son
But I feel more like Dale Earnhardt Jr
And doing the same thing my daddy died doing
Trying prove a proud legacy
To maintain staring down at that grave-site baring the same name
Chasing footsteps to the same storm that swallowed him
Mumma home hollering
I shut the door and followed him
Wanted to fill his boots but I got bigger feet
He never made it past thirty guess I got him beat
Learning how to be a man through the stories round the campfire
They bought me a can full of gas and it backfired
Great man did wrong for the right reasons
I still hear his voice
"Feed them by any means, son
Family first, don't forget where you come from
Life's a knife fight, bring guns for the"
