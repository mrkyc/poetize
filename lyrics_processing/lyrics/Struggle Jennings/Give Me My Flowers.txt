Surf's up, feel like I'm ridin' on a tidal wave
I'll be home put my plate off in the microwave
I do it my way, this is Massbaum
I'ma' make it, take it to the bank, cash bonds
Some of ya'll kept it real the whole time
Others dried up an flaked, pork rinds
Pop a cork time, toast to the lifespan
Burnin' candle an a four five on the nightstand
Take flight man, that what my family say
Please don't let him win, that's what the haters pray
I'm in the winner's circle but never won a race
I'm in the right state of mind but feelin' outa' place
They wanna take a shot, shit better aim high
I drove this road so ya' ain't have to take the same ride
This the same guy who sacrificed for ya'll to eat
So tell me how you feel before I rest in peace

Standin' all alone, starin' at the sky
Head in the clouds, wishin' I could fly
The only thing in life that's certain is I'ma' die
So I'm askin' ya'll to gimme' my flowers while I'm alive

Give me my flowers while I'm still alive
Cause one day you're here then you're gone
The only thing that's certain in life is I'ma' die
So cherish me while I'm still at home

Heard through the grapevine, but I tried to doubt it
Heard you'd never cross me, shit but you thought about it
You seen a hundred grand, would never steal from me
Said you 'member when I came through with that bill money
It's real funny, facing thirty all alone
I gotta month to the trial, you ain't called the phone
They like to say they know me when they got my G's with 'em
Quick to say they hate me if someone agrees with 'em
The apple look right but gotta' bad seed in 'em
I been bit by these snakes so I bleed venom
I keep grinnin', even in my darkest hour
You say you love me, gimme my flowers

Standin' all alone, starin' at the sky
Head in the clouds, wishin' I could fly
The only thing in life that's certain is I'ma' die
So I'm askin' ya'll to gimme' my flowers while I'm alive

Give me my flowers while I'm still alive
Cause one day you're here then you're gone
The only thing that's certain in life is I'ma' die
So cherish me while I'm still at home
Fifty miles an runnin' in the old Lincoln
I told you hop up out the ship when the boat's sinking
I'm the captain, I'ma' die with the Black Pearl
Leave my soul in the bottom of this black world
Lay it all on the line for La Familia
I think I been here before, it's all familiar
Know that I was righteous in my last life
Messed up this go around, trapped in the fast life
With my cash right, an my squad tight
Last night I found myself with a flashlight (hello)
If I die tonight, don't cry them big tears
Just let 'em know what I did here

Standin' all alone, starin' at the sky
Head in the clouds, wishin' I could fly
The only thing in life that's certain is I'ma' die
So I'm askin' ya'll to gimme' my flowers while I'm alive

Give me my flowers while I'm still alive
Cause one day you're here then you're gone
The only thing that's certain in life is I'ma' die
