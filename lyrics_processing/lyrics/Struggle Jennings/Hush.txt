Hush now baby, dry your eyes
Everything's alright
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your powers on the inside

Uh, daddy movin' like the Cosa Nostra
Baby, hold me closer, watch the holster
Got a loaded toaster, on a wanted poster
Holy Ghost always kept me kosher
Man of God with the devil's grin
Found my heaven after hella sin
Bad boys will make better men
But you already better than I've ever been

I'm a better father than I was a son
Black sheep but wasn't never shunned
Green eyes with a silver tongue
And when I went to prison momma wasn't stunned
Not no one and done I went back and forth
Had my momma's ass in and outta court
Unruly came unraveled
I won't give directions to the road I traveled
See my mistakes and don't make the same
You'll lose it all, for the sake of gain
Get your money never take the fame
You can change your play, but can't change the game

Getcha money never take the fame
You'll lose it all for the sake of gain
See my mistakes and don't make the same, ah

Hush now baby, dry your eyes
Everything's alright
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your power on the inside
Shine your light, it's diamond bright
Raise your head up high
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your power on the inside (yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha)

Got the only daddy that'll walk the line
Yeah, I'm a rambling man, baby, all in time
"I'ma make it home and I'ma make it fine"
That's what I said when I was doin' time
On that prison phone, had to stand in line
Had to polish up, so I could get to shine
I took that oath to make the promise stick
Family over everything, thin or thick, uh
Ride or die, yeah, I gotcha six
Protect your heart with this iron fist
I'll never dip, like my daddy did
You give me every reason that I got to live
Never buckle, never fold in pressure
If you wanna fly, you gotta show them feathers
Real men are never hit on women
So never settle or daddy'll kill 'em, uh
Go with feelings, lead with ya heart
You can write your script, if you play your part
Stand for love, don't fall for hate
Faith and work, that's all it takes

I said, "faith and work, that's all it takes"
Baby, stand for love, never fall for hate
You can write your script, if you play your part
Go with your feelings, lead with your heart

Hush now baby, dry your eyes
Everything's alright
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your power on the inside
Shine your light, it's diamond bright
Raise your head up high
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your power on the inside
Hush now baby, dry your eyes
Everything's alright
You're stronger than you even realize
You'll find your power on the inside
Shine your light, it's diamond bright
Raise your head up high
You're stronger than you even realize
