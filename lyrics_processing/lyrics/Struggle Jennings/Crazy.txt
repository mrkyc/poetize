I've aways been different with one foot over the line
Windin' up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from goin' insane

Outlaw shit four five in my Levis
Got stung gettin' honey out the bee hive
DEA wanna see me locked up
Two lines popped up, old girl's knocked up
Scratch scratch back to the drawin' board scribble
Man down but the ball's in my court, dribble
Everybody wanna rock if they don't roll
Paid that toll without sellin' my soul
This is how the game goes, no I demand more
Everything you been through in your life is what I stand for
I won't budge, run an tell that
Monkey on my back like the man with the yellow hat
If she curious, call me Jorge
Missed her chance like she came before the four play
Uninvited but I made it through the doorway
Black sheep, no shepperd that's my forte

I've aways been different with one foot over the line
Windin' up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from goin' insane

Momma told me never hit your brakes when it's slick out
Daddy told me always pull your dick out
Still check your chick out, even when I'm with my girl
Cause Jellyroll told me "share picky with the world"
Cashville rider, west side ratchet
Gotta problem with these Feds won't bury this hatchet
They know they wrong an I know I'm right
So we dancin' round an round like a slow Prom night
Click clack bang bang still reppin' A Game
Talk slick, put your shit on the woodgrain
Goddamn man black paint, blue velvet
Blue suede shoes, biggest thing since Elvis
Jailhouse rock, I'ma' hound dog
Still runnin' from your shadow like a groundhog
Won't stand up, thats your downfall
Back at home even if I hit a ground ball

I've aways been different with one foot over the line
Windin' up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from goin' insane

Forty five colt hangin' out of my denim
Find out where it hurts then I hit 'em
Got pitbulls, sick sick get 'em
But they said I'm wrong for the way that I did 'em
Shit, hop off of the boat afloat, no stow aways
All I know is digital scales an a throw away
West side raised, south side paid
May be a little crazy but I'm not insane
I've aways been different with one foot over the line
Windin' up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
