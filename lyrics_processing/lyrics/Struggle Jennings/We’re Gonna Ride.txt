And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind, we're gonna ride

The river ran dry, but the storm's comin'
The drought's almost over, but we're still mournin'
The picture's gettin' blurry, like this windy road
Cause I can only see you now when my eyes is closed
I know I'm supposed to keep your name alive, but it hurts to speak it
Memories is bittersweet, that's how I prefer to keep it
I'm bout to lose my top like the champaigne that we used to pop
Drivin' like that time we almost died tryna' lose the cops
But we're gon' ride again in that Cutlass with them golden wings
Arms hangin' out the window, doin' ninety while Waylon sings
Sweet chariot swing low homey an scoop me up
Before one of these hatin' motherfuckers shoot me up

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind, we're gonna ride

No smooth rides, so I grind harder
My whole life been cuttin' it close like a blind barber
Fightin' for my freedom, cause I seen freedom lost
I seen 'em never get paid but have to pay the cost
I hear the concrete crack every time you say you miss me
You waitin' on parole, two-thousand-an-fifty
Even if we both gone I'll be waitin' at them gates for ya'
With some new J's an one of momma's plates for ya'
The blank envelopes, lost letters that I never sent you
They told me it would be easier if I could just forget you
Cause you ain't comin' home, I'll never see you again
But that's a lie cause I will an (We gonna ride)

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind, we're gonna ride

The tires' bald, but the paint's wore
The seats is tore, but this motor roars
I'm runnin' hot but I refuse to blow a head gasket
I missed my turn back there, I musta' sped past it
In the fast lane tryna' see the scenery
I wanna slow down to smell the roses an the greenery
But these streets have left a smell of betrayal and distrust
There's nothin' to discuss, this is us
Outlaws an we gon' ride for eternity
Ain't no Pat Garret in my blood, it ain't no turnin' me
But for currency I seen they transmission slip
I started this with the intention that I would finish it
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind, we're gonna ride

I'm gonna find me a reckless woman
Razor blades an dice in her eyes
Just a touch of sadness in her fingers
Thunder an lightning in her eyes

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the devil close behind
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like a one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
