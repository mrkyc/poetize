Yea, The truth behind a fake smile

Lonely man in this crowded room
Another shot to heal the battle wounds
The crowd is waiting for his battle cry
He won the war so his banner flies
Gucci shades hide his saddened eyes
Cheeks wet so he pat em dry
His ships sinking but they paddle by
The money he makes don't make him satisfied
Sick and tired so homesick told him chase that dream at his own risk
He didn't listen now he's missin all his children gettin grown quick
Facetimes the only face time
Pay Barely covering the baseline feeling more at home across state lines
When's the big break they said it takes time
Running outta luck and he's running late
But he can't brake there's too much at stake
Moving fast n the fast lane
But he speeds up to get past the pain
Another toast as the glasses bangs
Tequilas fillin up his gas tank
Same song different city on a broken road that his soul paved

I've been here on my own
Lost and lonely on the road
Singing songs with the pain
Through a smile that's hard to hold
This damn highway never ends
'Cause the miles they take their toll
I've been here for way too long
Just trying to make it home

1000 miles and he still runnin
Amarillo by tomorrow morning
Drank himself to sleep in Albuquerque
Cause His hearts broken and his souls is thirsty
Gotta Phone call last week in Phoenix
That His brothers shot and it hit the deepest
Drinking heavy wash away regret
When the reaper come you gotta pay that debt
But He ain't ready yet another song to sing
Thunderstorms always wash him clean
When the bus rolls then the night is over
In an empty bed there's no crying shoulder
All alone he gotta face his fears
Through the empty bottle he can see it clear
Success is near he can feel it close
But his dreams are haunted by Talia's ghost
He's asking why to a clouded sky
With some clouded eyes with no answer back
I asked a question better answer that I fought the devil
God where you at I'm a man of faith in a wicked place
Try to make it straight with my crooked ways
Seen a light and he looked away
Fell into the dark and then he sang

I've been here on my own
Lost and lonely on the road
Singing songs with the pain
Through a smile that's hard to hold
This damn highway never ends
'Cause the miles they take their toll
I've been here for way too long
