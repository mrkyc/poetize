Is there no mercy
For the widow's son?

I got the sword of the samurai
City been traumatized
Temple was vandalized
Soldiers were standin' by
Kingdom was built on lies
People was victimized
Lyrics been simplified
And the fans have been hypnotized
Critics will criticize
Our voice has been minimized
Truth has been hidden inside the lies of the enterprise
What does this symbolize?
Rise of the Babylon
They danglin' diamonds
And so they holdin' us in they palm
Pullin' on strings
We keep dancin' like puppets
When I start to get lost
I'm usin' Pac as my compass
Yeah, I'm sick to my stomach
Watchin' the real music plummet
I'm still marchin' on the battlefield
To sounds of a trumpet
Rrah

This is my battle cry
Tell 'em is 'bout the time
To load up the cavalry
The ones who are the ride or die
They say that I'm out of mind
Feel like I'm out of time
The dreamers come out at night
The ones that are sacrificed

This is the story of Malachi
This is my battle cry
Messenger prophesized
The real will be ostracized
History is history
I believe he lied
Snipers in tree lines
Bullets on beeline
Bottles are dipped in gold
Still tastin' like cheap wine
The savages all starvin'
Tonight's the night we dine
No dreams of b side
Tell a label we'll be fine
My people keep streamin' records
My money get streamlined
Don't care 'bout platinum plaques
Long as I feed mine
My record you want them back
Find truth inside each line
Put in my street time
Made it out safe and sound
Tell 'em don't make a sound
They think we take 'em out
Rrah
This is my battle cry
Tell 'em is 'bout the time
To load up the cavalry
The ones who are the ride or die
They say that I'm out of mind
Feel like I'm out of time
The dreamers come out at night
The ones that are sacrificed

This is my battle cry
Rise-rise of the widow son
This is my battlecry
Rise-rise of the widow son
This is my battlecry
Rise-rise of the widow son
This-this is my battlecry
