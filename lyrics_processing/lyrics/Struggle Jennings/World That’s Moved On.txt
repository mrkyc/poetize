And never thought she'd change up like the weather
For better or for worse I guess what hurts is that it happened a my worst
And I never got the chance to make it better
I'm moving on suitcase in a heart full of souvenirs
5 years in prison clear vision of his truly here
I won't lose a tear instead I'm going to break a smile
Heart breaks may take a while got an inch I'll take a mile
Silence breaks the chaos in me
Memory's pour from a glass half empty
Sunbreak shadows that still stand with me
In a world that's moved on
I don't want the answers to the questions I can ask you
Some things better left in the past that's true
A lot of faces I ain't seen in the last q
Windows up as I pass you, we were so close this cashew
Took my plug cool stuff with my girl cool
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice then I'm the fool
Broken commitments I don't hold no resentments
Only Jesus need repentance, homie I just need some distance
Silence breaks the chaos in me
Memory's pour from a glass half empty
Sunbreak shadows that still stand with me
In a world that's moved on

Knowing the story of the apple and eve and sill took it instead
Follow the past scattered in cash I covered in blood
In a snake pit, thin thinking I won't get bit by the ones I love
And cuffs on the cuffs, there's something great hurry up and wait apologies to late fates been hard for me to take
Forgiveness given notes taken lessons learned
Mama told me that the stove was hot I had to feel the burn
Blistered fingertips still whippin work deep
Deep inside myself until I'm filled up with dirt
You gotta pay the price to ever feel it's worth
The sun rises after the moon, but the sun comes first
Silence breaks the chaos in me
Memory's pour from a glass half empty
Sunbreak shadows that still stand with me
In a world that's moved on
