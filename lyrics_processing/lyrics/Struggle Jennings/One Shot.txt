Aim it well
My people on the sidelines yelling give em hell
Bump it right
We buckled up
Think I'm gonna quit now you got me fucked up
One shot
Aim it well
My people on the sidelines yelling give em hell
Bump it right
We buckled up
Think I'm gonna quit now you got me fucked up
They ask me how I feel about comin home spent my whole life on ledge to edge my comfort zone
People been patiently waiting on the struggle song
Feds close on my bumper hoping I do something wrong
Get to em mandatory life in the pin life a crier sin thinkin bout what I might've been
Takin off my throne thrown into a Lions den now
I'm staring down the barrel lord it's like a fire pen
Goes on my scope, there's a strong breeze
Sights pressed tight to my eyes take a breath and squeeze
They looking like I'm gone fell first life appearance
Can't let it get the best of me knee perserverence
You can hear it in my lyrics that the struggles real
Worried bout the bill ain't worried how the fuck they feel
Can't fit a fall, hit the ground runnin
It'll be a beautiful sound to here this four pound gunning

Been playing roulette
One shell in the seven
Made a promise give it hell for my people in heaven
They said we get a second chance
Tell it to Blake
Tell it to Drake get a pen and then write it to Jake
Staying in chaos of the boats sitting close to the grave
Alotta killers on my boat try to hold em at Bay
See my reflection in my kids eyes like who am I
5 bricks in the back seat of a Caddy do or die
They said I got a light inside of me how will I use it
Lost in the dark follow the spark don't wanna loose it
The Masters in the pen on iron getting the swoll on
As I was walking out the gates he told me struggle hold on
So long remember where you been if this all go wrong
Do it for ones who can't do it homie go on
I took a leap and hit the ground runnin
Now my barrels smokin speakers bumping here the four pound gunning
