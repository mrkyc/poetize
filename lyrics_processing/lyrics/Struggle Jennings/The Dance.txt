The DJ playin' us some crazy songs
But we still dance along, hopin' that it carries on
When I met her I ain't wanna let her in my heart
'Cause I was facin' 25, goodbye's so fuckin' hard
I let go an let God, was lighter than a feather
We beat the case together, told you that the dust would settle
Never say never, the world is at our finger tips
Every day's a holiday so I bring her gifts
Try to design her, dress her in designer
She told me that the finer things never would define her
Just wanted to let her sit back, chill, recliner
Never wanted to let the tears smear her eyeliner

And I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd've had to miss the dance

Remember that dance on the boat on the river
Passing the city, under the bridge, I proposed
I still remember your glow
I still remember that song, how's it go
I still remember the kiss we kissed under the mistletoe (Oh)
I still remember that blue dress on the waterfall
Where we took our vows, I can recall it all
Like it was yesterday, yeah some of the best of days
Just let the record play, let's dance the stress away
Cause I'd be blessed to stay, because I'm blessed to say
My sin was not writin' this sooner, I confessed today
Let's put the rest away, but bring the past with us
We gotta smile to keep from cryin' so let 'em laugh with us

And I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd've had to miss the dance

The pictures flash before my teary eyes
I didn't know before but now i understand
So clearly why, why we met an fell so deep in love
An why we still danced in the rain even though our feet were stuck in mud
And why I'm at a peaceful place with this fed case
They tryna' take my life this time, no time to waste
So in case just hold me tight and lets slow waltz
No pointin' fingers no regrets, uh-uh, no faults
Cause they can throw salt, we add flour an make bread
I'll have to charge it to the game, I hope they take lead
Regardless they can't take the memories that we have
We gotta smile to keep from cryin' so this time we laugh

And I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
