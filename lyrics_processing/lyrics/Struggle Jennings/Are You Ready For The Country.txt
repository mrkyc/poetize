Slippin' an a' slidin', playin' dominoes
Leftin' an a' rightin', ain't a crime you know
Well you gotta tell your story boy, before it's time to go

Show me what it was an I'ma' show you what it will be
I got my hand on my nuts, can you feel me?
To each his own, I can't worry about his grind
This ain't no dress rehearsal homey, this the big time
We are professionals, this is my profession
Story of an Outlaw, this is my confession
No recession, the struggle can't be fabricated
They placed a bet against us, so they mad we made it
They can hate it, they can't stop it, it's irrelevant
Been doin' this since day one, growth and development
Born in the wolves den, became one of them
Lived off hand-me-downs, second hand of sin

Are you ready for the country, ready for me?
Get ready for the country, get ready for me
Are you ready for the country, ready for me?
Get ready for the country, ain't I a sight to see

We are the shooters not the shot at, the ones who never got out
In these streets chasin' money till it's hot out
If you got a weak stomach don't listen
My story's fulla' murder an suspense, John Grisham
Pain on the pages, not for all ages
Pedal to the metal so I redline all these gauges
Got young spirit old soul like my father
Travelled through muddy water just to get back to the alter
Caught up in the trap, but the trap set me free tonight
The game's dehydrated, yeah I got that Pedialight
They hungry so I feed 'em right
It's dark, I let 'em see the light
My circle's small, I keep it tight
I hope ya'll ready to see a fight
(are ya'?)

Talkin' to a preacher, God was on his side
Talkin' to a pusher, they both were sellin' highs
