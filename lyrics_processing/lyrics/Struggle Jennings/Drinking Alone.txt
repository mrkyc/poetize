I watched her walk right out that front door
And off the front porch into her car
Acted like I never seen her leave
I can fix the Chevy, but I can't atone a broken heart
I could have chased her, said I'd change my ways but lies is all she's heard
All the fight I got left is at the bottom of the bottle but gettin' there's where it hurt

She said she's leavin' 'cause I'm drinkin'
I'm only drinkin' because she gone
And now I'm sittin' here all alone
Thinkin' I'ma drink 'til she come home
She said she's leavin' 'cause I'm drinkin'
I'm only drinkin' because she gone
And now I'm sittin' here all alone
Thinkin' I'ma drink 'til she come home

I could quit now, start all over, make a deal and deal with it sober
Turn that bottle over top of that sink
Wash the excuses down the drain
Or I could have just one more drink and dance the night away from this pain
Call her bright and early and beg her to come home
'Cause drinkin' alone just ain't the same
