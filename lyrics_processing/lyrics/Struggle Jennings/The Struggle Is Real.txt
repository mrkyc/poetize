The struggle is real
So real
5 am comes early, Jack and folders in his cup
He wakes her up and lay her clothes out and packs her lunch
Got to rush to catch the school bus
Pony tails and tooth brush
Sometimes it seems its too much he waves good bye
Then he sighs 12 he days and barely gettin by
Her momma workin 3rd shift and
He hope she ain't back gettin high
On a slippery slope slowly slippin to a pit
Hanging on for dear life loosing grip but he refused to quit

I see the look in your eyes and I know how you feel
Work your fingers to the bone just to cover the bills
You want to leave that single wide trailer in the holler for a house up on a hill
You don't care how they feel
Cause the struggle is real
I know the struggle is real

She's almost 40 and still dancin on that brass pole
Customers are disrespectful, manager is an asshole
Her greater goals over shadow all the sorrows
5 am will take forever few more minutes till tomorrow
Not enough dollars in their garder for their house of dreams
Running to the dressin room slams the door and starts to scream
We're she wants to be in life is still a distant image
At her wits end still isn't finished story has an ending

He walks outside and throws his tools in to his pickup truck
Looks up and smiles see her Altima is pulling up
Her weight is lifted, her doors open and he knows she sober
He grabs aholdst her she finds comfort underneath his shoulder
As they embrace all of their worries are erased
Because together they can face all of obstacles in place
Pulls out of the holler to go make a honest dollar
Pay dues won't loose smile through the blues of blue collar
