Yeah
Only way to fly is to jump

Mama preachin' and they speakin' to us, common sense
Look around, neighborhood like the apoocalypse
Wanna reach the top, no money for that rocket ship
And he don't think he'll get no scholarship
So he drop out, people tellin' him it's just a cop out
American dream, picture perfect, he been cropped out
Bills at the house past due, what else to do
They don't know what he been through
How they gon' tell him how to move
Born to lose-lose, no avenues left to chose
Bruised and abused, persecuted and accused
Money he pursued, poverty he refused
Walkin' outta school with a fucking attitude

Some day you'll look around and regret what you've become
Never spread your wings to leave that place that you were from
Stars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun
Fly high young one, it could end before it's begun

He's writin' songs about the pain he feel inside
But ain't no rapper ever made it from the west side
His is a silly dream, reality is brutal
Lost three homies in three weeks from gang shootin's
Try to get out, it's just useless
They say his only option is a factory or prison institution
He wanna fly, but he afraid to jump
Plus, he can't afford it, his old lady got that baby bump
Time to grind, gotta let go of his wants, provide for their needs
Time to be a man, grow some roots, plant a seed
Get a 9-5, hustle on the side
Let go of all the foolishness and kiss the dream goodbye

Some day you'll look around and regret what you've become
Never spread your wings to leave that place that you were from
Stars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun
Fly high young one, it could end before it's begun

Seven kids, a couple prison years later
I decided to quit listening to haters
Took from the 'hood everything that made us
God won't forsake us and the Feds couldn't break us
Promised greater for my baby's fate than hard labor
Now I'm living in the mansion saving for some acres
Same people said I couldn't, askin' if I can
Give a helping hand, loan a couple grand
Never fake it for a second 'cause we been through real shit
The moral of the story, what you want you can get
Gotta jump you wanna fly, you won't get another life
Twinkle, twinkle little star, go and live your lullaby

Stars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun
Fly high young one, it could end before it's begun
