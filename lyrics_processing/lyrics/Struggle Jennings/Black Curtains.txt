In a white room, with black curtains, in the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired stars
In a white room, with black curtains, in the station

Daddy's a thug, mommas a saint
She sing a story to God, prayin for change
The air's thick but the mic's warm
Cause you were chasing them rainbows right into the storm
Was out on the block
Cause shorty wanna be a thug an he listens to Pac
In the same streets pops got shot in
A legacy expected for him to get it poppin'
It's Fat Pete's boy tell em' for certain
Can't see the world passed these black curtains

In a white room, with black curtains, in the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired stars
In a white room, with black curtains, in the station

He stands still while the time flies
Got kids of his own, responsible for five lives
Come in late don't startle the dog
To bring home the bacon had to slaughter the hog
A father will fall so the family will rise
An when the Feds all arrive, it's time for goodbyes
The look in the eyes of a child all alone
Will make any king give up his throne
They look at his son, he'll have it for certain
So now I'm tearing down the black curtains

You said no strings could secure you in the station
Platform tickets, restless diesel, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own needs just beginning

I wait in this place where the sun never shines
Die with you where the shadows run from themselves

The streets told me what I was supposed to be because of who my daddy was
But if he woulda' been alive, he woulda' wanted me to be better than he was
So now as I see my son I say "Be better than I was son, break the cycle"
Like Waylon said, "I leave a lot to live up to, and a lot to live down"
My strengths, my weaknesses, the truth and the lies
So don't walk in my shadow, follow the light
