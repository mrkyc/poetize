Uh, daddy wasn't home, momma raised a thug
The life I gravitated towards she never did indulge
But she never judged, her love was unconditional
Probation conditional, evidence admissible
Tears on her ivory keys, glory in the lyrics
Singin' Gods praise to anybody who could hear it
The end she doesn't fear it, words written in red
Pain weighs her down, but the girl liftin' her head
Son chasin' bread, searchin' for some soul food
When she preaches come, he says "I'm in no mood"
Carnivore, never satisfied by tofu
Wild eyes blind to what he 'bout to go through

Livin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
Wild eyes (Wild eyes), Wild eyes (Wild eyes)
Livin' on a prayer, me against the world
Momma's boy chasin' the devil's little girl
Wild eyes (Wild eyes), Wild eyes (Wild eyes)

I'm borrowed time, livin' off momma's prayers
The only one to ever see through all his rugged layers
Nobody really cares, bangin' me against the world
At the bottom of the black sea, fishin' for a pearl
Listen to the words, missin' all the meanings
Deal going down, should probably sit it out this evenin'
Devil on his shoulder, he gotta hit this lick
This what you been waitin' on, and after this you can quit
Butterfly's got him sick, somethin' don't seem kosher
Cops or the robbers go with or without the toaster
Now verdicts on the poster, candles burnin' blue
Wild eyes blind to what he's 'bout to go through

Livin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
Wild eyes (Wild eyes), Wild eyes (Wild eyes)
Livin' on a prayer, me against the world
Momma's boy chasin' the devil's little girl
Wild eyes (Wild eyes), Wild eyes (Wild eyes)

Pull in to the parkin' lot, dash full of cash
Homie in the back, killer in the stash
Shawty actin' funny, she don't even count the money
Then she strikes off runnin', right then he see it comin'
Blue lights, black vests, everything is slow-mo
Hands in the air, throw them keys out the window
Karma from his past is catchin' up with his ass
Then he laughs as his momma says "This too shall pass"
Handcuffs click, prison doors shut
Judge looks down and says 57 months
His kingdom disappears, a lot of friends follow suit
His wild eyes open and he finally see the truth

Livin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
Wild eyes (Wild eyes), Wild eyes (Wild eyes)
Livin' on a prayer, me against the world
Momma's boy chasin' the devil's little girl
