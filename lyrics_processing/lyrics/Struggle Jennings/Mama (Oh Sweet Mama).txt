Mama, oh sweet mama, say you love me
Let me hold you, hold you in my arms
Don't tell me that I'm really fallin' to pieces
Mama, oh sweet Mama, say you love me

Jack Daniels tears on a dear Strugg letter
Said she wanted to love me, but I never would let her
Fed up, she let up, let go, got out
Guess I shoulda' got up from the table when she shot out
UH, but I didn't I was sittin' countin' money
Speed limit was thirty five, I'm doin' a hundred
I can hear that train comin' I'm still walkin' on these tracks
Hold up girl where you goin'? Ay, bring it back
I'm out here bout to get it, I know I been gone too long
I'm a vagabond, dreamer, rhymer, singer of these songs
I ain't livin' long like this without you
I can't put these pieces back together without glue

Mama, oh sweet mama, say you love me
Let me hold you, hold you in my arms
Don't tell me that I'm really fallin' to pieces
Mama, oh sweet mama, say you love me

The camel's back's broke that was the last straw
We both throwin' punches, we got glass jaws
It hurts deep cause the love's strong
Damn, my favorite jams is the love songs
So I'm just sittin' here just listenin' to Usher on repeat
While the harder that I pull it just pushes you leave
We supposed to be some grown-ups an this is how we act?
Why you keep walkin' away girl? Bring it back
I'm feelin' like you never really loved me from the start
You can't love me from your purse you gotta' love me from your heart
So even though these times is hard I'm out here grindin'
I'm the King of Hearts baby, not the Jack of Diamonds

I'm not the Jack of Diamonds, baby
I'm not worried about all this money
The money comes and goes
What we got is here right now
That's why they jealous of us
So when they throw salt
Let's add flour and make bread
The hate is irrelevant when the love is present
Haha, shut up and tell me you love me, haha

Mama, oh sweet mama, say you love me
Let me hold you, hold you in my arms
Don't tell me that I'm really fallin' to pieces
