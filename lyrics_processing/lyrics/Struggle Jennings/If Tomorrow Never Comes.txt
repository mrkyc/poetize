Life's been a crazy ride, taught to look into the sky
Never ask no questions why, but now all I do is question
Would it all be different if I would of asked more questions
No time for stressin', gotta close the bottle top
Full speed ahead like the throttle body's locked
Took the brake pads off, time to grind hard
I'm short on good luck like I wrote nine bars
An the seventh's still missin'
Made false promises, will heaven still listen?
Still in the kitchen cookin' dinner for a house full
They can't digest me, but I still give 'em a mouthful
Yeah, I try to keep it all tasteful
The bitter truth lays so heavy on the tastebuds
My cuttin' board's fulla' onions so my sleeve's wet
I'm lookin' back like "no regrets"

If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
Remember what you say
If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
Remember you this way

I gotta headache, no it's not a tumor
I'm just hopin' that these kids don't listen to the rumors
An think that daddy was a bad man
To feed 'em I'd jump through hoops an do a handstand
On a bed of nails, in a thunderstorm
Did a year in jail, I'd do a hundred more
Just to make sure that they had what they need
I'm solar powered, never fueled by the greed
A good seed but I was planted in a bad place
With no light, no water in a cold vase
Cold case, will I ever know the verdict
Station's fulla' static, wishin' I could turn it
Yeah, but my reception's gettin' clearer
Antenna's up an I adjusted all my mirrors
If this airbag fails in the streets
Then turn the volume up an play me on repeat

If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
Remember what you say
If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
Remember you this way
If tomorrow came (yeah)
I'd stand with you in the pouring rain (let it rain)
Wearing nothing but the pain (uh huh)
If tomorrow came (let's fly)
We'd be flying through fire (let it burn)
If tomorrow came

If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
Remember what you say
If tomorrow never comes
I'll still have you for today
Paint a picture of your face
