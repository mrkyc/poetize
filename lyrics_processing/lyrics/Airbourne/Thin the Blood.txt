I need it now
So fill 'em up
And throw 'em down
My nerves are tighter than a piano wire
Like an ocky strap I'm about to snap
The pressure crush my mind in its vice
The weight of the world the perils of life
It's been so long since I drank from the cup
I've worked all week I'm gonna rip it up
It's 5 o'clock I'm ready to rock
Cold beer gonna hit the spot tonight
No more work coz I've knocked off
When I start to drink I just don't stop
I love the buzz it picks me up
Makes me feel a million bucks
Thin the blood
Thin the blood
In the name of fun
You gotta Thin the blood
Saturday morning and I feel like shit
Hungover in hell, I need to get lit
With a hair of the dog it puts me right
Washes away the sins of last night
I got my mojo working, I'm bouncing off the walls
And then it hits just like a cannon ball
You might also like5 o'clock and I'm ready to rock
Cold beer gonna hit the spot tonight
No more work coz I've knocked off
When I start to drink I just don't stop
I love the buzz it picks me up
Makes me feel like a million bucks
Thin the blood
Thin the blood
In the name of fun
You gotta Thin the blood
Coz I need to lose my mind
Forget today and burn the night
Coz I will have a good time
Even if I crash and burn tonight
Thin the blood
(Guitar Solo)
It's 5 o'clock and I'm ready to rock
Cold beer gonna hit the spot tonight
No more work coz I've knocked off
When I start to drink I just don't stop
I love the buzz it picks me up
Makes me feel like a million bucks
Thin the blood
Thin the blood
In the name of fun
You gotta Thin the blood
C'mon Thin the blood
Thin the blood
Thin the blood
