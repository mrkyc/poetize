Every single day oh it was a joy
I didn't really see until she said to me
Have you ever kissed a girl between the knees?
I said it's not just a memory
It's a gift the girl has given me
No it's more, it's a remedy
It's everything every woman needs
I'm Goin' Down Down Down Down Down On You
I'm Goin' Down Down Down Down Down On You
I'm Gonna eat you up
Down Down
Yeah I can't get enough
Down Down
All the way down, down on you
C'mon honey a 2 3 4
I can fix that bitter face
When I put mine in that place
Make your honey run coz I love the taste
Put me to the test I'm better than the rest
I'm gonna do to you what I can do best
It's not just a memory
It's a gift the girl has given me
No it's more, it's a remedy
It's everything every woman needs
