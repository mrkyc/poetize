I was flipping a record, when I heard you next door
I pulled back the curtains
Couldn't believe what I saw, what I saw
The gates of heaven where open wide
Wouldn't be a sin if I came inside
The wolf is at the door so I tried knockin'
But you couldn't hear me coz the house was rockin'
Your hands are moving with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex but you're all alone
Do Me Like You Do Yourself
C'mon Do Me Like You Do Yourself
I say Do Me Like You Do Yourself
C'mon Do Me Like You Do Yourself
I was flickin' your doorbell when you buzzed me inside
You said come up the stairwell
I've been waiting all night, all night long
I was late to the dance but not the party
You skipped the romance, started without me
Lying naked on your bed
You were doin' it with me in your head
Your hands are moving with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex but you're all alone

I say Do Me Like You Do Yourself
C'mon Do Me Like You Do Yourself
Your hands are moving with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex but you're all alone
Do Me Like You Do Yourself
