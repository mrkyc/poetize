Here you come, sucking my energy, and you
Suck it up right off the street, in a

Babydoll

Here you are, sucking my energy right up
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see, you are
You are so much bigger than me, you are
You are so much bigger than me, in a

Babydoll

My raw hand, my fever blister
Watch me, watch me, watch me disappear
Here she comes, her pants undone
All waste and void, all waste and void
And void, and void
Wow!

There you go in your Nazi car
Oh babydoll, what a whore you are, and you'll
Sit around with your old rag, how can I
How can I talk when you, you've got the gag?

Here you come, sucking my energy, and you
Suck it up, baby, right off the street, in a

Babydoll

In the dark I, I destroy what
What I became, what I destroy, yeah
She's hanging in the blossom tree, oh
Babydoll just bleeds for me, wow!

Babydoll

Babydoll, she's on the field, her
Chemical wedding, her chemical peel
I knife me, and I slash mine, and
I knife me, and I slash mine

Sick and sorry me, well
Here you are, as ugly as me, oh
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see, yeah
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see, yeah
Here you come, sucking my energy, and you
Suck it up, baby, right off the street, in my

Babydoll

She stares too long into the sun
Now I, I want a cancer that the crooked eye spun, well, you
You don't mind my energy, 'cause baby
You are so much bigger than me, wow!

Babydoll

Little girl, she's on the floor
She gets it all 'cause she's the whore
Little girl, she's on the ground
She gets it all for falling, falling down
Falling down
Wow!

"I am, I am," she says
"I am not free," she says
"Help me, I am withering
Withering, withering, withering"
Hang on, you'll get your soul
It's a soul
Hey, it's a soul, it comes down
