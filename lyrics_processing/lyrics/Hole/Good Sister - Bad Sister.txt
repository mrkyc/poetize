Good sister, bad sister
Better burn that dress, sister
Scar tissue, blood blister
Suck up on the dregs, sister
Wow!

I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad and

Good sister, bad sister
You're different from the rest, sister
Choke, strangle, rip, twist her
Sell me down the river, sister
Wow!

I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try, I try, I try

Come here and sit and talk about it just for a second
Before you sit back down
You're choking on big black bloody mouthfuls of it
You left me lying in your dog descent
And choking on your candy flesh
I'll be the biggest scar in your back
Run-down and jagged and naked and blind
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
Hey, want it back?
Hey, want it back?
You want it

Good sister, bad sister
Tell me what you want, sister
Better watch your back, sister
Even you cannot resist her
Wow!

I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't, and I try, I try
Sugar star comes down to talk to me
She comes to crucify all who believe
I am not your ruby degrees
And sugar comes from her arteries
I'll be the biggest scar
Run-down and jagged and naked and blind
I'll be the biggest scar in your sky
You want it bad
You want it bad
You want it bad
She's a, she is incredulous
And all of my apathy drips off her dress
She wants you in her descent
And choking on her candy flesh

I'll be the biggest scar in your back
Run down and jagged and make it back
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
Hey, want it back?
You want it back
