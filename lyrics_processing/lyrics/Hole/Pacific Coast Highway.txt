I knew a boy, he came from the sea
He was the only boy who ever knew the truth about me

I'm overwhelmed and undersexed
Baby, what did you expect?
I'm overwrought and so disgraced
I'm too ashamed to show my face

And they're coming to take me away now
What I want, I will never have
I'm on the Pacific Coast Highway
With your gun in my hands

Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands
Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands

I knew a boy, he left me so damaged
Do you even know the extent of what you ravaged?
You might also like
All this world's shame won't stop my arrival
And all this world's fame, drugs, plague won't stop my survival

I'm bloody and totally bound
I don't know what to do with my hands now
I surrender, I give in
I'll kick down your door if you don't let me in

And I've lost myself completely
I look to you, my shooting star
I'm on the Pacific Coast Highway
My God, how did you fall so hard?

Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands
Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands

And you know I'm drowning
And you know I'm drowning
And miles and miles of regret
It hasn't happened, and it won't happen yet
And days and days of perfect sex
And bad TV, oh I'll just try to forget
And miles and miles of regret
And miles and miles of regret

Pacific Coast Highway, so fast
Pacific Coast Highway, I crashed
Pacific Coast Highway, anguish
Pacific Coast Highway, you better leave
