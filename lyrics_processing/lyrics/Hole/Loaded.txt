Put on your coat and your little crown
That's the crown that you get for falling down
Hey baby, let me look in your eyes
I see you standing in a weird red light
The pump and grind that I call my head
The suck milk nebula I use instead
The sick cream clot and the sweet cream udder
The weird red light that pulls you under

Open my scar, let out my stars
Slut me open and suck my scars

And now I'm loaded
Yeah, now I'm loaded

Put on your coat and your little crown
That's the crown that you get when you fall down
Hey baby, won't you wave goodbye
As you go off to fuck your weird red light
The sun spits on your rawhide
As you dance to the sound of a suicide
You only laugh when you try to hide
That you're the rat poison daughter of a suicide
You might also like
Slut me open and suck my scars
Better open your eyes when I come down

And now I'm loaded
Yeah, now I'm loaded

Don't blush when I rip you open
Don't blush when I rip you open
Hey baby, let me look in your eyes
As you go off into your weird red light
The pump and grind that I call my head
The suck milk nebula I use instead
The sweet cream clot and the sick milk udder
The weird red light that pulls me under

You open and suck my scars
Better open your eyes when I come down

And now I'm loaded
I just get loaded
I just get loaded
I just get loaded
And now I'm loaded
So am I, so am I
And I, I just got, I just got, I just get, I just get, I just get loaded
