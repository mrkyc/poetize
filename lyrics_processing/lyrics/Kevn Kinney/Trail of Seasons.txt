I was trying to write a love song
It turned out to be the wrong song
She started to remember
As I sang about tomorrow
She was closing up the bookshop
Came walking like a gumshoe
Do you remember me
I used to go with you
I'm walking to the graveyard
I'm punching in at midnight
I'm waiting for the morning sun
To warm up the cobblestones

It's always nice to see an old friend again
How've you been? You changed your place
It's always nice to see an old friend again
Staying on the trail of seasons

Well, I met her at the Walgreens
For breakfast around noon
She was a talking up a blue streak
From the sky to the moon
You might also likeI wished upon a falling star
And I gave my wish to you
I didn't know he would hurt you
We can talk about that too
She wants to see a picture
I see you have a family
Adorned with holidays and lights
We can talk about that too

It's always nice to see an old friend again
How've you been? You changed your place
It's always nice to see an old friend again
Staying on the trail of seasons

How did two hippies in a U-Haul
Cross this country wide
Settle down and bide away
The rest of their lives
Gave her a hug and some cab fair
As we headed downtown
As I wheeled in the corner
I ran into a man
He said "I met you at the uptown
Do you remember my name?"
"Uh, no, it seems to have escaped me now
But it's all the same"
{Chorus: Kevn Kinney]
It's always nice to see an old friend again
How've you been? You changed your place
It's always nice to see an old friend again
Staying on the trail of seasons
It's always nice to see an old friend again
(You still living down the street, driving that same old car?)
It's always nice to see an old friend again
Staying on the trail of seasons
It's always nice to see an old friend again
How've you been? You changed your name
It's always nice to see an old friend again
Staying on the trail
Staying on the trail
Staying on the trail
