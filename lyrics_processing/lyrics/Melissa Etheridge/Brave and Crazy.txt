If I could have my way
I'd be sleeping in the alley
On a couch with a friend
And a bottle of gin
If I could have my way
I'd be runnin' with the circus
I would be tamin' all the lions
There'd be no denyin' I was
Brave and crazy
If I could have my way
I wouldn't be dreamin'. schemin', screamin'
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Tell me, what am I gonna do
About you?

If wishes were horses
This beggar would ride
I'd have my cake and eat it
With a little on the side
I'd never want for money
I'd never want for friends
I wouldn't have to make excuses
For the shape that I'm in
Shaking and crazy
Before I saw your eyes
I was in control of my soul, on the whole
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Tell me, what am I gonna do
About you?

Ah, cool as a rule
I wouldn't play nobody's fool
But I keep on talking
Ah, made in the shade
I had a perfect cue to fade
But I keep on walking
Baby, baby
I keep on walking

If I could have my way
I would check out right now
I'd say out to lunch honey, thanks a bunch
It wouldn't work out anyhow
This desire's too much
It's rented out my brain
It's showing previews of your body
Drivin' me insane
Baby, that's crazy
Ah, so all that I can do
Is to beg, plead, won't you tell me please
Tell me, what am I gonna do
About you?

Baby, what am I gonna do
About you?
Eh, ah, eh, no
I guess, I guess I just play, oh
Come on, now
Get up, get up
Ah
Eh, yeah, yeah
