10:03 on a Tuesday morning
In the fall of an American dream
A man is doing what he knows is right
On flight 93
He loved his mom and he loved his dad
He loved his home and he loved his man
But on that bloody Tuesday morning
He died an American
Now you cannot change this
You can't erase this
You can't pretend this is not the truth
(Up and down this road I go)
(Skippin' and dodgin')

Or teach your children in our schools
Because who he wants to love
Is breaking your Gods' rules
He stood up on a Tuesday morning
In the terror he was brave
And he made his choice
And without a doubt
A hundred lives he must have saved
Now you cannot change this
You can't erase this
You can't pretend this is not the truth
And the things you might take for granted
Your inalienable rights
Some might chose to deny him
Even though he gave his life
Can you live with yourself
In the land of the free
And make him less of a hero
Than the other three
Well, it might begin to change ya
In a field in Pennsylvania
Now you cannot change this
(Up and down this road I go)
And you can't erase this

Hear the bell now as it tolls
Wake up America
It's Tuesday morning
Come on, let's roll
