Why did you steal the matches
From the one room motel?
Once they gave you answers
Now they give you hell
They will never understand
They wonder where did they go wrong
How could you be so selfish?
Why can't you get along?

And as you pray in your darkness
For wings to set you free
You are bound to your silent legacy

You've seen it in the movies
And heard it on the street
Craving the affection
Your blood is full of heat
They don't listen to your reasons
As original as sin
Deny all that you feel
And they will bring you home again

And as you pray in your darkness
For wings to set you free
You are bound to your silent legacy

Your body is alive
But no one told you what you'd feel
The empty aching hours
Trying to conceal
The natural progression
Is the coming of your age
But they cover it with shame
And turn it into rage

And as you pray in your darkness
For wings to set you free
You are bound to your silent legacy

You are digging for the answers
Until your fingers bleed
To satisfy the hunger
To satiate the need
And they feed you on the guilt
To keep you humble, keep you low
Some man and myth they made up
A thousand years ago

And as you pray in your darkness
For wings to set you free
You are bound to your silent legacy
Mothers, tell your children:
"Be quick, you must be strong
Life is full of wonder
Love is never wrong"
Remember how they taught you
How much of it was fear
Refuse to hand it down
The legacy stops here

Oh my child
Oh my child
Hush
Hush my child
Oh my child
Oh my child
Oh my child
