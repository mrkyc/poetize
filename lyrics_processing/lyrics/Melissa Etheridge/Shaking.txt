Running down the road, breath is misty cold
Everything I touch leaves blood on the stone
The hounds are on my trail, I see the cross and nails
Everything is felt deep in my bones

But I tried, oh, I tried, how I tried
Every time I got close, I could never get inside
So I wait, oh, I wait, every night and day, I wait
But my fear is closing in and the ground has started

Shaking
All my dreams have started breaking
Hold me, honey, I'm still aching
I'm sorry, but I, I'm sorry, but I can't stop
I'm sorry, I just can't stop shaking, ha

I can't get away, every door I take
Leads me back into the maze
A laughter or a scream, everything's extreme
Come on, look at me, how much more can I take?

But I tried, oh, I tried, how I tried
Every time I got close, I could never get inside
So I wait, oh, I wait, every night and day, I wait
But my fear is closing in and the ground has started

I'm sorry, but I, I'm sorry, but I can't stop
I'm sorry, I just can't stop shaking, ha
I just can't stop shaking

Look me in the eyes, tell me you still believe
I can make it through the night, I just have to breathe
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Oh, I just can't stop
