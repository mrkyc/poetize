Lucky can be
Yeah
Right, baby
I saw you through
My blind intoxication
My shock induced
Insane self medication
You looked at me and smiled
Said: "Get ready to get wild
Sugar, you just need
A brief vacation"
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
I want to ride with my Angel
And live shockingly
I want to drive to the edge
And into the sea
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
I was dried up, I was starving
I was mangled
I looked like hell
Twisted up and tangled
You whispered in my ear:
"The ghosts are gone, it's clear
For too long, you've been tied up
You've been strangled"

Lucky can be
I want to ride with my Angel
And live shockingly
I want to drive to the edge
And into the sea
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
I don't want to ride
On the shotgun side
Don't want to be a quaint observer
On this super sonic ride
Double down
Split the aces
To the races
I feel lucky tonight
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
I want to ride with my angel
And live shockingly
I want to drive to the edge
And into the sea
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
I want to see just how lucky
Lucky can be
Ride with my angel
How I love being free
I want to drive to the edge
And into the sea
I want to see how lucky
Lucky can be
Yeah
(Lucky can be)
Come on
Right, right, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
I want to see just how lucky
Lucky can be
How lucky
Lucky can be
