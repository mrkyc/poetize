Showers of your crimson blood
Seep into a nation calling up a flood
Of narrow minds who legislate
Thinly veiled intolerance
Bigotry and hate
But they tortured you and burned you
They beat you and they tied you
They left you cold and breathing
For love they crucified you

I can't forget hard as I try
This silhouette against the sky

Scarecrow crying
Waiting to die
Wondering why
Scarecrow trying
Angels will hold
Carry your soul away

This was our brother
This was our son
This shepherd young and mild
This unassuming one
We all gasp "This can't happen here
We're all much too civilized
Where can these monsters hide?"
But they are knocking on our front door
They're rocking in our cradles
They're preaching in our churches
And eating at our tables

But I can't forget hard as I try
This silhouette against the sky

Scarecrow crying
Waiting to die
Wondering why
Scarecrow trying
Angels will hold
Carry your soul away

I search my soul
My heart and in my mind
To try and find forgiveness
This is someone's child
With pain unreconciled
Filled up with father's hate
Mother's neglect
I can forgive
But I will not forget

Scarecrow crying
Waiting to die
Wondering why
