Keep your eyes down
Keep your head lowered
Keep to yourself dear
Do not tell a soul
You know it's wrong
What they've been saying
And you knew all along
That I would have to go
Find a place where light shines on my reflection
A place where I can stand up on my own
Not down on my knees
Until then please

Meet me in the dark
Meet me in the shadows
Past the old graveyard
Down Eisenhower Road
Meet me where the storms
Blow out on their own, dear
Meet me in the dark
Never let me go

I know everyone
Has their unspoken fear
It eats away their senses
And their humanity
They carry all their secrets
Every night down to the river
And they try so hard to drown them
They won't do that to me
'Cause I'm working hard, saving all my money
And the tips in this jar will buy a brand new set of wings
For my Mercury
Until then please

Meet me in the dark
Meet me in the shadows
Past the old graveyard
On Eisenhower Road
Meet me where the storms
Blow out on their own, dear
Meet me in the dark
And never let me go

I could never hide this little light of mine
If God made a mistake then I should die before I wake
Maybe it's my fate to swim against this tide
Swallowing my pride

Keep your eyes down
Say that you don't know me
For I could not survive
If they took you away

Meet me in the dark
Meet me in the shadows
Past the old graveyard
Down Eisenhower Road
Meet me where the storms
Blow out on their own, dear
Meet me in the dark
Meet me in the dark
