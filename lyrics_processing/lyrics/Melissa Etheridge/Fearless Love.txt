Oh, oh, oh

When I woke up, I was 17
You kissed my lips in a bad, bad dream
Showed me things aren't what they appear to be
Called me angel and set me free
You gave me life in the cold, cold dark
But you ran away in the morning's spark
Made me think that reality
Oh, is not where I want to be

But I am what I am
And I am what I am afraid of
Oh, what am I afraid of?

I need a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
Oh, if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness
I want a fearless love
I won't settle for anything less

I've walked my path, had worlds collide
I lost my way and I fooled my pride
This lover's ache wouldn't feel so strange
If I could only change

But I am what I am
I am what I am afraid of
So, what am I afraid of?

I need a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
Oh, if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness
I want a fearless love
I won't settle for anything less

Now I'm not here to lay the blame
I understand when you hold a flame
Heads will shake, heads will turn
And sometimes you just get burned
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want a fearless love, oh
I need a fearless love
I want a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
Oh, if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness
I want a fearless love
I won't settle for anything
Anything less

Oh, I need a fearless love
I won't settle for anything less
Oh, oh, oh
I want a fearless love
