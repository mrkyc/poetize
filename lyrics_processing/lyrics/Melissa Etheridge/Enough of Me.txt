We were all wounded in some domestic war
I found you to settle my score
You looked like father
You felt like mother
My mind told my heart
There is no other

And I gave you my soul
And every ounce of control
And I gave you my skin
And my original sin
And I gave you my pride
And my side
Oh, my pride

Ain't that enough?
I turned your dreams into lightning
Ain't that enough?
I held the world back for you
Ain't that enough?
I loved you past the point of dying
Ain't that enough of me for you?

I was so sure one and one gave you one
My noisy love is coming undone
Now you leave like father
Disappointed like mother
And I know in my heart
There is no other

And I gave you my soul
And every ounce of control
And I gave you my shame
And my eternal flame
And I gave you my need
And my seed
Oh, my need

Ain't that enough?
I turned your dreams into lightning
Ain't that enough?
I held the world back for you
Ain't that enough?
I loved you past the point of dying
Ain't that enough of me for you?
Why can't you hold on?

And I gave you my soul
And every ounce of control
And I gave you my skin
And my original sin
And I gave you my shame
And my eternal flame
And I gave you my pride
And I gave you my side
And I gave you my need
And my seed
Oh, my need

Ain't that enough?
I turned your dreams into lightning
Ain't that enough?
I held the world back for you
Ain't that enough?
I loved you past the point of dying
Ain't that enough of me for you?
All your dreams into lightning
Ain't that enough?
I held the world back for you
Ain't that enough?
I loved you past the point of dying
Oh, ain't that enough of me for you?
