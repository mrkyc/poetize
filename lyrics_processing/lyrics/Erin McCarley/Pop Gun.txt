That on the ground
Throw the drama
Going up and down
I'm straight shooting
You can find it out
If you're gonna play the game
Standing up on your head
Fumbling words
Pulling my hair
Kicking up dirt
You're talking trash
And it's starting to work
Boy toy
I'm taking aim
I see the spark dancing in your eyes
Adrenaline sneaking up behind
No question, just tonight, out of your life
I got the way I want you
Load up, load up
Taking everything you got
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Straight for the heart
You might also likeGive it up, give it up
Yeah, you know want up
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Strung off my pop gun
I'm trigger happy
I tracked you down
Lock the door
Make a sound
In the dark
Feel your way around
Don't go
I dare you know
I see the spark racing in your eyes
No conversation, just an open mind
No question, this is the best night of your life
I got the way I want you
Load up, load up
Taking everything you got
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Straight for the heart
Give it up, give it up
Yeah, you know want up
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Strung off my pop gun
Load up, load up
Taking everything you got
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Straight for the heart
Give it up, give it up
Yeah, you know want up
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Strung off my pop gun
Better watch out
I'm loaded with a boy and gun
Bang bang
Better watch out
I'm loaded with a boy and gun
Bang bang
Better watch out
I'm loaded with a boy and gun
Bang bang
Better watch out a boy and gun
Load up, load up
Taking everything you got
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Straight for the heart
Give it up, give it up
Yeah, you know want up
Bu-bu-bang, bu-bu-bang
Strung off my pop gun
Load up, load up
