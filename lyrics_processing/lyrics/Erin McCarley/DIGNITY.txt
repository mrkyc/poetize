We're fighting for your freedom
We don't wanna bend back time now
They're yelling from the roof
Bananas slipping on the truth
And driving nails into my mind somehow
Are we living inside the upside down, baby?
Are we living inside the upside down? Maybe
Dignity ... Make your mind up
You know I know we're not alone
I thought that maybe we had grown up
Now there's silence on the radio
You keep on rising
I can't keep quiet
Whoa, Am I getting through to you?
Dignity ... make your mind up
Make your mind up
Make your mind up
Diamonds in their eyes
Blood shot into the sky
He's got you puffing up your chest, big boy
They're mining for the gold
Same shit; it's getting old
Sending rockets to shock us
140 don't block us
Are we living inside the upside down, baby?
Are we living inside the upside down, maybe
