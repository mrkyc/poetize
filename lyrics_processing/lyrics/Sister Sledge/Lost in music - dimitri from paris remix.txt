Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music
Have you ever seen
Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind. huh
Responsibility
To me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh
I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody
That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music
Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight
The band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity
To me, it's my sanity
I could never survive
Some people ask me
What are you gonna be
Why don't you go get a job, uh-uh
All that I could say
I won't give up my music
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh... oh...
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)
We're lost in music
We're lost in music (Don't take our away our music)
Feel so alive (Feel)
I quit (I quit) my 9 to 5 (Yeah)
We're lost in music
We're lost in music (Melody is good to me)
Caught in a trap (I'm caught up in it)
No turnin' back (No, no, no)
We're lost in music (Ooh... doo doo doo doo doo doo)
We're lost in music (La da da da da da da da, mmm... hmm...)
Feel so alive
I quit (I quit) my 9 to 5
We're lost in music (Lost in music)
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
