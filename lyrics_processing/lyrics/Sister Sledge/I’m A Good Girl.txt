I don't like it no, honey
I don't know what's come over me
I must lose control
You see I'm a good girl
Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey
I don't know what's come over me
I must lose control of my senses
If (there weren't?) I don't want you baby
Can't stop the feeling
It just seems to happen
And if (there when?)
I don't need you baby
I can't help myself
You always see through it
I don't know what is this feeling I feel
I don't like it no, honey
I don't know what's come over me
I must lose control
You see I'm a good girl
