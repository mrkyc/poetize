Using mama's makeup and sister's fake I.D
Out on the dance floor where I wanted to be
With the fever going 'round, everybody say shake
My legs were moving, having so much fun
So glad I didn't wait til I was twenty-one
Livin' up the good times, we were second to none
With the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake) shake me down
Shake me down
(Shake me down)

Used to be a model of agency
Now I'm a lady and I'm living out my dreams
Out on the dance floor where I'll always be
With the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake), shake me down
Shake me down
Music is driving me wild
And I just want you to move my body
Let no one cramp my style
When the others shake it up
Shake, shake, shake me down, hey, hey
Shake
