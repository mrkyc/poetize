We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine-to-five
We're lost in music

Have you ever seen some people lose everything?
First to go is their mind (Huh)
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh
I want to join a band and play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody, that's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine-to-five
We're lost in music

Mmm-hmm, in the spotlight, the band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity, to me, it's my sanity
I could never survive
Some people ask me, "What are you gonna be?
Why don't you go get a job?" Uh-uh
All that I could say, "I won't give up my music"
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music (Don't take our away our music)
Feel so alive (Feel)
I quit my nine-to-five  (I quit, yeah)
We're lost in music
We're lost in music (Melody is good to me)
Caught in a trap (I'm caught up in it)
No turnin' back (No, no, no)
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine-to-five (I quit)
We're lost in music (Lost in music)
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine-to-five
We're lost in music
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
