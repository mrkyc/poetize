We're lost in music, we're- we're lost in music
We're lost in music, we're lost-
We're lost in music
We're lost in music, we're lost-
We're lost in music, we're-
We're lost in music, we're-
We're lost in music, we're- we're-
We're lost in music, we're lost-
Lost in music

We're lost in music, caught in a trap (Lost in music, lost in music, lost-)
No turnin' back, we're lost in music (Lost- lost- lost in music)
We're lost in music, feel so alive (Lost in music, lost in-)
I quit my nine-to-five, we're lost in music (Music, music, music, music, music, music)

Have you ever seen, some people lose everything
First to go is their mind? Huh
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh
I want to join a band and play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody, that's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight, the band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity, to me, it's my sanity
I could never survive
Some people ask me, "What are you gonna be?
Why don't you go get a job?" Uh-uh
All that I could say, I won't give up my music
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh... oh...

We're lost in music, caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back, we're lost in music (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)
We're lost in music, feel so alive
