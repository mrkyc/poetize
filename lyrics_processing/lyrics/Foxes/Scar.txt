We were banging on the doors of heaven before
But we didn't have a chance in hell
Still I tried to save it
My soul hit the floor and it hurt to the core
And I didn't have nobody to tell
Didn't want to face it

You cut me deep
It hurt to feel
It's taken time
But wounds, they heal

Now you're just a scar, a story I tell
Such an ugly mark, but I wear it so well
Like, oh well, oh well
Now you're just a scar, a time that I fell
For someone who didn't love me well
Like, oh well, oh well

There used to be a time I couldn't sleep at night
No, I couldn't dry my eyes
Now I'm done crying
There used to be a time you took all my light
Like nothing was left to find
Now my lights are blinding
You might also like
You cut me deep
It hurt to feel
It's taken time
But wounds, they heal

Now you're just a scar, a story I tell
Such an ugly mark, but I wear it so well
Like, oh well, oh well
Now you're just a scar, a time that I fell
For someone who didn't love me well
Like, oh well, oh well

Now you're just a scar, a story I tell
Such an ugly mark, I wear it so well
Now you're just a scar, a time that I fell
For someone who didn't love me
Someone who didn't love me (Oh)

Now you're just a scar, a story I tell
Such an ugly mark, but I wear it so well
Like, oh well, oh well (Oh)
Now you're just a scar, a time that I fell
For someone who didn't love me well
Like, oh well, oh well
Now you're just a scar, a story I tell
