Show me love
Better love
Show me love
Better love

I cried myself to sleep again
You lie right there, but I've learned nothin'
I do my best to ease your pain
And here we are, but we've learned nothin'

And it's killin' me
When I'm in your arms, I forget the darker days
And it's hauntin' me
These feet of mine won't let me march away

Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
You might also like
I hurt myself again today
You lie right there, and you say nothing
I do my best to leave this pain
But here we are, and we've learned nothing

And it's killin' me
When I'm in your arms, I forget the darker days
And it's hauntin' me
These feet of mine won't let me march away

Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love

Show me love
Better love
Show me love
Better love
And it's killin' me
When I'm in your arms, I forget the darker days
And it's hauntin' me
These feet of mine won't let me march away

Show me a better love, a better love (Better love, show me a)
A better love, love (Better, better love)
Show me a better love, a better love (Better love, show me a)
Better love, love (Better, better love)
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love

Show me love
