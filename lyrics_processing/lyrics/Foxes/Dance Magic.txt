I know you like when we fight
Gets you where you want to be
I know we try to play nice
But baby, tell me honestly

We wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that
Wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that

But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)
But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)

But when we wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that
But when we wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that
You might also like
So on and off, I lose sight
In what everybody else can see
We drink too much to lose touch
And I know it's not good for me

We wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that
Wake up to break up, it's better, right?
Make up to break up, you like it like that

But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)
But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)

Maybe we just live for drama
Swallow and repeat it
Hate it, need it, starve it, feed it
Make our bed, get in it
But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)
But when we dance magic, oh
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic
(So, so tragic)
But when we dance magic, oh (We wake up to break up, it's better, right?)
When you kiss me like I need it, so tragic (Make up to break up, you like it like that)
But when we dance magic, oh (Wake up to break up, it's better, right?)
