Tell a lie
Tell a lie that makes me want to stay
Give me something out of nothing, if it's not too late
If it's real
If it's real, I guess I'll feel the pain
Coming closer, out of focus

Oh, and it's hard to
It's hard to love someone who can't be loved
But it's what you do
It's what you do

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you

Losing me
Carelessly, you sacrifice
Give me something out of nothing, if it's not too late
Did you steal or borrow me and all my life?
Coming closer, out of focus

Oh, and it's hard to
It's hard to love someone who can't be loved
But it's what you do
It's what you do

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you

All I do is pray, and it's keeping me awake
When I try to leave, I think that you need me, do you?
Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
'Cause I'm still bound to you, bound to you

There's a line that pulls me back to you
There's only so much I can do
A bind that holds the spark wrapped around my heart
There's only so much I can do when you got me bound to you

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
'Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
All I do is pray, and it's keeping me awake
When I try to leave, I think that you need me, do you?
Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
But I'm still bound to you, bound to you

I'm still bound to you, bound to you
I'm still bound to you, oh
I'm still bound to you, oh
