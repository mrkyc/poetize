Do what you want
Do what you wanna
Do what you wanna
Do what you wanna

When I look at you the drums all start beating
And I just don't know if I'm ready or not to do it all again

See, I got a wild heart and I can't control it
It keeps on letting me down

I know, with you, tonight could be amazing
Be amazing
I'm scared to death
Still, I'm stood here waiting
Here waiting

Do what you want
(Do what you wanna)
Take a hold of me
(Do what you wanna)
'Cause my heart keeps saying
(Do what you wanna)
That you're all I need
(Do what you wanna)
You might also like
With a touch, you bring me back to life
I'm rising
And I don't even know if I'll survive, but I'm all in

See, I got a wild heart and I can't control it
It keeps on letting me down

I know, with you tonight could be amazing, be amazing
I'm scared to death
Still, I'm stood here waiting, here waiting

Do what you want
(Do what you wanna)
Take a hold of me
(Do what you wanna)
'Cause my heart keeps saying
(Do what you wanna)
That you're all I need
(Do what you wanna)

Should be running away tonight
Should be finding a place to hide
But I'm starting to feel alive
I know, with you, tonight could be, oh
Should be running away tonight
Should be finding a place to hide
But I'm starting to feel alive
I know, with you, tonight could be, oh
I know, with you, tonight could be amazing
Be amazing
I'm scared to death
Still, I'm stood here waiting
Here waiting

Do what you want
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me)
Take a hold of me
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me)
'Cause my heart keeps saying
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me)
That you're all I need
(Do what you wanna)
You're all I need

Do what you want
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now)
Take a hold of me
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now)
'Cause my heart keeps saying
(Do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now)
That you're all I need
