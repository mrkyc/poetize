Feet don't fail me now
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
You're all I got
So, feet don't fail me now
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
You're all I got

You were all my riches
Spent my love 'til there was nothing left
You were all my sickness
But you cured me of my loneliness

And I lost faith
Nothing left here to say
The ghost of us is fading
And that's what I was chasing
I got faith
Saying it'll be okay
Step by step, I know I'll make it through

So, I'm saying, oh, now
Gotta go now
Oh no, nothing's gonna bring me down
So I gotta reach out
There's a way out
Praying, feet don't fail me now
You're all I got
You might also like
Second chances
Don't come easy like they did the first time
All the neighbors
Knew it was done before you and I

And I lost faith
Nothing left here to say
The ghost of us is fading
And that's what I was chasing
I got faith
Saying it'll be okay
Step by step, I know I'll make it through

So, I'm saying, oh, now
Gotta go now
Oh no, nothing's gonna bring me down
So I gotta reach out
There's a way out
Praying, feet don't fail me now

Take what you want, baby
Take what you need, baby
You can have it all, but you can't have me
So I'm saying, oh, now
Gotta go now
Praying, feet don't fail me now

Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me)
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me)
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me)
You're all I got
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me)
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me)
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now (Don't fail me now)
You're all I  got
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
You're all I got
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
Feet don't fail, don't fail me now
You're all I got

Feet don't fail me now
Don't fail me now, don't fail me now
