Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky, and started walking
Leaving our footprints on the ground
It might be a prayer
Or maybe a piece of conversation
Wherever we go we make a sound

So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know, is we're here tonight
Turn up the lights

Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life, and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I wanna drive
I wanna drive into the open
Looking for reasons I can't find
You might also like
So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know, is we're here tonight
Turn up the lights

Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
I need to it let go, let it go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know
Is that I need you here or you'll be gone forever
Turn up the lights
Turn up the lights
Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
I need to it let go, let it go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky, and started walking
