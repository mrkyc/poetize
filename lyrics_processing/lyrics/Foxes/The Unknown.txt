Walking with the humans
But I don't think I'm like them at all
We're all wearing the same suits
But it doesn't seem right anymore
Dreaming in the daylight
And they say that we're going nowhere
Looking for the unsung
If I listen, I know I can hear

And I can't see a reason for this method without madness
Going on

Living for the young ones, can't ignore the feeling
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living under one roof, I don't even know you
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living for the young ones, when they gonna listen?
I just need a reason, living in a world without one

Is it magic that makes us
Or is there something in the blue sky?
We're all speaking with the same tongue
But I know that we don't think alike
Walking through the unknown
Let's make sure we don't do it alone
I just need a reason
Just to know that I'm doing right
You might also like
And I can't see a reason for this method without madness
Going on

Living for the young ones, can't ignore the feeling
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living under one roof, I don't even know you
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living for the young ones, when they gonna listen?
I just need a reason, living in a world without one

And I can't see a reason
We can't leave tonight
Build it up and go
I can't keep holding what you want

Living for the young ones, can't ignore the feeling
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living under one roof, I don't even know you
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living for the young ones, when they gonna listen?
