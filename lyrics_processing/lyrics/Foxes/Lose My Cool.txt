You give me that dumb old line
What can we do to stay side by side?
And who, who you gonna be this time?
You got my head all unleveled on every side

You make me lose my cool
I would give you anything
Bad love on a good day, lose my cool
I get nothing in reply
I'm hooked, don't know why
Don't know why

I'm still hanging on, hanging on
You got me heated up
You make me lose my, you make me lose my
Hanging on, hanging on
I just can't get enough
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my, you make me lose my

I'm caught in this dangerous ride
What we gonna do?
Am I alone this time?
Don't try and turn this around
You should be ready, ready
Or are we tied up, bound?
You might also like
You make me lose my cool
I would give you anything
Bad love on a good day, lose my cool
I get nothing in reply
I'm hooked, don't know why
Don't know why

I'm still hanging on, hanging on
You got me heated up
You make me lose my, you make me lose my
Hanging on, hanging on
I just can't get enough
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my

Sometimes I think we could both have it better
Don't you?
But it's like a mountain that blocks the horizon
I only see you

Hanging on, hanging on; you make me lose my
Hanging on, hanging on; you make me lose my
Hanging on, hanging on; you make me lose my
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
I'm hanging on, hanging on
You got me heated up
You make me lose my, you make me lose my
Hanging on, hanging on
I just can't get enough
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
You make me lose my, you make me lose my cool
