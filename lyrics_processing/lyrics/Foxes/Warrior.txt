When the monsters aren't sleeping under your bed
They've crawled out from under and into your head
And outside, the cold gets into your skin
And you need someone to keep the light in
To send your wishes into the air
Someone listens someone is there
And you won't know anything about it
Until you have to live without it

Chasing the fire for you
Light in the nightmare
Watching from high above you
If you can make it then

The sun will rise
It doesn't matter
If you close your eyes
Before you wake up
I'll keep you safe tonight
Cause I am a warrior
And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight

The wheels are moving behind the face
The arms are directing the time and the place
And you only have to do the traveling
You don't have to design the engine
You might also like
Doing the fighting for you
Breaking the walls down
Finding the right way with you
If you can make it then

The sun will rise
It doesn't matter
If you close your eyes
Before you wake up
I'll keep you safe tonight
Cause I am a warrior
And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight

If you wake up in darkness
Before the dawn breaks
There is a strength in sadness
Magic in mistakes

Chasing the fire for you
Light in the nightmare
Watching from high above you
If you can make it then
The sun will rise
It doesn't matter
If you close your eyes
Before you wake up
I'll keep you safe tonight
Cause I am a warrior
And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight
The sun will rise
It doesn't matter
If you close your eyes
Before you wake up
I'll keep you safe tonight
Cause I am a warrior
