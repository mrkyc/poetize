I can hear your thoughts
Oh, please don't leave me now
I can't sleep alone
Chasing the light until the dawn
Thought we left a trail back to the way that it was
I can see it now
In your eyes you let it fall

Running in a crypt of a thousand words
Hiding in the dark when the violence starts
Looking for a sign we've gone too far (too far)

Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games, turn out the lights
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Time for a change
'Cause the devil, he sleeps in your head
Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games, turn out the lights
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Didn't you say we would stay, 'til we heard the last echo, echo, echo?

Look into my eyes
Do you see something to defend?
Spinning in the lights
Will I grow old before I die?
Silence is a curse
I feel it breaking the ice
I can see you now
In your eyes you let it fall
You might also like
Running in a crypt of a thousand words
Hiding in the dark when the violence starts
Looking for a sign we've gone too far  (too far)

Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games, turn out the lights
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Time for a change
'Cause the devil, he sleeps in your head
Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games, turn out the lights
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Didn't you say we would stay, 'til we heard the last echo, echo, echo?

Yeah yeah, oh-ho-oh-ho-eh, oh-ayo
Yeah yeah, oh-ho-oh-ho-eh, oh-ayo
Yeah yeah, oh-ho-oh-ho-eh, oh-ayo
Yeah yeah, oh-ho-oh-ho-eh, oh-ayo

You got the beat inside
Turn out the guiding lights
The dark is on your side
You got the beat in
You got the beat inside
Turn out the guiding lights
The dark is on your side
You got the beat in
You got the beat inside
Turn out the guiding lights
The dark is on your side
You got the beat in
You got the beat inside
Turn out the guiding lights
The dark is on your side
You got the beat in
