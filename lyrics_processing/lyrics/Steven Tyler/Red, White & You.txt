Right now, nothing else matters
You and me and the Georgia night
Look around cause it don't get any better
Have you ever felt so alright?

Let's dance, take it slow
Tom Petty on the radio
And we're singing 'bout American girls like you
When I look in your eyes, all I want to do is

Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and

You pulling me a little bit closer
Heart beating like a big bass drum
We spinning on a roller coaster
Free falling into your yum yum
You might also like
All the bad girls rocking in cut-off jeans
And good ol' boys driving big machines
And you can kiss my ass, can't help but say
It's good to be born in the USA

Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you
Baby, sweet potato pie
All I need is red, white and
Baby, what we gonna do
And honey, don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is
Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you
Baby, baby, all I need is red, white and you
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
