I hope your doubts come like monsters
And terrorize your dreams
I hope you feel the lonely hopelessness
'Cause no one else believes
I hope you question whether you
Ever really had a chance at all
I hope your fear is thick like poison
That gets into your blood
I hope you push until you cannot breathe
And it's still not enough
I hope you put your life out on the line
And everybody watches while you fall

'Cause I love you more than you could know
And your heart, it grows every time it breaks
I know that it might sound strange
But I wish you pain
Wish you pain
It's hard to say
But I wish you pain

I hope people break their promises
And leave you in the cold
I hope they beat your heart to pieces
Worse than you've ever known
I hope you finally arrive
Only to find you're nowhere close
I hope you cry and tears come streaming down your face
I hope this life traps you in more
Than you thought you could ever take
I hope the help you want never comes
And you do it on your own
You might also like
'Cause I love you more than you could know
And your heart, it grows every time it breaks
I know that it might sound strange

But I wish you pain
Wish you pain
It's hard to say
But I wish you pain

I love you more than you could even know
Been here before and I just wanna see you grow
Want you to grow

'Cause everything that matters most
That's where it goes by a different name
I know that it might sound strange

But I wish you pain
I wish you pain
It's hard to say
Wish you pain
I love you more than you could even know
I've been here before and I just wanna see you grow
