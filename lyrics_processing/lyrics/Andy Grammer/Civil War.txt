If I ever get to Heaven, gonna walk up to his desk and say
"Got a couple questions
Wonder whether you can answer me
You put everything together
Yeah, you made me just the way I am
If you're a lover that can tell me, then please help me understand"

Why you put good into my heart
Then tease me with evil since the day I was born?
Guilty and confused, I ripped myself apart
When you always knew I'd be a civil war
That I'd be a civil war, that I'd be a civil war
What'd you make me that way for?
That I'd be a civil war

Now I've been living with my demons
They've been eating at me every day
I like change 'round my neck
Most nights get the best of me
And I'm ashamed, I'm amazed, I'm afraid of the wicked I need
And I'm sure there's silver lining, and I'm trying, but I cannot see

Why you put good into my heart
Then tease me with evil since the day I was born?
Guilty and confused, I ripped myself apart
When you always knew I'd be a civil war
That I'd be a civil war, that I'd be a civil war
Now, what'd you make me that way for?
I'd be a civil war
You might also like
'Cause damn it, I'm tired and I wanna change
But you put it right into my DNA
So just for one evening, I curse your name
And ask why the hell do You do this to me?

Why would you put, why would you put
Why you put good into my heart
Then tease me with evil since the day I was born?
Guilty and confused, I ripped myself apart
When you always knew I'd be a civil war
That I'd be a civil war, that I'd be a civil war
Now, what'd you make me that way for?
