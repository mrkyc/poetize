Yeah, I've met your demons, but they do not scare me
I know they'll be angels once they learn to fly
I've seen all your seasons, your cold Februarys
I know you'll be blooming in a matter of time

What I'm saying is I get you, get you
Nothing we can't get through
If I see you going down that road, then I won't let you
I'll catch you no matter how far you fall

'Cause the best of me loves the best of you
And all the rest, I can see right through
You trust in me and I'll trust you too
'Cause the best of me loves the best of you

Oh, oh
Oh

You've seen my dark side and danced with my shadow
You never run from, run from a fight
Now I'll be your ally through all the battles
And I know, and I know, and I know it'll be alright
You might also like
What I'm saying is you know me, know me
Wrestled with the old me
Saved me at my lowest, all you had to do was hold me
Console me no matter how far I fall

'Cause the best of me loves the best of you
And all the rest, I can see right through
You trust in me and I'll trust you too
'Cause the best of me loves the best of you

Oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh

Yeah, I've met your demons, but they do not scare me
I know they'll be angels once they learn to fly

Yeah, I'm telling you the best of me loves the best of you
And all the rest, I can see right through
You trust in me and I'll trust you too
'Cause the best of me loves the best of you
Oh, oh (The best of me)
Oh (The best of you)
Oh, oh (The best of me)
Oh
