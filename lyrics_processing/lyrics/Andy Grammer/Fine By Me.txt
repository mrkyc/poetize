You're not the type, type a girl
To remain with a guy, with a guy too shy too afraid
To say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart
But with you, you, you I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start
And it seems that every time we're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you, that I don't wanna lose
You might also like
And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

And it's never easy
But darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
But when I think of life without us
It seems like what we're supposed to do
But I don't wanna come on too strong

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
It's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can lay like this forever
