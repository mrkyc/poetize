Yeah, your mom threw up three times again
Having a hard time keeping down the vitamins
Goes from laughing to crying to smiling
Couple times, real close to being violent, hey oh
We're not really parents, but we kinda are
You're gonna call me "Dad," shit, that's bizarre
Yesterday, couple kids making out in cars
Now I'm staring at a screen of your beating heart

She been in the lab, cooking you up
Damn, you growing fast, it's like you in a rush
Don't know if you can hear, that's why I get close
Singing to her belly just to let you know

Somebody loves you, you got a friend
Even if you don't know it yet
Somebody loves you, we're making plans
Waiting for your spaceship to land

I still cook most dinners in the microwave
And my plants all died over the holidays
And I don't know how I'm gonna ever pay
For the Ivy League school you gon' graduate
And I'ma be there learning right beside you
Probably teach me more than I can teach you
But I promise you I'm always gonna show up
Might be the only thing that I'm really sure of
You might also like
Is you'll become a kid, and I'll become a man
But first, we're gonna crawl, together we'll stand
Ain't sure if you can hear, that's why I get close
Singing to her belly just to let you know

Somebody loves you, you got a friend
Even if you don't know it yet
Somebody loves you, we're making plans
Waiting for your spaceship to land

Yeah, it's crazy, 'cause if I'm singing to you
Then my mom up in heaven's probably singing to me, too
Edges of the world makes some damn good music
Gotta close your eyes and listen to it
Yeah, it's crazy, 'cause if I'm singing to you

Somebody loves you, we're making plans
Waiting for your spaceship to land

Whoa, waiting, whoa, waiting
Waiting for your spaceship to land
Whoa, whoa, whoa, just waiting, whoa, waiting
