I like the way, like the way that I look in your eyes
And I like the place, like the place I take up in your mind
I fall on my face, never judgmental
See, I see mistakes, you see potential

I been afraid, been afraid if I open the door
That all of my pain will come out and roll out on the floor
And it did, and it does, but you still pick it up
You find a way to see the good in me

I know I'm a lot to handle
And I know that my heart's a handful
Even in the dark, somehow you see
The good in me, good in me
I know that I'm far from perfect
And you say that my flaws are worth it
Even when it's hard, I know you see
The good in me, good in me

I'm like a flood, like a flood, I get carried away
Yeah, sayin' too much, lotta things that I don't mean to say
But you give me space, showin' me patience
And maybe we bend, but we never break it

And I know that my heart's a handful
Even in the dark, somehow you see
The good in me, good in me
I know that I'm far from perfect
And you say that my flaws are worth it
Even when it's hard, I know you see
The good in me, good in me

Woah, oh
The good in me, good in me
Woah
The good in me, good in me
Woah, oh
The good in me, good in me
Woah

I know I'm a lot to handle
And I know that my heart's a handful
Even in the dark, somehow you see
