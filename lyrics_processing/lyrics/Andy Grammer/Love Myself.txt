(I'ma find a way to finally feel it)

I want to love myself without needing someone else
To say it, say it to me (Say it, say it to me)
I want to love myself without needing someone's help
To show it, show it to me, mm, ayy

'Cause I can be mean in my mind
Beat myself up all the time with awful thoughts
And I can eat myself alive
I'm gonna try, it's gonna be an awkward talk, but

I love you, I don't say it enough
I love who you are, who you've become
Don't know why I cannot hear it
'Less it comes from someone else
But I'ma find a way to finally feel it
When I say it to myself

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When I say it to myself
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I want to be someone who's not swayed by opinions
Be me authentically without the apologies
And want my heart to soar without being insecure
And point out what's wrong with me
'Cause sometimes subconsciously

Yeah, I can be mean in my mind
Beat myself up all the time with awful thoughts
And I can eat myself alive
I'm gonna try, it's gonna be an awkward talk, but

I love you, I don't say it enough
I love who you are, who you've become
Don't know why I cannot hear it
'Less it comes from someone else
But I'ma find a way to finally feel it
When I say it to myself

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When I say it to myself
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I want to love myself without needing someone else
To say it, say it to me

I love you, I don't say it enough
I love who you are, who you've become
Don't know why I cannot hear it
'Less it comes from someone else
But I'ma find a way to finally feel it
When I say it to myself

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When I say it to myself
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When I say it to myself
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
