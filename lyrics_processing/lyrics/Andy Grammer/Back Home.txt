I'm gon' need you to raise your glass
I don't care what you put in it
Here's to nights that you can't take back
We live hard, but we love to laugh
We all thought that we'd get rich fast
Hop the plane out for greener grass
Found out the greenest cash
Don't compare to the friends that last

See, we won't forget where we came from
The city won't change us
We beat to the same drum
No, we won't forget where we came from
The city can't change us
We beat to the same drum, the same drum

La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
You might also like
So here's to the cheap sunglasses
Redbull and minivans and
People who had your back when
The world didn't understand

See, we won't forget where we came from
The city won't change us
We beat to the same drum
No, we won't forget where we came from
The city can't change us
We beat to the same drum, the same drum

La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home

When ties loosen, we're losin' touch and fading away
We'll still be raisin' our cups to the same damn things
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us, won't change us
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-do
It don't matter where we go
We always find our way back home
We always find our way back home
