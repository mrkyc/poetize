You never got to meet your grandma did ya?
Every night, I got you kissin' on her picture
Cuts me up that you will never listen
To the sweet, sweet sound of her voice
I could tell you she was quite the mixture
Of a mama and a shaman and a fiery pistol
Truth is, she's right there in you
She's a part of you, you don't have a choice

My dear, you will feel her
In your mind, you will hear her
And if she could use words, use words

She'd say
"You're beautiful, but don't you overplay that card"
She'd say
"You're spiritual, so don't ever forget that part"
She'd say
"You are so much stronger than you even think you are
Let your heart, let your heart lead the way"
That's what she'd say
You might also like
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo
That's what she'd say
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-hoo-hoo

She said, "Take care of your sisters, I mean the whole world
Spend your days tryna lift up other girls
You came with love, a purpose, and your mother's curls
I'll be with you every step of the way, ayy
Don't live your life tryna blend in, stick out
Trust your gut and don't you get into those doubts
Remember God is like the sun, he always comes out
Just when you think the dark's here to stay"

My dear, you will feel her
In your mind, you will hear her
And if she could use words, use words

She'd say
"You're beautiful, but don't you overplay that card"
She'd say
"You're spiritual, so don't ever forget that part"
She'd say
"You are so much stronger than you even think you are
Let your heart, let your heart lead the way"
That's what she'd say
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo
That's what she'd say
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-hoo-hoo

She'd say, "Listen to your daddy
In his voice, you will hear me
I know he will sing my song to you
And know that I'm happy
And you'll always have me
I'm watching everything you do"

She'd say
"You're beautiful, but don't you overplay that card"
She'd say
"You're spiritual, so don't ever forget that part"
She'd say
"You are so much stronger than you even think you are
Let your heart, let your heart lead the way"
That's what she'd say

Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo
That's what she'd say
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-hoo-hoo
