You and me will be always

I'll be honest, there's a lot that I don't know
So much of this is out of our control
And the hardest thing can be learning to let go
'Cause there's a short, short list of people in it for the long haul

Now, see, your clothes your shoes and your best friends
They ain't gonna stay the same
Your reckless years and your mistakes
I promise you, they fade away
But trust me, the one thing that nothing in this world can change
Hey, you and me will be always
Always, you and me will be always

Gonna love all the versions of yourself that you'll try
Let you go through your phases, cheer you on from the side
And the sweetest thing is just knowing that you've got love
From the short, short list of the people in it for the long haul

Now, see, your clothes your shoes and your best friends
They ain't gonna stay the same
Your reckless years and your mistakes
I promise you, they fade away
But trust me, the one thing that nothing in this world can change
Hey, you and me will be always
Always, you and me will be always

I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be your always always
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be your always always
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be your always always
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be your always always
Hey, you and me will be always

Now, see, your clothes your shoes and your best friends
They ain't gonna stay the same
Your reckless years and your mistakes
I promise you, they fade away
But trust me, the one thing that nothing in this world can change
Hey, you and me will be always
