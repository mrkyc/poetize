Do you wanna be
My love, my sight
My heart and my eyes
My world, my pride
My stars in my sky?
I am looking for a queen who's more than gorgeous on a movie screen
I am looking for the cover girl of Dignified Beauty magazine
I want dimples and simple symbols that she's sweet
Wrinkles on her nose expose what I mean
I am looking for a four-course meal that isn't based in base desire
I am looking for a lady who knows the soul is more than an appetizer

Oh, just one more thing, yeah
Oh, just one more thing, no

Do we fit in the pocket?
Can we fit, sit back in the pocket?
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking? Not knocking, no
See, I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and back beat to lock in
I wanna know real love's not forgotten, not forgotten
You might also like
I want a teacher who's eager to speak her mind
Delicate features, sweet with her tongue so kind
I am looking for the markers that say "permanent" so we can share
I am looking for a love that's still alive and well in rocking chairs
I want faithful and stable, able to grow
Beauty that moves me, improves my soul
I am looking for a shining light who likes to fight and persevere
I am looking for a lady who wants to make me part of her atmosphere

Oh, just one more thing
Oh, just one more thing, no

Do we fit in the pocket?
Can we fit, sit back in the pocket?
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking? Not knocking, no
See, I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and back beat to lock in
I wanna know real love's not forgotten, not forgotten

Said all I need to know is
All I need to know is
All I need to know is
Are you clear on who you are?
Do you love it?
When this world starts getting hard
Will you rise above it, rise above it?
In the pocket?
Can we fit, sit back in the pocket?
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking? Not knocking, no
See, I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and back beat to lock in
I wanna know real love's not forgotten, not forgotten
I said the pocket
Can we fit, sit back in the pocket?
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking? Not knocking, no
See, I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and back beat to lock in
I wanna know real love's not forgotten, not forgotten

Sayin', "Ohh, na na na na na"
