When I met you, love, I hadn't done the dirty yet (Seriously?)
Called me a unicorn, said that I didn't exist
Truth is my card was torn, the V had a couple of rips
But I was still holding on to the edge with my finger tips

With a little bit of prayer, a little bit of porn (Sorry)
Couple long nights sleeping on my own
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know that

I was holding out for you
Yeah, I was holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah they all hate us
Cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you, oh yeah

And a couple times, thought I might not make it
Laying on the bed, both of us half naked
Looking in her eyes, something in my heart said save it
Here we go again, another awkward conversation

With a little bit of prayer, a little bit of porn (Sorry)
Couple long nights sleeping on my own
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know that
You might also like
I was holding out for you
Yeah, I was holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah they all hate us
Cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you, oh yeah

Cupid's secret is love starts before you need it
Cupid's secret is love starts before you need it
Cupid's secret is love starts before you need it
Cupid's secret is love starts before you need it

With a little bit of prayer, a little bit of porn (Sorry)
Couple long nights sleeping on my own
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know that

I was holding out for you
Yeah, I was holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah they all hate us
Cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you, oh yeah
Holding out for you (Love starts before you need it)
I was holding out for you (Love starts before you need it)
And the neighbors yeah they all hate us
Cause they say that we go too loud (Love starts before you need it)
