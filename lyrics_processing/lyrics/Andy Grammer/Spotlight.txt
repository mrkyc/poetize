Told myself I wasn't gonna be this way
But here I am in Hollywood tryna promote my face
Yeah, my mama raised me to be a humble man
But then you sing a couple songs and get some compliments and
Once you get it, you try to stretch it
You pull out all of the stops (All of the stops)
You get used to the rush it's giving you
Who are you when it's gone?

Hey, am I even alive if I don't shine in the spotlight?
The stage is getting overcrowded, how we fight for the limelight
Am I anybody if nobody sees me?
Am I anybody if nobody wants to be me? Yeah
Hey, am I even alive if I don't shine in the spotlight?

Look, comparison killing my joy (Ayy)
Still tryna fill in the void (Ayy)
I wish it was different
Feeling on minimum when they not feeling your boy
Oh y'all want a picture while I'm at dinner?
Yeah, I'm a little annoyed
But I'll probably miss it when it's all finished
And they don't want it no more
Of course, how many more likes do we need?
If we a slave to they opinion, we won't ever be free
So tell 'em I like me like this
Oh, you don't? Shoulda got your mind right
'Cause life still hands you lemons with the limelight, right?

Hi, my name is Swoope and I got a problem
It's not Alcoholics Anonymous
I'm addicted to all the applause that gets me high
And the prison I sit in is built outta bars I spit
Thinking 'bout giving up all of it
But I don't wanna go through withdrawals again
I'm dry, not to be high is killing me
Detox is sending me to seek my identity
Beyond my Twitter feed
My inner peace ain't in who follows me, nah
That clout is just a cloud of dust, I need sobriety now
Truth
