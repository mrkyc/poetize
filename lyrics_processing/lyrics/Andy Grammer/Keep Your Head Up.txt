Whoa oh oh oh
Eh eh eh eh

I've been waiting on a sunset, bills on my mindset
I can't deny they're getting high
Higher than my income, income's bread crumbs
I've been trying to survive
The glow that the sun gets right around sunset
Helps me to realize
This is just a journey, drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine

Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh eh eh eh
You might also like
I got my hands in my pockets, kicking these rocks
It's kinda hard to watch this life go by
I'm buying into skeptics
Skeptics mess with the confidence in my eyes
I'm seeing all the angles, thoughts get tangled
I start to compromise my life and my purpose
Is it all worth it?
Am I gonna turn out fine?

Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh eh eh eh

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again
And it's a circle, circling
Around again, it comes around again, I say
Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again
And it's a circle, circling
Around again, it comes around
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh eh eh

Keep your head up (oh oh)
And you can let your hair down (eh eh)
And keep your head up (oh oh)
And you can let your hair down (eh eh)
Keep your head up (oh oh)
And you can let your hair down (eh eh)
