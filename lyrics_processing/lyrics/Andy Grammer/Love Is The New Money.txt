Love
Is the new money, money

I wanna charm ya, disarm your cynicism
Remind your mind that love is what you're swimming in
And if you can't see it then I can try singing it
I love you to try listening
And if I need to learn new languages, let's go
Ich liebe dich, je t'aime, wo ai ni, te amo
Teach my heart to become trilingual
Hell, maybe aliens might hear my signal

Ooh, another check won't do it
Nah, another watch won't prove it
Hell nah, you can't hold on to it
But I'm feeling rich as hell right now 'cause

Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money, yeah
Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money

I wanna love, I wanna, wanna love better
Go down as the Muhammad Ali of being tender
Wake up at three a.m., hit the gym, wear a sweater saying
The champ is here while writing you love letters
I wanna be, I wanna, wanna be a scholar
Study the greats, watch tape and love harder
Even ivy league call me a love doctor
Graduate with honors, magna cum laude 'cause

Another check won't do it
Nah, another watch won't prove it
Hell nah, you can't hold on to it
But I'm feeling rich as hell right now 'cause

Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money, yeah
Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money

Status and lavishness
Can't give me anything that I need
Give me the new money
Give me the new money
Another check won't do it
Nah, another watch won't prove it
Hell nah, you can't hold on to it
But I'm feeling rich as hell right now 'cause

Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money, yeah
Love
Is the new money, money, is the new money, money

Money, money, is the new money, money
