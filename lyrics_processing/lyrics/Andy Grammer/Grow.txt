Good and grown, Lord knows I still ain't got it figured out yet
Maybe 30 more years, I'll know the answer to it all
Told myself I'd be like Mike, six rings on my fingers
And I'd be sipping on something somewhere, escaping from it all

I work hard (Damn right), I get bored (Sometimes)
Do it big (All night), still want more
We ain't made to have it made
So what I'm trying to say, what I'm trying to say

Is you gotta grow
Love yourself and be kind, water your soul
Celebrate and find your light
It don't matter who you are, where you're going, young or old
We all know, yeah, we all know
Gotta grow

Hearts all break, you're gonna break
Hearts just learn when it happens
When you plant your seeds, be careful reaping what you sewed
Don't feel lost in the weeds, don't count your medals, stay humble
And if you're gonna live fast, strap up, not everything is gold

Whoa, Lord knows I still ain't got it figured out yet
Ain't got it figured out yet, no

I work hard (Damn right), I get bored (Sometimes)
Do it big (All night), still want more
