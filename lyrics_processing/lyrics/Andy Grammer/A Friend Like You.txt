Right from the start, couldn't pull us apart, it just works
Nobody else ever gets me as well on this earth
Like rock and roll, Marshalls and Teles
Mac and cheese, PB's and jellies
Some things are better together, and that you and me-e

Dude, I love you, bro, I love you
Man, I love you
You're my brother from another, 'nother mother
You are my favorite, I'm not ashamed to admit
Cause I do, dude, I do
Dude, I love you, bro, I love you
Man, I love you
You're my homie, no one knows me like you know me
Like the sun and the moon, all the best things comes in two
What would I do without a friend like you?

W-w-w-w-what would I do?
Without a friend like you
W-w-w-w-what would I do?
Without a friend like you?

Laughed and we cried when we're passing the time away
Even our fights always end with a smile on our face
Like black and white, keys on a Wurli
Sounds just right when we're in harmony
Some things are better together and that's you and me-e

W-w-w-w-what would I do? (I wouldn't be the same, man)

You are my favorite, I'm not ashamed to admit
Cause I do, dude, I do

Got my back, I got your back, like chiropractors
Like the sun and the moon, all the best things come in two's
What would I do without a friend like you?
W-w-w-w-what would I do?
Without a friend like you
W-w-w-w-what would I do?
