How does a stranger walk into my life
And change what I thought it meant to be alive?
It's crazy how you went from bein' just some girl

I didn't know you, I didn't even know me
I was a soldier, I was a one man army
I thought the future didn't apply to me
And when I met you, come on, I was 23 and
Oh, now you're every, oh, thing to me

And change what I thought it meant to be alive?
It's crazy how you went from being just some girl
Oh-oh, to bein' my whole world
To bein' my whole world

And now you're my soulmate
And you get my shit if I die
And we got our own home
You're the mother of my child
There's nothing that I don't
That I do not know about your life
You're my one phone call
Ain't that shit wild?

Better than anything I coulda foreseen, so tell me
