This ain't love
This ain't love
I never understood the game
Forever awkward when I tried to play it
I get too deep with everything
But every now and then I get impatient

So I told that angel on my shoulder
You go home, won't need you tonight
Grabbed your waist and pulled you closer in so tight
Now we're faking sleep here on your sofa
Like we do this all of the time
One thing's running over and over in my mind

This ain't love
I may have fooled myself again
This ain't love
I've always been too sensitive
To have a good night
To have a good time
Because my heart can't handle it
If it ain't love
If this ain't love
You might also like
I never understood the game
I care too much about my reputation
You know it's just how I was made
But I'm tired of trying to explain it

So I told that angel on my shoulder
You go home, won't need you tonight
Grabbed your waist and pulled you closer in so tight
Now we're faking sleep here on your sofa
Like we do this all of the time
One thing's running over and over in my mind

This ain't love
I may have fooled myself again
This ain't love
I've always been too sensitive
To have a good night
To have a good time
Because my heart can't handle it
If it ain't love
If this ain't love

So I told that angel on my shoulder
You go home, don't need you tonight
Grabbed your waist and pulled you closer in so tight
Now we're faking sleep here on your sofa
Like we do this all of the time
One thing's running over and over in my mind
This ain't love
I may have fooled myself again
This ain't love
I've always been too sensitive
To have a good night
To have a good time
Because my heart can't handle it
If it ain't love
If this ain't love

This ain't love
I may have fooled myself again
This ain't love
I've always been too sensitive
To have a good night
To have a good time
Because my heart can't handle it
If it ain't love
