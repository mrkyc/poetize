My, my, my mother was a sunshine soldier
Everyday was a dream come true
She said that we were blessed by the breath deep inside us
She could make the colors in the sky turn blue

She said, "Honey, whatcha gonna  do today?
You're second guessing every single move you make
You're definitely gonna have some very hard days
But I'll be right here for you"
And she said, "Before I go
There is one thing you should know"

"I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
'Cause in the end, the love we take's
Got nothing on the love we make
So give love, so give love, so give love"

She, she said, "You're gonna be a light in a cold world
You got extra love pumping up your veins"
To my people feeling down and my people feeling empty
I got so much of this love, I gotta give it away

"Hey, honey, whatcha gonna do today?
You're second guessing every single move you make
You're definitely gonna have some very hard days
But I'll be right here for you"
And she said, "Before I go
There is one thing you should know"

"I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
'Cause in the end, the love we take's
Got nothing on the love we make
So give love (Yuh)
So give love (Andy, you know I got you!)
So give love (Yeah, yeah)"

Put this on repeat, it's so elementary
This that 1 + 1 is 2, you sprinkle love, that equal 3
Maybe that's the remedy, blind man, he can even see
If you wanna cook it up, well, then I know the recipe
It's the L-O-V-E, (ah) now you see me (ride)
Down the avenue, they hate I'm throwin' the peace (sign)
That my own reply, you know I don't even try
Yeah, I give that love, I get that love, I know the reason why
"I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
I give love to all of my people
All of my people need love, I give some
'Cause in the end, the love we take's
Got nothing on the love we make
So give love
So give love
