Too good, it makes me nervous
That we could ever keep this pace
And I know that's probably stupid
But that's my brain
Oh, I know that nothing's perfect
But we are in a perfect place
And I don't wanna lose it
I don't want the stars to fade

You make me wanna hit freeze
Stay forever in this moment
Polaroid, I wanna hold it
You make me want to, you make me want to hit freeze
Time is slipping through my fingers
Tryna check the universe
Can we, we

I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
Oh, I just want you and me right now, now, now
Oh, I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
I wanna hit freeze

'Cause if nothing is for certain
But I'ma keep you up all night
Tryin' to get every word in
While we have time
Heaven knows that the seasons change
We might be in our golden age
Forever will look different every day
Not trying to live in yesterday
But there are some things that should stay the same
Oh, slow and steady, this is not a race
You might also like
You make me wanna hit freeze
Stay forever in this moment
Polaroid, I wanna hold it
You make me want to, you make me want to hit freeze
Time is slipping through my fingers
Tryna check the universe
Can we, we

I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
Oh, I just want you and me right now, now, now
Oh, I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
I wanna hit freeze

You make me never wanna leave
Stay forever in this moment
Polaroid, I wanna hold it
You make me want to, you make me want to be me
Time is slipping through my fingers
Tryna check the universe
Can we

You make me wanna hit freeze
Stay forever in this moment
Polaroid, I wanna hold it
Make me want to, you make me want to hit freeze
Time is slipping through my fingers
Tryna check the universe
Can we, we
I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
Oh, I just want you and me right now, now, now
Oh, I just want to hit freeze right now, now, now
