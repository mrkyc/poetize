I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner
And you've been gone too long

And I've been on my knees, praying like
Praying like a sinner

Well you built a city right in me
And brick by brick and piece by piece
And love in both your hands
Tried to make an honest man

I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner
And you've been gone too long
I'm waiting out the winter
And I've been on my knees, praying like
Praying like a sinner

I've been on my own, praying like a sinner
And you've been gone too long
I'm waiting out the winter
And I've been on my knees, praying like

And I've been on my knees, praying like
Praying like a sinner
Praying like a sinner
