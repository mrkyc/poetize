I know you didn't think loving me meant so much time alone
Dinner for one on the couch, another movie on your own
You know that I'm never gonna be a 9 to 5, that was never me
I was born with a compass in my hand and a restless soul

But when it hurts, when you can't take it
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking

You hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

As far as ladies go, baby, you should know you're so patient
You're a thick-skin definition of low maintenance
But if enough time goes by, you can't help but dim your light
An empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked

But when it hurts, when you can't take it
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking
You might also like
You hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

Oh, let the audio be your second home for a while
And hold on to every note
Baby, listen close for me inside
And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow

And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
