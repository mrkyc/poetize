There is a lie that I believed
The more that I got, the more I'd be free, free, free, free
So I've been away, making the green
See, the more that I get, the more that I need, need, need, need

Pray for my, pray for my, pray for my soul
I got a, got a disease, and it's gold
Caught it so easy like the common cold, ooh, ooh
Tossing and tossing and turning around
Trying and trying to sweat it all out
Kicking the habit that's pulling me down, ooh, oh

I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I got a big house, but my heart is ugly"
You can't take it with ya, and your whip ain't gon' miss ya
So wipe off that window, see the bigger picture now
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Whoa, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"

Now there is a dream that I was sold
Just get all you can before you get old, old, old, old
So I bought it all and took out a loan
But now that I'm here, I got nothing to show, show, show, show
You might also like
Pray for my, pray for my, pray for my soul
I got a, got a disease, and it's gold
Caught it so easy like the common cold, ooh, ooh
Tossing and tossing and turning around
Trying and trying to sweat it all out
Kicking the habit that's pulling me down, ooh, oh

I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I got a big house, but my heart is ugly"
You can't take it with ya, and your whip ain't gon' miss ya
So wipe off that window, see the bigger picture now
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Whoa, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"

I want a life I cannot pay for
I want a life I can't afford to live without
I want a life I cannot pay for
I want a life I can't afford to be missing out

I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I got a big house, but my heart is ugly"
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Oh, no, I think I missed it, I was chasing money"
I don't wanna be 85, singing
"Whoa, no, I got a big house, but my heart is hurting me"
