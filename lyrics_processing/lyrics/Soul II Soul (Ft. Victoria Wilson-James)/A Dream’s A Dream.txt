I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you

A dream's a dream and I'm wishing on a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
A dream's a dream and I'm wishing on a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
I have a picture, a thought in mind
Now it's time to realise
This is something you should analyse
In your mind

Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are

Now as I see the things in front of me
Open my arms and welcome you
That hoping this dream will come true
So many rivers to cross
Somehow you could get lost
But by the time I'm through
I can see right through you
You might also like
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you

Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are
Are you dreaming, wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream, and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are

Now I can see all these things in front of me
I'll open my arms and welcome you
And I hope that this dream will come true

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you
I'm wishing on a star
I'm wishing on a star
I'm wishing on a dream
