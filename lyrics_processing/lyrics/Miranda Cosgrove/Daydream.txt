Yeah

I could have been the one you noticed
I could have been all over you
I could have been like all the others
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
It would have been really stupid
If I would have went out with you
To give you everything you wanted
It would have been way too soon

I try to be sensitive
I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent
I try to be rough
But I just wanna play

You're my daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain, I feel insane
I can't get away
You're my daydream

Yeah

If I tell you what I'm thinking
And I let myself trust you
Can you give me what I'm missing?
Can you make my dreams come true?

I try to be sensitive
I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent
I try to be rough
But I just wanna play

You're my daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain, I feel insane
I can't get away
You're my daydream
I've always wanted someone
I've been waiting so long
Could you be that someone?
Are you my, you my?
You're my, you're my...

Daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain, I feel insane
I can't get away
You're my daydream

You're my daydream (And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know)
You're making me insane
You're my daydream (And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know)
You're doing it again
You're my daydream (And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know)
You're making me insane
You're my daydream (And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know)
