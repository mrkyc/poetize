Mafia

I dotted my i's and crossed my t's for you
But something isn't right
I stayed in my lines and i don't hear you
So I'm on my own tonight

This ain't no tragic affair wasn't suppose to go there
But your so far away
So when I lay down at night
Light candles and pour the wine
I wipe my tears away
I'm writing love letters alone in my bed
Keep writing love letters alone once again
While I'm writing love letters your all in my head
Keep writing love letters, letters, letters

Wrote I love in pencil that it won't erase
But the ink is all gone
And how you flip the script and turn the page
Like nothing is wrong
You might also like
This ain't no tragic affair wasn't suppose to go there
But your so far away
So when I lay down at night
Light candles and pour the wine
I wipe my tears away
I'm writing love letters alone in my bed
Keep writing love letters alone once again
While i'm writing love letters your all in my head
Keep writing love letters, letters, letters

Woah and when you check the mail
I hope you feel my love (my love)
And though you won't write back
It's sealed with a kiss
From me to you, baby I hope the memory is still there

This ain't no tragic affair wasn't suppose to go there
But your so far away (far away yeah)
So when I lay down at night
Light candles and pour the wine
I wipe my tears away (hey)
I'm writing love letters alone in my bed (letters)
Keep writing love letters alone once again (Once again)
While i'm writing love letters (letters) your all in my head (in my head)
Keep writing love letters, letters, letters (ohh)
