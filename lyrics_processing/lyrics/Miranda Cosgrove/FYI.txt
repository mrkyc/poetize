You're a maniac, but it's my decision
When I say I'm so, so serious
As a heart attack, got you in my vision
Must admit I'm not afraid of us

Hey you, I say what I mean
I mean what I say when I say

Girls like boys
Who never want to stay, you see
As soon as they walk away
We step in their direction
That's okay
Who wants to have some guy?
Not I
Sticking right by my side
We cannot take rejection

You're a lunatic, and you're on a mission
To corrupt my soul, and it's all yours
I've been wanting it, Mr. Recollision
'Cause I'd rather rock, that's how I roll

Hey you, you get what I mean
I mean what I say and I say

Girls like boys
Who never want to stay, you see
As soon as they walk away
We step in their direction

I wanna be a casualty over this love
It'd better be worth it, I heard that you got some
Tragic times to pierce my heart, but it's only blood
You stick on a band aid and smile like a girlfriend should

I'm a little nuts, guess that's why I like you
Wanna meet meet me halfway, let's commit
Maybe both of us to the loony bin
Waiting through the bars of this big bus
Hey you, I say what I mean
We mean what we say when we say

Girls like boys
Who never want to stay, you see

We step in their direction
