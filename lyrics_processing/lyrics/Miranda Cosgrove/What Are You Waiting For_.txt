Standin' here in our final hour
I can't believe this is the end
Now I wish that I had the power
To start this all over again
'Cause I know that I'm gonna
Miss you when your gone
And I'd hate to leave it this way
So just make a move
You've got nothing to lose, no

Here I am, take a chance
What are you waiting for?
I'm telling you as a friend
We could be so much more
I never thought anyone ever could
Make me feel this way
So make my day
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Without you it's gonna be lonely
So lets make the most of tonight
Did I ever say you were the only
One who could make it alright
Now I don't know when I'm
Gonna to see you again
Can't you take my mind off the pain?
So just make a move
You've got nothing to lose, no
You might also like
Here I am, take a chance
What are you waiting for?
I'm telling you as a friend
We could be so much more
I never thought anyone ever could
Make me feel this way
So make my day

Don't make me feel stupid
Don't say I was wrong
Building this up in my mind for so long
Now our times running out
So you've got to be strong
If you want to make this right
Break the ice, don't think twice
Take me away
What are you waiting for?

I never thought anyone ever could
Make me feel this way
So make my day

Here I am, take a chance
What are you waiting for?
I'm telling you as a friend
We could be so much more
I never thought anyone ever could
Make me feel this way
So make my day
What are you waiting for?
