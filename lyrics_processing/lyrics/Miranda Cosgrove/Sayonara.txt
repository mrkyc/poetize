Like a ninja out of the dark
I'll steal your heart, I'll steal your heart
Maybe give you more than I should
Make you feel good, make you feel good

Like a tiger rurnin' through the night
You're the fire, got you in my sight
Feel the music runnin' through my blood
Can't fight my love

What I need, what I need is a rocket to ride
To the beat, to the beat, we'll be movin' all night
So, baby, just keep it rockin', keep it rockin', keep it rockin'
Better like what I see or it's
Sayonara

Under pressure, watch you perform
Turnin' me on, chasin' a storm
Yeah, I'm fallin' into your sound
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
You might also like
Like a tiger rurnin' through the night
You're the fire, got you in my sight
Feel the music running through my blood
Can't fight my love

What I need, what I need is a rocket to ride
To the beat, to the beat, we'll be movin' all night
So, baby, just keep it rockin', keep it rockin', keep it rockin'
Better like what I see or it's
Sayonara

Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara, yeah
Sayonara, sayonara, (D-d-don't make me say it)
Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara, yeah
Sayonara, sayonara, (D-d-don't make me say it)

Body, hands all over my body
Work me out like karate
Tell me, boy, can we kick it now?
Can you hold me down?
Body (Move your body, hands all over me)
Hands all over my body (Comin' closer, baby can't you see?)
Work me out like karate (Work it harder, what's it gonna be?)
Tell me, boy, can we kick it now?
Can you hold me down?
What I need, what I need is a rocket to ride
To the beat, to the beat, we'll be movin' all night
So, baby, just keep it rockin', keep it rockin', keep it rockin'
Better like what I see or it's
Sayonara, sayonara (Don't, d-d-don't make me say it)
Sayonara, sayonara (Don't, d-d-don't make me say it)
