I'm willing to try this, but maybe you're not
Maybe we'll like it, let's give it a shot
But let's throw ourselves in and get soaking wet
Don't just slip our toes in, not yet

Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

Adored
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it
From the bottom of your soul
Let me know that I'm adored
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words, let me know
That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know that I'm adored

I'm willing to show you the thoughts in my mind
I'm willing to cut loose the ropes that I tied
So tell me you're ready to dig in the dirt
To show me the places where you have been hurt
You might also like
Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna be

Adored
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it
From the bottom of your soul
Let me know that I'm adored (Adored)
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words, let me know
That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know that I'm adored

What's the point in settling for less?
(From the bottom of my heart)
What for? Wanna win and not come second best
(From the bottom of my heart)
So shatter my world, don't matter now
Because I wanna fall
For my own sake, it don't matter if I break
You're gonna be adored by me
Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

Adored
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it
From the bottom of your soul
Let me know that I'm adored (Adored)
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words, let me know
That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know that I'm adored

From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
'Cause
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
