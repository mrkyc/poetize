I don't know what you expected
For me to sit around and beg for you to stay?
Can't you see what you've neglected, oh?
I don't know what you've been taking
Do I look like I was born just yesterday?
You're the one who will be breaking after all

'Cause there will be tears, but they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear and my eyes are staying dry
Because again, and again, and again, you wish I never got away
I'll just be dancing, now I got a reason to celebrate
Tears, but they're not gonna be, not gonna be mine

You'll be begging for a shoulder
You'll be looking for someone to dry your eyes
But you ain't ever getting over what we had
And you'll be crying like a baby
Cause you thought you'd be the one to say goodbye
And I hope it drives you crazy, oh yeah

'Cause there will be tears, but they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear and my eyes are staying dry
Because again, and again, and again, you wish I never got away
I'll just be dancing, now I got a reason to celebrate
Tears, but they're not gonna be, not gonna be mine
You might also like
You don't know what you got 'til it goes away
Goes away, baby
Anything that you've lost, you're the one to blame
One to blame, so save it
Again and again and again, you'll wish I never got away
I'll just be dancing, now I've got a reason to celebrate
There will be tears, oh yeah
But they're not gonna be mine

'Cause there will be tears, but they're not gonna be mine
My heart will be clear and my eyes are staying dry
Because again, and again, and again, you wish I never got away
I'll just be dancing, now I got a reason to celebrate
