Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
No, oh no
Charlie, oh no, oh no

All the time you wonder why
People always tell you that you're so strange
You hide a funny face behind a head of hair
You never care what they say (You never did)

Everyone would love you the way that I love you
But they don't, Oh no
They don't know you like I do

Charlie, oh how stars shine in your eyes
Just one look and we're all hypnotised
Charlie, you're like sunlight in the rain and if you go
My world without you just won't be the same

Don't try to hide a smile
If you're shy then walk with me and you'll be fine (you'll be fine)
(Yeah, uh-huh)
Let it go, because you know that all
I wanna do is be by your side by your side
(Yeah, uh-huh)
You might also like
Everyone would love you the way that I love you
But they don't, Oh no
They don't know you like I do

Charlie, oh how stars shine in your eyes (In your eyes, Charlie)
Just one look and we're all hypnotised
(One look and we're all hypnotised)
Charlie, you're like sunlight in the rain and if you go (Don't go)
My world without you just won't be the same

(Yeah) You're a diamond in the rough
Pretty sweet but lookin' tough
Somethin' about you, so mysterious (So mysterious)
(Yeah) 'Cause you're so perfect how you are
You'd be the biggest superstar
If you'd quit acting oh, so serious

Everyone would love you the way that I love you
But they don't, Oh no
They don't know you like I do

Charlie, oh how stars shine in your eyes (And you're so beautiful)
Just one look and we're all hypnotised (We're all hypnotised)
Charlie, you're like sunlight in the rain and if you go
My world without you just won't be the same
(So keep shinin', uh-huh, Charlie)
My world without you just won't be the same (Yeah, Uh-huh)
