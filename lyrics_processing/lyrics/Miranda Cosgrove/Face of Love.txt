I'm ready fo-o-or you now
I think my time's done waiting it out
You took a whi-i-ile to get through
I've been awake and dreamin' it true

With every, with every seam you're sewing up my heart
With every thread, you know you'll pull it apa-a-art
Look in the mirror and I don't see no scars
And everywhere I need you, there you are

Something in your eyes, I recognize it
Baby, could you be the face (Face) of love (Of love)?
Everything is perfect when the light is right
You'll turn, and see the face (Face) of love (Of love)
Oh, we see eye, eye, eye-to-eye (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I hear it from your mouth, (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Uh, I-I'm pulling back the curtain, now it's starting to look certain
You're the face of lo-o-o-o-o-ove

I'll make it fo-o-or you now
Needed a minute to figure it out
I'm looking straight out through the window
Don't wanna blink, might miss the signal
You might also like
With every, with every seam you're sewing up my heart
With every thread, you know you'll pull it apa-a-art
Look in the mirror and I don't see no scars
And everywhere I need you, there you are

Something in your eyes, I recognize it
Baby, could you be the face (Face) of love (Of love)?
Everything is perfect when the light is right
You'll turn, and see the face (Face) of love (Of love)
Oh, we see eye, eye, eye-to-eye (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I hear it from your mouth, (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm pulling back the curtain, now it's starting to look certain
You're the face of lo-o-o-o-o-ove

I see my best self in you
I see my best self in you

Something in your eyes, I recognize it
Baby, could you be the face (Face) of love (Of love)?
Everything is perfect when the light is right
You'll turn, and see the face (Face) of love (Of love)
Oh, we see eye, eye, eye-to-eye (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I hear it from your mouth, (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
O-oh, I'm pulling back the curtain, now it's starting to look certain
You're the face of lo-o-o-o-o-ove
I see my best self in you
(Lo-o-o-o-o-ove)
