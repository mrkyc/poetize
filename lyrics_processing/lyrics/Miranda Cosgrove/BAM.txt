Never thought I'd fall in love
Now I stand corrected
Never thought I'd feel what I feel
Never been so affected
Now I know what I know
But right now, it seems so subjective, oh-oh

You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness
Then you creeped in
Took my heart then
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode

(BAM) My life has changed
(BAM) Can't concentrate
(BAM) I was okay until we met that day, then
(BAM) I am obsessed
(BAM) Can't get no rest
(BAM) Ever since we met I think I know what love is (BAM)

I felt so secure with these walls around me
Boys will take me out
But bring me back where they found me
And there's no harm, no foul
Cause they never got a chance to know me, yeah, yeah
You might also like
You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness
Then you creeped in
Took my heart then
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode

(BAM) My life has changed
(BAM) Can't concentrate
(BAM) I was okay until we met that day, then
(BAM) I am obsessed
(BAM) Can't get no rest
(BAM) Ever since we met I think I know what love is (BAM)

And if I had to walk a million miles to find your smile
I would
(You know I would, babe)
And if you took a trip to Costa Rica
And told me to meet you
I would
(I would, I would, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

(BAM) My life has changed
(BAM) Can't concentrate
(BAM) I was okay until we met that day, then
(BAM) I am obsessed
(BAM) Can't get no rest
(BAM) Ever since we met I think I know what love is (BAM)
You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness
Then you creeped in
Took my heart then
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode
