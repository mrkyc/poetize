Summer love isn't meant to be
And it's only a fantasy
That's what everyone's telling me
Stay my baby (Stay my baby)
Even know it's a little rushed
Let me know that you'll keep in touch
If you don't, it'll hurt too much
Stay my baby (Stay my baby)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me right now
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How it's going down

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (Stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So, now 'til forever, stay my baby (stay my baby)

All I do is think of you
Sitting up here in my room
Going crazy
But then you call
Gets me through it all

Stay my baby

Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (Stay my baby)
