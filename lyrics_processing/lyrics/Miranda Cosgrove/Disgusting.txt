My, my, my, my, my heart, heart
My, my heart, heart
My, my heart, heart

My heart booms at the speed of light
But the exit sign's always on my mind, always in my sight
I could say that I really want to stay
But the devil inside always wins the fight, always gets his way

Jump out the window, gotta get out on the highway
When things are getting too attached, I need an escape
I'm seein' stars, and there is nothing more that I hate, baby
There's something that I gotta say

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause you're messin' up my name
Gotta walk my talk, my fame
But I just wanna touch your face
It's disgusting
It's disgusting how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Think I might gotta change my name
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting (-ting, ting, ting, ting, ting)

My mind blinks like a traffic light
It's green and red and stop and go changing all the time
And it makes me scared that I haven't left
And I'm still right here, more, more, more or less

Jump out in traffic, yeah, I gotta go my own way (Go my own way)
My head is slippin', too intense, I need an escape (I need an escape)
I'm seein' stars and there is nothin' more that I hate, baby
There's somethin' that I gotta say

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause you're messin' up my name
Gotta walk my talk, my fame (gotta walk my talk, my fame)
But I just wanna touch your face
It's disgusting
It's disgusting how you changed me
From a bandit to a baby
Think I might gotta change my name
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame
Look at what you do to me (look at what you do to me)
It's disgusting
My, my, my, my, my heart, heart
It's disgusting
My, my heart, heart
My, my, my, my, my heart, heart
It's disgusting
My, my heart, heart

Chapter by chapter, I'm falling faster and faster
Becoming manic and magic, it's so romantic, I panic, oh
Hit the eject button, but it must be stuck, somethin's up
I'm drifting out right over the brink, baby

It's disgusting, how I love you
I can't take it, I should hate you
'Cause you're messin' up my name
Gotta walk my talk, my fame (Gotta walk my talk, my fame)
But I just wanna touch your face
It's disgusting (It's disgusting)
It's disgusting how you changed me (How you changed me)
From a bandit to a baby (To a baby)
Think I might gotta change my name
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame (Walk this walk of shame)
Look at what you do to me
It's disgusting
Look at what you do to me
