Disrespect, it's all that you do to me
So messed up, the way that you're treating me
Brace yourself, there's something I want you to know
You should know
Replaceable is one way you're saying it
You've made your bed, now you can lay in it
'Cause one day soon, I'll have a brand new you
New you

He's gonna walk like you, exact same anatomy
Talk like you except he knows how to be
Sweet and kind, it shouldn't be so hard to find

Does it make you mad
When you're thinking back to the starting line?
Back when I was yours and you were mine?
You took me for granted so I found a brand new you
And when you see me around this time
Well, I hope you'll see that I'm doing fine
It's never been better since I found a brand new you
Since I found a brand new you

I know you hate that I'm over it
I don't even miss you a little bit
I'm so glad I found a brand new you
New you
You might also like
He's gonna walk like you, exact same anatomy
Talk like you except he's so good to me
You were blind to think you were one of a kind

Does it make you mad
When you're thinking back to the starting line?
Back when I was yours and you were mine?
You took me for granted so I found a brand new you
Found a brand new you
And when you see me around this time
Well, I hope you'll see that I'm doing fine
It's never been better since I found a brand new you
Since I found a brand new you
Found a brand new you, oh, oh yeah
Found a brand new you

I  know you hate that I'm over it
I don't even miss you a little bit
I'm so glad I found a brand new you
New you

Does it make you mad
When you're thinking back to the starting line?
Back when I was yours and you were mine?
You took me for granted so I found a brand new you
Found a brand new you
And when you see me around this time
I hope you'll see that I'm doing fine
It's never been better since I found a brand new you
