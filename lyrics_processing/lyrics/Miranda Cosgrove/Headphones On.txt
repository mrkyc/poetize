(I wanna stay home with my headphones on)
(With the stuff on the floor)
(And the lock on my door)

10:28 on the digital clock
I know it's late but I just can't stop
All this jumpin' around
All this wastin' time
It's getting to be a habit of mine
You would think I didn't wanna get paid
I'm not the type to procrastinate
But a girl can't always be well behaved

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor
And the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
So rock on
With the headphones on

Got a lot of nothin' to do
I'm not getting it done
And I'm loving it too
24 hours since I've been outside
But it feels okay, it feels alright
I could go to school another day
Don't understand why I dance all day
You know what they say about all work and no play
You might also like
I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor
And the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
So rock on
With the headphones on

With the headphones on
It's like fireworks in my head
Above the clouds
I may never get to bed
Can't turn back now
Don't wanna come down

You would think I didn't wanna get paid
I'm not the type to procrastinate
But a girl can't always be well behaved

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor
And the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor
And the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
Rock on
With the headphones on

With the headphones on
