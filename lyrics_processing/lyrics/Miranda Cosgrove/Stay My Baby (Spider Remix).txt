Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Stay my baby

Summer love isn't meant to be
And it's only fantasy
That's what everyone's telling me
Stay my baby
Even know it's a little rushed
Let me know that you'll keep in touch
If you don't, it'll hurt too much
Stay my baby (stay my baby)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, tell me right now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how it's going down

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay my baby (stay my baby)

Now that I've gone back to school
All I do is think of you
Sitting up here in my room, going crazy
But then you call
Gets me through it all
Every time I hear you say, stay my baby

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay my baby (stay my baby)

Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby (stay my baby)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, tell me right now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how it's going down
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay my baby

Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby (stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up (oh)
I'm never gonna have enough (never gonna have enough)
So now 'til forever, stay my baby
