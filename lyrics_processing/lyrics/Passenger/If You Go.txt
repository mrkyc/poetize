While we're walking free
We slip like we're stones on the sea
We sing like we're birds in the tree
That grows outside your window
While we're new and young
We shine like a morning sun
And that's how the seasons have come and go
Which way the wind blows

Cause every time you go I'll see
Just how my world comes crashing round me
And if you always stay
I don't think I'd ask for nothing more

But if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

While our love is green
Forget the troubles we've seen
Forget the people we've been before
And all of it, mistakes and heartbreaks
Oh my love, while stars they shine
Oh while your heart is mine
Yeah, while this musical ride
Let us dance out of time, let us put out the stars
Let us tug on the lines, let us smile 'til we laugh
Let us laugh 'til we cry, let us fall in a heap
On the diamond skies

But if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

But I'll stay until the sun falls out of the sky
I'll stay, I'll stay 'til all of the rivers run dry
Hey now

Oh if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
Oh if you go, I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

Oh love, as you long as you want me to stay
Oh love, as you long as you want me to stay
Oh love, as you long as you want me to stay
