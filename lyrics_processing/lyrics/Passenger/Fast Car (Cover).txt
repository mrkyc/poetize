You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from nothing, we got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
Working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We don't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
Said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
Momma went off and left him
Said she wanted more than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
I quit school, that's what I did

I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone

Do you remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
