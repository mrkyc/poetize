They say home is where the heart is
But my heart is wild and free
So am I homeless? Or just heartless?
Did I start this? Did it start me?

They say fear is for the brave
The cowards never stare it in the eye
So am I fearless to be fearful?
Does it take courage to learn how to cry?

So many winding roads
So many miles to go

They say love is for the loving
Without love maybe nothing is real
So am I loveless? Do I just love less?
Oh since love left I have nothing left to fear

So many winding roads
So many miles to go

Who runs down from the hillside to the sea
When I start feeling that it's gone too far
I lie on my back and stare up at the stars
I wonder if they're staring back at me

Who runs down from the hillside to the sea
Yeah, when I start feeling that it's gone too far
I lie on my back and stare up at the stars
I wonder if they're staring back at me, yeah
Oh when I start feeling sick of it all
