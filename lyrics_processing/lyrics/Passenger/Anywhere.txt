If you get out on the ocean
If you sail out on the sea
If you get up in the mountains
If you go climbing on trees
Oh or through every emotion
When you know that they don't care
Darling, that's when I'm with you
Oh, I'll go with you anywhere

If you get up in a jet plane
Or down in a submarine
If you get onto the next train
To somewhere you never been
If you wanna ride in a fast car
And feel the wind in your hair
Darling just look beside you
Oh, I'll go with you anywhere

Oh, and I will be with you
When the darkest winter comes
Oh, and I will be with you
To feel the California sun
Oh, and I will be with you
In the night time and when it's through
Oh, I'll go anywhere with you
