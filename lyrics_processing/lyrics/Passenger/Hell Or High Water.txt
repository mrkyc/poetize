Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something I said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Man, all my life I've been searching for someone
To show me how it feels to be loved, and
How to love somebody back
And after stumbling through the years, I
Thought I found you just to
See you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something you said, or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?

See, all my life I've been silently reaching for
A hand to hold to warm the cold, spark a light
To guide me through alright
And after stumbling through the years
I thought I found you, just to
See you fading out into the night

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Was it a knife in my back or a fork in the road?
Was it hell or high water that left us alone?
Is it really game over? Is it really checkmate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
