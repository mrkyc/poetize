A couple of days isn't a very long time
Why can't I just walk away
I used to be good at goodbye
But out on the water
Under the stars
I let the moonlight play a trick on my heart

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

The radio plays, the sound of the waves rollin' in
The smell of the night
Sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment
I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go
You might also like
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

How much can happen in a night or two?
I guess it's all depending on your point of view

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
