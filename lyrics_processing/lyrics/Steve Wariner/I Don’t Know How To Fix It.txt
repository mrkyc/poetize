And I bought some brand new cologne
She made a candlelight dinner
And I put some soft music on
We sat by the fire waiting for desire
To lift us up and take us far away
But she started getting sleepy
So I turned on the tv
One more night of love just went to waste
Well it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
There's not a day goes by that I don't miss it
Yeah, love jumped the track and we just can't get it back
I still love that woman so
But it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
She said, "A change of scereny
Might just be the very thing we need. "
I said, "What about Las Vegas?"
She said, "What about Miami Beach?"
We ended up in Denver
I never did convince her
That we'd reached the perfect compromise
She said, "I hate cold weather."
I said, "But we're together."
And she said, "Yeah, that's where the problem lies."

But it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
Well love doesn't come with blue prints, instructions or plans
I wish love had a road map so I could find where I am
Well it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
There's not a day goes by that I don't miss it
Yeah, love jumped the track and we just can't get it back
