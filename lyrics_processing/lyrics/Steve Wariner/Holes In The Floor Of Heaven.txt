When grandma passed away
I was a broken-hearted little boy
Blowing out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go
With the cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said don't be sad child
Grandma's watching you today
'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
Just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me
Seasons come and seasons go
Nothing stays the same
I grew up, fell in love
Met a girl who took my name
Year by year we made a life
In this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together
Lord I sure do miss her now

And her tears are pourin' down
That's how I know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me
Well my little girl is 23
I walk her down the aisle
It's a shame her mom can't be here now
To see her lovely smile
They throw the rice, I catch her eye
As the rain starts comin' down
She takes my hand and says Daddy don't be sad
'Cause I know Momma's watchin' now
And there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
Yes there's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
