I hope there's a shot in the dark
That if I keep it up, I can keep on going
They say that life is short
And it can't be bought by the likes of me
I heard that it won't be long
Until we're gone like dew in the morning
Stop the clocks, pull up your socks
Go find a fountain to wash it off

So kill the screen, head to Medellin
To shout and scream and find your trouble
Live amongst the orange roses
Pull vogue poses and wash it off
Lord knows I'm in the field
Hellhounds are back and on my heels

They said I died last week
In the Pacific Ocean, no words spoken
Plane fell right out the sky
But they dunno why, but don't you worry
'Cause life's a lie, so roll the die
Keep on trying to wash it off
You might also like
Go wash it off
Go wash it off
Go wash it off

Don't you even think of me
'Cause I'll be free beyond the levee
All that's left is a ghost machine
And it can't be reached, but you can try
You should go buy the boat and build a moat
Untie yourself

Go wash it off
Go wash it off
Go wash it off

You're my ride or die
I just wish I'd said goodbye one last time (One last time)
Now all that's left's a ghost machine
It can't be reached, it won't be seen again (Seen again)
'Cause you were my ride or die
I just wanted to say goodbye (To say goodbye)
'Cause all that's left's a ghost machine
It can't be reached, it won't be seen again
Go wash it off, go wash it off
Go wash it off, go wash it off
Go wash it off, go wash it off
