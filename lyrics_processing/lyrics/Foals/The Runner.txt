Shadow, see how far I go
(Step by step, I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
Walk through the embers, through the rows
(With every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Show them all just what I know
(While the years, they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)
'Cause they all just come and go
(With every step that I will take, I'll make sure that I won't break)

Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I know to keep on running
Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I know to keep on running

And if it hurts, don't let it show
(Step by step, I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
While the seasons come and go
(With every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Shadow chiaroscuro
(While the years, they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)

When I, when I fall down, fall down
Then I know to keep on running
Oh, when I fall down, fall down
Won't you come to keep me running?
Yeah, I keep on running
Well, I keep on running
