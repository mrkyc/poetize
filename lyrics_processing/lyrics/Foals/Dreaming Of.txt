I thought I saw you, dancing with dirty feet
Broken records, slightly out of reach
Are you dreaming, dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires?
Are you longing, hands up in the air?
Broken flowers twisting in your hair
Are you dreaming, dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line?

You cut and run
You cut and run
You cut and run
I am the one

Empty rooms, dancing on your own
Broken flowers from a broken home
Are you dreaming, dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line?
Thought I saw ya, dancing with tired feet
Longing hours, records on repeat
Are you dreaming, dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires?
You might also like
But you cut and run
When you see the trouble come
You cut and run
Once the damage has been done
You cut and run
When you see the trouble come
I am the one

'Cause you're always crashing that same car
And the apple don't seem to fall too far
And there's always icebergs in the way
Of all the sorries that you ought to say
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then

But you cut and run
When you see the trouble come
You cut and run
Once the damage has been done
You cut and run
When you see the trouble come
I am the one
You, you're always crashing the same car
But the apple don't seem to fall too far
And there's always icebergs in the way
Of all the sorries that you ought to say
So you don't come back around this town
Always causing trouble or just fooling 'round
'Cause there's always something in the way
