Hey, now it's time to go
From the white wards of England
The crows line the rivers and roads
I wanna walk where I know
Through the olive groves
The sky that knows my name
It gave me away
The magnolia moon
Like an eggshell, a white bell
To lighten my cold room
So let me sleep where I lay
With a murder of crows
That live in the boughs of my brain

See me when I float like a dove
Skies above lined with trees
I'm on my knees, I'm singing, please
Come and take me away

Time brings low all good things
When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes
Now in the vastness of pines
Where my ghost lies in loose-limbed array
I pass the time
And go upload my heart to the fatal shore
Forevermore, it spins there behind closed doors
Now, it's time to go through the fields of chrome
The rusted homes abandoned at the remains of the day
So come on, row me away
On black rivers and rainbows to Neptune
Where I can stay
You might also like
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above lined with trees
I'm on my knees, I'm begging, please
Come and take me away
Come take me away
Come take me away

Time brings low the best of things
When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes, eyes
Time brings low all good things
When we open our eyes
When we open our eyes


Oh, I've waited so long
On the slow shores of England
To sing my last song
So come row me away
On black rivers and rainbows to Neptune
Where I can stay
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above lined with trees
I'm on my knees, begging, please
Come and take me away
Come take me away
