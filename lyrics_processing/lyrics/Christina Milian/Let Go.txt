Ooh, oh-oh...

Hey Girl, I hear you're havin' trouble with your boyfriend again
And why do you keep playing it ghetto with him every day?
By now, you should know he's not treating you the way you deserve
Yeah, I can see that he's fine
And we all know love gets you blind

If it doesn't really benefit you, you'd be better off alone
Then it wasn't really meant to be
Just move on

If you wanna give it all you got
You gotta be the one to call the shots
Tell him all the secrets in your heart
From now on, you need to be the one to take control
Even if it means to let him go-oh-oh-oh
Let go
Gotta gotta, let go
Gotta gotta, gotta let it go
Gotta gotta, let go
Gotta gotta, gotta let it go

I'm not the type of girl to let somebody else run my life
You won't see me crying 'cause I couldn't get along with some guy
I've never been down with anybody who wouldn't treat me right 'Cause I don't need nobody else to make me feel good about myself

If it doesn't really benefit you, you'd be better off alone
Then it wasn't really meant to be
Just move on

If you wanna give it all you got
You gotta be the one to call the shots
Tell him all the secrets in your heart
From now on, you need to be the one to take control
Even if it means to let him go-oh-oh-oh
Let go
Gotta gotta, let go
Gotta gotta, gotta let it go
Gotta gotta, let go
Gotta gotta, gotta let it go

If it wasn't meant to be, you're better off alone
Just move on
Go-oh-oh-oh
Take control; et it go
Even though; let it go
Take control; let it go
Even though; let it go
If you wanna give it all you got
You gotta be the one to call the shots
Tell him all the secrets in your heart
From now on, you need to be the one to take control
Even if it means to let him go-oh-oh-oh
Let go

Ooh-oh
Let go!
Ooh-oh
