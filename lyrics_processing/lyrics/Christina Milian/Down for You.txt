Boy, you know I'm the type of girl who will always understand
And whatever you're going through
I will always be right there
But there's just a few things you should know
I'm not the chick that'll blow ya' spot in front your friends
'Cause I'm cool like that, I'm sayin'

Maybe your old girlfriend complained
But baby with me, it's not the same
You treat me right when we're alone
You got your own thing when you're gone

Baby, you know that I'm down for you
Keep that on the low when you're with your crew
'Cause I know how you feel when it's me and you
'Cause baby, you know that I'll hold it down for you
No need to trip when you're with your friends
'Cause you ain't gotta hug me or hold my hand
Baby, I'm grown so I understand
'Cause baby, you know that I'll hold it down for you

It's kinda funny on the phone when I talk to you
When I tell you "I love you", and you just laugh and say "Me too" (Ooh)
Just the other day when you passed me by
I could see you were checkin' me from the corner of your eye

But baby with me, it's not the same

Baby, you know that I'm down for you

'Cause I know how you feel when it's me and you
'Cause baby, you know that I'll hold it down for you
No need to trip when you're with your friends
'Cause you ain't gotta hug me or hold my hand
Baby, I'm grown so I understand
'Cause baby, you know that I'll hold it down for you
Baby, you know that I'm down for you
Keep that on the low when you're with your crew
'Cause I know how you feel when it's me and you
'Cause baby, you know that I'll hold it down for you
No need to trip when you're with your friends
'Cause you ain't gotta hug me or hold my hand
Baby, I'm grown so I understand
