I love a fast car
And you got a fast ride, so
Won't you take me for a spin out?
On your highway
'Cause It's raining outside
And I know that a drive
Might sound a little crazy
But I feel that is time

So, speed it up, slow it down
Put it back, in reverse
My directions, pay attention
To my every word
We can bump, we can swerve
But watch out for that curve
On your highway

Engines (Engines), roarin' (Roarin')
Bodies (Bodies), explorin' (Explorin')
Hold on tight, we going all the way
All the way
We can go eighty miles an hour
Ninety miles an hour
As long as you're drivin', man, it's okay
'Cause I love it ridin' on your highway
You might also like
Now, let's take it nice and slow and
I'll tell you where to go
I'll whisper to you softly when I see the signs
(La, la, la)
I, I look over to see you (Yes)
And you're checkin' out the rear view
I'll control the stick you drive between the lines
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh)

So, speed it up, slow it down
Put it back, in reverse
My directions, pay attention
To my every word
We can bump, we can swerve
But watch out for that curve
On your highway (Oh)

Engines (Engines), roarin' (Roarin')
(Our bodies, yeah)
Bodies (Bodies), explorin' (Explorin')
Hold on tight, we going all the way
All the way, all the way
We can go eighty miles an hour
Ninety miles an hour
As long as you're drivin', man, it's okay
'Cause I love it ridin' on your highway
Take me to another place
(Somewhere)
Where you can touch my face
(Somewhere)
Where you can kiss my waist
(Somewhere)
That I can show you

Engines (Engines), roarin' (Roarin')
Bodies (Bodies), explorin' (Explorin')
Hold on tight, we going all the way
All the way
We can go eighty miles an hour
Ninety miles an hour
As long as you're drivin', man, it's okay
