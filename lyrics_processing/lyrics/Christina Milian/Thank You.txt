Ooh, yeah yeah
Ohh, ohh

Once upon a time, I walked an easy road
I didn't think I needed anyone
I could make it on my own
I never thought about tomorrow
Just livin' day to day
I never thought these clouds would come along
And bring me so much pain

When my world was upside down
I didn't think that I could make it
I reached out my hand for you
And you were there to take it

I wanna thank you
For being my strength when I thought I couldn't go on
And I wanna thank you
For showing me right when my heart was leading me wrong
For all the times I was lost and my soul was blind
And I didn't know what to do
Somehow you pulled me through
And I wanna thank you
You...
You might also like
When I was down and feeling low
Looked up and you were there
Somehow you knew and found me
You were the answer to my prayers
You shined a light when it was dark
And opened up my eyes
You led the way when I was lost
And you helped me realize

That I will never walk alone 'cause you'll be by my side
(By my side)
I don't know what I'd ever do without you in my life

I wanna thank you
For being my strength when I thought I couldn't go on
(When I thought I couldn't go on)
And I wanna thank you
For showing me right when my heart was leading me wrong
For all the times I was lost and my soul was blind
And I didn't know what to do (I didn't know what to do)
Somehow you pulled me through
And I wanna thank you (I wanna thank you)
With every step I take
You show me there's away
And in your hands, my heart will never go astray
So each and every day...

I wanna thank you
For being my strength when I thought I couldn't go on
(Thank you, you)
(When I thought I couldn't go on)
And I wanna thank you (Every little thing you do)
For showing me right when my heart was leading me wrong
(I know I can depend on you)
For all the times I was lost and my soul was blind
And I didn't know what to do
Somehow you pulled me through (You pulled me through)
And I wanna thank you (Yes I do)

I wanna thank you
Thank you for the love you gave me
And every time you were there to save me
Thank you for being right by my side (I wanna thank you)
I wanna thank you when I thought that I couldn't make it
Reached out my hand, you were there to take it
Thank you for being here in my life (I wanna thank you)
I wanna thank you
For all of the joy
For all of the tears
