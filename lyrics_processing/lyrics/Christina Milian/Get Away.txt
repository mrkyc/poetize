You know, I've been thinking about you
And I've been thinking, we should get together
But I know you have somebody, and I do too
But I got one question. Can you get away?

I've been lookin' to get away from him
I've been lookin' to get away from her
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I've been lookin' to get away
Since I found you

Say whatever it is you need to say
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout heading my way
This relationship is getting crazy
Lately, lately, lately
I've been feelin' this way from back when
But now it's time I turned you in
Maybe now, baby, we can be friends
Baby, baby, baby
