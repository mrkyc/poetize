Back and forth with my conscience
Back and forth with that bullshit
Back and forth with your nonsense
I keep saying I'ma leave you
Back and forth with that drama
Bitches adding more bullshit
And I'm just counting your condoms
Wait, hold up

Where them shits go?
When I left you had three
Where them shits go?
Say you was only fucking me

Lipstick stains all on your white tee
Tryina wash it off like a bitch wouldn't see
I'm about to catch a murder in the third degree
I don't know why you do this shit to me

Boy, it's obvious you're a liar
Obvious you're a liar
You keep telling me you can't find them
Why is love so blinding? Oh
Back and forth with my conscience
Back and forth with that bullshit
Back and forth with your nonsense
I keep saying I'ma leave
Back and forth with that drama
Bitches having more bullshit
And I'm just counting your condoms
You might also like
But one day I'ma learn, oh oh
One day I'ma learn, oh oh (I keep saying I'ma leave)
One day I'ma learn, oh oh
One day I'ma learn, oh oh oh (I keep saying I'ma leave)

Now it's all my fault
Should've listen to my girls before
Should've never went to your top drawer
Cause we don't even use them anymore

It's obvious you're a liar
Obvious you're a liar
You keep telling me you can't find them
Why is love so blinding? Oh
Back and forth with my conscience
Back and forth with that bullshit
Back and forth with your nonsense
I keep saying I'ma leave
Back and forth with that drama
Bitches having more bullshit
And I'm just counting your condoms

One day I'ma learn, oh oh
One day I'ma learn, oh oh (I keep saying I'ma leave)
One day I'ma learn, oh oh
One day I'ma learn, oh oh oh (I keep saying I'ma leave)
