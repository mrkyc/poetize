Oh, I miss you like
Oh, I miss you like

I miss you like the sky misses the birds
I miss you like a song without the words
And everyday away from you it hurts
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I miss you like the sun misses the day
I need you like the desert that needs the rain
And baby, it's driving me insane
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I'm missing you like crazy

Sitting here, thinkin' 'bout how much you, you mean to me
You're my love, my baby
You're my friend, my homie
What we got can't be replaced
I see no one, taking ya space
Anywhere you take me
I'll follow

'Cause every time I gotta go, I look into your eyes
And then I know, you'll be waiting for me, oh
And no matter how long that may be
I know that you are always there for me
Oh baby, I can't wait until I have you here
You might also like
I miss you like the sky misses the birds
I miss you like a song without the words
And everyday away from you it hurts
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I miss you like the sun misses the day
I need you like the desert that needs the rain
And baby, it's driving me insane
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I'm missing you like crazy
VERSE 2:
Sometimes at night, I get it bad
I think about the times we share
So I rush to call you hoping you miss me too
The special way you say my name
You soothe my heart, make it ok
You're not here so I hold
My pillow

'Cause every time I gotta go, I look into your eyes
And then I know, you'll be waiting for me
And no matter how long that may be
I know that you are always there for me
Oh baby, I can't wait until I have you here
I miss you like the sky misses the birds
I miss you like a song without the words
And everyday away from you it hurts
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I miss you like the sun misses the day
I need you like the desert that needs the rain
And baby, it's driving me insane
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I'm missing you like crazy

Baby, I'm missing you like crazy
And I'm hoping that you miss me too
I'm missing you like crazy

I miss you like the sky misses the birds
I miss you like a song without the words
And everyday away from you it hurts
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I miss you like the sun misses the day
I need you like the desert that needs the rain
And baby, it's driving me insane
'Cause I'm missing you like crazy
I'm missing you like crazy
I miss you like the sky misses the birds
I miss you like a song without the words
And everyday away from you it hurts
