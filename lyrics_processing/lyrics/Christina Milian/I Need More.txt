Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I can no longer see myself being the girl for you I used to be
You've done so much to bring me down
When I think about how you treated me
I no longer need to try and be perfect for you
'Cause now I see, I'm just something to throw around
You were never down, just misleading me

I need more than what you're givin', what you're givin'
I can't take no more of being second in line in your eyes
I've heard it all before (Oh), time to even the score (Oh)
It'll be a cold day in Hell before you ever see your girl shed another tear
Boy, you better hear me
Oh
Oh

Friends is the phrase you used to describe our relationship
It was best for you
So when the other girls come around, you would have an out
To do that do now
But now I found in me the strength to say the hell with you
And let it be
No more will I be sick and down or thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
You might also like
I need more than what you're givin', what you're givin'
I can't take no more of being second in line in your eyes
I've heard it all before (Oh), time to even the score (Oh)
It'll be a cold day in Hell before you ever see your girl shed another tear
Boy, you better hear me
I need more than what you're givin', what you're givin'
I can't take no more of being second in line in your eyes
I've heard it all before (Oh), time to even the score (Oh)
It'll be a cold day in Hell before you ever see your girl shed another tear
Boy, you better hear me

I can't deny I miss you (Can't deny I do)
And I can't deny I wish you (wish you only knew)
How to treat a girl who'd give her whole world to you
But I understand you now
You'll never appreciate somebody like me

I need more than what you're givin', what you're givin'
I can't take no more of being second in line in your eyes
I've heard it all before (Oh), time to even the score (Oh)
It'll be a cold day in Hell before you ever see your girl shed another tear
Boy, you better hear me
Did you hear me?
Hope you did (Oh)
It'll be a cold day in Hell before you ever see your girl shed another tear
