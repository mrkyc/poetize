It was the smile, it was the style
That had me gone from the jump
It was your name, it was your sign
That made me want to run

Flying to Vegas, packing my bag
Don't know where it will take us
When I'll come back, I'll be with you
You'll be with me and the rest is history

Welcome to Vegas
Love on the runway soon as we land
In the airport, holding my hand
Welcome to Vegas
Louis duffle bags, we exit out the terminal
I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas
Ever yours, I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas
I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas

Elope, elope, elope, we go, go, go, go
Elope, elope, elope, we go, go, go, go
You might also like
It was your lips and the first kiss
That had me rolling around in bliss
It was your touch, your hold
You took my heart in from the cold

Flying to Vegas, packing my bag
Don't know where it will take us
When I'll come back, I'll be with you
You'll be with me and the rest is history

Welcome to Vegas
Love on the runway soon as we land
In the airport, holding my hand
Welcome to Vegas
Louis duffle bags, we exit out the terminal
I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas
Ever yours, I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas
I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours, I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas

Elope, elope, elope, we go, go, go, go
