The way, with me
The way, with me
I gotta get to you, how far
I gotta get to you, you are
I gotta get to you

It's not like me to fall at first sight
I'm only telling the truth
It took a little while to realize
I was falling for you

'Cause all I see is your face
You really blow me away (With all that you do)
And if I see you again, I'll take you into my hands
I'm calling out, say

Take my heart, I'll let you lead the way
I gotta get to you
Stars are lost without you here with me
I gotta get to you

No matter how far
I gotta get to you
Wherever you are
I gotta get to you
You might also like
I wake up to the break of sunlight
You're all in my head
It's like you put a hole in my mind
But we haven't met

Now all I see is your face
You really blow me away (I've got to have you)
And if I see you again, I'll take you into my hands
I'm calling out, say

Take my heart, I'll let you lead the way
I gotta get to you
Stars are lost without you here with me
I gotta get to you

No matter how far
I gotta get to you
Wherever you are
I gotta get to you

Take me now, now I'm waiting
Look at me anticipating
Look at me, I'm falling for you
Take me now, now I'm waiting
Look at me anticipating
Look at me, I'm falling for you
Now or never, forever
Take it to another level
I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)
Now or never, forever
Take it to another level
Come on, I'm waiting for you, you

Take my heart, I'll let you lead the way
I gotta get to you
Stars are lost without you here with me
I gotta get to you

No matter how far
I gotta get to you
Wherever you are
I gotta get to you

Take my heart, I'll let you lead the way
I gotta get to you
Stars are lost without you here with me
I gotta get to you

No matter how far
I gotta get to you
Wherever you are
