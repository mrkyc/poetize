You make me laugh, ooh
Make me laugh
You make me laugh
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will never hurt me
Make me laugh

Ever since the first day I met you
We were hanging 'round tight, we were cool
Brought you 'round to everything that I do
But something told me I should watch you
Now I'm finding out the other day
You been runnin' 'round
Talking every word that I say to my friends
Now I feel betrayed
Now why you tryin' to play these silly games?
Now it's funny how it got to me
He told she and she told me
And I don't think that you can really see
That all their loyalty belongs to me
They don't believe a word you say
The only reason that you know 'em 'cause of me anyway
Why do you have so much jealousy?
But no matter how you try, you can't be me
You might also like
Got me thinking about
You make me laugh
All the things you're doing
Trying so hard just to ruin me, but you can't see
You make me laugh, 'cause you're running around
You make me laugh
Tryin' so hard to be down
Talking 'bout me when I'm not around
But you don't get that you make me laugh

Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will never hurt me Ooh
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will never hurt me

You can't blame me for hatin'
But it's funny how you thought you can
Let your little secrets pass by me
And try to get them not to like me
I was being good to you
Now you're running 'round, talking, looking like a fool
I'd like to know what you gon' do
And now who's laughing
Jokes been played on you
Got me thinking about
You make me laugh
All the things you're doing
Trying so hard just to ruin me, but you can't see
You make me laugh, 'cause you're running around
You make me laugh
Tryin' so hard to be down
Talking 'bout me when I'm not around
But you don't get that you make me laugh
Got me thinking about
You make me laugh
All the things you're doing
Trying so hard just to ruin me, but you can't see
You make me laugh, 'cause you're running around
You make me laugh
Tryin' so hard to be down
Talking 'bout me when I'm not around
But you don't get that you make me laugh Ooh-ooh

Your words will never hurt me, hurt me
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will never hurt me No, no no
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will never hurt me Ooh, no
Your words will never hurt me, hurt me
You make me laugh
Got me thinking about
You make me laugh
All the things you're doing
Trying so hard just to ruin me, but you can't see
You make me laugh, 'cause you're running around
You make me laugh
Tryin' so hard to be down
Talking 'bout me when I'm not around
But you don't get that you make me laugh
Got me thinking about
You make me laugh
All the things you're doing
Trying so hard just to ruin me, but you can't see
You make me laugh, 'cause you're running around
You make me laugh
Tryin' so hard to be down
Talking 'bout me when I'm not around
But you don't get that you make me laugh
