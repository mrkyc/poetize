Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Uh-hmm

Tell me, who do you think you see?
You're standing in your corner looking out on me
You think I'm so predictable
Tell me, who do you think I am?
Looks can be deceiving
Better guess again
Tell me what you see
When you look at me

You're probably thinking that I want those things
Cash, cars, diamond rings
Thinkin' on my side the grass is green
But you don't know where I have been
I could be a wolf in disguise
I could be an angel in your eyes
Never judge a book by its cover

I could be a crook or your lover
I could be the one or the other
If you'd look beneath, you'd discover
You just don't know me
You might also like
Tell me, who do you think you see?
You're standing in your corner looking out on me
You think I'm so predictable
Tell me, who do you think I am?
Looks can be deceiving
Better guess again
Tell me what you see
When you look at me

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Uh-hmm

You look at your neighbor, thinking "What a guy!"
'Cause he's got a 9 to 5
And I bet that you don't realize
He stalks you while you sleep at night
But you're scared of the homeless guy
Think he's gonna wanna start a fight
Never judge a book by its cover

I could be a crook or your lover
I could be the one or the other (Oh, yeah, yeah)
If you'd look beneath, you'd discover
You just don't know me
Tell me, who do you think you see? (Who do you think you see?)
You're standing in your corner looking out on me (On me)
You think I'm so predictable
Tell me, who do you think I am?
Looks can be deceiving (Can be deceiving)
Better guess again
Tell me what you see
When you look at me (Oh, ooh)
Tell me, who do you think you see?
You're standing in your corner looking out (Out) on me (On me)
You think I'm so predictable (Mmh)
Tell me, who do you think I am?
Looks can be deceiving
Better guess again (Again)
Tell me what you see
When you look at me

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Uh-hmm

Now tell me, who do you think I am? Huh?
Hey, you don't even know me
Well, did you think about this?
I could be a crook or your lover
I could be the one or the other (Oh, yeah, yeah)
If you'd look beneath, you'd discover
You just don't know me

Tell me, who do you think you see?
You're standing in your corner looking out (Out) on me (On me)
You think I'm so predictable
Tell me, who do you think I am? (Who do you think you see?)
Looks can be deceiving
Better guess again (Again)

When you look at me
Tell me, who do you think you see? (Who do you think you see?)
