What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
I can be your hot girl
Lemme set your body on fire
What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
I can be your hot girl
Lemme set your body on fire, fire
(Verse 1:)
I can cook a steak up
While you hook up a stake out
And I'll sit in the passenger side
And let's ride
And I can fix my make up
While you slip on ya Jacob
Now that's just what I call perfect timming
Yes I'm
I'm ho-ho ho-ho hot girl
I'm in need of a ho-ho ho-ho hot boy
Got a spot locked down it's absurd
You and me get together the block would just burn
So
Set my body on fire why don't you just
Get with me I'm on fire
I'll burn you up
So hot
You makin' me feel so hot
To the third degree
You might also like(Chorus:)
What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
I can be your hot girl
Lemme set your body on fire
What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
I can be your hot girl
Lemme set your body on fire, fire
Fire I'm burnin' up cuz
What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
Fire you get me hot cuz
What they do ?
You's a motha- hot boy
Hot boy
(Verse 2:)
While you gettin' froze up
I'll go hook my clothes up
Know you like what you seeing
Fit the jeans you put me in
Thugged out that's how I like it
You stay g'd up

Hot hot boy like you
Tell me what we gon' do
Don't you see how you get me now
I'm catchin' a fever
Boy just pull ya sleeves up
And gimme what I need now
Set my body on fire why don't you just
Get with me I'm on fire

So hot
You makin' me feel so hot to the third degree
