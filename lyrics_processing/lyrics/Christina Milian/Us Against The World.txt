If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more
I would still have you, baby
If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war
I'll be fighting with you, baby
'Cause I know if I'm falling
You won't let me hit the ground
If the boat is sinking
I know you won't let me drown

No matter what anyone could say
This is the only place for me
And no one could ever take that away
Nothing could come between us

If the sun shuts down
And decided not to shine no more, no more
I would still have you, you, you, you, you, you, you
If we see the last day
And they say we gotta go to war, to war
I'll be fighting with you, you, you, you, you

Because it's us against the world
The world, the world
You know it's us against the world
The world, the world, oh
You might also like
Now if I'm lost at sea seven days, I'm not alone
If I'm holding you, you, you, you, you
And if it all ends, everybody in the world is gone
I'll be standing with you, baby
And if it's the last breath I take
I'll leave my kiss with you
If there's a wall between us, baby
I know I'll break through

No matter what anyone could say
This is the only place for me
And no one could ever take that away
Nothing could come between us, oh whoa

If the sun shuts down
And decided not to shine no more, no more (Decided not to shine no more)
I would still have you, you, you, you, you, you, you
If we see the last day
And they say we gotta go to war, to war
I'll be fighting with you, you, you, you, you
Because it's us against the world

Nothing's stronger now than you and I
'Cause your love is all I got
And this will never gon' stop, no whoa
There's no distance here when we're apart
Come on in from the cold
Lay your head on my shoulder
Ride like a soldier, I'ma stay right here
If the sun shuts down
And decided not to shine no more, no more (No more)
I would still have you, you, you, you, you, you, you (You baby, right here, oh)
If we see the last day
And they say we gotta go to war, to war (Go to war)
I'll be fighting with you, you, you, you, you (You, you, hey, hey)

Because it's us against the world
The world, the world (No...)
You know it's us against the world (You baby, me baby, oh-ooh)
The world, the world
Because it's us against the world
The world, the world (No matter what happens, baby)
You know it's us against the world (If it's a disaster, baby)
The world, the world (It's us against the world...)
Because it's us against the world
The world, the world (Ooh, yeah, ooh)
You know it's us against the world
