Woke up today thinking of you
Another night and I made my way through
So many dreams still left in my mind
But they could never come true
I press rewind
I remember when
I close my eyes and I'm with you again
But in the end I can still feel the pain
Every time I hear your name

The sun won't shine since you went away
Seems like the rain's falling every day
There's just one heart, where there once was two
That's the way it's gotta be
Until I get over you

Walked through the park, in the evening air
I heard a voice and I thought you were there
I run away but I just can't escape
Memories of you everywhere
They say the time will dry the tears
But true love burns for a thousand years
Give my tomorrows for one yesterday
Just to know that I could have you here
You might also like
The sun won't shine since you went away
Seems like the rain's falling every day
There's just one heart, where there once was two
That's the way it's gotta be
Until I get over you
('Til l i get over....... you...)

When will this river of tears stop fallin'
Where can I run so I won't feel alone
Can't walk away when the pain keeps callin'
I've just gotta take it from here on my own
But it's so hard to let go'
(Oh no no no)
(Oh no no)

The sun won't shine since you went away
Seems like the rain's falling every day
There's just one heart, where there once was two
That's the way it's gotta be
Until I get over you
('Til l i get over....... you...)

(You...)
(you...)
Thats the way it's gotta be until i get over you
