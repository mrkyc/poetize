Let's go

Whether you're windin' it, grindin' it
Or straight twerkin' it
I don't care as long as you're workin' it
Ride the vibes until you get into it
I guarantee for sure you'll be lovin' it
Whether you came alone to leave with someone
Or with your crew to party 'till the night is done
Do your thang, ain't nobody stoppin' you
It's whatever all I want for you to do is...

Close your eyes and just groove (You just groove)
Don't stand there, come on move (Move)
Don't be afraid to let go (Let go)
Let the music take control (Ooh)
If you come here to have a good time
Leave all your troubles behind
Wave your hands and get live (Get live)
This is the place and now is the time (Oh)
You might also like
Get loose tonight, we get down
Tearin' up 'till the place shut down
Get loose, it's time to get loud
Fell the bass boomin', movin' the crowd
Get loose, let it go
Quit standin' around and get on the floor
Everybody grab somebody, here we go
We revvin' up the party, act like ya know

Ain't no need for fightin'
Or catchin' some kinda attitude
Check that mess before you step in the room
Let it go, remember what you came to do
While the D.J. spins it on the one and twos
Get busy, get jiggy, whatever works for you
Whether tipsy or sober that's up to you
But before the night's over, I'm tellin' you
To enjoy yourself all you need to do is...

Close your eyes and just groove (Groove)
Don't stand there come on move (Don't stand there, come on)
Don't be afraid to let go (Let go)
Let the music take control (Oh ooh)
If you come here to have a good time
Leave all your troubles behind (Yeah)
Wave your hands and get live (Get live)
This is the place and now is the time
Get loose tonight, we get down
Tearin' up til' the place shut down
Get loose, it's time to get loud
Fell the bass boomin', movin' the crowd
Get loose, let it go
Quit standin' around and get on the floor
Everybody grab somebody, here we go
We revvin' up the party, act like ya know

Ahh ahh ahhh
Now that you're on the floor
I know that you're wanting more
Ahh ahh ahhh
The music's taking over you
Show me what you're gonna do
Ahh ahh ahhh
Too late, you can't hide it
I can see it's in you
Ahh ahh ahhh
And you feel the need to let it go

Get loose tonight, we get down
Tearin' up 'till the club shut down
Get loose, it's time to get loud
Fell the bass boomin', movin' the crowd
Get loose, let it go
Quit standin' around and get on the floor
Everybody grab somebody, here we go
We revvin' up the party, act like ya know
Get loose tonight, we get down
Tearin' up 'till the place shutdown
Get loose, it's time to get loud
Fell the bass boomin', movin' the crowd
Get loose, let it go
Quit standin' around and get on the floor
Everybody grab somebody, here we go
We revvin' up the party, act like ya know
(Boom)
