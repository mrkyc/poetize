Ooh yeah, oh-oh
I'm so Sorry
Mmm

Boy, we've been cool for so long now
Tell me, why would you?
Just up and throw that away
You're making a mistake
Thinking that we would be lovers
But I don't look at you that way
I'm sorry

I gotta go away
'Cause I didn't mean to lead you on
You say I broke your heart, but I didn't mean to lead you on
And it's hard to hear the truth
But I'm feeling bad 'cause you love me
I'm sorry

You've got a wife and a family
And if I was you, I wouldn't throw that away (Away)
I'm not the type of girl to break up a happy home
I really thought we could be friends
But it seems that
I gotta go

You say I broke your heart, but I didn't mean to lead you on
And it's hard to hear the truth
But I'm feeling bad 'cause you love me
I'm sorry
I gotta go away
'Cause I didn't mean to lead you on
You say I broke your heart, but I didn't mean to lead you on
And it's hard to hear the truth
But I'm feeling bad 'cause you love me
I'm sorry

What did I do?
Tell me, what did I do? (What did I do?)
I didn't try to I didn't wanna hurt you (I didn't want to hurt you no, no)
