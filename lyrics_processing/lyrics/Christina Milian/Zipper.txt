So we was up, up in the club
To the bar, hit 'em up
Now it's straight to the bar, hangin' low
Hips made him fall, could you pick him up?
He's all up in my ear talkin' mad shit
So, I was all in his ear with some mad shit
Play hard to get, but you kinda cute
I'm hard to get, but you kinda cute
Now he all up on me, wanna know, see
All up on me like he no see
So, I put it on him for a couple weeks
Now he can't keep his hands off my

Zipper, always lovin' on me
Zipper, always huggin' on me
Zipper, and always got you
Tuggin' on my, tuggin' on my
Zipper, ain't got nothin' on me
Zipper, he's always searchin' on me
Zipper, before I go (Before I go)
Now he can't keep his hands (I know, I know)

So, I put, put, put him on
And everytime he see me, wanna get it on
Taking me to meet his mommy, yup, it's a wrap
Buyin' me Chanel, yup, it's a wrap
Stay up all on like a bright thong
If he keep  looks at any at the mall
Now he's always on the door like a FedEx
'Cause I opened 'em up like a FedEx
If you ain't see him then you will see
If he ain't with you, then he with me
If you ain't heard from him in a couple weeks
Then he couldn't keep his hands off my
