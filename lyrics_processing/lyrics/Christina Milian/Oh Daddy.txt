I used to be daddy's little girl
To us, you meant the world
And oh, how we seemed so happy, yeah
Thought we had everything
But, oh, how the seasons changed
When you broke up with us and made a new family

So many times I cried, sleepless nights
Asking why did you go? I still don't know
What happened to the man I used to know?

You loved me then left me out here with no daddy
No longer a family with daddy
Though we struggled for a while
We still made it through these trials
I don't think back because we're okay
Oh, daddy

Day by day, it got so hard
Ma taking any job
And the car just won't drive
And nothing to get by
Next thing we in a food line
These things, no, you didn't see
'Cause, dad, you gave up on me
I just kept following my dreams
You might also like
So many times I cried, sleepless nights
Asking why did you go? I still don't know
What happened to the man I used to know?

You loved me then left me out here with no daddy
No longer a family with daddy
Though we struggled for a while
We still made it through these trials
I don't think back because we're okay
Oh, daddy

Now slowly I start to understand
This was just all part of a plan
'Cause without you we've been through so many things
Now to you we are thanking
And every word I say is true
I couldn't forgive, but now I do
But we still can't forget
I just can't let it happen all over again

You loved me then left me out here with no daddy
No longer a family with daddy
Though we struggled for a while
We still made it through these trials
I don't think back because we're okay
Oh, daddy
You loved me then left me out here with no daddy
No longer a family with daddy
Though we struggled for a while
We still made it through these trials
I don't think back because we're okay
