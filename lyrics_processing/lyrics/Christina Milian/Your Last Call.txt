Hey what's up, you've reached Christina's answering machine. Please leave me a Message after the tone
Thank you, bye
Hey, I'm sorry
Hey I know your there, pick up the phone

When I met you, I never through this would be something I'd have to do
'Cause from the beginning, we knew you fell for me and I fell for you
We've broken up and then gotten back and then things fell through
The situation is changing and I'm facing nothing but the truth

We came so far, but it's the same
It will never change
So now it's time to let this go
Don't try to call my home, no message at the tone
Don't wanna hear your voice
That's why you're the reason

I won't pick up my telephone 'cause it happens every time
That I get you in my life, you let me down
So this has to be your last call
You won't hear from me
Don't want you at all, so this is your last call

So now you know that I am not including you in chapter two
And it hurts me so, but now I know it's what I have to do
So you can stop callin' me and tellin' me there's still us or we
No thinking like that and now I won't come back
'Cause now is bout me

This time no more sorry's
I don't want you in my life
That's why I have to let you go
Don't try to call my home, no message at the tone
Don't wanna hear your voice
That's why you're the reason

I won't pick up my telephone 'cause it happens every time
That I get you in my life, you let me down
So this has to be your last call
You won't hear from me
Don't want you at all, so this is your last call
I won't pick up my telephone 'cause it happens every time
That I get you in my life, you let me down
So this has to be your last call
You won't hear from me
Don't want you at all, so this is your last call
Your last call
Don't try no, I move on with my life
We're not meant to be, now you see and know why

I won't pick up my telephone 'cause it happens every time
That I get you in my life, you let me down
So this has to be your last call
You won't hear from me
Don't want you at all, so this is your last call
I won't pick up my telephone 'cause it happens every time
That I get you in my life, you let me down
So this has to be your last call
You won't hear from me
