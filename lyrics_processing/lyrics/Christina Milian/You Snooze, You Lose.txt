I know you think you're the man the way you do your thang
And I bet you're havin' fun when your hangin' with your boys
Well, your relationship with your girl is comin' to an end

You keep thinkin' that she won't leave
But again and again, you go on and on
And the next thing you, know she'll be gone

You betta be on your toes 'cause soon she's gonna go
You keep thinkin' that she won't leave
But again and again, you go on and on
And the next thing you, know she'll be gone
