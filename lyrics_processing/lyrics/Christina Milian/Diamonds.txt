Diamonds, darlin'

Ayy, ayy, oh
You love my diamonds don't you?
Love the way a nigga shinin', don't you?
Baby, what's your disposition?
Have you ever tried this position?
You're my dream girl from the posters
That I thought I'd never get close to
In the black limousines with chauffeurs
Right next to the Testarossas
It's funny how all the jewelry
Just gets your cat so purry
And it look good all together
They say they are forever
You love my diamonds, don't ya?
That I bought from all this rhymin'
But I know you'll never love me
You only love my diamonds

You pick me up on a hot summer night
I fall in love with you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger
Boy, I hope your love lingers
I do (Do), I do (I do)
You might also like
You're my one and only rock in the rough (Flawlessly cut)
I like to floss you, baby, you light me up (Like stars above)
And there ain't no way I'd give you away
He's my di-di-diamond daddy
And I just gotta have him

Wanna love you, baby, I wanna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds)
I'll treasure you, cherish you, wear you on my body, ooh
'Cause we go together, diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby, ooh
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds)

Like every girl, I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls and big Graff diamond rings
But you're my priceless possession
I rock you twenty-four seven
I do (Do), I do (I do)

All my accessories, yeah, I give 'em up (Yeah, just for you)
On eBay, trade 'em in for your love (That's what I do)
And there ain't no way I'm giving you away
He's my di-di-diamond daddy
And I just gotta have you, oh
Wanna love you, baby, I wanna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds)
I'll treasure you, cherish you, wear you on my body, ooh
'Cause we go together, diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby, ooh
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds)

You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind
You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

Wanna love you, baby, I wanna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we be shining (Diamonds, diamonds)
I'll treasure you, cherish you, wear you on my body, ooh
'Cause we go together, diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby, ooh
