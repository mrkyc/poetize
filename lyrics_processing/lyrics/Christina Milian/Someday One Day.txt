Day to day, each night, I pray
That there's someone out there that's gonna melt my heart away
(Away, away)
And take me to another place (A place)
From the loneliness that's driving me insane

I get so cold, summer feels like the winter (Like the winter)
When I'm at home, all alone, I just cry
I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy (Oh-ooh)
But I can't hide this hurt inside

But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find (Find)
A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day, just wait and see (See)
True love is waiting out there for me (Me)

I'm like an open book, just trying to turn the page (Page)
Feels like I'm trapped in a maze, trying to find my way (Way)
Oh, my heart's yearning for someone to call my own
And I don't wanna sing another sad love song again, oh (Ah-ah-oh)

I get so cold, summer feels like the winter (The winter)
When I'm at home, all alone, I just cry (I cry)
I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy
But I can't hide this hurt inside (Can't hide this hurt inside)
You might also like
But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find (Find)
A guy that's gonna change my life (My life)
And I tell you one day, just wait and see (One day, see)
True love is waiting out there for me
But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find (Aah-ah-ah-ah)
A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day, just wait and see (Aah-ah-ah-ah)
True love is waiting out there for me

Take me away, away (Take me away, far away)
Far away, away
Take me away
So far away, away (Want you to take me)
Take me away, away (Away)
Far away, away
Take me away
So far away, away

But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find
A guy that's gonna change my life (A guy, who's gonna change my life)
And I tell you one day, just wait and see (See)
True love is waiting out there for me
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
Someday, someday
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
La, la, la, la
