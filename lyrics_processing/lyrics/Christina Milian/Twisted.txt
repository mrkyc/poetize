Oh, oh, oh

Ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
So crazy, boy (So crazy, boy)
So crazy, boy (So crazy, boy)
Listen

I don't know if I done told you
But you got me going so crazy, boy
It's the things that you do
When you doin' the things that you doin', doin' (Ooh)

Temperature's risin', you're so appetizin'
My boat's capsizin' (Oh)
Damn it, this feeling
I can't help but feeling that this could be real and (Oh, wow, wow)
It's so amazin', my heartbeat is racing
When I see your face and
All I know is I
All I know is I'm, I'm in the zone
And I'm writin' this song for you
You might also like
Boy, you got me, all twisted, twisted up
Boy, listen up
You got me thinkin' I just might miss, might miss the bus
Boy, twisted up
Boy, you got me, all twisted, twisted up
Boy, listen up
All I know is I
All I know is I'm, I'm in the zone
And I'm writin' this song for you

You and I, like touching fire
Practically blazin' the whole place down
And it feels so good
Turn up the heat a little higher
Turn up the music little louder
I just can't get enough of you
Oh, boy, It's the things that you do
When you do what you doin' (Ooh)

Temperature's risin', you're so appetizin'
My boat's capsizin' (Oh)
Damn it, this feeling
I can't help but feeling that this could be real and (Oh, wow, wow)
It's so amazin', my heartbeat is racing
When I see your face and
All I know is I
All I know is I'm, I'm in the zone (Ooh)
And I'm writin' this song for you
Boy, you got me, all twisted, twisted up
Boy, listen up (Boy, you got me, yeah)
You got me thinkin' I just might miss, might miss the bus
Boy, twisted up (Oh, wow)
Boy, you got me, all twisted, twisted up
Boy, listen up
All I know is
All I know is I'm, I'm in the zone
And I'm writin' this song for you (Ooh)

Everything about you I'm cravin'
Oh, baby, I'm saving my love for you (Ooh)
When I see you, I get so excited
My light just ignites when I'm here with you (Ooh)
'Cause my night turns to day when I'm seein' your face
All my troubles just go away (Oh)
It's the things that you do
When you doin', yeah (Doin')
Boy, you got me so

Boy, you got me, all twisted, twisted up (Hey)

You got me thinkin' I just might miss, might miss the bus
