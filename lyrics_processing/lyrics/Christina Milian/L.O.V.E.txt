Oh (Ayy)
Oh-oh
Joe B, Christina
We're gonna take ya to the 80's
I'ma hold you down though

Look, we tired of the same old chit-chat lame, oh
Mami frame low make dude chain smoke
We could do things slow as if you ain't know
All real them other dudes ain't Joe (No)
They'll put you in canaries temporarily
But you know they can't compare to me
Can't come close, pop cham, one toast
Till I'm on my knees with your hand numb froze
Now why you actin like you can't come close ma'?

Things are about to change
I won't just give my heart away
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever
You're blowin' my mind
So this might be the last time
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever
You might also like
I don't need love
I don't need love, if love is gonna hurt me
No need for trust, if trust just keeps me crying
I think you can see, you can see that I'm not playing
I'm not the way I used to be
Understand just what I'm saying

Things are about to change
I won't just give my heart away
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever
You're blowin' my mind
So this might be the last time
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever

I've come a long way
You can say I've learned some lessons
To never wear my heart up on my sleeve
And always keep on guessing
But it's hard not to be naive
'Cause you're saying all the right things
And I won't fall for words
So this time you gotta show me things
Things are about to change (Oh-oh-oh)
I won't just give my heart away
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever
You're blowin' my mind
So this might be the last time
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever
Things are about to change
I won't just give my heart away (Oh-oh)
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever (Forever)
You're blowin' my mind
So this might be the last time
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever

Understand that I (Understand that I)
I don't know what to do (Don't know what to do)
It's happening again, I got that old feeling again
But before I give in

Understand me
Now we're both grown, both done with the practice round
Watch me prove to be different from your average clown
It's safe, go ahead, baby, put the baggage down
I ain't tryin' to bend you over, just tryin' to win you over
Take out chin-chin's on the sofa
Relax a little, maybe then get closer
Feel like I feel related to Joe Beasy
You make bein' in L-O-V-E so easy
Pushin' me up some like pa' go easy
Ma' don't believe me, trust and come see about it
We on the same page, baby, girl, we about it
Enough with the talk, game, boo, let me be about it
Things are about to change (Things about it)
I won't just give my heart away (Yeah, oh)
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever (I told you, ay!)
You're blowin' my mind
So this might be the last time (Christina)
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever (L-O-V-E)
Things are about to change
I won't just give my heart away
'Cause when I do, it's gonna be forever (Na-na-na-na-na)
You're blowin' my mind (I told you now)
So this might be the last time (Oh-oh)
I'm fallin' L-O-V-E forever

Oh-oh-oh
(You're blowin' my mind)
(So this might be)
(L-O-V-E forever)
Oh-oh-oh
(You're blowin' my mind)
(So this might be)
(L-O-V-E forever)
