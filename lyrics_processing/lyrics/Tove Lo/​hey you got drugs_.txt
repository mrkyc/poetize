Two years of change, now they say, "Never change," never did
Keep up with me for a night, think you're free, I don't quit
Come on, my sweet escape for a while just to try it on
I'm dancin' away while it's all fun and games till it's not

We don't wanna go home (Better dance for us)
You're fucked, but, oh, you're so fun (How you holdin' up?)
I don't know tomorrow (If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight

You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home

Ten years of highs just for fun, now to hide till I'm caught
Pain from the past like a small piece of glass in my heart
This should be the time of my life, you fuckin' made it your deal, your deal
And I keep dancin' away 'cause it's all fun and games till it's real

We don't wanna go home (Better dance for us)
You're fucked, but, oh, you're so fun (How you holdin' up?)
I don't know tomorrow (If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight
You might also like
You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home

Hey, you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up
Only for tonight
Don't tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah, it's good stuff
But I'm resistant now
Take it if you want
Think I'm fallin' out of my feelings

We don't wanna go home (Better dance for us)
You're fucked, but, oh, you're so fun (How you holdin' up?)
I don't know tomorrow (If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight

You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
You all save that night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home, go home
Hey, you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up
Only for tonight
Don't tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah, it's good stuff
But I'm resistant now
Take it if you want (Go, go, go home)
Think I'm fallin' out of my feelings
Hey, you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up
Only for tonight
Don't tell anyone I was with ya (I don't wanna go home)
