Yeah

I run my fingers through her hair
Crushing my hope that this could go anywhere
I'm just a memory of good times
She's not mine

Love hurts when you hold her
But it's over
Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Love hurts when you're deep in
She's forgetting

I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now, took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys
Bad as the boys
I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now, took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys
Bad as the boys
You might also like
I know she used me for some fun
And I was down until she felt like the one
Maybe the heat just got me blind
She's so fine

Love hurts when it's fire
She's a liar
Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Love hurts when you're fingering
But she kiss him

I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now, took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys
Bad as the boys
I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now (Yeah), took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys
Bad as the boys

Big girls cry, big girls cry
It's, it's, it's alright
Big girls cry, big girls cry
It's, it's, it's all right (And big girls cry)
Big girls cry, big girls cry (Ooh, ooh)
It's, it's, it's alright (You know that big girls cry)
Big girls cry, big girls cry (It's alright, alright, alright)
It's, it's
I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now, took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys (No, no, no)
Bad as the boys
I met her in the summer, thinking life will get better
But she's gone now (Yeah), took my heart and sunk with it
She was just as bad as the boys (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bad as the boys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I, I know she, I know she used me for some fun
She was as bad as the boys
I, I know she, I know she used me for some fun
