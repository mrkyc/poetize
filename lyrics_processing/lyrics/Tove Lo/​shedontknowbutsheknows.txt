Hanging by the bar at sunrise
With our bodies talking
Hooked up last week, had a good time
So I regret nothing

I see her come close, ooh
I wonder what you told her to make her stay

Oh, she don't know what you did when ya come back home
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, she knows)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, she knows)

Blaming me for all the sadness
Didn't know 'bout you two
Nosey, why I'm dragged into it?
This whole thing is on you
You might also like
I see her heart break, ooh
Still, she's keeping face
Need it to make her stay

Oh, she don't know what you did when ya come back home
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, she knows)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, she knows)

Don't even bother with your lies
Won't let you see her when she cries
Go on, live happy in denial

Oh, she don't know what you did when ya come back home
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she knows (she knows, she knows)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
Oh, she don't know what you're doin' out all night long
Oh, she don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
