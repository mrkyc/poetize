He's gone, he's gone
You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone
He's gone, he's gone

I got a girlfriend, she's got a boyfriend
She calls me crying every day 'cause they got problems
He likes complaining, she's compromising
Coming to me for real advice when he just playing
I can tell she loves him way too deep
He loves being fucking hard to please
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations

Did you go down on his birthday? (Yup)
Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)
Or did you show him all your crazy? (No)
Blow him up on the weekends? (Mmm)
Did you give in to his ego
Just to give a little confidence?
I think you know it's time to let go
(You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone)
My baby...

Never no tears for that sucker
Only one dick, that's a bummer
Dancing all night, get guys' numbers
(You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone, he's gone)
Baby, no tears for that sucker
But never go dry this whole summer
Wanna get over, get under
(You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone)

He's gone, he's gone
You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone

Bitch, I love you, he never loved you
He never saw the pretty things in you that I do
I miss your madness, you're kinda ratchet
We used to go out every night, get into bad shit
You and me under each other's wing
We were free 'til he spoiled everything
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations
