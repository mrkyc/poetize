Pretty boys, they didn't teach me
Things I didn't know
They don't have the thing that I need
But they don't know they don't
You got that whole thing about ya
And I can't hide my feels
Pretty girls, they always die out
Need another sex appeal

I said, come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on

Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Pretty girls, they like it fancy
But you don't keep it clean (No)
We get dirty and we go hard
Some things, we don't mean
Tell me, "No one's gonna get ya"
I'm just straight up mad
A fool in love, roll up beside me
And you're just as bad
You might also like
I said, come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on

Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Keep playin' 'em like
Keep playin' 'em like
Yeah, keep playin' 'em like (Keep playin' 'em like)
Keep playin' 'em like
Yeah, keep playin' 'em like

I'm gonna get hurt
I'm gonna get hurt
Ah, come on

Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playin' my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster (True disaster)
Keep playin' 'em like (No)
Keep playin' 'em like (You keep, you keep, you keep playin' 'em like)
Yeah, keep playing 'em like
Keep playin' 'em like (Da-da-da-da-da-dun)
