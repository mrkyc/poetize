Counting while I run the tap
I'm on my knees
Chokin' on my hands all night
In my sleep
Counting all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out

The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me
I'd die for my love though, break
Break till I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
You might also like
Sweet girl, you're so disciplined
Now keep it down
I don't like my measurements
Won't make a sound
Diana, how she guards the clock (The clock)
She's in control (Control)
Now why is everyone in shock? (In shock)
You let her go

The swans of ballet ('Llet)
Their skin and their bones, that's not me (Me)
I'd die for my love though, break (Break)
Break till I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

When I'm hurting, every time I have a bad day
Then everyone gets lost
But I'm learning every time I feel out of place
That you are all I've got, oh

One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in (Oh)
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
