Ooh

They say be one with the city
So I'm standing in the sun all day
Got their manners mapped out
And they just smile, no matter what I say
But I, I am darker at heart
And so their smiles are playing tricks on me
I try to laugh it all off
Truth is I'm lost 'cause I'm supposed to be

This isn't home for me, this isn't home
This isn't home for me, this isn't home

Come whatever, now or never
I follow you anywhere you go
Yeah, wherever, doesn't matter
I follow you anywhere you go
Stay together, you make me better
And I say that we'll be there through it all
Come whatever, doesn't matter
I'll follow you anywhere you go
You might also like
Will you come with me, dive in deep
Get high by the beach all day?
And this is us, this young love
You should know I haven't changed
Will you come with me, dive in deep
Get high by the beach all day?
And this is us, this young love
I'll follow you anywhere you go

I'm always too drunk to drive
And so I'm never in the driver seat
Then we go out with your friends
All these new faces are a blur to me
And I try, I try
I really do, really do try
To pretend that I get it
'Cause I'm hopin' it will click someday

This isn't home for me, this isn't home
This isn't home for me, this isn't home, no

Come whatever, now or never
I'll follow you anywhere you go
Yeah, wherever, doesn't matter
I'll follow you anywhere you go (Oh, yeah)
Stay together, you make me better
And I say that we'll be there through it all
Come whatever, doesn't matter
I'll follow you anywhere you go
Will you come with me, dive in deep
Get high by the beach all day?
And this is us, this young love
You should know I haven't changed (You should know)
Will you come with me, dive in deep
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
And this is us, this young love
I'll follow you anywhere you go (I'll follow you anywhere you go, oh yeah)
Will you come with me, dive in deep (Come whatever, now or never)
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
And this is us, this young love (Come whatever, doesn't matter)
You should know I haven't changed (You should know I haven't changed)
Will you come with me, dive in deep (Come whatever, now or never)
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
And this is us, this young love (Come whatever, doesn't matter)
