Good people do bad things too
Pretend they don't know, but they do
It takes one to know you're mine
You and me, we are one of a kind, it's true

I like to feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearin' me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (Hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on till I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on till I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline
You might also like
Lost in the magic with you
A pretty disguise from the truth
Truth is ugly, don't open your eyes
I can change, I can change with just one more lie

I like to feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearin' me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (Hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life

I don't know what to do about a man that's this beautiful (Felt like you)
