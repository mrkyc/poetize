I grew up with a lot of green
Nice things 'round me
I was safe, I was fine
Grew up with a lot of dreams
Plans who to be
None of them, none were mine

I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And me

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts
But on good days, I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts
But on good days, I am charming as fuck

I can't be the perfect one
But I'll make you come
And I'm locked in your mind
You can say I don't belong
That I'm so wrong
I can tell, tell you lie
You might also like
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts
But on good days, I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts
But on good days, I am charming as fuck

Rough around the edges
Memories and baggage
You know me
Never play a safe card
When I go, I go hard
And now you know

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments (I)
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts (Now you know me)
But on good days, I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don'ts
