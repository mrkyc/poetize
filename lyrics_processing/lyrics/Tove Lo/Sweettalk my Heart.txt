Tell me you love me, tell me you're mine
Tell me, I know it, don't need a sign
But I feel different, know you don't lie
But I want attention, commitment, intertwined
What are your dreams?
Give me the details, all in-between
Just let me know, yeah, we can go far
Don't turn your shoulder, get colder, keep me warm

Sweeter than love
Is the taste of all those promises
That pulls you in for good
Can't get enough
Put your top moves on and run with it
Sweet talk that shit, so good

I can be yours
I can be yours now
I can be yours
I can be yours now
I can't get enough
Put your top moves on and run with it
Sweet talk that shit, so good

Tell me forever, how can you know?
It doesn't matter, see as we go
Hope is protection, saving us both
Got good intention and passion, can't run low
Don't wanna deal with all the sad stuff, keeping it real
Playing pretending when it gets rough
Don't want us ending, we're mending, shake it off

Sweeter than love
Is the taste of all those promises
That pulls you in for good
Can't get enough
Put your top moves on and run with it
Sweet talk that shit, so good

I can be yours
I can be yours now
I can be yours
I can be yours now
I can't get enough
Put your top moves on and run with it
Sweet talk that shit, so good
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet talk my heart
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet talk my heart
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (I can be yours)
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet talk my heart (I can be yours)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (I can be yours)
Ah, sweet, sweet talk my heart now
Mmm
I can be yours, yeah

Sweeter than love
Is the taste of all those promises
That pulls you in for good
Can't get enough
Put your top moves on and run with it
Sweet talk that shit, so good

I can be yours (I can be yours)
I can be yours now
I can be yours (I can be yours)
I can be yours now
I can be yours (I can be yours, I can be yours)
I can be yours now
I can be yours
