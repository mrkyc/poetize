Golden tables, broken mirrors, naked girls around
Young and scared of love affairs, so keep your conscience down
The world is beautiful, believe it with another line
Keep it up, if you're lucky enough, you know you're winnin' at life
Piles of paper, gonna make 'em roll around in it
Watch it dripping from her lips and wash your sins with it
Know it's hazy, but amazing, yeah, you like that shit
Keep it up, if you're lucky enough, you know you're winnin' at life

Safe with me
Move so free
Silently

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
You might also like
Pretty faces put in place to match the scenery
Take our pics, it's like a fix for your anxiety
The world is beautiful, so why don't you feel anything?
Keep it up, when you gettin' that rush, you know you cash your way out

Safe with me
Move so free
Silently

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
(Pushin', pullin')
(Pushin', pullin' 'til we die)
(Pushin', pullin')
(Pushin', pullin' 'til we die)
(Pushin', pullin')
We can take perfect pictures
(Pushin', pullin' 'til we die)
We can take perfect pictures all night
(Pushin', pullin')
We can take perfect pictures
(Pushin', pullin' 'til we die)
You better keep a straight face for the camera flashes, but you're fucked

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us, then you're in, too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind, too
Know you're lovin' the highs
