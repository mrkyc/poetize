Nothing but a dirty mind
Player burnin' bridges where she goes
Lookin' like the free card kind
But no one standin' 'round him wants him close

Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
White noise in my head, ego
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
Judge a babe who dance alone

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
I don't care if it's all true
I want you hangin' with me
I want you, I want you hangin' with me
I want you, I want you hangin' with me

Rumors are their only friend
Spread their shit around's what turns them on
I can see all eyes expand
Oh, they can't believe I take you home
You might also like
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
White noise in my head, ego
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
Judge a babe who dance alone

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
And I don't care if it's all true
I want you hangin' with me
I want you, I want you hangin' with me (I want you)
I want you, I want you hangin' with me

Perfect imperfections with mistakes and unlearned lessons
Yeah, you give me wood, give me lady wood
Dirty on the inside, damaged goods with nothin' but pride
Yeah, you give me wood, give me lady wood

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
I want you
I know what people say about you
They say the same, oh
I don't care if it's all true
I want you hangin' with me (Hangin' with me)
Oh, I want you, I want you hangin' with me
I don't care if it's all true
