Skin to skin, seepin' in
Flickerin', our eyes go wide
You're givin' me studder sight
Paintin' stars in our hearts
Yeah, you know I'm down for you
I want you to lick my wounds

What's your line, though?
That I'm fine, oh
Heard that before
But somehow, it means more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feelin' so high, fallin' into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? (Oh)
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feelin' so high, fallin' into you

Break away all the things
Stoppin' me from lettin' go
Temperature is takin' hold (Oh)
Heart beatin' faster and faster
I'll be your (You'll be my) brand new disaster
But I don't know
Seems like what you're lookin' for

What's your type, though?
Am I right, no?
Heard that before
But still, you want it more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feelin' so high, fallin' into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? (Oh)
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feelin' so high, fallin' into you
What's your type, though?
