Scanning you up and down
See you got curves in all the places that count
Only you in the crowd
He's looking at you and he looks happier now

Why, why, why
Why did I go to this party?
Thought I was done feeling sorry
Knew he'd be here with somebody
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really, I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time (Yeah, yeah)
I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really, I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time
You might also like
None of it is your fault
And when I hate on you, I'm breaking the code
But you got him, I don't, I don't
Hard to be fair to you when I got my heart broke

Why, why, why
Why did I go to this party?
Thought I was done feeling sorry
Knew he'd be here with somebody
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really, I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time (Yeah, yeah)
I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really, I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time
But I'm gonna try
Till my eyes and these drinks run dry
Till I, I don't feel anything
Oh why, why did I go to this party?
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to (I know)
I know I've got no right to (I know)
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight (Yeah)
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time (Time, yeah)
I know I've got no right to (Oh)
I know I've got no right to (I know)
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
Time, time, time

Wish it wasn't real, girl
You know how I feel, mmm
Wish it wasn't real, girl
