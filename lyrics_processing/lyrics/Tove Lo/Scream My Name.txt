Fist fights, long nights, come home late
Can't sleep, I keep me awake
Flip through the lives on TV
I'll say, for now, I'm happy

Love it when I'm play-pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fuckin' up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart

Breathing violence and love, I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood, yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone, will they sing about me?
Dead and gone, will they scream my name?
Scream my name

Wake up, guard up, and I'm bored
Night runs with guns, too hardcore
Don't dare to care about someone
I'm dirt, I'm ice, is that wrong?

Love it when I'm play-pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fuckin' up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart
