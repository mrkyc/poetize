What's your name?
I can tell you our story before we get into the game
We fall head over heels overnight
See my face in your future
I'm in your future, in your nights, mmm
We're intense
In a lip-lock now 24/7, don't want it to end
But reality's waitin', they say better come up for air soon
Yeah, come up for air soon
Make a change, mmm

Fallin' again, and don't understand
Never my plan, nah

I'm in a cycle
Yeah, I admit it
How can I change it when I don't know when I'm in it?
I'm in a cycle
Swear this is different
Don't wanna end it, if you leave then I keep spinnin'
Our love's a cycle
Don't mean we ain't true
Just 'cause I talk about the things I've done before you
I'm in a cycle
Swear this is different
Don't wanna end it, if you leave then I keep spinnin'

You're afraid (yeah)
The way I love you now and my love in the past are the same
And the things that I say are exactly what I used to tell them
And that really hurts me, but I know, mmm

Fallin'  again, and don't understand
Never my plan, no

I'm in a cycle
Yeah, I admit it
How can I change it when I don't know when I'm in it?

Just 'cause I talk about the things I've done before you
I'm in a cycle
Swear this is different
Don't wanna end it, if you leave then I keep spinnin'

Guess I'm romantic in a way
Why don't you catch me when I sway?
'Cause when my heart falls out of place
I know (oh, oh, oh)
I'm in a cycle
Yeah, I admit it
How can I change it when I don't know when I'm in it?
I'm in a cycle
Swear this is different
Don't wanna end it, if you leave then I keep spinnin'
