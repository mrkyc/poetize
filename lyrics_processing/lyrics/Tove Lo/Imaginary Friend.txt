People said you're not a superstar
Can't jump that far
You know better
Got my armor on with superglue
Can power through
Yeah, whatever

Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feelin' their doubt, shut them all out
Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feelin' their doubt, shut them all out
'Cause I need you

Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Keepin' me dreamin'
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
Ah
Keepin' me dreamin'
(Don't you know I)
Ah
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
You might also like
Breaking bones to feel like I'm alive
How kids get high
Need to feel it
We want big things, but they make us small
No game at all
They don't feel it

Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feelin' their doubt, shut them all out (Mm)
Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks

Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Keepin' me dreamin'
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again

Ah
Over, over again

Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Crushin' my heart, tear me apart
Feelin' their doubt, shut them all out
Over, over again

Ah
Keepin' me dreamin'
(Don't you know I, uh)
Ah
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now (Oh)
Keepin' me dreamin'
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again

I don't know, I, I guess it's kinda like a voice in my heart
