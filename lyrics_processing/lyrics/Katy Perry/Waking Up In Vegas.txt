You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin'
Dirty looks now, don't blame me

You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an SOS
(Oh) Ha, and get some cash out
(Oh) We're gonna tear up the town
(Oh) No, don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
Oh, yeah

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for wakin' up in Vegas
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
