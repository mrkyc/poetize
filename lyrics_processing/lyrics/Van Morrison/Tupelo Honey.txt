Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around all the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea

She's as sweet as Tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet, she's as sweet as Tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor bent on chivalry

She's as sweet as Tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (She's an angel)
She's as sweet as Tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor intent on chivalry
