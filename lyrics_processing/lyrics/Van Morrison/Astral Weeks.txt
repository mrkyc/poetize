If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
And lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again?

From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I pushed another door

Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
Lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again?

There you go
Standin' with the look of avarice
And talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter
Showin' pictures on the wall
Whisperin' in the halls
And pointin' a finger at me

There you go, there you go
Standin' in the sun darlin'
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before

There you go
Takin' good care of your boy
Seein' that he's got clean clothes
Puttin' on his little red shoes
Seeing that he's got clean clothes
A-puttin' on his little red shoes
A-pointin' a finger at me

And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Lookin' straight at you
And comin' through, darlin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, yeah
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
And lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again?
To be born again
To be born again

In another world, darling
In another world
In another time
Got a home on high
Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world
I'm nothing but a stranger in this world
I got a home on high
In another land
So far away
So far away
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Ooh, ooh
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
Ooh
Way up in the heaven, mmm
In another time, haha, mmm
In another place
In another time
In another place
And another face
Mmm
