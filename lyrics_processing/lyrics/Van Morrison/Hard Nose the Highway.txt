Hey kids, dig the first takes
Ain't that some interpretation?
When Sinatra sings against Nelson Riddle strings
And then takes a vacation

Seen some hard times
Drawn some fine lines
No time for shoeshines
And hard nose the highway

I was tore down at the dead's place
A shaved head at the organ
But that wasn't half as bad as it was, oh no
Belfast and Boston

Seen some hard times
Drawn some fine lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard nose the highway

Put your money where your mouth is
Then we can get something going
In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime
And leave one or two cards showing
See Van Morrison LiveGet tickets as low as $204You might also like
Seen some hard times
Drawn some fine lines
No time for shoeshines
And hard nose the highway
(Sing it again)
Seen some hard times
Drawn some fine lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard nose the highway

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
It may not be today
It may, it may be tomorrow
So if you live for today
Gotta keep in mind
It may be tomorrow
Yeah, further on up the road
Further on up, further on up
Further on up, further on up, further on up, further on
Up the road
This may help the hard nose
And hard nose the highway, yeah
Hard nose the highway, yeah
Sometimes gotta hard nose the highway, yeah
Hard nose the highway
Hard nose the highway
Further on, further on, further on up the road
I know you paid your dues in Canada
I know you paid your dues in Canada
But you just may, you just may have to hard nose
I hope not, I hope not but you just may have to
I hope not, I hope not but you just may have to
Hard nose the highway
Hard nose the highway
