Chamois cleaning all the windows
Singin' songs about Edith Piaf's soul
And I hear blue strains of "Ne regrette rien"
Cross the street from Cathedral Notre Dame
Meanwhile back in San Francisco
We're trying hard to make this whole thing blend
As we sit upon this jagged
Story block with you my friend

And it's a long way to Buffalo
It's a long way to Belfast city too
And I'm hoping the joist won't blow the hoist
'Cause this time they bit off more than they can chew

As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on (Yeah)

All the orange boxes are scattered
Against the Safeway supermarket in the rain
And everybody feels so determined
Not to feel anyone else's pain
No one makin' no commitments
To anybody but themselves
Talkin' behind closed doorways
Tryin' to get outside, get outside of empty shelves
See Van Morrison LiveGet tickets as low as $204You might also like
And for every cross-cuttin' country corner, country corner
For every Hank Williams railroad train that cried
And all the chains, badges, flags and emblems
And every strain on the brain and every eye

As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on (Yeah)

All the restaurant tables are completely covered
And the record company has paid out for the wine
You got everything in the world you ever wanted
And right about now your face should wear a smile (Doin' alright)
That's the way it all should happen
When you're in, when you're in the state you're in
Have you got your pen and notebook ready?
I think it's about time, time for us to begin

And meanwhile we're over on a 52nd Street apartment
Socializing with the wino few
Just to be hip and get wet with the jet set
But they was flyin' too high to see my point of view
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

Saint Dominic's preview (Turn back, come back)
Saint Dominic's preview (Turn around and look at the man)
