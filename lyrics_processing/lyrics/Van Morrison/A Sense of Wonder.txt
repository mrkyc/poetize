I walked in my greatcoat down through the days of the leaves
No before after, yes after before
We were shining our light into the days of blooming wonder
In the eternal presence, in the presence of the flame

Oh, didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
Oh, didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame?

On and on and on we kept singing our song
Through Newtonards and Comber, Gransha and the Ballystockart Road
With Spike and Boffyflow, I said I would describe the leaves for Samuel and Felicity
Rich, red browney, half burnt orange and green

Oh, didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
Oh, didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame?

It's easy to describe the leaves in the autumn
And it's oh so easy in the spring
But down through January and February
It's a very different thing

On and on and on, through the winter of our discontent
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too
I said I could describe the leaves for Samuel and what it means to you and me
You may call my love Sophia, but I call my love Philosophy

Oh, didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
Oh, didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame?
Didn't I, didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
Oh, didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame?

(In the flame) In the flame, child
(Didn't I come to bring you) A sense of wonder in the flame
(Didn't I come to bring you) In the flame, child
(Didn't I come to bring you)

Wee Alfie at the Castle Picturehouse on the Castlereagh Road
Whistling on the corner next door
Where he kept Johnny Mack Brown's horse
"O solo mio" by McGimsey
And the man who played the saw outside the city hall
Pastie suppers down at Davy's chipper
Gravy rings, wagon wheels, barmbracks, snowballs
A sense of wonder (Didn't I come to bring you)
A sense of wonder (Didn't I come to bring you)
(Didn't I come to bring you) A sense of wonder
(Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?)
(Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?)
(Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?)
