With the childlike visions leaping into view
Clicking, clacking of the high-heeled shoe
Ford and Fitzroy and Madame George
Marching with the soldier boy behind
He's much older now with hat on drinking wine
And that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through
Early cool night air like Shalimar
And outside they're making all the stops
The kids out in the street collecting bottle tops
Gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops
Happy taken Madame George
Oh, that's when you fall
Woah woah woah woah woah woah, that's when you fall
Yeah, that's when you fall
When you fall into a trance
Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance
With your folded arms and history books you glance
Into the eyes of Madame George
And you think you've found the bag
You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag
In the corner playing dominoes in drag
The one and only Madame George

She jumps up and says, "Lord have mercy, I think that it's the cops"
And immediately drops everything she gots
Down into the street below
And you know you gotta go
On that train from Dublin up to Sandy Row
Throwing pennies at the bridges down below
In the rain, hail, sleet and snow
Say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
Woah
And as you leave, the room is filled with music
Laughing music, dancing music all around the room
And all the little boys come around
Walking away from it all
So cool
And as you're about to leave
He jumps up and says, "Hey love
You forgot your glove"
And the love that loves to love
That loves the love that loves
The love that loves to love
The love that loves to love
The love that loves
To say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
Dry your eyes for Madame George
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain in the backstreet
In the backstreet, in the backstreet
Say goodbye to Madame George
In the backstreet, in the backstreet, in the backstreet
Well, down home, down home in the backstreet
Gotta go
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Dry your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye
Say goodbye to Madame George
And the love that loves, the love that loves, the love that loves to love, the love that loves the love to love, the love that loves to love
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
The love that loves, the love that loves to love, the love that loves to love, the love that loves to love
Say goodbye, goodbye
Get on the train
Get on the train, the train, the train, the train, the train
This is the train, this is the train, this is the train
Whoa, say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
