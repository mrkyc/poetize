I won't be satisfied till I see your face
Every victory, every loss
Every tick and every cross
You can put them all in place
It seems I'm finding more of why
In these moments
I feel like I'm made to sing of how good you are
The more the years swell by and pass
Each second more than last
It's truer by far
That no profound thought or clever rhyme
No soaring grand, melodic line
No theory, philosophy or sign
Can explain it
Can explain
Where you are, I wanna be
It's your love that has changed me
I'd give the world and all it's charms
For a moment in your arms
Better is one day with you
Than a thousand elsewhere
A thousand elsewhere
You might also likeI still remember what it felt like before you
I'm grateful every day for how things have changed
I'll thank you every way I can
'Cause my life only began
When I heard you call my name
Now, no praise of man
No great acclaim
No humble looking kind of fame
No power, wealth or worldly gain
Could satisfy me
Could every satisfy
'Cause where you are, I wanna be
It's your grace that has raised me
I'd give my whole life to honour you
In whom I live
In whom I move
Better is one day with you
Than a thousand elsewhere
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than anywhere else oh
Lead me, lead me
Lead me to yourself
Lead me to your heart
Where you are, I wanna be
It's your grace that has raised me
I'd give my whole life to honour you
In whom I live
In whom I move
Better is one day with you
Than a thousand elsewhere
Lead me to yourself
Lead me to your heart
I'll be found in you
I'll be found in you
Here is peace
Here is joy
Here is light
