Come this far by yourself
Face the world on your own
No one heard your cry for help
Thought you were alone
I got a different story to tell you
Cause I've been there before
You know you feel so much
But there is so much more
You could wait
But there may not be tomorrow
So can you take
A minute just to listen and to let it go
This is the time
This is the place
This is the love
That was given to us by grace
Dont turn away
Today is the day
Open up your heart
His love is waiting, waiting
(Forever waiting)
