You know we can't give up
You know it's hard enough
Let's come together
Let's come together
Once upon a magazine
There I saw a beauty queen
And she challenged me to be something I cannot be
She had the looks, the kind that kill
With one look I felt so incomplete and obsolete
I can't compete, you can't compete
So I'm lookin' in the mirror I'm tryin' to see mine
Not the traces of the faces that I've seen a million times
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life
I don't have to change
I'm a girl
Livin' in a world
Where wrong is right and my body's more important than my mind
So come on girls we've got to get together
You know we can't give up
You know it's hard enough to be a girl
Girl, girl
Livin' in a world
You might also likeSo you want a perfect girl
In a mini skirt and pearls
With a lovely disposition and changeable opinions
That may be nice, but here's the facts...
I won't sacrifice true love that lasts for house and cash
I can't do that, I won't do that
So I'm lookin' in the mirror and I can't believe my eyes
Cause I'm seeing what's inside me for the very first time
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life
I don't have to change
I'm a girl
Livin' in a world
Where wrong is right and my body's more important than my mind
So come on girls we've got to get together
You know we can't give up
You know it's hard enough to be a girl
Let's come together
Let's come together
Let's come together
Gotta get your influence from things that bring you something real
So c'mon live your life girl
God can give you the hope
If you just imagine
Oh that He can do what you want Him to
Just imagine
