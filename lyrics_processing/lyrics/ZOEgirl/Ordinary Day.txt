Feeling the pressure from all of the things I gotta face today
All of my days are totally crazy
Can't do nothing right
It's an ordinary day
Every minute feels like am hour slowly creeping by
All of this stress, but I do my best to take it all in stride
I need to decidde need to unwind all these things are on my mind
It's an ordinary day
Things are crazy but it's alright
You make me feel alive again
When it rains You are the sunshine
That lights me up from deep within
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure
You've given me the pleasure of an ordinary day
Pounding the pavement, another engagement, gotta make it there on time
Hitting the side walk, hearing the small talk of people passing by
Wondering why, gotta rewind
Think I gotta clear my mind
It's an ordianry day
What are the chances I've locked glances with a passer by
Oh, this stranger must be an angel 'cause he smiled
I wonder if he knows everything I know
That there is life in an ordinary day
You might also likeThings are crazy but it's alright
You make me feel alive again
When it rains You are the sunshine
That lights me up from deep within
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure

When it rains You are the sunshine
That lights me up from deep within....
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure
