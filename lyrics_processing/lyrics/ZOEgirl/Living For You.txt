I closed my eyes and let You in
Ready to let my life begin
It just hit me, couldn't ignore it
Heard Your voice calling now I know it
I wanna see Your face
I wanna speak Your name
I wanna tell the whole world how my life has changed
I'm gonna lift my voice
Ever to sing Your praise
As long as I'm alive know that I
I'm living for You
Lord, here I stand before You now
I want to give You everything
No matter what may come my way
You give me a smile they can't take away
Holding onto all You brought me through
You're the strength that I'll always cling to
I wanna see Your face
I wanna speak Your name

Life has changed
I'm gonna lift my voice
Ever to sing Your praise
As long as I'm alive know that I
I'm living for You
