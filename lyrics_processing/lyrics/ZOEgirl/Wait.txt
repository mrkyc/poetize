You've been hurt, you've been lied to
You ran all your life just to get out of your shoes
But you settled in too soon; now your road is clearly dark
No room for any light to break through
You're on a mission to get even with the world
To give back all the pain you received, it's just too hard to believe that anything could make it better
Please don't let it end this way
You could wait another day
It's foolish games that players play
One choice can bring you so much ache
Please don't end up this way
There's got to be some other way
You could live without this mistake
So please wait
You've been betrayed; left so confused
You couldn't understand how trust could be so abused
So you let the darkness come over you
Now you don't know anyone to turn to
You're beat up and bitter, face down in the cold
Lying on the ground with footprints on your back
Where you gunna go? You've never been so low

(If you would only wait) Please don't let it end this way
You could wait another day
