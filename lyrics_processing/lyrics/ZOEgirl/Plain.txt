Well, let me tell you something I have felt the same
I know you're in pain, but they'll be another boy along the way
And God, He made you beautiful and
There' s nothing about you that's plain
You are a jewel, you are a treasure
You are one of a kind
And you shine just as bright as the stars in the sky
You're a rare kind of wonder, created just right
So keep your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain
You tell me you're not the type, the kind of girl that they like
And you're a little insecure of how you look in their eyes
Well, fashion will change, and trends come and go everyday
But God only made one of you and
There's nothing about you that's plain
You are a jewel, you are a treasure
You are one of a kind
And you shine just as bright as the
Stars in the sky
You're a rare kind of wonder, created
Just right
So keep your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain
You might also likeSee your mind, it is precious
Though your heart may be restless
And your eyes they will see all that you're meant to be
'Cause your spirit is strong and your soul carries on
You keep your head up no matter the pain
There' s nothing about you that's plain
Ya know, I have my days when I feel out of place, yeah
I look at who I am, I cover what I can
I wish it would change
But you take the make-up away, you'll see the same girl still remains
She may not feel that beautiful but
There's nothing about
Her that's plain
You are a jewel, you are a treasure
You are one of a kind
And you shine just as bright as the stars in the sky
You're a rare kind of wonder, created just right
So keep your head up no matter the pain
And I'll keep my head up no matter the pain, yeah
We'll keep our heads up no matter the pain
There' s nothing about you that's plain
You may have felt plain but
God, He knows your name
And let me tell you something
There's nothing about you that's plain
Spoken:
It's your life
What are you doing?
