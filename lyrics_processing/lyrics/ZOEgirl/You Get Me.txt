Is what I percieved
This life would be
Pain and problem free
But over time
I found reality
And through it all I see
That you're the only one who gets me
I may be missunderstood 'cause I wouldn't ever fake it
You're the only one who understands my pain
Cause you get me
Doesn't matter what they do what they think what they say
At the end of the day i'm okay anyway
'cause LORD you get me
No more tears
It's a silent night
You're broken down on fear
'cause you remain in all of me
You know me better than I know myself
The key to my security
There is no one else who gets me
I may be missunderstood 'cause I wouldn't ever fake it
You're the only one who understands my pain
'cause you get me
Doesn't matter what they do what they think what they say
At the end of the day i'm okay anyway
'cause LORD you get me
