I kept my anger yearning close to me like fire burning
I watched a million chances slip through my withered hands
I almost lost myself
When I looked around there was no one else
In the nick of time You overtook my mind and suddenly I saw the world much clearer, in the nick of time You turned my water to wine and suddenly I didn't feel the fear, right before my eyes You showed me there was life left to be found, You're the miracle I prayed about, You were the One to save my life, in the nick of time
I followed habits around, been swept above the clouds
I've fallen down, I've shaken up and down by the pills I've taken
I could have kept on going with no one ever knowing
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me?
In the nick of time You overtook my mind and suddenly I saw the world much clearer, in the nick of time You turned my water to wine and suddenly I didn't feel the fear, right before my eyes You showed me there was life left to be found, You're the miracle I prayed about, You were the One to save my life, in the nick of time
I could not, I could not believe that You were right there waiting, I never knew, I'd never dreamed that You'd be right there waiting, You were right there, You were right there, You were right there, You were there for me, mmm-hmm, when I couldn't see, I couldn't, no I couldn't see
You showed me
Life, life, life, life, life, You showed me life, life, You showed me life, You showed me life
Right before my eyes, You showed me there was life yet to be found, You're the miracle I prayed about, You were the One to save my life, in the nick of time
In the nick of time You overtook my mind and suddenly I saw the world much clearer, in the nick of time You turned my water to wine and suddenly I didn't feel the fear, right before my eyes You showed me there was life left to be found, You're the miracle I prayed about, You were the One to save my life, in the nick of time
In the nick of time, in the nick of time, in the nick of time
