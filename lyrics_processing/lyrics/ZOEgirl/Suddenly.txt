Hold on, something's bound to break
Falling down, running from the promised land
Midnight, and I'm still awake
Don't feel right, haven't slept for days
I'm so tired my thoughts are getting weak
And I'm wired, can I get some peace?
Suddenly you are here with me
Finding a reason to believe
I know you'll be here to the end of time
And when the night falls all around
My frightened heart the only sound
I know you'll be here to the end of time
Maybe it was my mistakes
That kept on pulling me away
I was still living yesterday
The message that I want to relay
Without Him, there's no other way
So don't try to make it on your own
When you're lost, He will lead you home
Suddenly you are here with me
Finding a reason to believe
I know you'll be here to the end of time
And when the night falls all around
My frightened heart the only sound
I know you'll be here to the end of time
You might also likeCan't imagine life without your hand in mine
I can't believe I've lived this long without you
I know that You will find a purpose for my life
Beyond my wildest dreams, beyond what I can see
Suddenly you are here with me
Finding a reason to believe
I know you'll be here to the end of time
And when the night falls all around
My frightened heart the only sound
I know you'll be here to the end of time
Suddenly you are here with me
Finding a reason to believe
I know you'll be here to the end of time
And when the night falls all around
My frightened heart the only sound
I know you'll be here to the end of time
Suddenly you're here and I'm not alone anymore
