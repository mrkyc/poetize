Seems like everybody's got one
I had the devil waiting on standby
For when I wanted to have some fun
Thought that I was living forever
I thought that my smile would get me in
Never felt the wave that was coming
Never thought the party would end
No, no, no, no...
Chorus
Little did I know
That you were all I needed
Little did I see
Until you opened up my eyes
Little did I know
That one prayer could reach you
Little did I know
That you'd even care
I had my daddy wrap 'round my finger
Tp never make my momma cry (cry)
Nothin but smiles on the outside
But all the while living a lie
If you ask me "Are you going to heaven?"
I'll say you know I've been a good good girl
I'm gonna spend all my money on makeup
And a find a boy who will buy me the world

That you were all I needed
Little did I see
Until you opened up my eyes
Little did I know
That one prayer could reach you
Little did I know
That you'd even care
Little did I know
That you loved me before I met you
I didn't see beyond myself
But I couldn't fight forever
Because you are so easy to love
And now we play together
My life has just begun
Little did I know
That you were all I needed
Little did I see
Until you opened up my eyes
Little did I know
That one prayer could reach you
Little did I know
That you'd even care
Little did I know
That you were all I needed
Little did I see
Until you opened up my eyes
Little did I know
That one prayer could reach you
Little did I know
