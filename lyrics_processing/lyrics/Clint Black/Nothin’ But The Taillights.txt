Blue Kentucky highway
Headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night but the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

Was it somethin' that I did to her
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were
Was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parkin' spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck
See Clint Black LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also like
Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind

Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' at how
She brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

She'll be walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights she won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

There she goes
And here I come
Leave me out there in the middle of nowhere
