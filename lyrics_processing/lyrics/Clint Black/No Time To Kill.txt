There's no time to kill between the cradle and the grave
Father time still takes a toll on every minute that you save
Legal tender's never gonna change the number on your days
The highest cost of livin's dyin', that's one everybody pays
So have it spent before you get the bill, there's no time to kill

If we'd known ten years ago today would be ten years from now
Would we spend tomorrow's yesterdays and make it last somehow
Or lead the cheers in someone else's game and never learn to play
And see the rules of thumb are all the same that measure every day?
The grass is green on both sides of the hill, there's no time to kill

No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill

If we had an hourglass to watch each one go by
Or a bell to mark each one to pass, we'd see just how they fly
Would we escalate the value to be worth its weight in gold
Or would we never know the fortunes that we had 'til we grow old?
And do we just keep killin' time until there's no time to kill?

No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill
