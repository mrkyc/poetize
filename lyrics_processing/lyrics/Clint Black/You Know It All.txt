People tryin to get through some will never get an answer
But I've already found a way to get through to you
It comes in gentle and clear I'm still the same romancer
And you know what I'm thinkin if I have to tell you myself
I can never let you wonder what I want you to believe
And there isn't any wonder at how lucky I am
From the smile that I'm wearin and the heart out on my sleeve
(Chorus)
Everybody thinks they know me I don't doubt that it's true
I've never been one to put up many walls
There's so much of me they'll never know not the way you do
When it comes to me you know it all
I've seen all of the signs and all the changing of minds
And signals gettign crossed and the killing seeds are planted
But those could never grow out of things that we know
Like the vows that we made we can always take for granted
While everyone else is losin groung you know where I stand
Forsakin everyone but you to reap the love we sow
And one thing everybody knows is I'm a man of my word
And you and I have places that I'll never let them go while
(Repeat Chorus)
My life has been an open book til you walked in
And turned a page I never saw
You found a side of me that even I could never see
When it comes to me you know it all
