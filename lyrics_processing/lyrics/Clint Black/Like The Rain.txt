I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thundercloud that came was one more I might not get through
But on the darkest day, there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you

I hear it fallin' in the night and fillin' up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light, I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin' through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe, I never liked the rain

(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

When the cloud is rollin' over, thunder's strikin' me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, fallin'

(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

And when the night falls on our better days, and we're lookin' to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways, to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin', forever we'll be fallin'

(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
