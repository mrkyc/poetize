I want it, I need it, I want somebody
I want it, I need it, I want your eyes to turn
I need it, I want it, I want somebody
Baby, now this is my turn

I don't want any more doors cause I'm walkin' on the string
They only slam any more like we're pulling our teeth
And I could just see your eyes just above your shoulder
And you were scannin' the skies for me
I dreamt like you were some long-forgotten soldier
Like I was someone that you cared for

I want it, I need it

I want it, I need it, I want somebody
I want it, I need it, I want your eyes to turn
I need it, I want it, I want somebody
Baby, now this is my turn

I don't want any more heartbreak, I'm tired of the sound it makes
Like tryin' to shut out the dark at night, you close your eyes but it won't erase
And you were walkin' beside some other person's shadow
And it was more than I could take I wouldn't see what I couldn't know
But there might be somebody after me

Oh, I want it, I need it

I want it, I need it, I want somebody
I want it, I need it, I want your eyes to turn
I need it, I want it, I want somebody
Baby, now this is my turn

I need that new vacation where nothing that's spoken is known
Let the winter be my station, I'll let the cold teach me what to know
That there might be somebody after me

I want it, I need it
I want it, I want it, I need it

I want it, I need it, I want somebody
I want it, I need it, I want your eyes to turn
I need it, I want it, I want somebody
