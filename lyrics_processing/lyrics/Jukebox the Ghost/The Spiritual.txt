Some walk quiet and some walk loud
Sometimes people yell but they don't know what they're yellin' about
I've said things I didn't mean but I'd already said them out loud
Forgive me if you can find out how
You could rise or you could sink
Some get filled up with the secrets that they think they need
Oh, whatever would the others think
That you're human like the rest of us, weak

Lord above me to my knees bring me
It's a call I don't often make, this is the rarest of pleas, fair enough
Again you got the best of me
Now let me go, let me go in peace

I should've left but for you I stayed (for you I stayed)
There's a part of me that likes it when it burns that way
I put my finger time and time through an open flame
Going slowly so the burn reminds me
That we might have kissed a bit too soon
I could feel what was coming and I didn't mean to hurry you
I just knew that time would find our fingers linked through and through
Forgive me, I'm human too

Lord above me to my knees bring me

Again you got the best of me
Now let me go, let me go in peace

I walk the night as the rain turned to sleet then to ice
The roads became cruel and left me to my vices (to my vices)
So I drank, stood, stared, and then walked out into the street
Singing come on "chorus line" take me

Lord above me to my knees bring me
It's a call I don't often make, this is the rarest of pleas, fair enough
Again you got the best of me
Now let me go, let me go in peace
NO!
