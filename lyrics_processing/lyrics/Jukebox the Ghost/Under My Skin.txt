How much can you fit under your skin?
How much can you fit under your skin?
I wish you were dead, babe, I wish you were dead
I can fit two, I can fit two

I can fit two people under my skin
Yeah, I can fit two people under my skin
And I will prove it if you will listen
You crawled up in there, you joined me within

I can feel your heart beating under my skin
And the beating of your heart is making me bleed from within
And if we cut open your heart, pour it in a cup
Do you think it'd be enough, do you think it'd be enough
To fill my heart with music?

Well, oh no, not a chance in hell
Yeah, I've heard ya sing, but it ain't too well
Heartfelt, yeah, ya meant so well
But your song's no good round here

I can feel you breathing under my skin
Yeah, I can feel you breathing under my skin
And each breath you take is a brand new begin
Each breath you take, brand new beginning

England has a way of getting under my skin
And my family has a way of getting under my skin
And my family had a castle way back when
I would have lived there if they had more male children
To fill my heart with music

But oh no, not a chance in hell
Yeah, I've heard ya sing, but it ain't too well
Heartfelt, yeah, ya meant so well
But your song's no good round here
Oh no, not a chance in hell
Yeah, I've heard ya sing, but it ain't too well
Heartfelt, yeah, ya meant so well
But your song's no good round here
No, no, no, no!

I don't think there's anyone under your skin
Like a Cheshire cat, I think that you are just a grin
And I can feel you laughing under my skin
And the happy palpitations are making me grin
You know it fills my heart with music

But oh no, not a chance in hell
Yeah, I've heard ya sing, but it ain't too well
Heartfelt, yeah, ya meant so well
But your song's no good round here
Oh no, not a chance in hell
Yeah, I've heard ya sing, but it ain't too well
Heartfelt, yeah, ya meant so well
But your song's no good round here
