I don't want you to feel broken
I just want you to feel good
Let's put away all those past indiscretions
Let it go, do you think you could?

I just want you to be happy
I just want you to be glad
So that every time you wake up
You're not thinking of someone
Trying to set you back

Good idea, good idea, you keep me waiting 'round
I'll just wait here until you decide to come back to town
You don't call, that's alright, you send me a postcard
You send me a postcard
You send me a postcard

Yeah you dream but you have to
Work out the secrets you have
Kiss him under the dream light
Don't tell me, I won't ask

So that every time you wake up

Trying to set you back

Good idea, good idea, you keep me waiting round
I'll just wait here until you decide to come back to town
You don't call, that's alright, you send me a postcard
You send me a postcard
You send me a postcard

Enough's enough and oh that dream light it is killing me
I can't be next to you and not think about what you're thinking
So I just hang on your words and read between the lines
Cause you send me a postcard
Yeah, you send me a postcard

Good idea, good idea, you keep me waiting round
I'll just wait here until you decide to come back to town
Good idea, good idea, just give me a shout
Oh I don't mind as long as you keep coming back around
You don't call, that's alright, you send me a postcard
You send me a postcard
