I could've sworn I felt the influence of an unseen hand
The ghost of someone else's dream
A forgotten god stopping by to survey the scene
And the lights were complicated and so we all just
Prayed to the spirits above and below
That the water would never reach us in time
But I had a feeling that we'd never get to 2009
Didn't want a wave but a wave was coming, yeah
We didn't wanna swim but the cities were sinking
Though we wanted to react we were too busy sleeping through
The ground that was shaking, the bass was thumping
There's a tidal wave coming so you'd better start learning to swim
There's a tidal wave coming so you'd better start learning
And now's as good as any as a time and place to begin
On TV, they said the storms wouldn't last
But their answers didn't correlate to the questions we'd asked
They said, "A spark that's gone is not a spark to mourn
You can't resuscitate a person who was never born"
So I climbed to the tallest building in town
To see the rain rushing in, to feel my heart breaking down
And as the blue sheen drew nearer I saw a window to another world
Strange fish I'd never seen and in that moment I realized

There's a tidal wave coming so you'd better start learning
Now's as good as any as a time and place to begin
I should have known this was coming, yeah
It could not have been more obvious
Like the flood that Noah dreamed about
Except bigger and more ominous
I should have seen this was unfolding, yeah
It could not have been more obvious
Like the flood that Noah dreamed about
Except bigger and more ominous
Every moment lost someone else has won
Every time you breathe there's another gone
Every passing second is a minute late
Every breath can escalate a hurricane
And do you think we'd realize just what we'd done
Tore down the canvas that held up the sun?
We ripped down the canvas hung up above
But what if we were created to gaze
What if we were created to gaze at the stars up above?
Didn't want a wave but a wave was coming, yeah
We didn't wanna swim but the cities were sinking
Though we wanted to react we were too busy sleeping through
