Slumped over the steering wheel
Of an interstate runaway, bursting into flames
And the devil was gently breathing
Sleeping face-down in my apartment
And like all his friends, I'm growing tired of his games
And there's a homeless man, arranging his hands
Grooving to the beat radiating from a police scanner
He said, "The air was feeling good to me
As cool and ripe as air can be"
And a woman who sincerely believes in UFOs
Who can blame her when the
Stars are hanging overhead
Dangling by a thread
Floating ten thousand feet off the ground
This was a story told to me
When I was just the age of 17
One which God himself dictated to me
He said, "This is how all this shit's gonna be
When I blow your little planet into smithereens
Blow your little planet into smithereens"
It haunted my dreams
Like an accident on replay on
The TV screen

Strange machines she'd never seen
Blueprints of submarines
To reassemble in a time of dire need
And there were preachers in the desert
Waving to the crowd
Dictating seven angry letters
From a man up in the clouds
And there were 27 soldiers
Telling 27 lies
And a hole inside a hurricane
With a pair of beady eyes

A pair of beady eyes
Looking down
Onto the pavement
While the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all want a front seat
When shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova
Turned the other way around
There were strangers in the subway
And men in limousines, making deals
And swapping photographs of cans of gasoline
There are no angels in the woodwork
Or devils on the ground
They're looking through a hurricane's
Tectonic wall of sound
And a man who smokes his cigarettes
The other way around
She is looking in behind him, from inside a wall of sound
And she is dancing with the neon cause
The air is feeling good
Against her arms and legs and fingertips
Are measuring the distance
In the spaces in between
Me and you and all your friends
And there's no time to load a weapon
No time to make amends
And people frozen in their tracks
They're staring at the sky
At a hole inside a hurricane revealing
A pair of beady eyes
A pair of beady eyes
Looking down
Onto the pavement
While the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all want a front seat
When shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova
Turned the other way around

This is not a test, this is the real thing
