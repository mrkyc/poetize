I think I'll go down in flames
Wouldn't ask you to join me
Cause that would be insane
But you could warm your hands
I would stake out your place right here next to me
They will come from miles away
Cause it's cold outside
And they need a place
To rub on their hands and feet
What better time and place than here?
Cause you've become a fire for me
Ever since you turned eighteen, love
And then you said that love was
Just some sort of passing thing
You've become a fire in me
Ever since you turned eighteen
And the cold ain't so cold
When you hold yourself to me
They will come from miles away
In your honor
In their Sunday best of sleeveless shirts and winter coats
Oh they've been waiting for this for years

There's a fire there
But it's not that I'm on fire, yeah it's deep inside
They're jumping to the peppered sky
Cause you've become a fire for me
Ever since you turned eighteen, love
And then you said that love was
Just some sort of passing thing
You've become a fire in me
Ever since you turned eighteen
And the cold ain't so cold
When you hold yourself to me
Look! You can see it in their eyes
They're afraid that they'll catch fire
Cause I told them, they're filled with gasoline
Cause it's what my heart desires
All these little birds, are chirping in their worlds
Twenty feet above the street where our footprints are heard
You're wearing it down, you know, when you walk like that
We're not supposed to carry ourselves in the smalls of our backs
And you're wearing it down, you know, when you walk like that
We're not supposed to carry ourselves in the smalls of our backs
Yeah you're wearing it down, you know, when you walk like that
