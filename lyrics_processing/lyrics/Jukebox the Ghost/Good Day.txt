I think that I would like
To invite everyone I've known, dead and alive
To a street where we can be
Finally free
And they will come in droves
Wearing their hearts on their sleeves, but oh
How good it felt to have 'em worn
Just like they should

And everybody here wants to know

Did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Suddenly, we all got young
Running circles around ourselves just for fun
And oh, how good it felt
To be young and loved, and feel it in our bones

And everybody here wants to know

Did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh, did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

We go there when we're in trouble
We got old and old age made us humble
You and I are alone

That it felt like this, we were never told
That it felt like this we were never told
And it scares us bad so we'll have to be bold
But there's still one thing that we need to know

Did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh, did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh, did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh, did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
D-d-d-d-did they smile 'cause they like it, d-did they?
Whoa-oh, did everybody say what a good day that it was?
For everybody who said what a good day that it was
Did they smile 'cause they like it?
Did they smile 'cause they like it, did they?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
