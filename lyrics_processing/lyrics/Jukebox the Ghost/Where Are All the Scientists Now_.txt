Plaster and glass as an earthquake
Came floodin' through my living room
The sky was black with ink and
As it began to sink, I thought of you
And as the smoke came floodin' in beneath the doorway
I saw Satan shakin' hands, holdin' a briefcase
Where inside there's a plan that contains an X Command
For soldiers in the desert and toy soldiers marchin' in the sand
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da
I'm innocent, I'm innocent
Keep me out of this
Keep me out of this, keep me out of this
Keep me out of this
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da
Laaa daa daa daa da daa da daa da daa
Laaa daa daa daa da daa da daa da daa
Laaa daa daa daa da daa da daa da daa
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da
It's the end of the world, la da di da da da da da

We survived!
They lit up the inside of the moon
We survived!
To remind us that help would be arriving soon
We survived!
Hangin' tinsel in clear view
Erecting scaffolding and Christmas lights
Dedicated and renovated for you
We survived!
They lit up the inside of the moon
We survived!
Hangin' tinsel in clear view
We survived!
Erecting scaffolding and Christmas lights
Dedicated and renovated for you
And taking a cue from the animals burrowing down
You dug a hole inside the architecture
