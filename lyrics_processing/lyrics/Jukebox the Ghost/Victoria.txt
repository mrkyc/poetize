Victoria approached me with a fire in her eyes
And I swear and I swear, I was burning alive
And now you're crying wolf out to the moon
Yeah, is anybody there or am I just as scared as you?
And now you've given me a mission to do
I've got to rearrange the stars so that they're not as far from you

But you are certainly my poison of choice, sigh
And I know you've had your fair share of boys
But you are certainly my poison of choice
And when I drink you down
My heart makes a sound
Like this

Victoria approached me with a fire in her eyes
And I swear and I swear, I was burning alive
And you are causing me physical pain
It's like you're handing me a knife and from my insides
And without any shame

But you are certainly my poison of choice, sigh
And I know you've had your fair share of boys
But you are certainly my poison of choice
And when I drink you down
My heart makes a sound
Like this

I came down without any sense of conviction, yeah
I couldn't tell if you were a bitch or totally bitchin', so

Victoria's been crying, I can see it in her eyes
And yeah, a part of me is sad, but a part of me is having such a good time!
And I know that likely I am at fault
Oh, but what the hell, I can't even tell if she's putting me on

You are certainly my poison of choice, sigh
And I know you've had your fair share of boys
But you are certainly my poison of choice
And when I drink you down
My heart makes a sound
Yeah, when I drink you down
My heart makes a sound
When I drink you down
My heart makes a sound
