Hey, yeah, we're just getting started
Take your fears and let them go
For the lovers and the broken-hearted
Take a deep breath, make the world a little colorful

Wanna feel like a light in a dark place
Another color in a world of black and white
Wanna try to paint the world in a new way
Left home with a dream and a suitcase

Work hard, play hard, we don't have to grow up
Hide and seek, promise me that we'll never grow up

Hey, yeah, we're just getting started
Take your fears and let them go
For the lovers and the broken-hearted
Take a deep breath, make the world a little colorful
Hey, yeah, we're just getting started
Take your fears and let them go
For the lovers and the broken-hearted
Take a deep breath, make the world a little colorful
