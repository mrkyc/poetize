It seems like I can do no wrong for your eyes
Sing the wrong lines to my own song, you don't mind
Make it up as we go
All the words we don't know
Even when I'm a drunken mess, you don't care
Still like me better than the rest
I swear, I don't understand it
How you like me when I'm dancing (Hey!)

Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire
Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire

All my idiosyncrasies, you like 'em
Annoyed at all the little things
I know I can be frustrating
But you still like me when I'm dancing

Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire
Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire

When I lose myself, there is no one else
Who ever sees through me quite like you

Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire
Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes, I can do no crime
When I dance like I don't care, you call me Fred Astaire

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You call me Fred Astaire
Those eyes, damn, those eyes, they get me every time
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
