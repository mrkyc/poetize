Oh, here's to new mornings, to new evenings
Pack your bags, babe, and we are leaving
Don't you say no, 'cause I know that you want to go
Oh, believe me
Out west, babe, out west with the rest
We'll go fast, and we'll go faster yet
Don't you worry, I've been there before

And so has everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it

So mark on your skin something that you like
Some phrase or a symbol that might
Better say who you were at that time in your life

But not because everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it

And if you wanna do the popular thing, oh
Well then, follow away
But if you want to find something unique, oh
You can't look that way
'Cause if you give it any more than a peek, oh
Well, then you will have changed

Because everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it

So have a kiss, babe, one little kiss
And you won't ever never never never miss it
'Cause when you get kissed you also get to kiss
And one thing then leads to another
But don't prematurely make her a mother
Make sure that you love her 'til death do you part

But not because everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it

And if you wanna do the popular thing, oh
Well then, follow away
But if you want to find something unique, oh
You can't look that way
'Cause if you give it any more than a peek, oh
Well, then you will have changed

Because everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it
Well look now, there's a graveyard
You'll be in one, like it or not
You can't pick when, but you can pick your lot

And everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
Everybody, everybody's doing it

And if you wanna do the popular thing, oh
Well then, follow away
But if you want to find something unique, oh
You can't look that way
'Cause if you give it any more than a peek, oh
Well, you will have changed

Because everybody else, everybody else, everybody else
