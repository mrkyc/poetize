You awoke to find the war was finally done
You rubbed your eyes and squinted at the sun
Which was brighter and hotter and better and lit up
The earth like a birthday cake
You were amazed you were still living
To celebrate this new beginning
Where the grass is a little greener
And the Earth is a little bigger
And the trees are a little taller
Due to air that's a little cleaner
And suddenly
Voices rang out from the clouds
Bursting out in song
Speakers pumping loud
Keep on crying just to stop the water rising
To your brain composed of dirt
You keep on pissing to keep on drinking
You keep on eating to keep on shitting
Time will wear you down
You clapped your hands and sighed
You were amazed that you survived
And the air that you were breathing
Gave you a supernatural feeling

With the rhythm of your breathing
Mixed with the speed of the Earth spinning
Was precisely the same speed as earthquakes
Building beneath your feet
Awaking strangers that you meet
To see the collision of a hurricane
And a suicidal plane, oh God
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
Until, suddenly
A voice will ring out from the clouds
Bursting out in song
Speakers pumping loud
Keep on crying just to stop the water rising
To your brain composed of dirt
And keep on pissing to keep on drinking
You keep on eating to keep on shitting
Time will wear you down
Keep on crying just to stop the water rising (Keep on pissing to keep on drinking)
To your brain composed of dirt (To keep on eating to keep on shitting)
Keep on pissing to keep on drinking (Keep on crying)
To keep on eating to keep on shitting (Just to stop the water rising)
Time will wear you down
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
