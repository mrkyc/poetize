Open up to the night
Our bed is underneath a heavy moon
Cast a doubt
Like a shadow walking through the corners of the room
I always thought I'd have a full tank to go
But not tonight, you're all alone
I always thought I'd find my own way

What's going on in your head now?
Maybe something I said?
I know that you've been living in the past
What's going in your head now?
Maybe something I said

It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny me
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside, you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny me
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
Not gonna, not gonna deny my love
Gonna deny my love
You can try to lie but you're not gonna
Gonna deny my love

The eyes of God are watching over us
So we don't break the golden rule
The seven seas, have we learned
Or are we sailing on a ship of fools?
I always thought I had a full tank to go
But not tonight, you're all alone
I always thought we'd get there someday

It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny me
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside, you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny me
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
Not gonna, not gonna deny my love
Gonna deny my love
You can try to lie but you're not gonna
Gonna deny my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
Gonna deny my love, my love, my love, my love
