I arrived on a midwest summer
The Daybreak, a day late
Became a man with a plan in his hands
And a passion for being great

I was a lover, not a fighter
Burning time with a lighter
Looting hearts, taking charge
I was none the wiser

Had me running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
You might also like
In a place and time so cosmically aligned by my telephone
You were waiting, contemplating on a time to call me your own

You had a fighter, not a lover
A star, he couldn't love her
I said I'd put you under cover
Kindred to one another

Had me running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Being brave with wires in the way of us tonight
Wish you'd stay a little longer by moonlight
The calvary is asleep
You know it's easy for me
To surrender
To surrender

Had me running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
Running like a
Bandit from the gun
Shot me with your
Caliber of love
(Bandit from the gun)
(Caliber of love)
