HE WAS A GOOD MAN
THAT IS, YOU SEE, WHAT I MEAN IS
I THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD MAN
I HAD A FRIEND
SHE WAS A GOOD FRIEND
I TOLD MY FRIEND 'BOUT MY MAN 'CAUSE
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A GOOD FRIEND
LIFE WAS SWEET
DIDN'T I HAVE MY MAN?
WORLD COMPLETE...
THEN THE FIREWORKS BEGAN
AIN'T GOT NO MAN
AIN'T GOT NO FRIEND
I BET YOU CAN GUESS
JUST EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
THAT WAS THE END
THE END OF MY FRIEND
THE END OF MY MAN
AND ALMOST THE END OF ME
OH YES, OH YES, I HAD A MAN
OOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO
THAT IS, YOU SEE, WHAT I MEAN IS
I THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD MAN
I HAD A FRIEND
I SAID, I HAD A FRIEND
UMM-MMM-MMM-MMM-MMM
I TOLD MY FRIEND 'BOUT MY MAN
'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS A GOOD FRIEND
LIFE WAS SWEET
DIDN'T I HAVE MY MAN, MY MAN
WORLD COMPLETE...
THEN THE FIREWORKS BEGAN
AIN'T GOT NO MAN
AIN'T GOT NO FRIEND
I BET YOU CAN GUESS
JUST EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
THAT WAS THE END
THE END OF MY FRIEND
THE END OF MY MAN
AND DARNED NEAR THE END OF ME
