This is my life, and it's my right to live
The way I want to live each day
That's what I want to say
And this is my song
And for too long I sang someone else's melody
It wasn't really me
Somehow I took myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

You were the sun, I was the one who just
Revolved around you day and night
You were my only life, but if I were free
Baby, I'd take control of everything inside of me
Find who I want to be
I'd never take myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes
You might also like
I got to show myself I can still exist without a man
Got to finally take control, got to see myself as whole with you
Though you're not the one to blame, I was lost inside your name
And I'll never be the same 'til I find a way back home again
In someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

Got to find my way back home again
Through someone else's eyes

I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

Ooh, someone, someone else's eyes, no baby, ooh
Someone else's eyes, can't do it, I can't do it
I, I love you, sweet baby, I want to be with you, baby
Through someone else's eyes, ooh
Someone else's eyes, oh baby
Ooh, oh yeah, someone else's eyes
I want to be by your side
