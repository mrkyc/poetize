A pressed shirt, you tuck it in
You tie your tie, tie it again
I put a little curl in my hair
Pink on my cheeks barely there
A proper skirt, hits at the knee
A good sweater in winter green
You shake the keys downstairs
I hit the lights not a minute to spare

Slip a five in the bible for the offering plate
What a beautiful picture we both made

You drive, I look out the window
It's not right, but nobody said so
We walk in and head to the same pew
And hold hands, just like we're supposed to
But last night, you slept on the sofa
And these days I don't even know ya
We fight like hell, but nobody knows
When we're wearing our church clothes

We stand up, we sing a hymn
We say a prayer for other friends
We're turning to the book of John
I'm thinking how I can't go on
You might also like
But we smile and we give it our Sunday best
If we're lost, couldn't tell by the way we dressed

You drive, I look out the window
It's not right, but nobody said so
We walk in, I head to the bedroom
But you don't, you do what you want to
Like last week, when you packed a suitcase
And came close to getting your own place
Oh, that's the stuff that nobody knows
When we're wearing our church clothes

Oh, we don't speak
Don't touch as if nobody's watching us
Lord knows we've got it down
What would they say if we gave up?

You drive, I look out the window
It's not right, but nobody said so
We walk in like we've never been so close
Miles apart, but careful that it don't show
When we're wearing our church clothes
