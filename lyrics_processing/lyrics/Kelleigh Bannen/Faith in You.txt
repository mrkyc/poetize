I got faith in you
I got faith in you
I got faith in you

I've tried drinkin'
The gospel of dark bars after midnight
Mmm, didn't I?
I prayed to the god
Of the jukebox, tryna get lost
But the music stopped
Oh, it always does

Didn't know I needed savin'
'Til you showed up, ain't grace amazing?

I don't know what I believe anymore
Ain't sure what I've been fightin' for
Lotta dreams that don't come true
But baby, I got faith in you
Preach to my soul when you hold me
Reach for my hand, you're my only
Heaven, when there ain't no proof
Baby, I got faith in you
You might also like
(I got faith in you)
Baby, I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)

Yeah, you're my hold steady
When the ground shakes and I'm fallin'
But you won't let me (I got faith in you)
Don't let me, oh
Every dead end I've been down
Turned out to be sacred ground
Feels like we're standin' on it right now

I don't know what I believe anymore
Ain't sure what I've been fightin' for
Lotta dreams that don't come true
But baby, I got faith in you
Preach to my soul when you hold me
Reach for my hand, you're my only
Heaven, when there ain't no proof
Baby, I got faith in you

(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
Baby, I got faith in you
I got faith in you
I got faith in you
I got faith in you
I got faith in you

Didn't know I needed savin'
'Til you showed up, ain't grace amazing?

I don't know what I believe anymore
Ain't sure what I've been fightin' for
Lotta dreams that don't come true
But baby, I got faith in you
Preach to my soul when you hold me
Reach for my hand, you're my only
Heaven, when there ain't no proof
Baby, I got faith in you

(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you, you
(I got faith in you)
Faith in...
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
(I got faith in you)
I got faith in you
Baby, I got faith in you
