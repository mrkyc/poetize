Livin' on suntan (not sure what drink), sippin every drop
Chillin' on ice on a cool summer day
I'm a sundress in a CJ7
Drive top yellow, engine revin'
Down an old beach road that ain't never been paved
Hey, hey. You are what you love
Life's too short not to live it up
Call me red wine, call me late night
Call me kissin' in an old truck don't lie
Hey, hey I'm a good back beat
Boots on the porch with the guitars and me
Can't change, just blame it on me cause
You are what you love-a-ove. You are what you love-a-ove, oh yeah
I'm voxofone (guessed on this word as well), cash cassette
I'm a turned on ten, tape deck
I'm a crack the window, occasional cigarette
I'm a Saturday on a Monday night
Yeah the mornings come in just a little too bright
But I'm a ray bans so everything's alright
Hey, hey. You are what you love
Life's too short not to live it up
Call me red wine, call me late night
Call me kissin' in an old truck don't lie
Hey, hey I'm a good back beat
Boots on the porch with the guitars and me
Can't change, just blame it on me cause
You are what you love-a-ove. You are what you love-a-ove, oh yeah
