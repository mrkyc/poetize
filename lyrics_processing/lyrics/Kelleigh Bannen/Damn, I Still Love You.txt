Hey old friend, how ya been?
Almost didn't recognize ya
Dressed up in that suit and tie, yeah
Guess you're all grown up
Me, I'm still chasing down a dream
Keeps runnin' away from me
Yeah, some things never change, huh?

Damn, I still love you
Even though I don't want to
Wish I could help myself
But I can't
Somethin' you do when you do what you do to me
Is two steps forward and backwards, three again
I could be good and over you and doin' better
But I'll probably never
Not give a...
Damn, I still love you

Heard it from a friend of a friend
That you were movin' back to town
Too small not to see you 'round
Just a matter of Friday nights
So I'll small talk my way through the weather
And whatever steers you clear of
Reading my mind
You might also like
Damn, I still love you
Even though I don't want to
With I could help myself
But I can't
Somethin' you do when you do what you do to me
Is two steps forward and backwards, three again
I could be good and over you and doin' better
But I'll probably never
Not give a...
Damn, I still love you
Damn, I still love you


Damn, I still love you
Even though I don't want to
With I could help myself
But I can't
Somethin' you do when you do what you do to me
Is two steps forward and backwards, three again

If it takes a day for every day we were together
If it takes forever
I don't give a damn
Damn, I still love you
Damn, I still love you
If it takes a day for every day we were together
If it takes forever
I don't give a damn
