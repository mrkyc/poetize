Oh, when the long Cadillacs and people in black have scattered
And I'm way up high in the sky between Aretha and Haggard
If you wanna honor my memory, tip the cover band for me and tell 'em play my favorite songs
Everybody's gonna die, but the music plays on and on, and on

Hey now, save them roses
Got me a garden where I'm going
Way up with the saints and crazies
I can push up my own daisies
You could fill a church, but I'd rather you not
Go find a bar with an old jukebox
And keep the lights blinking on the radio tower
Buy records in lieu of flowers

I got a one-way ticket to the ride to the promised land
And if I'm lucky, John and George'll let me play bass in the band
So don't you spend too much of your money on my headstone
Just buy an old guitar or a brand new pair of headphones

A-come on, hey now, save them roses
Got me a garden where I'm going
Way up with the saints and crazies
I can push up my own daisies
You could fill a church, but I'd rather you not
Go find a bar with an old jukebox
And keep the lights blinking on the radio tower
Buy records in lieu of flowers
You might also like
Buy records in lieu of flowers

Sing a hymn at the Ryman
Keep the neon shinin'
When the good songs end
Rewind 'em, rewind 'em

Hey now, save them roses
Got me a garden where I'm going
Way up with the saints and crazies
I can push up my own daisies
You could fill a church, but I'd rather you not
Go find a bar with an old jukebox
And keep the lights blinking on the radio tower
Buy records in lieu of flowers

Oh, and buy records in lieu of flowers
