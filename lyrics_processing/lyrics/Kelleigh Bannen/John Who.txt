John who
Took me to the Garden to see the Rolling Stones
'Cause he knew my mama loves 'em
And he knows I love my mama
John who
Learned how to dance 'cause he knows I love to dance
Even though he hates to dance and I love that he did that too

Well who would've thought that John who did that
Would do this to me
Who would've thought that
You would up and leave

I need a clean slate from this heartbreak
I need a reason to forget
Get you the hell out of my head
I need a don't look back kiss that stops me in my tracks
Someone that makes me say, anytime I hear your name
John who, John who, John who
John who, John who, John who
John who
I shouldn't think about, but who wouldn't think about
Someone they thought about for so long, every other memory
John who
Are you with right now, are you kissing her now
Is she prettier than me, what do you see in her that you didn't see in me

I need a clean slate from this heartbreak
I need a reason to forget
Get you the hell out of my head
I need a don't look back kiss that stops me in my tracks
Someone that makes me say, anytime I hear your name
John who, John who, John who
John who, John who, John who

I need a clean slate from this heartbreak
I need a reason to forget
Get you the hell out of my head
I need a don't look back kiss that stops me in my tracks
Someone that makes me say, anytime I hear your name
John who, John who, John who
John who, John who, John who

John who, John who, John who
