Did your grandmother send you a card?
With a 20 in it?
Did your boss say 30 is old?
Did your nephew sing on the phone?
You'll either pick up or you won't
Hey, it's me, I know it's kinda late
But I had to call ya
Just to say hello, catch up
You know I was thinking of ya
Another year older
Another year wiser
Bet you're out with the guys
Low key drinking Budweiser
I learned a little too late
You know what they say
I can't have my cake and love you too
Anyway
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Was that a mistake?
One glass of red and I get so carried away
Like last year I threw you a party
And you hate surprises, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

If I said I don't care I'm a liar
I learned a little too late
You know what they say

Just called to say
Happy birthday, mmh
