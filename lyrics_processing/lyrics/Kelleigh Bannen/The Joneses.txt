White picket fence
White Mercedes Benz
Wife knows how to spend that money
Grass is always greener
Kitchen floor is cleaner
And pockets even deeper, ain't it funny

We don't got what they got
They don't got what we got
When it comes to the haves and the have nots
We'd rather not

Keep up with the Joneses, what the hell for
Mind your own business, shut the front door
We ain't rich but we own it
Work all week just to blow on a backyard tab
High class white trash party on the patio
Too busy living in the moment
To keep up with the Joneses

The big house on the block
They keep their door locked
We keep our fridge stocked
With Blue Ribbon and good living

We don't got what they got
They don't got what we got
When it comes to the haves and the have nots
We'd rather not

Keep up with the Joneses, what the hell for
Mind your own business, shut the front door
We ain't rich but we own it
Work all week just to blow on a backyard tab
High class white trash party on the patio
Too busy living in the moment
To keep up with the Joneses
To keep up with the, to keep up with the Joneses

We don't got what they got
They don't got what we got
When it comes to the haves and the have nots
We'd rather not

Keep up with the Joneses, what the hell for
Mind your own business, shut the front door
We ain't rich but we own it
Work all week just to blow on a backyard tab
High class white trash party on the patio
Too busy living in the moment
To keep up with the Joneses
To keep up with the, to keep up with the Joneses
