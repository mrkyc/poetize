I gone be honest tomorrow ain't promised that's why I say this
Here today then you gone like rentin' a car from Avis
Hurts but it's the truth your driving out that Mercedes
That's why I be on point, I'm never procrastinatin'
You better be dodging Satan, the pussy nigga be hatin'
Want his cake and eat it too, you you do greasy like bacon
Everyday money chasin', I'm so in love with the fragrance
So what, I'm a little impatient, you dope man, ain't got no patience
Boy I feel like I'm racin', before I become a raisin
Those strippers hotter then cajen', my daily be in rotation
The daily birthday occasion, I'm rarely off of vacation
I'm barely owing the nation, the nelly dollars are rakin'

I ain't talkin' next year, I ain't talkin' in a month
I ain't talkin' in a week, every day I wanna stunt
Every day, I want sum candles, every day, a hundred bucks
Every day I pull up in lambos, filet meion for lunch
What my birthday, you got my birthday, when my birthday
You better say my birthday, I get emotional
That's what c-notes will do
Them penny loafer shoes help me cop a Bentley coupe
Now my string of women hotter than Campbells soup
Boy, that cake will make them priests turn to animals
I'm King Kong and it's your trainin' day
Denzel with the ice and I'm pushin' weight
I ain't tryna wake 'em all, I ain't tryna down pay
If Biggie got a wife, she ain't with him, not day
Ain't nobody here to stay, you can try to get away
I'mm bounce a nigga pray, my advice still the same, aye

For that work, that man, I will hurt that man, tell 'em
You don't want me to go outside, you make them head swellin'
No-no-no-no, oh no, another birthday up or so
Gotta make a wish, boy, you done blow
Hey, too many people keepin' it G-Code
So, the nigga, he get all about that dough
Yeah, you niggas speakin' to me, I get ghosts
But the suckers, you fuckers, so duckers
We squeezing triggers like mustard all on your dogs
Say sum'n, I'll get you lost, It's repercussion, no talk, boss
