Hey, Ms. Red Carpet
She can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway
I'll be looking at everybody else watching
I don't wanna be obnoxious
But this girl worth the gossip
Take away the smile
The tattoos now, forever she very guardless
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
On and poppin'
She mad marketing
Attitude like we arguing
Return, I'm gonna celebrate, glitter to my life
I should twitter this is girl, she's sparkling

She ain't no Rockstar
But she's got Groupies
She ain't no actress
But she makes movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl, who dat girl, who dat girl?
She ain't got riches
But she's got fashion
She ain't a model
But camera's flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl, who dat girl, who dat girl?

Hey, they wanna know my mam name
'Cause that where she get from
They ain't never shot her with silicone
Shawty is her and her she's the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one
I wish she would'a told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge?
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort'a like a oldie jam
Record some shh on a playboy cam
She ain't no actress
The movie found my mattress
Rockstar, none of that practice
But still she's got fanatics

She ain't no Rockstar
But she's got Groupies
She ain't no actress
But she makes movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl, who dat girl, who dat girl?
She ain't got riches
But she's got fashion
She ain't a model
But camera's flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl, who dat girl, who dat girl?
Oh, whoa, whoa
