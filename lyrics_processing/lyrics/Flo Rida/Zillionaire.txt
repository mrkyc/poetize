I gotta ask where you been hiding
You're like a twenty-karat diamond (Diamond)
The finer things in life were shining
How 'bout that late night wine and dining? (Dining)

You want that expensive clutch
And I'ma give that five-star experience (Yeah)
Show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you give enough

I spend it all on you, baby, baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire (That was perfect)

I'm gonna work it to impress you
Get you that dress and then undress you
Oh, we'll do things only the best do (Best do)
Do what you want because I'll let you (I'll let you, let you)
