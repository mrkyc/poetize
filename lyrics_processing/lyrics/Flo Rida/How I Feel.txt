Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

Yeah, I'm a new man, baby
Your other man probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I've been filling before
3 million feet up in the sky full of diamonds
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling
I'm behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Vices
I don't ever look at the prices
My Super Bowl tickets are priceless
You know who the king of the night is
Beautiful music for you to go lower
You and your girl go work this pole
I think I'm bipolar
See Flo Rida LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like

You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistols
From party, and bigger than life
50 bottles of Luminis
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me
You're fixing, I'm fixin' my collar
My natural height
She can get it, my whole clique is wit it
No question, we all on the champion vibe
This how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London, end up in Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my bride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day approachin'
80 million, they still rollercoasting
Want the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, soaring like vultures
(Oh-eh-oh) Who told y'all the party's over?
(Oh-eh-oh) Well, it ain't over til I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober
But oh, tonight, I'm like...

Birds flying high (Ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
It's a new day
