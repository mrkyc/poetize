My third flo' stuck on the hoodrat shone
Cut, take one, Hollyhood act on
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bought the "Low" ringtone
Plenty ghetto booty, plenty ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories by them hoodrat's beg
