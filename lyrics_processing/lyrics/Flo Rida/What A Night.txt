Oh, what a night

Yeah, oh, what a night
Feel like I'm twenty-two, you know I'm 305
Tatted on my body, I got everybody in a jive

More peace for my medulla, the whole crew up, yeah

Write my name in history

Oh, what a night (Yeah, sing it)
Almost had me down, came back to life (Hell yeah, I'm finna ride)
Who's gonna stop me now?
Oh, what a night (Yeah, sing it)
I can't even lie, what a time to a time to be alive
Drinks in the sky, that's the vibe
