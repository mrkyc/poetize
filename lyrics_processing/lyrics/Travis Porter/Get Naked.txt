Lay your body down, just so I can touch you
I'm hoping that you're ready 'cause I don't wanna rush you
And just to set the mood, I put on a little Usher
And now we're trading places and wrestling undercover
Ten to fifteen, I'm ready to blast off
While we're playing under covers, I'm taking her pants off
Like man, now she want me to be her man
And then I said "nah", then she brought another friend
I told her...

Get naked, take your clothes off
Wipe off your lip gloss, your body's so soft
She naked, I love the way she moving
And we should make a movie, a movie while you standing here
Naked, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
She naked, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Here, girl, come get this dicky
Mmm-mmm, good, she said, "Strap, you finger-licking"
Listen, shorty, can I tell you something?
It's you that I've been wanting
I love your body structure, it got me super sprung
And I bet when you butt-naked, that thing gone go stupid dumb
Where you get that ass from? She said from my momma
Well take off your pajamas, let me watch you cook lasagna
Girl, you know you bad
Flip over your ass, I'll give you something you never had
Let's play Adam and Eve, I'm messing up your weave
Here, have some more drink, sit back and let me roll the weed

Get naked, take your clothes off
Wipe off your lip gloss, your body's so soft
She naked, I love the way she moving
And we should make a movie, a movie while you standing here
Naked, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
She naked, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Take your pants off, take your panties off
Take your socks off, fuck it, take it all off
I hope it ain't a issue
I ain't gone kiss you, but I might lick you
From your neck to your ankles
Girl, I'm nasty, I might spank you
I ain't come here to tease you, girl
I came here to please you, girl
And we touching and we rubbing
And we freaking and we vibing
And she like it, we ain't kissing
We ain't hunching, we fucking

Get naked, take your clothes off
Wipe off your lip gloss, your body's so soft
She naked, I love the way she moving
And we should make a movie, a movie while you standing here
Naked, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
