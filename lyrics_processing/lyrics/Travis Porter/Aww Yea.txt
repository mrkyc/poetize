All white thing with the  to the side
I've been counting money all day all night
Bad bitch with me  stand up
Took her from her nigga, had to get his bands up
Problem me and Quez smoking weed, getting drunk
Took her for a show, couldn't find what I want
Easter clean, D's and jeans
30K in hundreds and it's for the whole team
Packed the whole club, got hoes in the V-I
Shawty want a baller, she know that's what we bout
100 for the belt, 400 for the Pradas
I came in flexing everything that popping bottles
This for the strippers and the girls selling models
Put her through college when I'm playing with them dollars
14 grams, put it on the scale
Grabbing work from the street nigga not from Yale, Yeah

Said the shawty got an ass on her, and it's fat
I'm trying take her home but she rather take care (aight)
Dancing while we're standing on the chair (aight)
You got a bottle, go on and put it in the air (aight)
I got some bands on her, I put some bands on her
I wonder what she'd do if I put my hands on her
Pop a rubber band on her, and did my dance on her
I only throw out the money to make it land on her
Now where the hoes at? Where the blow at?
And where the real thick girls shaking low at?
And where the weed at? And what my G's at?
And where the freaks, but the lady in the streets at?
Now make it clap for me, clap clap for me
Now make it clap for me, clap clap for me
Now make it shake for me, she shake-shake for me
She make it shake for me, shake for me, shake for me
She got an ass on her, and she pretty in the face

Every time we out to eat you know it's shrimp and steak
And she ain't with the game, mama mama don't play
Shawty name Terrica, her friends call her TC
I met her friend named Erica, cause she really dying to meet me
And I live in the area, somewhere off of these streets
She bad to the bone with her hair down the rear-ie
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah
Her booty cause hell, cause hell, cause hell
You fuck with ball players, ball players, ball players
Well, bitch, I ball and yeah, I'm a player
