Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
Know my friends, they killing
All these hoes I'm killing
Nigga came from dope dealing
Dirt bike four wheeling
Come up in the street I'm peeling
Come up in the street I'm peeling

And I might just lose the ceiling
And I'm trying to grind up on a million
I might kill it if I feel it
Hell yeah you damn right I kill it if she give it
Mat go extension, take it and we flip it
Take it and remix it, bring it back
Sixteen curry on them hoes
Bank too big, need pockets like girbaud
Hold up wait, know exactly how it goes, its Gucci
No, bet you can't do it like this
Fully loaded diamonds on both my wrists
Me and Joblow gonna scheme on your bitch
Add it to me nigga get the money out the six
Scream my name
Got a hundred in the six
I ain't no gas, I'm a jug this mid
Pint coming in, I'll lean like this
I ain't hit hard like shawty you lit
Fuck all these rappers
My trap look like cappa
Came in like this turning up on you bastards
After I smash lil nigga can have her
Fuck her from the front then turning her backwards
Ask all those strippers i stay with that cash
I'm in a dipper, I'm moving them bags
Play with that money we put on a man
Know no limit we are busting your ass

Stop flexing bitch you're not really popping
Bitch bout the dough
Ace and spade popping
Rose popping, bitch we popping
You ain't really jocking
Ya'll niggas flexing, ya'll ain't got it
I got two bitches they're getting wild
These bitches want to do doggie style
I got one black and got one CHinese
She be talking to me, say kung pow
I fucked it up, just made a pound
SMoking this shit up I made a cloud
Just fucked it up at the after hours
44 too big it can't wait to growl
Bitch yo ass ugly and yo ass musty
So free bitch, here go a bar of Dial
Stinking ass breath smell like black and mild
I'm fresh as hell bitch wipe me down

All my shit exclusive
She wants me cause I'm cooler
Looking like a goddamn jeweller
Might fly to Bermuda
Thank god a rich nigga, hallelujah
I feel high and I barely even knew her
I fucked her now that bitch luda
Wild in the bed looking like Frank Lucas
Me and my goddamn shooters
Carbon, got a damn cooler
Clip like a goddamn ruler
These bitches faded and be acting funny
All she wants is a bag of money
Get her on molly she acting slutty
Hit from the back and she ain't a buddy

That mean I got something expensive
Know my friends, they killing
