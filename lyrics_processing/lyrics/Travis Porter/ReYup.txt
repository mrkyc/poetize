2-17 on the track, man

Rollin' up gas in the strip club
Know I got the bag from a thick girl
Where the trap niggas at? Just re'd up
Got the bloods in the back throwin' B's up
We gon' fuck up the commas
We got them M's like McDonald's
We just a young stunna
Fort Lee doin' numbers, ayy

Dodgin' hoes like a prenup
Skeet all on her, make her clean up
Spend ten K then re-up
Got a whole lotta money, nigga, we up
Nine times outta ten I'm leaned up
Nine times outta ten she geeked up
She ain't got no ass but she a D cup
She got double shot of Henny in a tea cup

In the back of the club rollin' weed up
Got Spodee with me throwin' C's up
I done lost all my hoes, I done re'd up
I done lost all my hoes, I done re'd up
Out the STK we feed her
We the three live crew, bitch, three up
Hit your girl every time that we meet up
Head real good but the pussy beat up, damn

Diamond hangin' on my neck
Rollie chillin' on my arm
Ice cubes in my ear
Ice cubes in my trunk
Ho, I look like a Egyptian
Pure gold on my ring
VVS under my pendant
I got this shit from the king, uh

Hey ladies, hey ladies
Your pussy ride like a Mercedes
I need a old bitch born in the 80's
I need one that ain't got no babies
Hey fellas, hey fellas
Your bitch always gettin' jealous
'Cause you hangin' in the club with ya fellas
Bitch starstruck soon as she met us, oh

Dodgin' hoes like a prenup
Skeet all on her, make her clean up
Spend ten K then re-up
Got a whole lotta money, nigga, we up
Nine times outta ten I'm leaned up
Nine times outta ten she geeked up
She ain't got no ass but she a D cup
She got double shot of Henny in a tea cup
Diamond hangin' on my neck (Oh)
Ice cubes in my ear (Oh)
Diamond hangin' on my neck (Oh)
Ice cubes in my ear (Oh)
(Oh)
Diamond hangin' on my neck
