(Cause I'm a heartbreaker)
(Verse 1: Strap)
I just wanna fuck a couple times but she want more than that
She wanna be a couple, all exclusive, I'm ignoring that
I'm on my explorin' shit
She see me on the Internet
Plus on TV, all of this she says she gets no benefits
Calling me like back to back
Baby girl, what's up with that?
Got damn you fine
Before I signed
You wasn't even tryna give me that cat
Now shit done changed, you feeling Strap
Hold up boo, I'm not no
Cheese if you want to, but this dick is not yours
Tryna cuff me up, tryna cake up
Got my sheets fucked up from her make-up
It's cool, but baby I don't need all that
Relax, it ain't gotta be all that
What we do behind closed doors, keep it like that
She text me I miss you but I ain't write back
(Chorus)
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
You text me, I don't text you back
You like boo what's up with that?
You miss me, I don't miss you back
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
This here is a one night thang
And I looking for no rings
And I don't play no games, but
I don't mean to break your heart, heart, heart
Don't mean to break your heart, baby
But I'm a heartbreaker
This here is a one night thang
And I ain't looking for no rings
And I don't mean to play no games, but

I'm in the club like Saturday
Girl what yo name is?
Ooh, you looking good, girl is you famous?
Well, I'm Quezyo the heartbreaker
All my pillows white so take off your make-up
I'mma lay it down so I hope you do your part
Please don't put your love in my hand I might drop your heart
But when all the feelings surface
You see it wasn't working
In fact, baby girl I dropped your heart on purpose
(Chorus)
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
You text me, I don't text you back
You like boo what's up with that?
You miss me, I don't miss you back
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
This here is a one night thang
And I looking for no rings
And I don't play no games, but
I don't mean to break your heart, heart, heart
Don't mean to break your heart, baby

This here is a one night thang
And I ain't looking for no rings
And I don't mean to play no games, but
(Verse 3: Ali)
I love ya girl, but I ain't your lover
We fucking girl, but we gotta use a rubber
Can't spend the night, cuz I ain't tryna cuddle
And she can't find another nigga like me
So she sprung, sprung, sprung yeah
Can't leave me alone yeah
It's like I shot her down, right in the heart
I broke her and split her feelings apart
(Chorus)
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
You text me, I don't text you back
You like boo what's up with that?
You miss me, I don't miss you back
Cuz I'm a heartbreaker
This here is a one night thang
And I looking for no rings
And I don't play no games, but
I don't mean to break your heart, heart, heart
Don't mean to break your heart, baby
But I'm a heartbreaker
This here is a one night thang
And I ain't looking for no rings
