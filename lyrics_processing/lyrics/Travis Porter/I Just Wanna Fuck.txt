I make her call me daddy when I'm smacking on her hiney
Screaming, yelling, whining, why you acting like you dying?
Then she started crying, all we do is fuck
Why you always fussing? Oh my God, girl, shut up
Wow, wow, neighbors saying turn it down, don
Fuck them people, this my house
Now I got her turning out, bend you over, turn around
The rubber pop, I'm pulling out 'cause shorty who I'm talking 'bout
Tracy fuck with Stacey and Stacey fuck with that white girl
And I picked shorty up and she was with two white girls
They like the Spice Girls, all kind of races
And every time I fuck them, they make all kinds of faces

I just wanna fuck
Tell me what you think 'bout that
I just wanna fuck
Ain't no need for you to be mad (all I wanna do is)

Fuck, fuck, fuck, let's fuck (all I wanna do is)
Fuck, fuck, fuck, let's fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck, let's fuck (tell me what you think 'bout that)

I ain't trying to be your man
And I ain't trying to be your friend
And I ain't trying to be your buddy
So why don't you just come over and fuck me?
She got mad when I said that
You gonna be angry when I tell you where to put your head at
Walked into her room like, "Shorty, where your bed at?"
She got in this crazy position, I'm like, "Where your legs?
I don't know you girl
But we can get nasty
I just wanna show you, girl
So come on, sit next to me

I just wanna fuck
Tell me what you think 'bout that

Fuck, fuck, fuck, let's fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck, let's fuck (tell me what you think 'bout that)

I just wanna fuck, she never tell me no
She only got three friends, she never tell me four
I always beat her fast, she never tell me slow
And always in the bed and we're never on the floor
When I knew from the club, just by looking at you dance
Tonight, you with Travis Porter, I'm gonna be your fan
Now you spinning 'round and 'round on the ceiling like the fan
I know we fucking, baby girl, but I can't be your man
So I hope you wasn't thinking that (tell me what you think 'bout that)
Girl, go put on your thinking hat
I just had a vision of me beating that (ain't no need for you to be mad)
Me fucking you, girl, tell me what you think of that
Damn
All I wanna do is...
All I wanna do is...
All I wanna do is...
Oh, oh, go
Oh, all I wanna do is...
Oh, oh
Girl, tell me what you think 'bout that
