DJ turn me up, crank that to the max
I got lots of guala, I be blowing stacks
Polo on my hat, shoes and shirt ta match
I be so turned up, I be swagging to the max
If you gettin in, then you gettin dough
Gone pop a bottle, this right here your song
Purple by the zone you can smell it on my clothes
And a band up in my swisher, bout to take one to the dome
I'm gone, in another zone
I be ridin on them inches with the woofer goin strong
They like what is goin on, I don't really know
Then I roll down all my windows and I crank that shit sum more then we...
