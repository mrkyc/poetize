I was walking through the crowd and I seen her with her team
I tapped her on her shoulder and said, "Girl, I like them jeans"
I told her, "Go shorty, shorty, go shorty, shorty, go
Go shorty, shorty, go shorty, shorty, go"
She was dancing like a stripper, so I had to throw some ones
She winked her eye at me and said, "It's time to have some fun"
I told her, "Go shorty, shorty, go shorty, shorty, go
Go shorty, shorty, go shorty, shorty, go"

Hopped off the stage, walked through the crowd
Drunker than a white boy, blowing on that loud
Shawty said something, but the music was too loud
I told her, "Come here, girl, get out this crowd"
And uhh, "Bring your team, come fuck with my team
Tell the waitress four bottles of Goose and 30 wings"
And now she all up on me, whispering these dirty things
Want me to make her sing just like the birdy sings
Lip ring, tongue ring, girl, you a freak
Winked her eye at me and said, "Bring Quez and Li"
Okay cool, shawty, we gon' party 'round three
And now I got her whole team screaming, "Travvy!"

I told her that I want her, then I asked her, "Can I have her?"
Booty looking big, I hope you don't mind if I grab you
'Cause I came just to have fun and, uh
I take her home and I smash something, then I'm done with her
'Cause this happens every night
Ooooh yeah, yeah

I was walking 'round the club 'cause I ain't have nothing to do
I tapped her on the shoulder and said, "Girl, I like them Trues"
She was dancing like she worked at Magic City
Said her name was Tasha and her homegirl's name was Brittany
Man, started calling, so you know we got 40's
So I told her go, man, that was for encouragement
I told her, "Go, go!"
