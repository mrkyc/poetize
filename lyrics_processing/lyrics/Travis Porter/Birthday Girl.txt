Birthday girl, birthday girl, let me see your hands
Put it on, put it on, put it on my tab

Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gon' do it all
Cause baby, you're the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gon' have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

Lil mama, it's ya B-day
And I ain't wit dat drama, lil mama, fuck what she say
I'ma make it rain cats and dogs, ain't no cliche
She say she from LA but landed in the Peach State
Now that's GA
See lil mama this yo song
She got on a thong
Sippin' on patron
Wonderin' when we goin' home
She just turned 21, 21
Girl we about to have some fun, have some fun
We need, 2 shot of that Patron
We need, 2 shots of that Grey Goose
We need, 2 shots of that get right
We need, and 2 shots of that get loose
Then we hit the dance floor
I said you gotta work that girl
Then the DJ gave a shootout to the birthday girl
You might also like
Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gon' do it all
Cause baby, you're the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gon' have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

It's ya birthday, know you want a shot
Take it back to '04?
Drop it like it's hot
Girl you know where I'm goin'
Meet me at the spot
Still drinkin' Ciroc
It's damn near 4 o'clock
But like Gucci Said
She's only 21
So I only feed her crumbs
But I fuck her till she cums
I love the way you dancin' when you playin' wit' ya tongue
I'm not really romantic but you might just be the one
Whatchu wish for
I'ma give you what you need
Hit you from the back
Pullin' on ya weave
And we do it this away
And do it that away
As long as you blow the candles out because it's ya birthday, birthday
Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gon' do it all
Cause baby, you're the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gon' have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

Okay, you just turned 21
Let's go live it up
Let's go hit the club
Let's go have some fun
We can hit up Magic
We can throw some 1's
You invite ya friends
It's whatever she wants
How bout we go to Vegas?
We gon' have a ball
We gon' get it poppin' tomorrow, forget it all
And we gon' do some gamblin'
We gon' do some fuckin'
I don't usually do this, so you should feel lucky
So quit all that frontin'
Sayin' you won't do nothin'
Cause I know you ready, just waitin' to push ya button
So now she suckin', fuckin', trippin', wasted
Fell asleep at 6 and woke up in different locations
Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gon' do it all
Cause baby, you're the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gon' have a ball
