Shake it like you tryna get paid
Make that ass clap
Work it like you tryna get a raise
Make that ass clap

Make that ass clap
We don't stand around we make it rain
Make that ass clap

Make that ass clap
Baby you the baddest of them all
Make that ass clap
Somebody give her a round of applause

I did it so I do it
I bring it in the club so you know I threw it
She said her name was Keisha
It's very nice to meet ya
I told her turn around and that booty had a seizure
I only carry cash, I do not carry a VISA
And she dropped it low, like the bass up in my speakers
Then she got up on the pole with this girl, her name Christina
Her friend said it's time to go, I said "Baby girl, just leave her
Just leave her" (Bye, Bye)
