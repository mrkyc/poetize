Well it's a goddamn shame what's going down
How we got to this I do not know
There's a sick, sick wind that is blowin' 'round
And the captain's got to go
About you or me, he does not give a damn
What a low-down, dirty snake
With his mind on his money and his money on his mind
Well something's got to break

Like when the hounds start howling (when the hounds start howling)
And when there's fiends about (when there's fiends about)
I will stand up and shout
"I declare mutiny on this ship"

Well the captain's been drinking below the deck
And this vessel's headed way off course
I want to wrap my hands around his crooked neck
And throw him overboard
Send him to his Lord
Send him to his Lord

No, I just want to be free
And take back what these old Devils have taken from me
No, I don't want to be saved
Oh I just want to be free
And take back what these old devils have taken from me

Like when the hounds start howling (when the hounds start howling)
And when there's fiends about (when there's fiends about)
I will stand up and shout
"I declare mutiny on this ship"
I said, "I declare mutiny on this ship"

Well the captain's been drinking below the deck
And this vessel's headed way off course

I want to send him to back to where he came
Not to mercy, no, but to burn in flames
I said, he don't need no water (he don't need no water)
Well let the motherfucker burn (let the motherfucker burn)
I said, he don't need no water (he don't need no water)
Well let the motherfucker burn (let the motherfucker burn)
Well, burn motherfucker, burn
