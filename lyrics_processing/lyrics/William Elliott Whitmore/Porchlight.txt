Is the farm on which I stand
Every single seed that's been sown
Was put in the ground by my hand
Sometimes the sun goes down a little too soon
Before the day's work is through
I keep on going by the light of the moon
When I'd rather be home with you
Would you keep the porchlight on for me?
I come home from the field when it's too dark to see
I can barely stand up
But there's more to be done
The bottom field needs to be plowed
I've never asked help from anyone
But Lord I could use some now
Give me the strength to make it back home
I can't work no more
Lord let her be the first thing I see
When I crawl through that front door
Would you leave the porchlight on for me?
To light my way back from the night so black
I'm sick as a dog and no one can help
The pain's more than I can bear
Still my thoughts drift to the one sweet gift
The love that we share
I hate for you to see me like this
Remember when I was strong?
If i didn't have these I.V.'s in my wrists
I'd hold you in my arms

This hospital bed is where I've got to be
They say that I ain't got long for this life
They say that it's my time to go
Darlin' you've been the most wonderful wife
That any man has known
You've stuck by me through thick and through thin
Since the day you became my bride
Someday i hope to see you again
When we meet on the other side
Would you leave the porchlight on for me?
Even though just a memory is all that I'll be
