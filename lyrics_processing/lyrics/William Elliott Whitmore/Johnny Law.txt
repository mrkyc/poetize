When Johnny Law pulled up from behind
He walked up to my window and said, roll it down
And let me see what I can find
I said, no way, what's mine is mine
And I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me be
He said, I'll leave you be alright, in a cell all night
I'll lock you up and throw away the key
He slapped them cuffs on my wrist
And my hands clenched into fists
And I wished I could have punched him in the jaw
And knock out old Johnny Law
Old Johnny Law
Johnny Law
He's the littlest man I ever saw
With his badge and his gun
He'll just hassle everyone
He'll get you on the run
Johnny Law
He took me down to the state house
And he hurled that book at me
And being in a cell is like being in hell
For a man who longs to be free

Just what gave this man the right
To leave me to rot
Here on this rickety cot
Just a staring at the celling all night
And I couldn't help but think
Of the words of my dear departed pa
He said, do the best you can
Be a good man
But don't you never trust Johnny Law
Old Johnny Law
Johnny Law
He's the littlest man I ever saw
With his badge and his gun
He'll just hassle everyone
He'll get you on the run
Johnny Law
Without any proof they couldn't keep me there
So they let me out in the morning
And that cop said, son, I don't know what you done
But just consider this a little warning
I said, it must take a lot of nerve to protect and to serve
But I wonder what it would be like
If you didn't have that badge or that gun or that uniform
To hide behind
And although I feel
That this whole deal, I got, was pretty damn wrong
My conscience is clean
Cause I'm a human being
And you're just Johnny Law
Old Johnny Law
Johnny Law
Well, you're the littlest man I ever saw
With your badge and your gun
You just hassle everyone
You'll get ya on the run Johnny Law
With his badge and his gun
He'll just hassle everyone
You'll never get me on the run
