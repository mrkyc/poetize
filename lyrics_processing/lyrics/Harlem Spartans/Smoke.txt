On the K with my blade
Man down if a nigga owe me
K Town that's 11th put smoke on the road for a neek
Long trips been treking on the road for the dough and the p's
She knows by 11th put smoke on the road for a neek
Put smoke on the road for a neek
Put smoke on the road for a neek
On the K with my blade
Man down if a nigga owe me
K Town that's 11th smoke on the road for a neek
Long trips been treking on the road for the dough and the p's

Long trips off ends got p's so I might just cab it
Big bruck and it's local any beef them man'a just bang it
Got heat like man'a just time it
Crack rocks got the kittys on balance
Any beef on the K, mans backing
Don't brag about p's that's lacking
Short bitch uck me she's standing
Dick long got the bitch just gagging
Six long Imma hit no lacking
Hood on gloves man dashing
Free Haze had nigga's on ropes
With D in the cut with the pole
See bands stick sav they know
G'd up, duck him down with the rambo
Clipper dan dot dot in the bag bro
Amm buds got the room all smokey
Four talls got a nigga all dopey
Pack loud got the call from Tony
Got B that's buggy like OG
Took his rocks on the spot like he owes me
2 bills don't act like you know p's
Get him down for the bro and the brodie

Telling me this, opp boy stop all the chat
 him with post like pat
Looking for the O's like rats
Like looking for the O's like cats
I don't even know what happened
Tell a boy straight no lacking
Tell a boy straight no lacking
Never seen a mash what you rapping, never see your friend wan back it
HS put it in your name wan brag it
Amm to the face, bet she ain't having
Niggas in the clap wan clap it
And I need bands right now pull up in the cab right now
Boy just freeze like lagging
Peng ting good wan grab it
Trap like booth them trapping
Telling me Harlem streets
Tell em what laugh at neeks
 then I skip them beats
More time I skeem on neeks
Old school 3 on 3, now cats wanna 3 on 3
Nigga it's mad
See TG mad
See the gyal dem are bad, now the girl want wood
Now your girl want Blancs
Your girl want Blancs
Your girl want Blancs
Your girl want (bow)
