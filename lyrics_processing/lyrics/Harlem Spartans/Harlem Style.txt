I'm a violent guy, I do violent things
HS gang wanna ride on me see an opp put my knife in him
Bare talk on the net, big 45 man'a fry man's wig
Bare take on the net and that da opps them wet, them write to the pigs
Stuff two in the dots, itching to squeeze the bruckback looking like D
Long like Bellz, I ring Bellz make the opps see hell like please
Fuck all the chat we can do it main road man'a do it on streets
Like fuck all the chat, might pull up on the Brix like who's in McDees (whose in it?)
Na na na na just wait na na na na wait just pause
Man finna ride with my shank or man finna bang on da 4s
Look hookahs on me like they all want a piece of Tee'g like woah
Hookahs on gang look HS gang man set it for the roads (man set it)
I wrap food in cling, I put work on streets

Summertime mandem, gyaldem bake in the harlem district
Ride round with my kitchen if I see them I back my ting instant
Harlem stepped in public, peng peng can't keep her distance
In jail realistic no kitchen man pull up my pants and fist him
With Latz and Naghz what you know about biscuits step to my block that's fiction
Step with bro that's assistance search and destroy on the victim
I get in position, they run like bitches see bare bums and knickers (uhhh)
Stupid victim changing the story like chinese whispers (stupid boys)
Harlem villains jump out gang everyone for themselves like chickens
I was with bro one day next day, he's locked up in the prison
I got light plus dark and the cats got gold like egyptians
He said I'm an opp, I backed out my nank why's my man twitching (why's man dancing?)
Stupid infants, you're not my level you niggas are different (you niggas are bitches)
Got bro on the phone from a distance judge needs one in her system
