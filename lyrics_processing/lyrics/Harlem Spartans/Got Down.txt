Free the O
Gang shit
Trust me, you know what it is
Ay, are you listening? Free all the mandem and fuck all the opps
Gang

What's all the talk on my name?
They know about me, I'll do it bait
Like a fat boy, I'm in love with my cake
We got no manners, shed blood on our blade
We got down Splash, we got CSav
We got down Skully and we got CS
We got down a yute in Wooly from Pecks'
But that was shit, got it in his hand
We bully our opps, does it not show?
We got down CT
We got down Jules, we got down Dkizz
There's plenty more, but I'm talking flizz
But ask all my opps if I'm telling fibs
They come to the block and they're running like kids
When we step to their block, they instantly sprint
Couple man on the glide, so I don't toke no spliffs
Old news, Abdi's still in my Riz'
Smokey if you're from 'Narm or Brix'
Shit, the ramzy wasn't local so luckily he felt the kitch, litch
They only chill on their block, 'cah they feel protected by pigs, litch
They only chill on their block, 'cah they feel protected by pigs

Ching up a yute if he's claiming Brix'
Same way I done it on shh from the 2's
Ching up a yute if he's claiming Brix'
Same way I done it on shh from the 2's (Ask Skully)

It's a shame that they dropped their roses
Don't get blammed in your leg like Rose did
The way they talk is atrocious, 'til I back out my cheffers and soak him
It's either cookie or flavours that I'm smoking
But it's Thumpz in my spliff I'm toking (He's dead)
And I swing my shank, no joke ting, joke ting, tryna leave my man open
I'm tryna make me a K in the bando before I double L these twats
They probably think my name is SpillJuice the way I swing my shank with my hand
He coulda got one in his headie, but since that day he ain't never been back
I hear everyone screaming out "Gang", but where was your gang when you turned pack?
H1, I'm a well known striker
Dodson Street, yeah, I taped that off

Juice got spilled from his punctured lung
On who, have you lost the plot?
Can't violate bros, I'll leave man rubbed
How you 'garn beef if you ain't got funds?
Welcome to the Kennington slums (O)
Money and drugs
We splash them when they see us and run
Same way we run from unmarked feds (I leg it)
A-Team step
Way before we done it Brixton, we already done it and Cambs' and Pecks'
I remember that day in Fields, RD chopped up Dkizz with the 'chetes
Don't think you can step on my turf, I was 16 when I taped off ends
I chinged CT in his back, then I cut from the scene with my shank all ketched
Same road Tyrese got splashed on is the same road where I whacked CF
They thought they could violate me, so on the same way I put Turner on the bench
Don't think you can beef my block, we put 'nuff man on the hospital bed
I should've got down DRose, but I couldn't keep up so you know I was vexed (I was pissed)
We have Cambs' on lock
And we taped off Fields
