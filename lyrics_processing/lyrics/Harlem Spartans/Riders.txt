Shh, shh, ayy
(Clicker on the beat)
Real rider
(Shell Kartel)
Talk is cheap, grab a splash and it's finished

Real-real rider, certified rider, ridin'
You just watch when we do him, we step and you just witness
Talk on things and you witness (Shh, shh)
Talk is cheap, grab a splash and it's finished (Ayy)
Yardman step, kweff fam, hit your block and evict it

For the love of the dough I'm dishin'
See the plain clothes on the back road, not gonna lie I'm missin'
In school its dot to dot, now the Dot-Dot's live it's kickin'
Free bro and bro, you're way too fidgety
See red when I see dat green, would've thought it was Italy
Shakes on the Spear like William they like how I use dem Similes
Wipe off all that makeup, a-a-ain't no way they're trickin' me
See that gang hit a milli, now all of a sudden she's feelin' me
Ayy, lemme switch it
Back show to the backbone, I kill it, I kill it, I kill it
Three like Bruce, no Willis, ten man, Two coupes, no kiddin'
Us man fishin' and them man fishes
Losk got lose and they swimmin'
Smoke to the rave gotta bring it, bro's in the can, gotta visit
Phone ring' gotta buss them tickets
Nothin' but winnin' in my vision, this is real life shit no gimmicks
Face got shave no Gillette, I listen to some of the realist
She wanna be bae, I'm like is, it is it?, Ayy, you're feelin' different
You might also like

Talk is cheap, grab a splash and it's finished (Ayy)
Yardman step, kweff fam, hit your block and evict it

Riders, these dumb little punks keep drawin' man out
So, we're out on alert, two drivers
It's eight tugs, six man ready to jump out
When you hear the six doors pop, best run out
It can be hot when the sun out, water-water, ching splash, gone
My nigga's in fields, cuttin' down things, gardens
Believe in your G's, get martyred, die by the sword, King Arthur
What's with the .44 starters? You can get gwopped
Linkin' bae or Spartans, they ain't no bells carves in their hoodie
Ri-ride with my heart in fully, slide over there, we bullies
Turn up like "Bis what's goody?", Four door, 'ped or a pushy
3TG he was boppin' on the fours with a fours tryna' find this rookie
Steppin' with some hothead young G's
Splash man, head up to country, chest shot, make a man funky (Ayy)
Chest shot, make a man funky
Chest shot, make a man funky (Splash)

Real-real rider, certified rider, ridin'
You just watch when we do him, we step and you just witness
Talk on things and you witness (Shh, shh)
Talk is cheap, grab a splash and it's finished (Ayy)
Yardman step, kweff fam, hit your block and evict it
Real-real rider, certified rider, ain't got four man just got a fiver
And some weapons, HS gang ride out kwoof kweffin'
Hop off and hop on the ped with tekkerz
You put heart in numbers, not in the blade or skeng
Us man run with blade and skeng
Run off I dare you leave for bro the spartan men
Kuku niggas, SA drill splash live on niggas
Drippy, rippy, rippy
This nigga must be frozen oso cold and bold
War is war, trap don't stop, why would the might trap stop?
Ridin', ridin' non-stop, bro can't even see he's hot
Bro can't you see you're hot? Banned from all them blocks
Not Kennington blocks, them mans blocks
And I back mine quicker, back my jigga
Trap phone calm but I need cash thicker
Finesse rich man that's a licker
Got a gold one I'm diggin', them man timid like Krillin
Astra love ping
Stack to the ceilin' by the time they free T Millian
They talk 'bout I need some weight
Whilst you was workin' on that body
I was on the phone man I need some weight
You was runnin' 'round for a gyal, you dream for a gyal like Nicki
My dream more cash than Ricky, but tugs in the wrap is sticky
Real-real rider, certified rider, ridin'
You just watch when we do him, we step and you just witness
Talk on things and you witness (Shh, shh)
Talk is cheap, grab a splash and it's finished (Ayy)
