21st Century Spartans, spinners from 1912
Suspect blacked out, late teens, darker than 
Free bro, could've had him in cooks, didn't have him in Felts
MizMac didn't need no help, did it himself
10kg, man press it
That's a mash not weight I'm pressing
When you went jail, never had your bredrin
Now little man's doing shows like Jetix
Fire on you, on you, man press it
The jakes they taught me a lesson
Thought of that bird, that shit was depression
Then I went court, got caught, possession
Buss intent
Beef got squashed so them man get drenched
Clap man with my ratchet, get renched
Skyfall, Mr M, Judi Dench
See the verbal, the fakes I detect (chattings)
Shotty in the ride, Bis clenched
20kg my brodie can't bench
Mad
I'm not a bone, I won't fetch
Fuck jakes, they want apprehend
They lower raided in feds
Madman now you're talking some sense
Glasses, Superman or Clark Kent?
TSG vans, I hate it when they step
I hate it when they crep
I hate it when they sweat
Spartans, be the cause and effect
The violence infect
Wreak havoc on them

Spartan baby mish mash
Steady running through cash
Dons talking like gyally
We dont talk we just splash
Harlem-Harlem O11, South East of that dungeon
Whole heart on my weapon
1 love to my bros
2 taps and you're ghost
Free up all of my folks
410 wheres that dotty?
5 gyal in this lobby
5, 5 brown and peng hope there's gold ones in this rave
Course its Kennington that they play
Ride out, riding out the next day
Free up all of my goons Spartan Ku who is you?
They snitch on us before we get them
Watch your back do not let them
I think Kenningtons hotter than Wesson
Biscy back of the net like Beckham
K on the K, man rise in a second
Harlem repercussion come instant come on
I travel to just dashing blitz spriting
I feel like crows but the package is different
Mish mash trap mash its a living
They lovin' the Harlem village
JoSavy and O they feelin'
You are now listening to some of the orbits realist
Deader than Blancs, what you mean let me bill it?
Who do I look like? Phillip
If SA back that thing, might even call him Willis (Bruce)
How they gonna chat 'bout drillings?
They should just chat 'bout women
Caramel peng got me up in my feelings
I'm trying to get my stack to the ceiling
Money

Harlem O, Spartan gang
Violate bro and you violate man
Locate that sonar, change that swag
Tracky, bally, hoody in black
Rusty Glock
Violent dogs
Serious dons
Invading flats
Chasing cats
Making bands
Fuck them feds
They soon get slapped
Kennington still mash work on the map
Facts, running man down with MACS
Diligent like Militants in caps
Kennington no medicine we mad
Generous, you're irrelevant just dash
Skeet skeet skeet
I'm flipping the figures, you're chilling with dingers
Go halves on dinners and talk about man
We the niggas that live it
You the niggas that rap
Them niggas still fibbing
Same niggas still ran
Get the spinners in dingers so chingers go ham
On missions we vicious no kiddin' attack
Demonically gassed and constantly mad
Harlem your darling wanna be gang
Wait your boyfriend wanna be man?
Trust me comfy in my jones, I'm Jack
