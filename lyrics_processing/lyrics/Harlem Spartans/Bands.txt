Mash if we talking about bands, see a stack like fans
Fam they're coming in mad
Wass, they be chatting that wass they be doing gaga till we backing that splash
Mad when I'm chilling with Naghz and Lats they be known to be itching out backs
They slide we ride and camp
They snap we creep on man

Mash if we talking about bands, see a stack like fans
Fam they're coming in mad
Them man don't clean, they muster the lies, that I hear on the net
Its foul
They slide, we ride and camp
They snap, we creep on man
Badman we out for necks, no bargain deal, man they taking peds

Darling, want a brown skin, sparta smoke green like the gardens
KK where my heart is
K where it started
Sometimes I forget I'm an artist
So enraged, put my blade where your heart is
Frozone so cold like the arctic
Free the Ku 'til the Ku start marching
Bait ting hop off the ped start clarting
Long time Spartans could've charted
Like why you gotta lie like that, ahk lying in the booth is retarded
That opps got got two different times, that player needs selling in a market
Pull up like boo don't piss yourself
Time to put your wishes down the wishing well
He dashed off, nearly tripped and fell
Maysk never looked back, flippin hell

No sense, spartans out for necks
Buck TG head chest chest wet
No meds, Sav move mad, see red
Miz with Blancs in Thames
Free my friends, no song gonna free my friends
Passion for rap gone dead, but the rap gonna feed my brothers
Real real niggas
I do it for Milly and Savage
JoJo and that
Blancs needs a MOBO and that
Still trap jump, all pogo and that
I love to say Mizzy and Lats, the cray cray twins
Who fair who?
These waps blazing skin, MizMac the loose loose twin
Spartans we moving sick
Spartans the move you prick

I think the feds wanna know and the cats wanna know
The feds gotta go, still do trap ten ten get sowed
Still come back now the stack looks fat
Blancs and Miz soon home in a bit
Free the rest of the camp, no my camp dont sing
Need no feds, come dash that quick
15 on the strip, now they're gone in a bling

Them man they run, I click
These weapons sit
JoJo blazing at hats, don't blink
Think think
Max insane, see me with bae, I'm wayne
See me with gang, my fam in the Arkham City
Where Mad Max loves his blicky
You can't hold one from the flicky
