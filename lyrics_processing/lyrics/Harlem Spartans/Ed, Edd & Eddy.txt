Get round dere with waps
Still deep in stuck in the trap
Spartan splash we take no chat
Stab out your chest and back
She brown and cute and she does give hat
Fuck out the face then dash
Reload and slap that mash
32 bells in the dirty strap
We ride and get man 'napped
Free MizMac love creeping flats
S.A loves to splash
SD too thats nothing but facts
We nothing but Spartans akh
Longest swords and the biggest waps
10 toes in Brixton flats
I swear that's bout where your half got splashed
Mikez and Dondon love to trap
They do pedal bike and sweep up cats
No talking, rise that mash
Cock it back and let it slap
Bro bro wet a opp in his hat
Yuck yuck how bout that
I can show these yutes about trap
Hold this G pack don't come back
And I gotta face 6 in the trap
I do 35s don't tell your friends that
I love to run down opps but it gets me mad when I shout to stop (ay stop)
Hand tings not shit one pops
Fuck the feds they took two mops (fuck the feds)
Free all my friends in the box
Ride and tarnish get man chopped

2 Spartans turn up and shit gets nasty
Me and Mad Max love K'ing through your army
2 smokes in the ride
Comfy in the glide
Anyone slip get clarted
Me and Dondon in the trap
100 wraps intent to supply is the target
Soon as I bruck that pack 1 text to the cats
Things get sold like markets
Step with Jazz and Splash
I got my splash
They're both itching to bark it
Bro said he just saw jakes turn 'to a chase
We got a dots and we need to park it
We pressure opps on a regular bas'
And us man still get tarnished
Oh well the scoreboard does not lie
And I know they regret what they started
Zone 2, Town and Fields, opp block tour
125 I'm skidding
We still cattin' for blood to pour even though we done 'nuff drilling
Free MizMac that's samurai Jack
When he's home back to the drilling
TG Milly loved chasing a milly
But bro bro loved doing chingings
Stepped out twice that day, cah bro's too cray
He really wants to get man down
Anytime man get we bored on the ends, man take a trip round Town
Peng tings loving the way I'm affectionate and I love them cute and brown
Any opps dare try come into the ends
Same hour mans getting back round (same hour)
I remember doing up 22 times while you was at home just chillin' with bae
Reminiscing down that I pussio to sleep so I try vacate and go kway off the map
This ain't the life for you mate
You're just out here dreaming for the fame
Trust me, fuck all the fame
Put the gloves on and go spray
The twin shots should be ok
Me and LM  no way
And tell my young bloods don't move sane
Cause 1 strike that can take you away
Assisting them goals like Jesus
On my right hand nigga like Sane
Trust me I miss my nigga like Splash
He really got bagged with a wap
Next year still back to the trap
Still slanging on my strip like Max
I feel sorry for my guy LM
Cah the ting really did jam
On my ones still letting off cartridge
2 smokes in the ride that's arson
