Yo, Smarkz, say nuttin? That's beef den
And until my knife bend, I ain't leaving

Bae, bae love cuss, I ain't cheating
Say your 4 door coming, I ain't seen no car
Eh, drench man down doing 10 shank wounds

Harlem or KuKu, gyaldem glance
Still, still keep a pole in the dance
Pengers in Moncler lookin' like France
Pedal too hot, I'm in  with the dargs
Trappin' in my blood, I can tell you 'bout graph
Peds or mouth, but I gotta take the chance

How can a gyal be dead and screw man?
Trap boy, peng gyal wanna do man

Poled up your friends, I ain't seen karma
Them man there ain't loyal
Me and my gang, stay 1 hunna
On brikky road wit' da scrams
Beat on the opps, the opps dem run arff

Skid round the K, got ducked down

Been there, you're cuttin'out

Fuck the buns but I'll ching man down
Only God knows how I'm feeling now

Fuck around wit' dem fuck arounds
