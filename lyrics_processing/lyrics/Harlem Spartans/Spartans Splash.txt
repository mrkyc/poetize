Don't run, don't run
Stepped in a 4 door
Don't run, don't run
SA
Don't run, don't run
Don't run, don't run
Stepped in a 4 door
Don't run, don't run
SA
Don't run, don't run

Violence is gang
4 door whip or ding dong Ku
I've seen a hella man dash
I'm with three or MizOrMac
Bellz in the Glock no blancs
Turn up man got capped
Look young boy don't get gassed look don't get gassed just stay on your music
Cuh that talking is useless
Tell these little niggas think again
I got brand new 4s and I'm ready to use it
Before I pick man down no tooth pick
I woosh man down no broom stick
TG got touched that's rumours
I ran man down with shooters, I ran man down with lugers
Spartans no manners mans rude
Stepped in the field and I KuKu bop with Harlem goons (Harlem Spartans)
And I harlem bop with KuKu dons we're violent youths
Silent mop tryna silent yutes
KuKu bop with Harlem goons

Spartans mash and splash
If we ain't trapping then we splash Naghz
Splash you with passion
School beef no we ain't gassing
22 times probably chatting
Spartans booting down doors
We are not not seven we'll back like Nut Nut
Never wanna shave no haircuts
Dottys and Glocks
Ty got nicked for the mad ting
Still got the things on the block
Cutting thru sshh so you know that we're stepping
Live  shanks and a samurai weapon
Tryna give em all 3 each
But we all mad stressing
If you don't get him we don't play them games
They left my man he was screaming his name
Chest back shots tryna get him in his face
If donny dies okay
Screaming out 410K we ain't squashing this beef hell no no way
None of them boys got heart they're brave (brave)
They know my face
See me and Miz and they're tryna get away
Jumping over fences and pushing thru gates
The boy they're lame
Come to my block and they're leaving their mate (why you running?)
Tryna turn him off that day
You don't want to get dipped by SA
Whole rambo going thru your team
Like ten man I've been splashing your team (SA)
Spartans nab yutes and we stab yutes and we shoot shoot
How the fuck we ain't KuKu
Young goons and they too loose
2 2s brown tings and they so cute
They love SA they love GG, they love me too
Slip bitch and get move to
I know these yutes first stack and they buying loubs
Spartan or Ku run out rip out your arm in two
Spin spin in the whizz whizz bitch kid get scooped
Creep up on ediats get splashed up for the crew
Fuck feds man I hate them they soon dead on the news
Took Sav, Smarkz, Ty and now the man there took Loose
See man run hide olders, olders running their loubs
Feds know If Savage out that's another boy on the news
Free my motherfucking nigga Savage (gang)

Quatro (quatro)
That's 2 man two bikes man saddle
Kunai for shinobi men do travel
He a dead man so we on his back and that's hassle
Drip drip that's splash wounds and you're baffled
Got cat food and there dazzled
We got green around this ain't brazzle
Might buy humps and humps with no cab
We throw  and we battle
Hold two hands on that smoke double barrel
