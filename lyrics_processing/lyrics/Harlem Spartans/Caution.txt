Rah, it's Bkay una
Or them man dash off
We tryna get down opps
Don't try and cut tru' my block
We Spartan bop
Big shavers and mops
Red card tackles, rambo battles
Or them man dash off
Two in a dotts, four in a Glock
We're tryna get down opps
Opps get smacked on the bus
Don't try cut tru' my block
We Spartan bop

Kennington bop
March on your block
Annihilate opps get dropped
Two in a dotts
Rise that mop
Who wants to taste these shots?
Don't get clocked
Get swiped and chopped
My right hand goes through your top
Free all my friends that's locked in a box
Still ride with stainless Glocks
Kennington bop
March on your block

16, I done me a drill
Stepped opp block and I rinsed that fully
15, done me a wetting
Put him in a coma, lightwork setting
Ask about me, I'm a savage
Run man down and M.Y. grab it
Opp ain't bad they're neeky
Ask about me and go check my CV
Practice score on the four
How many opps been slapped in Zone?
He ran he still got bored
Hospital boys go check that score
Yuck yuck do it again put my knife in your core
Free GSplash got bagged with the dotts
Show man about opp block tour
We done it again, another opp just got bored
This gyals too freaky
She sucked my balls with that yawn
Tryna buy me a brand new 
One that's better than the one before
Free Fat Tye out the slums
He backed flick knives and he spills redrum
Don't move stubborn or dumb
You might as well hope and pray us you run
Hope and pray us you run
You gonna get frightened and scared by the gun

Fuck up your walking skills and lungs
Still trap mash getting these funds
Break down amm and put it in guns
