Harlem, RIP Mo
Harlem
Grip-grip and then ride

HS, Gaza Strip, splash, splash like Kanye and Kim
If we turn up now, weapons out
Are you gonna back your goon? (Goon)
Harlem, dip pricks when they ride, ayy, masked up to my eyes
Harlem this, that, grip, grip and then ride (Ride)

Ding dong coupes, skid, skrrt through (Through)
I ride dot-dot, in the back is Loose (Hm)
Ty drivin' too, free Ty, creep up on yutes
Boo, see man scatter in twos
AM, I'm on AM in zoots, gang, screamin' out, "Harlem crew" (Harlem crew) (Crew, crew, crew, crew)
G-G'Smarko too rude
The kitchen broke so he's usin' a tool (Harlem)
Harlem, major money gang crew (Harlem for money, Spartans for what we about)
If we-if we turn up now, weapons out
Are you gonna back your goon?
She brown-brown and she cute (Cute)
Darlin' you can be a spartan too (Ayy)
Chocolate throwin' up K's, got caramels doin' it too
Peng, peng, peng, peng, peng, peng (Peng)
Bro-bro's inside of her mouth while you were inside of her room (Brown and bad)
Three man, four blades on your estate 'cause SA got two (Two)
With Oboy, he Ku (Ku), Zico with one stab too
Kennington, watch where you're ridin' to (Think) (Watch where you're ridin' to)
Trap and ride on yutes, gyal, bands and violence too
I'm no victim, before you're thinkin' I backed his kitchen on you

Chocolate darlin' passes, says she like the way that I'm boppin'
Used to Kenny Bop in my college, fuck it, violate, we get horrid (Horrid)
Please acknowledge, Spartans bucked these yutes they're not on it
Fam, demonic thoughts when I'm shoppin'
Roll, roll out lets get droppin' (Man down, man down)
Brown and blushin', know Harlem Spartans get homage (Peng, peng)
A lot of man are on nothin'
Badman, take your hands out your pockets
Trap, trap mash, I get gwop in
Cats dem love the food that I'm shottin' (Trap, trap)
Twenty-two times when we got choppin'
Loose screamin' out that I love it
Bitches screamin' out to just stop it (Stop it)
On your block don't get spotted, spotted
Back the stuff and get poppin' (Back)
We stand the ground we ain't runnin'
Fam, grip your sword and get choppin' (Ching)
Man, need to know who they're watchin'
Fam, I'll expose what I'm tuckin' if mine jams then I buck him (Buck him)
My main bitch is my flick, my side bitch is my stick
SA with that black blade he hear one flick and get dipped
Blood drip of the dip-dip, it's a splash ting when we grip (It's Harlem)
It's Harlem bitch, Spartans lookin' all Harlem-ish
HS, Gaza Strip, splash, splash like Kanye and Kim
If we-if we turn up now, weapons out
Are you gonna back your goon? (Goon)
Harlem, dip pricks when they ride, ayy, masked up to my eyes
