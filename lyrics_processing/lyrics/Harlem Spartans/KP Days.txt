Savage
Armed with Mizzy and Latz (Twins)
Holding one for Loose
Ragers tun man juice
Water Water, TG said these opps ain't nuttin
Push my buttons, BE ring off the suttin
TG sauce like Mutton, touch BE you're buzzing (buzzing)
Fam, choose if you're on my nigga
Call your hitters, spartans hop out the whizzers
Thought he was bro, but he said no
When they see Spartans pull up, 2 door whip look full up
 and little man if you're on ball just stick to this shit
Don't be like Max
Fam, bro used to do up the wing, now man ride and attack
I got his back like splash, and he got mine and I've seen it, fact
3 SA, SA, my bro, my bro, to the end thats fam
Free up the vengeance clan, I'm from HS, repercussion gang
Spartan mashers, KuKu dons with the shortest fuse
Packs got mad and it blew, more time he do it like , bang man down then he gone
Last ones left, swear I feel rude and dead
Kennington Movie, loving the Harlem trend
Free all my spartans, KuKu men
Fuck, the judge just dirted my friends
Harlem Harlem, free all my KuKu spartans

Loyal man bop these streets
Harlem O
People know what was it worth
Bis can't grow with his friends no more, SA can't let me wan no more
Man can't bill it for Miz no more, TG can't sag with the 45, (My bro)
Used to stuff 4 man in the back, us man violent and them man wack
KP days, young boys made bands
Harlem O, but man turned Spartans know
Swords and live Rambos, Scratch playing Captain Hook
Work up a boy like cook, remember when Mizzy and O had Bell
Thought they could score on my bros oh well
Remember when me and SA were tryna do 
Jump tru, pablo, gloves, on step, public who's on it?
Bare half hearts, big bears didn't want it
Swords and corn you don't want it
TSG's seen, man gotta do sonic
Sparta jungle from it
Used to only rap if Blanco's on it, first time I step tryna earth for Mizzy (My Bro)
TG and Jo man got them a milly
Look Look, can't do it like us, man chat like man can't work with the splash, like man
Move like Spartans would, loyal to the fam, we can ride and dead on the ride
Fam, them gyal should of not seen the wetting, but lifes real, real real life, tears draw blood spillage and broken trust
Real life get him, my heart is full of rage and sorrow
Tryna hit riches, blue lights telling man nono, uhoh
Where's my brothers? Where's my hitters?
To my 300 donnies, block my batch, aim for your chest and back
Creeping flats, too ashamed to lie, man's screaming facts
Free the real G's, she be screaming Latz, them man ain't real
Like they covered in Mac, stepped on my block, man coming right back and more
Told man ready for war, see man ready for war, couple times the odds was cray, still did I back my beef (still done it)
Back your heat, these eyes have seen you twice
Both times you ran with heat, both times the splash on me
I know the pigs locked in, pork tryna get man in
Rats tryna help them things, Rats you can hold some things
Soon time to get them back, Soon man will get them back
Man gon love it, gonna be sweeter than pudding
Man buss shots, cash sweet like pudding
Differently different men, last ones left
How I miss my friends, they also also trying to clamp my set
