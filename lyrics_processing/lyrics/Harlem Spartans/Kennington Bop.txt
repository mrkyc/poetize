Opp block in the ding dong whizz
4 man me, TG and Miz
SA with the ching, real striker 3 Pulla from the wing
These opps don't think
Bang off 1 eye closed no wink
44 bells make him fly like ting cah splash splash leave him wet like a sink
Then I jerk me a pack for a drink then I fly OT till I'm dressed in mink
True harlem's hot like sauna, packs on packs got me feeling Rich Porter
Serve bits of both, bits in bulk can I take your order
Serve bits of both, bits in bulk can I take your order

Them man watered, the trap lifestyle I'm in the trap and I'm dishing out orders
Spartan's drilling till the feds want haunt us
These niggas don't want war, these niggas get bored up
Some harlem g's kennington bop man lean
Skip in da cut chilling with the dots, cuh I lean and pop on the opps
See the gyal dem way to catty
Nuff gyal turn fiend for da cock
Look at the score last week man a opp got bored
Ching man down make him snore
But I chinged man down make him crawl, these niggas all talk them man talk to the pork
Ching man down make him snore
But I chinged man down make him crawl, these niggas all talk them man talk to the pork ay, ay, ay

Mash bake sale
Till the trap come fused in man like bee and 8 tails
Bro moves mad sometimes Cain and Abel
Fiction storyteller story's fable
3 light and dark Charlie's Angels, splash is painful
Add a K get sliced and stapled
And the bay brown one and a hazel's
Old friend like Joey and Rachel, break down buds in homes and couch and tables
Bro said man you don't glance
Ride like the tour de la France
Feds saw how we don't prance
Kenny bop but I swear I don't dance
Bro keep a pole in dance
She wan beat I want plant
TG take squeeze he might blast
Spartans fly out of cars, long like Bells man I saw a giraffe

Harlem's too cold like russians
Bastards came harlem same day spartans did nutters (harlem repercussion)
Harlem's on nothing, ride for your cousins
Spartans pull up see who's realer big men run for their covers
G'd up in the party, chocolate darling looking at me stop blushing
Harlem only man get smokey do it for the Ku-ku gunners
(Ku-ku)
We don't flag bandannas we grip on dannas and bang on the others
Dot dot same size as cupboards, ding ding dong coupes and cutters
We ever lack, we ever lack tell my nigga Naghz Max done him
See a 100 100 spartans back out the ting from jumpers
Splash get down suckers, misch then mash and get numbers
Everyone grip on your weapon, grip on your weapon and bang on the others
