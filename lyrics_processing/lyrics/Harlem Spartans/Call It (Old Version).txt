I don't think I should call this beef
I don't even think I should call them opps
Bro just showed me the long one I don't even know what to call it (Oh Gosh)
Peng ones skin tone different I don't even know what to call her (gold and peng)
Bro just draw me the mad ting I don't even know to call it

Niggas just run like Shaggy
If he didn't roll would've put him in a baggy
Interview room my bali, saved man
I don't know nuttin 'bout Spartans
You call yourselves dogs, surname doo
They do the legs like Scooby
I don't rain in stores when we dress like Panther
Step in your hood-hood Santers
2 splashers, swords and wappers
I'm in Harlem chilling with trappers
Mis mash just throw them drugs, Aydee, OT for months
You bang, we bang, you run
School days took train with gloves
Backpack fully load with stuff
4 door, tell the driver TG pull up
The nine ain't good up, the opps ain't cook up
Demons in the black mobile
Grim reaper, who do you want? (which one)
Move to boy say "Bro" I'm like fam where do you know me from?
Look, I can be a sinner right now and tell Mad Max I don't know these yutes
How we move to and splash them yutes
Still, Mis mash the same tracksuit
Tell me like "Buy guns", we buy guns too
Fuck dat, Imma scratch these yutes
Step round with my hood on my back
So man Kenny bop when we do it
M told me to do it, he blew
He creeped up and threw it on his shank
I used fist to abuse him like that
Jumped on train, I linked with the goons
MizorMac and TG to
My cousin stepping up to
Free up Loski Loose and dem to
Before I knew dat boy was my blood
Up in Lane, we said we was blood
Fam we mash work in this hell
It's always free the mandem in jail
