Bro stepped in with a silent mash
Shit den I gotta get my own
Fam, niggas ain't on my nigga, call your hitta, we can go
TG used to put mad work on the map
My bro got bits of both
Bae bae don't know I'm inner
Gotta get dinner, gyal on hold
She thinks I'm sweet like Tiller
Bryson Tiller, no girl no
Grim Reaper up in a wagon
Blackmobile tryna turn man ghost
Say she don't mind my bro
Like, she didn't see him on vokes
Step out the 8 man cab for the rave
That swords and skengs, you don't know
Hoodie on, yo yo yo
Lock off a man, go home
Do Moscow march in a gilet
Pull up with TG Milly
Where you from? Now they gonna act silly
Jump out gang, man hop out the wagon
Bare wannabes screamin' like women
Chickens, and Max needs them meals
They got jackin', not Jill
Fought dem sam-swords on wheels
Spartans does this for real
My splash got my back, and this corn lookin' fat
Free my bro MizOrMac
