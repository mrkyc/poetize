Harlem for money
Spartans we step out and do up your badman brother
She look peng with a K on her face
And that one really sounds like her mother
Man's way too Ku
Hop out, hop out, boo
Three Spartans, One Ku
Two pedals up in the zoo
KuKu

K on my blade with Bis, doing up patrols in the manor
Hello with the rest like two make a Kennington bop then stagger
Splash a man down till him stand up
Back to the trap for the bag up
Dish dish dat, bare chat
Don't worry boy best smile for the camera (flash)
Still trap mash, still got food for the cats
But why these niggas talk bad it's mad
Cah most these niggas been wacked
Doing up party with the gang
Two shots with the Grey Goose and I'm back
Feeling like Mist in the trap
Peng one screaming out "Karlas back"
Cah, I got hang one hang
Dash, better get known on you're getting on your back
Cah hang one hang
Dot dot 10kg in the bag
Hit him three times and I'm swirving
I'm with Bis, misch mash
And you really misch mash
Get a phone, get twerking
Brown and leng, looking 10 out of 10
On a milli in person
But it's MOB, got a thing on me
Won't lack when I'm serving
Got bros in jail and I'm hurting
Bros them really put work in
Don't sit, don't lack, get shows
And volts man a clothes and curtains

Free strikes when I get caught, you're dead
And we put sheets on a ped
We put sheets on a skeng
Splash is free
How could I lack, how could they snitch on man
But you claim you're a real arse, real arse man
These niggas ain't numb, but dumb
Just pushing his bun
Bro leave sauce on man, he's stutting
Still keep the trapline jump
Dash ain't numb, but fun
Fam, free the niggas I love
Family treating my circle
Spartan gang, fam
Don't cash spend on war
Most man planned for war
The the ting crash get worse
Jakes got the whole thing capped
Free my gang
Grab them man, they run not gang
What if we jump out on a fed like shh
What if we do up a pig like shh
What if we do it like see it on cam
Rookies ran, still tryna cam like set
Kennington rep
Bro tryna brown and leng
My one's gold and peng
Reach out to Latz and Loose
Apparently need a man doing bare loose screws
Still we bop over there
They see us just everywhere
No skeng here, no toss do I care
On a Spartan ting
Get a man down, they run with mash
Man put life on line for blood or bro
Spartan ting
Ching to the born
Carry couldn't touch my buttons
Kennington's flow
Spartan or Ku
Kennington flow
 couldn't chat like us
I be tryna run from them
Really tryna get me bagged (snitches)
Lonely Spartan
 parked off
Like free my broski Jacks
Ay, (?) wolves in packs
They run off if we pop out the flats
Jakes tryna get man trapped
Fam, why you want all my niggas bagged
Next white ting it's on I'm on
Come link me there where it's at
Spill piglet juice and I'm done
If you see Biscuit, officer, officer run
Same when you see it on cam
Do it then run
Bis ain't in it for fun
I'm raging, Spartan's raging, Kuku mad
Put him in the can
So I can do wheel all day
Ready for war all day
Cut through the block they pray
4 door truck look zate (zate, zate, zate)
So I can do wheel all day
Ready for war all day (for war all day)
