Bad B lost her mind
Bad B got declined
We used to be Bonnie & Clyde
You used to be my sunshine
Crime life
Doing time
They could never get no high five
They could never get no Bye Bye

They could never get no high five
Oh my, oh my
What's the price I can buy my guy
Broke, they ain't even making no notes
They be on tracks talking bout trap phones
They ain't been in the bando
Woah, woah
They might have bars, they're all liars
I'm behind bars doing my time, free spartans 1000 times
Free Spartans they be doing time
Yo yo
Way back then with the .44
They already know 'bout me and Jo
Tape of roads, tape of roads

Darling, slow down if you're feeling different
Mans tryna eat figures with my real niggas, real jiggas
Ain't got bread, let the chatters, chat
Ends went dead, spartans had to bring it back
Rolling with it tucked, man i love this stuff
Linked a cat a bit of both, and they love that stuff
On the the phone to Millian just got out the block
Eye got plucked what a gruesome one
Niggas see the guys now they're not so tough
They're not staying for none, they're just running off
No respect from us, they're just stuck and bruck
Spartan shit this is more than luck
On a ped with the pack and the T line
Shout my guy, my nigga from knee height
Mash works, no Os then its peak times
If you ain't seeing money, then you be blind
Fuck these guys, nothing but cheap lies
You ain't done no dirt, you're a clean guy
Im ready for the belly, i eat guys
Cloud9 i be buzzin' with the beehives
Back on my me shit
Back on my me chase me shit
Fuck a little nigga tryna pree shit
No lie, get a big man beaten
