Like rico, mitch and ace just living in harlem
10 toes on the block with the gang
Like look at my spartans
Hoes say I got no manners
Excuse me oh darlings (slow down b)
Fuck it, man get kwenged, get kwenged
Like shit that unfortune

Bags in a box it's Tetley
I might have to do this hop no fist
Cause he looking all hefty
Do dirt in the field man's scared
Free corn for the referee
Loving the bands same way that the cats love Meffy
Miz with the blade like slice
Like I'm talking about Wesley
Still showing enough
TG we stepped out on fendi
Same gyal said she's good but she's bad
She's telling man many
Ice on my neck flash cream
That's Ben & Jerry's
And the peng gyal saying she's ready
Can't lack, won't lack with my splash
One splash but I better move right
See an opp bring flesh bring crash
Can't lack, won't lack or dash
Can't lack, won't lack with my splash
One splash but I better move right
See an opp bring flesh bring crash
Can't lack, won't lack or dash
You might also like
Telling me loads
You might want the team you man
Till you feel my Jawns
In the trap that's nomenal bells
He ain't coming home
Jumz on Jumz on joints
Like they ain't gonna know
In the roof from six day rap
Like they ain't gonna blow
Full packs on the curb
Colombian snow
Trapping ain't dead
Just save my bro for the most
Trapping ain't dead
Just move my load for the bros
Niggas ain't bad man act
To the bad niggas come up on chat
From a q now the gun up is mad
L1 two shanks that's Latz
Niggas ain't bad man act
To the bad niggas come up on chat
From a q now the gun up is mad
L1 two shanks that's Latz

(Get money)
Peng gyal on man be patient
She telling me I cheated
She should've seen it coming like that's so raven
Chudz got sixteen years cause he said it was him on that pavement
Scales got eighteen years cause he said it was him at that station
Shank long like Bellz and Zimz
Like do you really wanna taste it
And this bruckback only holds two
Like tell me why the fuck would I waste it
And gyal see me with Dboy and Dan
Now the hoes asking me if I'm Leyton
I said no way baby I'm Harlem
Tell her gyal don't be mistaken
Mizzy and Lackz two man four shanks
Before the bros start shaving
All of my niggas in the Prince that's Hyze and Savage on the block just raging
Got step with the skeng
10 toes on the block got me looking like Satan
Peng gyal with a metal tongue
Like shit a them gyal are amazing
Can't come to the K it's way too violent
Got smoke round here
Jumz fresh home and it's way too violent
The opps don't wanna see gang
Aydee with the blade just tryna do knifings
What you know about the van?
Four man mashed up in the back
Tools keep tools on man
Don't you know man can't lack
Blancs all serving dust
Jump out at man he dust
Up trap loving I'm buss
Up trap something and cut
Opps don't wanna see Mizzy
Aydee with the blade that's silly
Been round there with my ones
No need for a team
Man way to giddy

Everybody freeze like Stalin
I've seen bare man throw up their hands
When I rise I come like auction
Bad B new home get uck in the morning
Big road for the gwop that's fortunes
Now I'm back in the lab no acting
Do I got it on me or am i acting
Don't be silly gun buck just turned a boy silly
Me and  on alert with the 4s
One shell can't miss when I'm bored
Go round them blocks with swords
Lucky HS never torn
Go round them blocks with the sword
Like rico, mitch and ace just living in harlem
10 toes on the block with the gang
Like look at my spartans
Hoes say I got no manners
Excuse me oh darlings
Fuck it, man get kwenged, get kwenged
