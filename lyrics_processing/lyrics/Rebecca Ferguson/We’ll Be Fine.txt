When you're lonely
Don't be afraid, I'll keep your heart close to mine
Lay safe in my arms
Lay safe in my arms
(Verse)
When I'm falling
I won't stay down
'Cause I will hold you
Lay safe in my arms
Lay safe in my arms
(Pre-Chorus x2)
When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...
(Chorus - part 1)
Sometimes we can relax walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise
(Chorus - part 2)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
You might also like(Verse)
You'll find me
As a song forget me
Try victory
With your head held high
(Pre-Chorus x2)
When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...
(Chorus - part 1)
Sometimes we can relax walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise
(Chorus - part 2)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
Just give it a try
And I'm not afraid
Give it a try
And I'm not afraid
And we'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
And we'll be fine
(Chorus - part 2)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine, we'll be fine, yea we'll be fine
