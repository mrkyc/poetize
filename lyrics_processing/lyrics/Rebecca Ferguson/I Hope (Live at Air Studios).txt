Look into your eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away
'Cause when there's money love is blind
Its so blind
But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she's kind
I hope that she's kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
'Cause after a time you'll realise that it ain't easy
'Cause after a time you'll realise that you should've believed me
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Loving ourselves comes so easily
Forgiveness was like the biggest sin to me
And where there was war
I wouldn't walk away
But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she's kind
I hope that she's kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Right now I have taken all that I am
And I forgive you, and I forgive you
For all that you are
I hope that life is good
In a way you haven't been good
I hope that she is kind
Even though you haven't been kind
Cos I'll forgive you
Cos I'll forgive you
