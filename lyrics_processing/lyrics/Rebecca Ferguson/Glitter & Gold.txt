How good or bad, happy or sad
Does it have to get?
Losing yourself, no cry for help
You don't think you need it?

And old friends are just a chore
But now you need 'em more than ever before

All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding wild horses you can't control
With all your glitter and all of your gold
Take care of your soul

Take care of your soul, soul, soul, soul

How high, how low, how on your own
Are you gonna get?
Because losing your soul will cost you more
Than that life you're paying for
You might also like
And all those friends you left behind
You might need 'em when it's cold outside

All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding wild horses you can't control
With all your glitter and all of your gold
Take care of your soul

One day you're gonna wake up and find that
New dream is losing it's shine
And nobody is by your side
When the rain comes down and you're losing your mind
So, who you're gonna run to?
Where you're gonna hide?
Glitter and gold won't keep you warm
On those lonely night

And all those friends that were such a chore
You're gonna need 'em more than ever before
All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding wild horses you can't control
With all your glitter and all of your gold
Take care of your soul
With all of your gold
Take care of your soul

Take care of your soul, soul, oh-oh-oh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)
Take care of your soul, soul, oh-oh-oh-ooh
Take care of your soul
