You said the wrong words, so I'm writing this song
The mess you left was my crying best
It wasn't my fault
And how was I to know I was nothing, nothing
Did I ever truly mean nothing, nothing
I like to try to tell myself I was something
Cos that's easier to take
And I'll meet you there
Between the right and the wrong
I'll meet you there
Between the good and the bad
I'll meet you there
There's a field of peace
Where our children will greet
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
Between the right and the wrong
I'll meet you there
Between the good and the bad
I'll meet you there
There's a field of peace
Where our children will greet
I'll meet you there

You had an ice tongue, it took my breath away
The words you used cut me inside
And how was I to know I was nothing, nothing
Did I ever truly mean nothing, nothing
I like to try to tell myself I was something
Cos that's easier to take
And I'll meet you there
Between the right and the wrong
I'll meet you there
Between the good and the bad
I'll meet you there
There's a field of peace
Where our children will greet
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
Between the right and the wrong
I'll meet you there
Between the good and the bad
I'll meet you there
There's a field of peace
Where our children will greet
I'll meet you there
There, there
And I'll meet you there
Rivers were full with the tears you left
Skies could fall with every prayer I sent
Crossing borders and killing time
Waiting for the day we'd draw the line
