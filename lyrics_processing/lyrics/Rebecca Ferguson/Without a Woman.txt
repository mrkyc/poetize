Build bridges with my braids
I've seen the waters grow
Been high and I been low
I walk, I made a way
I fight with grit and grace
And yet I still come home
I do it all, I do it all
This body of mine's a body divine
And I know, and God knows, oh how I try
You know I gotta tell you something
So take a seat and listen to me
Let me break it down
I'll show you what life without a woman would be
Move over mister good for nothing
I'll show you things you wouldn't believe
But first you got to stop, find out
What life without a woman would be
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
You might also likeMy love, my love is deep
Just like the seven seas
And I love you faithfully
I do it all, I do it all
This body of mine's a body divine
And I know, and God knows, oh how I try
You know I gotta tell you something
So take a seat and listen to me
Let me break it down
I'll show you what life without a woman would be
Move over mister good for nothing
I'll show you things you wouldn't believe
But first you got to stop, find out
What life without a woman would be
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Been high and low
I felt the cold
But now I know, I know, I know
I'm more than gold
Can't break this mould
Been tried in fire
Still have my soul
Cos I'm a woman
Yes, I'm a woman
You know I gotta tell you something
So take a seat and listen to me
Let me break it down
I'll show you what life without a woman would be
Move over mister good for nothing
I'll show you things you wouldn't believe
But first you got to stop, find out
What life without a woman would be
I tell ya boy, you won't like it
I tell ya, tell ya, boy you won't like it
I tell, you won't like
No no no
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
Tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya boy you won't like it
