(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

I used to hate you so easily
Look into your eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away
'Cause when there's money, love is blind
It's so blind

But after a time
I realised that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good, I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well, I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind, I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
'Cause after time you realise that it ain't easy
'Cause after time you realise that you should've believed me
Oh, I hope life treats you good, I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
You might also like
Loving ourselves comes so easily
Forgiveness was like the biggest sin to me
And where there was war
I wouldn't walk away

But after a time
I realised that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good, I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well, I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind, I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Hope life treats you good, I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Right now
I've taken all that I am
And I forgive you, and I forgive you
For all that you are
I hope that life is good (I hope, I hope)
In a way you haven't been good (I hope, I hope)
I hope that she is kind (I hope, I hope)
Even though you haven't been kind
'Cause I'll forgive you (I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope), 'cause I'll forgive you, 'cause I'll forgive you (I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope)
