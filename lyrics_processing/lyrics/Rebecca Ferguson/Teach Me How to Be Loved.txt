One foot onto the ice
I hold my breath and try to believe
Can I look at you with different eyes?
Like the girl that I was when I was seventeen

The fallen empires, the shattered glass
The wicked echoes of my past
I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved
Teach me how to be loved

I got caught up in a daze of the wine and roses
Such a sweet escape
But I watched it all slip away
Like running water through my hands
Raining on this picture land
You might also like
The fallen empires, the shattered glass
The wicked echoes of my past
I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved

Can I give myself just one more second chance
And put my trust in love? Please, don't hurt me
If I make myself like a feather in your hand
And put my trust in love, please, don't hurt me

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved
