Everyboy dreaming their life away
And there you are
Wishing on stars everyday
Feel torn by the seems/seams
You work so hard to hide
But life's a bitch
Remember she's not always on time
Right through your good days and bad days
Sad days and dark days
I'll be here for ya
And when you're too weak to get off the ground
I'll pick you up, won't knock you down
I'll be here for ya
People wanna get away
Everybody trying to do something with their lives
With some sense you've gotta pay
But it's not a price you pay all of the time
And everything you have to face
What would do I think you'll find it's alright
So give yourself a break
And be patient
Let's all come out of the rain

Sad days and dark days
I'll be here for ya
And when you're too weak to get off the ground
I'll pick you up, won't knock you down
I'll be here for ya
Right through your good days and bad days
Sad days and dark days
I'll be here for ya
And when you feel like you can't get off the ground
I'll be here for ya
When you're alone by yourself
And you feel like nbody is yours
I'll be there
When you feel like nobody's around to help
I'll be there
And every tear that you cry
I will pour out to dry
I'll be there
Right through your good days and bad days
Sad days and dark days
I'll be here for ya
And when you're too weak to get off the ground
I'll pick you up, won't knock you down

Everybody trying to do something with their lives
People wanna get away
