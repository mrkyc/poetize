Oh-ooh
Ooh, ooh

Second-guessing, never learn my lessons
Always chasing after what somebody else had stole
When you took your chances, I wasn't burnt to ashes
And your broken promises have left you out in the cold

With each lie that you told (Lie that you told)
I learn a little more (Learn a little more)
And it was brighter before (Brighter, yeah)
Your love don't shine anymore

You went and turned a diamond to a stone
I should have known to leave you well alone
But instead, I chose to lay you in my heart
My eyes don't shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone

So now I'm walking with me eyes wide open
But I fell off the track, but now I'm back in control (In control)
Since I saw through you, the crystal waters are so blue (Are so blue)
And my smile is back again, it had been away for so long
You might also like
'Cause with each lie that you told (Lie that you told)
I learn a little more (Learn a little more)
And it was brighter before (Brighter, yeah)
Your love don't shine anymore

You went and turned a diamond to a stone
I should have known to leave you well alone
But instead, I chose to lay you in my heart
My eyes don't shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone

The harder I try, the easier it is to walk, walk away
The harder I try, the easier it is to walk away

You went and turned a diamond to a stone (Diamond to a stone)
I should have known to leave you well alone (Leave you well alone)
But instead, I chose to lay you in my heart (I lay you in my heart)
My eyes don't shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone (Diamond to)
Diamond to a stone (Diamond to a stone)
I should have known to leave you well alone (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh)
But instead, I chose to lay you in my heart (I lay you in my heart)
My eyes don't shine quite like they did before (Like they did before)
Like a diamond to a stone
