You should do just as I say but not as I do
I done told you I own you
And I can do anything
Anything, anything, anything I want

Does it make you feel like you can win some?
You can't take my freedom, freedom, freedom out of my life
Freedom, freedom, freedom out of my life

I told you I won you
And I can to anything
Anything, anything, anything I want
