Walk on, yeah
I don't control the weather
Like I don't control your mind
I don't have my hands on time
But I'm pretty sure you're lying
See your golden lips ain't sweet to me
And there's plenty more who plant their seed
Bet you've been out there
And met plenty of girls who would love to play your mistress for a week
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
So walk on, yeah, walk on
So walk on, yeah
Script ain't getting much better
Cos you slipped up twice
You're loving your shine boy
You're gonna pay the price
You might also likeSee your charm it doesn't work on me
I heard you got a family
Bet you've been out there
And met plenty of girls who would love to play your mistress for a week
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
And I think we've been here a couple of times
That same look, that same shirt, those same lies
But I've drawn my conclusion
You want me to be your bit on the side
I'm not somebody's fool
That ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
No, that ain't me, that ain't me, no, no
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, that ain't me
