I'm not wearing a cape, these are just regular clothes
And I'm praying to God, come on lessen this load
Smiling through the bad times, but it's all just for show
Saving my tears for when I'm alone

And I lose my shit every now and then
I break down big then I start again

Never, never said I'm a superwoman
Never said, I never said it
Never ever said I was more than coping
Never did, I never did
Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm all cried out
Maybe I'm scared, but I'm coming 'round
No, I never, never said I'm a superwoman

Dropping the mask, uncovering my soul
Loving my scars, letting go of control
Seeing beauty through the ashes everywhere I go
One minute I'm strong, the next I don't know

And I lose my shit every now and then
I break down big then I start again
You might also like
Never, never said I'm a superwoman
I never said, I never said it
Never ever said I was more than coping
I never did, I never did
Maybe I'm mad, and maybe I'm all cried out
And maybe I'm scared, but I'm coming 'round
No, I never, never said I was more than human

And I wish I could fly
Take me away
Take me away
Just fly
Up and escape sometimes
I wish I was strong
Stronger than this aching
It's breaking me down

And I never ever said I'm a superwoman
I never said, I never said it
Never ever said I was more than coping
I never did, I never did
And maybe I'm mad, I'm all cried out
And maybe I get scared, but I'll be coming 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
All cried out
And no I never ever said, oh
Coming 'round
No, no, I never ever said I'm a superwoman
