Hey, when you get tired
When you're waiting for a train
When nothing's exciting you
I'm probably thinking about you then
Every time you cross my mind
You're like a prayer, a precious sig (Sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign)

Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh, I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now
Oh, you're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
Oh-oh, you're too good to lose (Ooh)

Hey, I lost my phone
It must have fallen out in the street
Maybe you called and I didn't pick up
And if you wondered, that's all it means
All I touch and all I see
I give it up so freely
You might also like
Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh, I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now, oh
Hear my prayer now
Just say the word and I could be there now
Oh, I say my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now
Oh, you're too good to lose
Ooh, you're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
Oh-oh, you're too good to lose (Ooh)
Oh, you're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
You're too good to lose

I'll be there when you get lost, when you need somebody
Keep your name on my heart
Because, because

Hear my prayer now
Just give me time and I will be there now
Oh, I say my prayer now
Just say the words and I will be there now
You're too good to lose
Oh, ou're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
Oh, you're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
You're too good to lose
