I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like, but you still did it
You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Am I confused? Am I a crazy person?
You say it's old news, she doesn't mean nothing
But don't you understand that I am heartbroken?
No matter what you do, you just can't make it untrue

You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door
I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like, but you still did it
You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Too much to lose and it's still raining
I know it's not a game, so I'll stop playing
But oh, my heart's on fire and it keeps burning
And I don't mean to cry, it's just the smoke gets in my eyes
You might also like
You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door
I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like, but you still did it
You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Let the battle drum start, I wanna turn back the clock
I wanna find the missing pieces of the whole love I lost
You say it like you mean it and I want to believe it
'Cause I can't stop this feeling

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like, but you still did it
You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
