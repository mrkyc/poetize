And how tired they've been
You've done the bottles, you've paced the halls
Cos deep down I know, there's a strength from within
So why don't you smile, cos smiling is all you have
And why don't you trust instead of getting mad
Cos not all love's dependent and changing
There's some that is real
Never ending
No sorrow lives there
No sorrow lives there
Will you hold me
Cos I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking
Didn't turn out as you thought
Fairytale was more like the wall
How innocent you are
No father just crushed dreams
It's not exactly your knight in shining armour
Not much of a king

And why don't you trust instead of getting mad
Cos not all love's dependent and changing
There's some that is real
Never ending
No sorrow lives there
No sorrow lives there
Will you hold me
Cos I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking
You're been playing on my mind lately
Want to help you, don't leave me behind
Docs saying I'm going crazy
Rumour has it that love is blind
And my back's against the wall
Yeah, you already took my shine
And I've found the dream I was dreaming
Wasn't mine
Will you hold me
Cos I've had enough
Will you hold me
I feel like giving up
And I'm tired of smoking
And the drink's not working
Because I feel let down
I'm sick of this fake smile
And I'm tired of smoking
You've been playing on my mind lately
The docs saying I'm going crazy
But I can't sleep at night
