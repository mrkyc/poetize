I wish that you could see who I really am
It's tough being a woman in love with an unkind man
Cause baby I'd give you the world, in fact, I already do
And how do you repay that?
Talk to me like I'm just a regular tramp tryna do you over
Have you even got a clue, what I gave up just to be here?
Serve you with your steak and beer?

'Cause baby that's love (Baby that's love)
And baby that's real (Baby that's real)
And all I've ever wanted was for your loving arms
To wrap themselves around me and say

Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my eyes have ever seen
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down with me
Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my heart has ever known
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down

I'm not tryna play the victim, don't wanna go head to head
But boy I shouldn't have to stand in the mirror convincing myself I'm fair
Baby that's your job to do
And baby you should say I'm beautiful
Why do you wanna watch the set when I'm layin' right next to you in my own room?
I feel like you don't even know I'm there
But I put a brush through my hair for you
Run my fingertips over your back real smooth
You might also like
Boy I need love (Boy I need love)
I don't get enough (I don't get enough)
And all I've ever wanted was for your loving arms
To wrap themselves around me and say

Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my eyes have ever seen
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down with me
Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my heart has ever known
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down

I look you dead in the eyes and say that "I love you"
In the eyes and say "I want you"
In the eyes and say "This is what I'm asking for"
How can you sit and stare at the wall?
Do you even like me at all?
Stop talking 'bout making it better, ain't that complicated
I just wanna see your arms around me, baby
Come and lay your bones down
Come and lay your bones down

Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my eyes have ever seen
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down with me (Bones down)
Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my heart has ever known
Come and lay your bones down with me
Come and lay your bones down
Oh, I look you dead in the eyes and say "I love you"
In the eyes and say "I want you"
In the eyes and say "This is what I'm asking for"
Ooh, come and lay your bones down
