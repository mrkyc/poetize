Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow

It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
You might also like
Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed

And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right

Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
