Acting crazy like that
I know that I've been wrong
It's something I've been working on
And I don't know what to do
It's changing me, it's killing you
I'd tear out my insides if I could
But I don't know if it'd do me good
I'm sorry friends, I'm sorry lovers
To put us all in this mess
I know we've still got each other
But I'm in distress
'Cause every time that I feel like I've figured it out
Can't seem to figure it in
It's got nothing to do with me
It's not even you, you see
It's part of my chemistry
It's this jealousy
In absolutely no position
To be so needlessly unkind
When I'm the one writing this fiction
Make it real in my mind
You might also likeIt drives me crazy in the morning
Who is this monster in the mirror?
I try to get the steam to fog it out
But I just can't get it clear
Oh, and I can't stand what I'm feeling
It's just like poison in my veins
I know that I'm speaking
But I don't know what I'm saying
'Cause every time that I feel like the world just got lighter
It seems that my muscles give out
It's got nothing to do with me
It's not even you, you see
It's part of my chemistry
It's this jealousy
And I'm hearing your voice
Babe you know it's your choice
Maybe so
I know it's no use
But it's the only excuse
That I know
Know, know...
Let me go
Let me go
Oh, let me go
Oh, let me go
Now let's be real I've been just like a child
Man, someone could be taking all my toys
So call me dumb, call me wild
See that's the thing with little boys
Oh, I know I can't get it out in the shower
Or drink it off at the bar
This sugar's gone sour
And it's gone way too far
'Cause every time that I feel like I'm riding so high, feel on top of the world
The bitch just keeps telling me no
It's got nothing to do with me
It's not even you, you see
It's part of my chemistry
This demon is killing me
And, oh, Christ it's filling me
It's this jealousy
Oh, and I just can't believe
In this jealousy
This jealousy for you
Oh, this jealousy
