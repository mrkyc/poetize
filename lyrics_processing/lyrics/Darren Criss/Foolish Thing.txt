I got my ducks all in a row
They're exactly how I like them
But now, I'm afraid they've gone
Good afternoon, I'm losing focus
My soldiers are putting down their guns
And I think, oh no, where did they go
Maybe all this time
Maybe all this time I've been wrong
Falling in love
Was another foolish thing
That I never really needed
But you were the first to change my mind
You're knocking me off of my horse
And here I lay fallen and defeated
And I'd leave it all behind
For this foolish thing of mine
The jester sent his resignation
And my tower is crumbling to the ground
And as far as I see
I would much rather be in the place you appear
As if I needed a distraction
As if I wanted an attack
But a prince in distress needs a damsel to test
What he always feels
I couldn't run
I couldn't hide
I'd look away if I tried to

Was another foolish thing
That I never really needed
But you were the first to change my mind
You're knocking me off of my horse
And here I lay fallen and defeated
And I'd leave it all behind
For this foolish thing of mine
I'll close the door
Put it to bed
My loneliness
Falling in love
Was another foolish thing
That I never really needed
But you were the first to change my mind
You're knocking me off of my horse
And here I lay fallen and defeated
And I'd leave it all behind
For this foolish thing of mine
Falling in love
Falling in love
With this foolish thing of mine
Falling in love
Falling in love
With this foolish thing of mine
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
