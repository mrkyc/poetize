Ladies and gentlemen, let me present
Frankie Goes to Hollywood
Possibly the most important thing
This side of the world
Oh yeah, well 'ard!

You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over
But the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History
Will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the
State prosecutor and the sentence of this court
For she acquits us
Condemn me
Condemn me
Condemn me
History will absolve
Singing "this will be the day that I die"
Yeahhhhhaaaa

When you hear the air attack warning
You and your family must take cover at once
Do not stay out of doors
If you are caught in the open, lie down
And now, here is a reminder about fallout warnings
When fallout is expected
You will here three bangs in short succession, like this
In some areas, the warning may be given
By means of three gongs, like this
Or you may hear three whistles
All these three types of sounds
Indicate that fallout is expected
When two tribes go to war
A point is all you can score
When you hear them
You must stay in the safest position in the house
Keep the doors shut
Do not go outside your house
We've got two tribes
Until you are told it is safe
Here is the all clear warning
Yeeaaahhhh
When you hear this sound
You can leave your house
Something must give now
Are we living in a land
Where sex and horror are the new Gods?
Yeeaaahhhh, ow, ow, ow
