We have to find a world that's new
Buy a new dress and go out dancing
Do all the things you wanna do
For heaven's sake, you have to break away
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today
We don't need aggression
We don't need recession
Just give us some money
Our lives could be sunny too
We don't need regression
Or means of repression
Our lives could be sunny too ,ooh
Our lives should be so full of laughter
With endless joy to follow after
Summer comes to girls and boys
Never too late, but to enjoy, to enjoy
In my head, In my head, In my head
In my head, In my head, In my head
Oh come on down from your ivory tower
Unlock the doors and give us flowers
We've worked for you now for too long
We've done what's right, you've done us wrong
For heaven's sake, we got to break away
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today

To make your impression
Oooh, the world is waiting
We need to go out dancing
Oooh, the world is waiting
We need a new TV
Oooh, the world is waiting
We don't need fear and fighting
Oooh, the world is waiting
We don't need history
In my head, In my head, In my head
In my head, In my head, In my head
She should buy us all a drink
She should buy us all a drink
She should stop and think, stop and think
She should buy us all a drink
