Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Move with me inside the strange world of the 12"
Where nothing is as it seems
Where everything has it's place
And there's a place for everything
And anything can happen
Let me take you on a tour of the 12"
Using this special extension of Rage Hard as our example
We have begun
It is, of course, Frankie
And Frankie only
Around we go, under, through, up and under
Watch out here for the guitar
Let it sustain
Now, our favourite, the funky guitar
Always note the sequencer
This will never let us down
Let it have it's wicked way
We are sliding good
Building fast
The perky percussion
How does it feel?
The god-like bass guitar
A hint of backing vocals (Rage!)
You might also likeA lust of deep, dark synthesiser
And we shall be teased by a long, merciless reverb
The breakdown
So you can lie down
The whip, if you know what I mean
Do what you are told
Those repeat echoes
An essential part of the 12" is the climax (Yes)
But first (Yes)
The anti-climax
The lads with electric disgust
Paul Rutherford, here for the smell of it
How does it feel? (Hard!)
Do what you are told
Move with me over the thrill of the 12"
Do what you are told
The whip (Ow!)
Do what you are told
The whip (Ow!)
Do what you are told
The fall, and the rise
The whip (Ow!)
The fall, the whip (Ow!)
We are sliding good
Building fast
The beginning
And the end
The rush
And the thrust
The speed
And the sweat
The vocals of Holly Johnson
(Yes, yes, yes!... Yeah!)
We are at the centre of a riff
Rage
Rage hard
The fall
And the rise
The beginning
And the end
The rush
And the thrust
The speed
And the sweat
It is, of course, Frankie
And Frankie only
You flipping me off?
The climax
The climax
Rage!
Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rise up in millions, get off your knees
Dispelling the demons
In the valley of danger
We all walk together
Sculptures in sorrow
With love light to follow
On sweet head of Apollo
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard
Rage
Rage hard
The blue eyes of children
They shine without fear
Hope is the future, with oceans of cheer
(Nothing to fear) There's nothing to fear
The laughter of angels
Resounding from Heaven
Keep fighting the favours
Of charlatan saviours, charlatan saviours
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark 
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
I don't know which way to go
My love's like driven snow
When we pass the test of time
My love, you shall be mine
And if only, lost and lonely
Is all that's wrong with me
We'll be free, be free, be free
Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rage hard
Rage hard
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
