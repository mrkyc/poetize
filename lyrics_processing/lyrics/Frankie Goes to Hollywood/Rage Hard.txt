Rage, rage, rage, rage
Rage hard
Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rise up in millions, get off your knees
Dispelling the demons
In the valley of danger
We all work together, sculptures in sorrow
With love light to follow
On sweet head of Apollo
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard
Rage
Rage hard
Though blue eyes of children
They shine without fear
Hope is the future, with oceans of cheer
(Nothing to fear) There's nothing to fear
Though laughter of angels
Resounding from Heaven
Keep fighting the favours
Of charlatan saviours, charlatan saviours
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage hard, against the dark
Rage hard, make your mark
I don't know which way to go
My love's like driven snow
When we pass the test of time
My love, you shall be mine
And if only, lost and lonely
Is all that's wrong with me
We'll be free, be free, be free
