Thirsts for You Lord
In the desert
In the dry and dusty land
As your words
Fall like rain
On this hard heart
I believe again
There is hope
That all addictions
And corrupt kings
Are falling off like snow
I believe a broken people
Can be reborn
Spilled blood makes it so

Drench us with Your love
Help us up from our glowing screens

When the sea rages
Against my small defences
You are good
You're always good
When the sea rages
Against my small defences
It's Your love
That carries me through
Each grain tumbles
In the  shoreline
All is had by Your will

In the  shoreline
All is had by Your will
When the sea rages
Against my small defences
You are good
You're always good
Each grain tumbles
In the  shoreline
All is had by Your will
You were there
At the hospital
In the rooms where we were born
And You smile
Knowing this
That we always be loved
You were there
At the hospital
In the rooms where we were born
And You smiled
Knowing this
