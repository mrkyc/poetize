When I heard those words
My heart skipped a beat
My mind went crazy
I fell to my knees
I didn't care about the rain
I didn't care about the cold
All I wanted was to run
Now that I've been told

When I heard the news
I saw the world reborn
Glossy as they thought
To bring boulders from the peaks
His downtrodden 
From the Heaven He was born
Your help is our hope
Now we have a hope

You
You said to me
"Child
Child, I love you"
Hope
Hope is now alive
 no more

Your love don't stop, no no
Your love don't stop
Your love don't stop, no no
Your love don't stop
Your love don't stop, no no
Your love don't stop
Your love don't stop, no no
Your love don't stop

When I stopped and stared
At the Cross on the hill
I knew for certain
That I was adored
A smudge on my heart
Now turned into gold
My love without limit
Like medicine for the soul

Those old ways, they fade
The shame that once 
Is shrinking each day
As I call on Your name
I step out on the waves
And I face down my fears
Because You are on my side
And You've been helping all these years
Jesus
You said to me
"Child
Child, I love you"
Hope
Hope is now alive
 no more

Your love don't stop
Your love don't stop
