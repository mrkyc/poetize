I have seen the light falling over me
I can see the light falling
I have seen Your light falling over me
I can see the clouds calling
I have seen the clouds calling up to You
I have seen the waves cresting
I have heard Your voice speaking over me
The liars and the haters just can't keep their eyes off You
Doesn't matter what they say or what they do, where to run hey?
The fire's in my belly
The fire's in my bones
Now a torch has been lit
And I'm running the other way
Can't wrap my head around this feeling
But I know that You've got me
You've got me, I know
Oceans and oceans rolling and rolling
The thunder and the lightning
The speaking and the heartache
This is now, this is real
Where to go, hey?
Where to go, hey?
You might also like and restless, we just can't keep our eyes off You
Capital kids with their capital speak
From centre to the suburbs and beyond
I guess small things don't matter as much anymore
But they do to me
The objects and the clock of that regret
Buried under beams of light
Behind the screen where hearts sleep
 whispers around some palls in the pain as the metal falls
The people fill the boats
But yet the blood speaks
And the sun shines pretty much like it always did
It always did
It always did
The fighters and the climbers
The best of us are just like the rest of us
Some stood  eating what we've sown
We just can't keep our eyes off You
And the idea behind the heart it
Is that the heart must be protected
Leaving 
The danger left behind is atrophy
Clouds upon clouds
Billowing and boiling
Rising and rising
The planes and the tree tips
Empty cups as the sun dips
And your smile
Keeps me going
And it's physical when it 
Turns like Summer
Hot sticky days, lazes yellow days
Like the peach among the pines
The concrete wreck
Sculpting youth
Seas swimming
Insects floating
Dogs drifting
Silk plumes
And we just can't keep our minds from You
Oceans and oceans just rolling and rolling
The thunder and the lightning
The speaking and the heartache
The thunder and the lightning
The speaking and the heartache
Rolling and rolling
The thunder and the lightning
Rolling and rolling
The speaking and the heartache
I have seen the light falling
I have seen the light falling
I have seen the light falling over You
I have seen the clouds calling
I have seen the door breaking
I have seen the clouds calling out to Thee
I have seen the trees bending
I have seen the earth shaking
I have seen the light shining over You
I have seen the waves cresting
I have seen the storm sinking
I have heard Your voice speaking over me
Your love carries me
Over the mountains
Across the sea
Your love fixes me
Softens this old heart
To love in reply
Your love my guilt relieved 
Now I am smiling
Now I am free
Your love carries me
Over the mountains
Across the sea
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth and I followed Thee
You clutched my body to Your chest, oh-oh
And whispered "Darling, I love you" in my ear
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth and I followed Thee
You clutched my body to Your chest, oh-oh
