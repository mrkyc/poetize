I can't unfeel your pain
I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
My love, my arms are open

So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
And when you're losing faith and every door around you keeps on closing
My arms are open

I can't uncry your tears
I can't rewind the time
I can't unsay what's said
In your crazy life
My love, my arms are open

Ooh, and when you're cursing at the sky
And thinking, "Lord, you must be joking"
My arms are open
And, and when you're looking in the mirror
Thinking that, "My life is over"
My arms are open

So let me do to you
What you've always done for me
And let me be the ground
Underneath your feet

I can't unfeel your pain
I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
My love - my arms are open, arms are open

So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
Oh, and when you're losing faith and every door around you keeps on closing
My arms are open

I will be standing here
I will be by your side
