(Yeah, yeah)

Thank you to anyone who hurt me
This is a shout out to those who never cared
I got scrapes on my heart from all the battles
And I owe you for getting me prepared
I tip my hat to all the haters
Got a handshake for lovers from the past
I got a peace sign for all you backstabbers
You're not the first and you sure won't be the last

Minute by minute, it took me time, time, time
Letter by letter, it cut me line by line
I'm proud of these scars 'cause they're mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, oh

In everyone there is a worry
And every scratch is a new tattoo
'Cause those lines on your face, they tell a story
Of how you became, you became you
So put your arms around the doubters
And dunk a deuce when they push below their belts
They keep it up for the ones who lit the matches
'Cause you get fire proof from going through hell
