I'm a love, love refugee
Don't let nobody get close to me
I'm a hard, hard fugitive
Always running, that's the way I live

'Cause when you go solo, end up feeling so low
You become your own worst enemy
Thinking that there's no hope, and your boat won't float
This is why she said, what she said to me

No man is an island, no one should be on their own
Look in the horizon, 'cause love will always take you home
She said all hearts break, don't lose faith, you can't live life that way
No man is an island, no one should be on their own
No man is an island
No man is an island

I'm a thousand miles from yesterday
Now I'm living like a castaway
Just a broken man on the shore
Still hurting from the one before

I know there's plenty more fish in the sea
But only sharks circle me
And when my heart was buried in the sand
You came along and took my hand (Yeah, yeah)

And when my heart was buried in the sand
You came along and took my hand, made me understand
