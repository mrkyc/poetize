Who would have thought that i'd be here by myself
Who would have thought that you'd be bad for my health
Now I know, now I know I'm just a man on a wire, oh
Who would have thought about the cause and effect
Yesterday's love is now tomorrow's regret
Now I know, now I know I'm just a man on a wire, oh

No I can't look down, I'm trying to fight the feeling
I will fall to the ground, If I ever see you
Cause I

I feel like I'm walking a tightrope
And my heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you, you
Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

Who would have thought I'd see you with someone else
Who would have thought that I'd be in such a mess
Now you know, now you know I'm just a man on a wire, oh

When I walk that line, I try to keep my senses
Make it to the other side, I know the consequences
And I

Feel like I'm walking a tightrope
And my heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you, you
Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

The higher it gets, the more I miss the ground
No safety net, so now you're not around
I have to keep walking to keep me from falling down

Feels like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
My heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you
Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
