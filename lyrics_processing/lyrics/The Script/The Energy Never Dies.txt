I cross my heart and I hope to die
May God strike me down if I tell you lies
I'll stay here forever looking in your eyes
24/7 baby, 365
I'll take your hand and I'll hold real tight
I'll tell you "Life's just a blink, so don't think twice"
Let's catch the moment, in a flash of light
24/7 baby, 365

If we're gonna feel alive, let's feel it now

We could all be blown to pieces
Because time's a ticking bomb
We could all be dead tomorrow
But our love will carry on
Cause when you know your days are numbered
And you're looking in my eyes
It's not the end, cause the energy never dies
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh

I fell for you and I never got up
I stay here forever till I turn to dust
Just take every minute, make it last for life
