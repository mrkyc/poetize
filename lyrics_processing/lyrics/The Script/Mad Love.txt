We're smashing plates and throwing knives
Feels like we're crazy half the time
I got mad, mad love for ya
I got mad, mad love
Beautiful lips, beautiful lies
They're keeping us up every night
I got mad, mad love for ya
I got mad, mad love

Oh, no
They'll never understand what they don't know, woah

Whoever said if you love someone, you should set them free
They don't know shit about you and me
'Cause I won't let you go, no, I won't let you go
Whoever said it was meant to be, but you come right back
We ain't never gonna find out about that
'Cause I won't let you go, no, I won't let you go
No, no, no
I got mad, mad love for ya
I got mad, mad love

We fill the bed with dynamite
Who's turn is it to start the fight?
I got mad, mad love for ya
I got mad, mad love
I'm your great white, you're my piranha
We don't give a, we love the drama
I'm your snakebite, you're, you're my charmer
We don't give a, we love the drama
