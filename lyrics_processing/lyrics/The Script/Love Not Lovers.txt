Another date at the weekend
You met a guy named Jack
Gave him the keys to the castle
But he never called you back
You met a guy on vacation
And you were in paradise
Only found out when you got home
He had three kids and a wife
Swiped right on Tinder
Had a little fun on the phone
You made up but he got so drunk
That you had to swipe left, had to send him home

Oh, the harder you chase it, the more love will run
So tell me you're done

No more going under the covers
No more one bed to another
'Cause you will never find love, you will only find lovers
You go from one to the other
Like you think your days are numbered
But you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers

Met the nice guy from the local
You and him danced all night
But he was trying to get you into bed and
Leave you at first light
And you had a thing with a rockstar
He was living up to the hype
'Til got you back to the hotel
Only wanted your love for just one night

Oh, I know you feel like love's on the run
But your day will come

No more going under the covers
No more one bed to another
'Cause you will never find love, you will only find lovers
You go from one to the other
Like you think your days are numbered
But you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers

Oh, I know that it feels like love's on the run
But your day will come, your day will come
Your day will come, day will come
Your day will come
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers
Oh, you will never find love, you will only find lovers
