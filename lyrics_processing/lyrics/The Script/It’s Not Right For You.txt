My head, my head is full of
Things that I should've done
My heart, my heart is heavy
Here it sinks like a stone
She said, "is this the life you've been dreaming of?
Spending half a day away from the things you love?"
It's not too late to do something new"
She said, "it's hard enough trying to live your life
But not following your dreams makes you dead inside
If you don't love what you do"

It's not right, it's not right for you
If you even have to think about it
It's not right, it's not right for you
If you really have to think about it
You got one life to love what you do

My hands, my hands are scarred by
Things I shouldn't have done
My feet, my feet are weary
From all the miles that I've run

If we don't do something now
Then we'll never know
If we stay here too long then
We'll, we'll never grow old
So, before it's too late
And it's killing you
We've only one life to live
So love what you do

It's not right, it's not right for you
If you even have to think about it
It's not right, it's not right for you

In the end, in the end
You got one life to love what you do
In the end, in the end
Better hold cause you're take it all in
In the end, in the end
