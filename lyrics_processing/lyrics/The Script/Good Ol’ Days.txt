Here we go
Ooh
Here we go

Up in the bar all smoking cigars
While we were drinking Irish whiskey straight from the jar
Talking 'bout them better days, they're not that far
Whoever's coming back to mine, you better bring the guitar
You play a sad song
Yeah, sing it from the heart
Tell a sad story
Yeah, tell it from the start
Pass me on the pain that you made into art
Yeah, pierce it through my skin like a heroin dart (when)
Someone's strumming on the strings
And they're spitting things
Everybody's moving, grooving vibes while the other sings
They gon' kill you with their passion and the soul
When the first verse drops, you'll be fighting back the tears and all
While another man's crying in his beers and all
While his woman's saying, "Cheers to it all!"
Ain't no shame in the game
Just the way you were raised
To always sing about better days, better days

(Here we go, hey)
Ooh
Oh, we'll remember this night when we're old and gray
'Cause in the future, these'll be the good ol' days
Ooh
(Here we go, hey)
Ooh
Oh, yeah we're arm-in-arm as we sing away
In the future, these'll be the good ol' days

Ten o'clock and it's off
What started as a pub crawl, now we're all lost
Better live it out tonight, tomorrow's gonna cost
So get up on that piano boy and play your a** off
You play it real good
Everybody sing along
If you bang us out a beat
Everybody move along
Play us something real
We can hang our hopes on
Sing a rebel song (Oh, these times are hard)
And watch us march along
Won't you come along
And meet Jenny, meet Pete
Meet Mary, meet Keith
They're busking on the street seven days a week
Pay a pound, pay a penny
Make it full or leave it empty
They play, you listen, that's plenty
It's two AM now, we're dancing in the rain and all
Hanging out of each other like the pain is gone
These are my people, these are my crowd
And I'm never too proud to sing about 'em (sing about 'em)
Ooh
(Here we go, hey)
Ooh
Oh, we'll remember this night when we're old and gray
Cuz in the future, these'll be the good ol' days
Ooh
(Here we go, hey)
Ooh
Oh, yeah we're arm-in-arm as we sing away
In the future, these'll be the good ol' days
The good ol', the good ol' days
(The good ol' days)

I got the whole place singing, yeah, singing this song
Even the old man there with the paddy hat on is singing
(Oh, you wanna sing it? Sing it)
I got the whole place singing, yeah, singing this song
Even the girl over there with the red dress on is singing
(Yeah, she's singing)
Oh, I got the whole bar drinking, yeah, singing this tune
Even the guys over there with the big tattoos are singing
(Drinking and singing, yeah)
Now the emo girls with the college degrees
And the tag-along friends with the fake IDs, singing
Oh singing
Yeah
Here we go
Here we go

Ooh
(Here we go)
Ooh
Oh, yeah we're arm-in arm as we sing away
In the future these'll be the good ol' days
The good ol', the good ol' days
(The good ol' days)
Good ol' days, yeah
