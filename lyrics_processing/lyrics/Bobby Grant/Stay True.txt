Never gon' change, I will always stay true
Focused on me, you should focus on you
If you think negative, destined to lose
I am stressed out what am I gonna do?

I cannot complain
Gotta rider, she's the main
After money, not the fame
Out here switching lanes
Someone that you cannot tame
You gon' fuckin' know the name
Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few
Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few

I am the man I said the one and only
Talkin' shit but when I see you we're homies
Now I got bitches all saying they owe me
But they weren't interested when it was old me
But nothing has changed, I am the same
Playing the game but now money's the motive
People keep hatin' I guess that's the motion
People all talk man I'm just staying focused
Choosin' out here, and I'd say that I'm chosen
Leave your girl soaking like she left the ocean
Imma make noise and they'll finally notice
I am the shit but you already know this
Hold me down like a rock, call her my HOV bitch
Usin' me when she dry like I'm some lotion
Dreaming about it, I'll make it all happen
I see no sense in me wishin' and hoping'

Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few
Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few
I cannot complain
Gotta rider, she's the main
After money, not the fame
Out here switching lanes
Someone that you cannot tame
You gon' fuckin' know the name

Imma stay true and homie that's a fact
Done with the fakes I can't deal with all that
After this cash man the money's the mission
Spending time in the stu like I'm in prison
With it or not shawty, make a decision
I got 20/20 they don't see the vision
Mike cookin' beats like we live in the kitchen
Quit bitchin', and listen, I got nothin' missing
I keep on working' but set out to manage
Feel in control but don't know where to land it
I ain't with the drama, I'm chasing these commas
And I keep it movin' I never stay stagnant
After these goals man shit I made a list
Stayin' true even as hard as it gets
Walk in my shoes but your feet wouldn't fit
I just say fuck it and I'm with the crew
And we all in the back, and we all gettin' lit
Girl on my lap and she's twerkin' and shit
Said lets meet up but she's workin' and shit
Said she's done with me still lurking' and shit
Not many people real I know who is
Still immature cause ya boy still a kid
But I'm on my grown shit so don't get it twisted
Imma be me and stay true till the ending
Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few
Imma stay true, Imma stay true
Small circle friends, only got a few
I cannot complain
Gotta rider, she's the main
After money, not the fame
Out here switching lanes
Someone that you cannot tame
