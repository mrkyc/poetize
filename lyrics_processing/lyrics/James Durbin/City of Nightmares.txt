And bleed you like a vein
Angel, we don't wanna be seen
All the smoke and mirrors is where they used to be
Ten million hearts try to find the line
In a world of misery
Consuming the flesh that burns throughout because of history
Don't be afraid
We're gonna make it there someday
And when you break
You're gonna know about hell to pay
So let it burn, burn alive
Give me more 'cause it's my time
I sold my soul to live this life
In the city of nightmares!
And I don't care if I die
'Cause where I go
Is how I decide
I buy the ticket and take the ride
In the city of nightmares!
Let it go!
Be where the sick and deranged
Lies and paranoia feed the city of hell
(Shutdown)
No longer back in the scene
Standin' on the shelf no longer livin' the scene
Ten million hearts try to find the line
In a world of misery
Consuming the flesh that burns throughout the cause of history
