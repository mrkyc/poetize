If you ask what's wrong with me
Well I would tell you it's everything
When I'm tired and feeling sick
When it's nothing you can fix
I want you to know it's not you
Cause I will never be OK, this I know, but that's OK
Cause my eyes are never shut, while my heart is wide awake
And it's all that I can do
Tell me, what else should I do?
Cause
I've got issues, I've got scars
And the color is just like yours
I was broken right from the start
I'm no different than you are
I'm not perfect, I'm perfectly flawed
And my scratches don't hurt much at all
But just like you, I've got issues
There are smiles, there are tears
There are times through the years
Where I cannot remember yesterday
And everything is like a blur
It loses me around a curve
I'm always in a high speed chase
You might also likeAnd I'm trying to gain control using everything I know
But nothing seems to work, I'll never catch at this I'm sure
But I will not forget
You've been with me step by step
I've got issues, I've got scars
And the color is just like yours
I was broken right from the start
I'm no different than you are
I'm not perfect, I'm perfectly flawed
And my scratches don't hurt much at all
But just like you, I've got issues
Am I unwell, cause I don't understand
Is this what they say it is, to be human
And these bandages I wear to keep out the cold
They keep me from something that I'll never know, know
I've got issues, I've got scars
And the color is just like yours
I was broken right from the start
I'm no different than you are
I'm not perfect, I'm perfectly flawed
And my scratches don't hurt much at all
But just like you
You know I'm just like you
