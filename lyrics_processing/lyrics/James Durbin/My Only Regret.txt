Is I didn't know you when we were kids
Hid behind the bleachers and kiss your lips
And after we stop act like we never met
My only one regret
Is I didn't ask you to be my homecoming date
Buy you a corsage and putting it on
Shake your dad's hand and started talking to your mom
But if I could turn back time now
And find out where you live, where you live
And I'll knock on your door
Cause if I knew then what I know now
There's no doubt
I would made you my girl long before we met
That's my only regret
That's my only regret
Oh yeah
My only one regret
Is I didn't know you over a summer
No school just one party after another
Knowing only three months is all we get to get to know each other
My only one regret
Is I overestimated my ability to win
I was a jerk, selfish and conceited
It's taken years to figure out what I needed

And find out where you live, where you live
And I'll knock on your door
Cause if I knew then what I know now
There's no doubt
I would've made you my girl long before we met
That's my only regret
My only one regret
Is the pictures of you and me
Don't exist from when we were little kids
But that was then and now this is this
And the future for us is where it is
But if I could turn back time now
And find out where you live, where you live
And I'll knock on your door
Cause if I knew then what I know now
There's no doubt
I would've made you my girl long before we met
If I could turn back time now
And find out where you live, where you live
And I'll knock on your door
Cause if I knew then what I know now
There's no doubt
I would've made you my girl long before we met
That's my only regret
That's my only regret
