And now the sun is streamin' in
I threw the curtain and light open makin' patterns on your skin
Yeah, I would let you keep sleepin' in
Just sleepin' off, darlin'
I wanna watch what the light does
See where the night goes
'Cause you found me in the shadows
In the shadows
There's a life for us
A space and time for us
I was spinnin' down in a neon haze
'Til I saw your face
And there's a life for us
A space and time for us
A destiny that grows in the light of the lonely
Let's get lost in the shadows
Cause when we fall we fall down hard
Look up and you'll see the stars
And if you need to fall apart
You can do it in my arms
'Cause now the peaceful and quiet
Fought from the traffic and sirens
Saturday nights spent talkin' real close
Out where you found me
Out in the shadows
In the shadows

A space and time for us
I was spinnin' down in a neon haze
'Til I saw your face
And there's a life for us
A space and time for us
A destiny that grows from the light of the lonely
Let's get lost in the shadows
Yeah, I had a little too much last night
And now the sun is streamin' in
I wanna watch what the light does
See where the night goes
'Cause you found me in the shadows
In the shadows
And there's a life for us
A space and time for us
A destiny that grows from the light of the lonely
Let's get lost in the shadows
There's a life for us
A space and time for us
The dents and groans from the light of the lonely
Let's get lost in the shadows
La la la...
