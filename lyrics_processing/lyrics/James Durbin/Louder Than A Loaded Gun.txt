You left that key on the table
You left my heart
You left my heart on the floor
I battle on
With my battle scars still open
What is it good for?
Tell me, what is it good for?
If an apology's all that you needed
It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I'm finding it hard to believe that

Was it easier to run?
So say, say, say
Just can say what you want to
But hey hey hey
Just don't give me up
I can scream scream scream
As loud as I want to
But silence has become
Louder than a loaded gun
Would you walk with me
Walk with me to the ocean
Just to write goodbye
To write goodbye in the sand
Well there's nothing here
And nothing left to be broken
Maybe that's part of the plan
To shatter everything I am

So say, say, say
Just say what you want to
But hey hey hey
Just don't give me up
I can scream scream scream
As loud as I want to
But silence has become
Louder than a loaded gun
Pick up the pieces
That fell in between us
Take it or leave it
You can say, say, say
Just say what you want to
But hey hey hey
I don't give a damn
I can scream scream scream
Just as loud as I want to
Your silence has become
Louder than a loaded gun
Say, say, say
Just say what you want to
But hey hey hey
Just don't give me up
I can scream scream scream
As loud as I want to
But silence has become
Louder than a loaded gun
Louder than a loaded gun
