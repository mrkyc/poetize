Too thin, too wide, don't waste your time
That's what they say, no other way
Don't buy it all, don't buy it all
Too rich, too poor, too prude, too bored
Too mental and too obscene
What's ugliness to some
Is so beautiful to me
Don't hesitate, don't wait
It's always wrong to play it safe
What you've become is never wrong
You're always in the right place
Some things are so hard to be
Some things are just meant to be
I'm here to tell ya
You can't believe
What people say about you
You've gotta be
Yourself in your own virtue
You can't believe (can't believe)
What people think about you
You've gotta live (gotta live)
The life that you were born to
Woah woah
You can't believe (you can't believe)
What people say about you, you...
You might also likeToo straight, too gay, too bi, too strange
Everyone's got their own way
The world is cruel, they ridicule
What they're too afraid to face
Don't play the game, make it change
Just right the wrong and fight the hate
What you've become is never wrong
You're always in the right place
Some things are so hard to be
Some things are just meant to be
I'm here to tell ya
You can't believe
What people say about you
You've gotta be
Yourself in your own virtue
You can't believe (can't believe)
What people think about you
You've gotta live (gotta live)
The life that you were born to
Woah woah
