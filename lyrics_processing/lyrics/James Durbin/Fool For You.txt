Notorious just like BIG
She's got me lookin' over my shoulder, ugh!
Short red dress with Vanna White thighs
Bubblegum lips with starry blue eyes
She's building me up an American dream
She flirts with all my best friends
And screams out, I never listen
So tell me what's a, what's a boy to do (a boy to do)
She'll go down for no reason
And steal from me when I'm sleeping
She's holding back her, her "I love you's" (her "I love you's")
So tell me why, well me why
You're always building me up up, to bring me down
Look at you, look at you baby
Calling me king just to steal my crown
Well didn't you, didn't you make me
Fall for the games that you played with my head, girl
I let you get away with murder
I guess I'm just a fool for you
People ask if I'm okay
I got scratches on my back and face
She really likes to leave her mark (leave her mark)
She comes home drunk at 4 a.m
With whipped cream, strawberries in her hand
She's keeping me up like I got a choice, yeah yeah
You might also likeShe makes cruel seem like sexy
Gets off when she hears McCartney
She'd like me better if I was Bruno Mars (Bruno Mars)
So tell me why, tell me why
You're always building me up up, to bring me down
Look at you, look at you baby
Calling me king just to steal my crown
Well didn't you, didn't you make me
Fall for the games that you played with my head, girl
I let you get away with murder
I guess I'm just a fool for you
No matter what we hear, we'll turn the world away
Cause honestly it's you and me and nothing's gonna change
I guess what I'm trying to say, is it's enough for me
Oh, it's enough for me, it's enough for me
But you're building me up, you're building me up
You're always building me up up, to bring me down
Look at you, look at you baby
Calling me king just to steal my crown
Well didn't you, didn't you make me
Fall for the games that you played with my head, girl
I let you get away with murder
You're always building me up up, to bring me down
Look at you, look at you baby
Calling me king just to steal my crown
Well didn't you, didn't you make me
Fall for the games that you played with my head, girl
I let you get away with murder
I let you get away with murder
I guess I'm just a fool for you, oh yeah
