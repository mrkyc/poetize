From your silhouette to the curve of your shape
You kiss so good
So good that it hurt
But then it all turned from bad to worse
Cuz something in your eyes just wasn't right
Untouchable when you said stay the night
You called me crazy cuz I made you mad
And the kiss that we had
Well I take it back
Cuz you're not all that
So girl get over yourself
Like I got over you
And your cheap perfume and your bad tattoos
Get over yourself, your Gucci and prada shoes
That runway walk and that dumb girl talk
Cuz you try and you try
But you just can't hide the truth about you
So girl get over yourself
Like I got over you
Now you're stalking my house
I saw you round there at night
Thought this girls bark was worse than her bark
Throwing rocks at my window, bricks at my car
Just can't believe how crazy you really are
You're hardly an angel, you're more like a freak
You blame it on me and then you called the police
Being chained to you is like a living hell
A one night stand was a night in jail
But I made bail!

Like I got over you
And your cheap perfume and your bad tattoos
Get over yourself, your Gucci and Prada shoes
That runway walk and that dumb girl talk
Cuz you try and you try
But you just can't hide the truth about you
So girl get over yourself
Like I got over you
Now it's been three months since the fight that we had
I changed all the locks after you called your dad
Heard about somebody new
Good riddance to you
So girl get over yourself
Like I got over you
And your cheap perfume and your bad tattoos
Get over yourself, your Gucci and Prada shoes
That runway walk and that dumb girl talk
Cuz you try and you try
But you just can't hide the truth about you
So girl get over yourself
