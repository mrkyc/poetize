Walking alone along an endless road
Sometimes the meanings re misunderstood
Always doing the opposite of what you should
Everyday gets you further from the truth
It's not what you give, it's what you lose
The world will turn you sick and crazy
Until all you feel is one shade of grey
But can you, can you
Just forget it, forget it
Let it go and watch it burn
Forget it, forget it
And bury it with all that hurts
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
Forget it, forget it
And wipe the tears from your eyes
Forget it, forget it
Learn to live before you die
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
(How long have you waited?)
You might also likeLife's too short to just wish away
Praying good fortune always comes your way
There's no time to run and push it down
Cause everything that matters is right here and now
But will you, will you
Just forget it, forget it
Let it go and watch it burn
Forget it, forget it
And bury it with all that hurts
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
Forget it, forget it
And wipe the tears from your eyes
Forget it, forget it
Learn to live before you die
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
And now that it seems
It seems we've never hurt so much
You know we've never hurt this much
I know you're scared of this
I know you're scared to death
Forget it, forget it
Let it go and watch it burn
Forget it, forget it
And bury it with all that hurts
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
Just forget it, forget it
Let it go and watch it burn
Forget it, forget it
And bury it with all that hurts
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
Forget it, forget it
And wipe the tears from your eyes
Forget it, forget it
Learn to live before you die
You don't have to fake it
How long have you waited?
Forget it, forget it
How long have you waited?
Forget it, forget it
