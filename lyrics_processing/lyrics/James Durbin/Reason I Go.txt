My body and wreckage from all that I gave
For a moment a memory may stick with you, what I do
I only hold space for the moments you save
I'm lost in this hotel, deep in this shiver
I gave them all heart and yet paid for it still
 landscape packed for delivery
Twelve hours to stop till we do it then
Fly me from Boston to DC to Nashville
Nashville to Dallas and New Mexico
I can't tell you the miles, the numbers don't matter
The things that I do is the reason I go
Just bridges and terminals, windows and aisle seats
Sendin' my thoughts in the millions of ways
Throw me around and you'll leave me for hours
Feels like I've been gone for some weeks, not days
My father was fire, he couldn't be handled
Burned out before he could ever explode
My babies are everything to me that matters
I know that your daddy never wants to leave home
The thing that I do is the reason I go
Fly me from Boston to DC to Nashville
Nashville to Dallas and New Mexico
I can't tell you the miles, the numbers don't matter
The things that I do is the reason I go
You might also likePacked up and unpacked, the kiss you've been missin' too much
I hold regrets but I'll never lose hope
One day we'll ride up and my loves will be there
The reason they are'll be the reason I go
Fly me from Boston to DC to Nashville
Nashville to Dallas and New Mexico
I can't tell you the miles, the numbers don't matter
The things that I do is the reason I go
I can't tell you the miles, the numbers don't matter
The things that I do is the reason I go
