This for my nigga, my round, my woadie, my killer, my thug, my nigga, my love
My cock it back ready to bust
Since we was small, look you was around nigga
You on papers , I took the charge cause I'm down nigga
When we was broke, we cocked it back and we was blastin'
When we could smoke, we pulled off with yo sacks, laughin'
If we get chose, ge goin' on the same line
Boxin' at the same time, you my thug and I ain't lyin'
Let me fuck your main line, you don't cherish it
When beef kicked off you the first one hollerin' bury this
Look, I'll tell you this, if you cross 'em I'm gon' bank a bitch
If four niggas go on this lick, two of them ain't gon' get shit
My woadie, my round, my vick, kick our door together
We pull out bread and score together
Go to the head to blow together
Un-click it, ain't no level my partner, my friend
If your high don't kick in, I'll give you my last shot of Gin
Look

And when I give you, you ain't gotta pay me shit
One of our dawgs go sour you holler, "We can take the click"
Thug love made us thick, that's why we roll solo
Smoke Doe Doe, drink Hen' like hot cocoa while hoes pop a photo
Was down bad with no goal for some cash
You watch out while I hit his stash
I'm gon' give you half
And jump on the slab hopin' today they make me boss
We come up together so it ain't shit to take a loss
On your chest, take it off and we gon' handle that
Collect calls, I answer that, your bail, I handle that
Look, I cock and bust with this nigga
Get full of that dust with this nigga
Drop my nuts with this nigga
'Cause I got love for this nigga
Put my trust in this nigga, he ain't never sold out
Hollerin' fuck all that chillin', mane, let's cut down the whole house
He know what them four's bout
Take my side, right or wrong

If you my nigga you my nigga then
