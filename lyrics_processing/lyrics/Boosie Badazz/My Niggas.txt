Boosie Bad Azz
(Now) If you love yo nigga, Hug yo nigga (hug yo nigga)
Look em' dead in the eye

Tell that nigga you love em' (you love them)
We started out
Smoking weed in the park
Visine in our eyes
Tryin make it home foe dark
Flippin off the clothes line, holes in our jeans
Fuckin wit these hoes mind, on the trampoline
Trippin off that purple haze, tryin get it off
Gotta find a junkie
At the bottom mad dog
All fights was crowd fights, coming up in the streets
And even if you right or wrong it on mane its beef (off top)
I cut class wit this nigga
Act a ass wit this nigga
Off that hide-go-get
Unless them hoes suckin dick
Feeling like the shit on the first week of school
Till ya clothes run out now you acting a fool
Member when we first started grindin'
They was giving us hell
All the OG's was hatin tryin hog all the sells
But the OG's started chosen
We busted the hood open
And my niggas they keep a nigga rollin
