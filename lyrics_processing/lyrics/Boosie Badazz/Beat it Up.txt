I know lately that we ain't did much
But on my mama girl I promise

I know you sick of all them bitches
With them rumors and lies
But however against the weather

And I'mma beat that pussy up, beat that pussy up
Girl I'mma beat that pussy up until you holla that's enough

My juvie in tha yard wit my draws in her hand
My girl looked at me and said
