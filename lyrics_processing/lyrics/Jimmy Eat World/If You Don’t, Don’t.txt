What's wrong baby?
Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it?
For every penny that you could?
We once walked out on the beach and once I almost touched your hand
Oh how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend

Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

If you don't, don't know, why'd you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't

I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

If you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did, did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't
If you don't well, honey, then you don't


So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back
If you don't don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean the please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now, now need this, need this
If you don't well, honey, then you don't
If you don't know, honey, then you don't
And if you don't well, honey, then you don't
