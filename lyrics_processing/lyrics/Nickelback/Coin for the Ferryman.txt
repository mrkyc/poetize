Flying down the highway like a bat out of hell
My buddy Bradley's in the middle
Darcy's lookin' out the window
We just got high and hopin' no one can tell
But with the icky of the sticky
It don't matter where the wind blows

Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
Cause you know momma's gonna hate that

The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In three, two, one

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
See Nickelback LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low out on the backroads
The city lights are glowin' over the hill
And we can make it, but we take the chance of never coming back home

The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In three, two, one

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
One for the road and one for those in heaven
One for the lord and take it from the devil
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide
Better run, better run, better run

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know (one thing I know)
We're smokin' dynamite (smokin' dynamite)
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
A thousand fahrenheit
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
