She's tough no doubt
She'll eat you up and spit you out
Her club, downtown
Gonna need a lot of credit if you're hanging out
Top shelf, top floor
I'm like a kid in a candy store
Resist? What for?
You know you're coming back for more

Skinny little Missy don't want no boyfriend
Skinny little Missy don't waste no time
Her pretty little face will never grace your bedroom
'Cause skinny little Missy is a friend of mine
Skinny little Missy don't want no boyfriend
Skinny little Missy don't waste no time
Her pretty little face will never grace your bedroom
'Cause skinny little Missy is a friend of mine

It ain't cheap, I ain't lyin'
Strikes pain to hear the price
What's free? My advice
Need the wallet of a baller for this appetite
Unsafe and unwise to be going after mine
Long list, long line
Fallin' for her every night
