He was my best friend
Well, I tried to help him
But he traded everything for suffering
And found himself alone
I watched the lying turn into hiding
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips were melted to the bone

But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now

Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
A gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
To get high-igh, -igh, -igh (High-igh, -igh, -igh)

Three days no sleeping
Well, he gave up eating
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing
And pretended not to know
He started stealing, to supply the feeling
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife
And held it to her throat

Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
A gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
To get high (High)
Tell me what you did, where you gone and hid?
Show me is what you really want, watching what you've got
Slowly
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high (High)
High-igh, -igh, oh
