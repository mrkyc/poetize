Let's get this circus on down the road
We're takin' bets how far a tank of gas will go
Call up your best friend, then call two more
About to do some shit that you ain't seen before
There ain't no backdoor, there ain't no sign
Location changes almost every other night
Last time we found it, can't remember much
I thought I was a God until my lawyer woke me up and said

I testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?

Got out on bail, we hit the town
Somebody told me we should burn it to the ground
Too many favors, too much to drink
Come 6 AM, they had me back inside the clink

I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?

Tough to find, a goddamn alibi
Wrong or right, it's tough to justify
Can't dismiss, too many witnesses
When insanity's the pattern, it don't matter what it is

I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
