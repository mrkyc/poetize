Lying awake, did it again for Christ's sake
Shoulda told her to go, and I know it
But she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
I did what I did, can't say "hey man, I'm just a kid."
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
Cause she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home

Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home

The pain in my heart's 'cause we're a thousand miles apart
I've got no one to blame for the shame
'Cause she's waiting back home
I hope she's waiting back home
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home
I hope there's someone back home

Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home

I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore
Must have known all along I was wrong
Cause there's no one at home
No one's waiting back home

Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
