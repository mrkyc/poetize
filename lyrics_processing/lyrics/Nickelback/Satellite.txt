I know it's late, but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warnin'
And I'm tired of ignorin'
All the space that's between you and I

Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait

While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go 'til the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night

Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)

Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means

Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait

While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go 'til the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night

Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
I can't believe the days turn into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight, the sand is stoppin'
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay inside this atmosphere

Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
