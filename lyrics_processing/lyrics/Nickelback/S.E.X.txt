"No" is a dirty word, never gonna say it first
"No" is just a thought that never crosses my mind
Maybe in the parking lot, better bring your friend along
Better off together than just one at a time

S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
'Cause that's the one you really want
(Yes!) Sex is always the answer; it's never a question
'Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's yes
Not just a suggestion if you ask the question
Then it's always yes, yeah!

I'm loving what you wanna wear, I wonder what's up under there?
Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?
I'd love to try to set you free, all of you all over me
Love hearing the sound you make the second you're done

S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
'Cause that's the one you really want
(Yes!) Sex is always the answer; it's never a question
Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's yes
Not just a suggestion if you ask the question
Then it's always yes, yeah! (Yes)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
