She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, "What's wrong with right here on the counter?"

Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola rollercoaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola rollercoaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to

She keeps me up (I keep you up)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
All night (All night)
All night (All night)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
All night (All night)
All night (All night)

I need her so bad
Sometimes I think that I can taste it
This evil romance
So good I never wanna waste it (Yeah)
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
And I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces
Come on

Gotta be a better way to come down
I've gotta stay awake somehow
