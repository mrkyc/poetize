There was nothing I could do to make you stay
I just wish all this pain would go away
I guess I never knew what happiness really was
If I did, I'd choke it down, I'd take it like a drug
I guess I never knew that it would hurt so much
If I did, I'd spit it out, and never feel your touch
I guess I'll never know what it's like to find
That perfect match to live up to this life of mine

This is a song about another broken heart
I wish I knew, I wish it ended from the start
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, I wish I never met you
To all the nights that I lay awake in bed
Tossing, turning, thinking what if I was dead
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, all I really need is you

And I need you now

Now your image seems to slowly fade away
I just wish my pain would do the same
I guess that now I know how misery really feels
It's a fact, like heart attack, I have fallen off track
I guess I never knew that I would feel so numb
But I stayed, I wouldn't run, and you just gave up
You gave up everything, just threw away our dream
Now looking back, we were never meant to be

This is a song about another broken heart
I wish I knew, I wish it ended from the start
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, I wish I never met you
To all the nights that I lay awake in bed
Tossing, turning, thinking what if I was dead
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, all I really need is you

And I need you now
But all you bring is pain
My heart bleeds in vain

This is a song about another broken heart
I wish I knew, I wish it ended from the start
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, I wish I never met you
To all the nights that I lay awake in bed
Tossing, turning, thinking what if I was dead
I never meant for my actions to abuse you
On second thought, I never really needed you
