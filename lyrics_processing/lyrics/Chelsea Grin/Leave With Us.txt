Planet Earth is about to be recycled
Your only chance to survive
Or evacuate is to leave with us

Leave with us
We are the vessel, we are the light seeds
We may forever leave this rock
Hail the forever presence, this is what you've been waiting for
Studied for years, this ancient presence will show its face

As it paints across our sky
Why stay and suffer with your kind?
Won't you?
Won't you join and leave with us?
Here, before your eyes
This holy moment
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Leave with us
Won't you join and leave with us?
Here, before your eyes
This holy moment
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
You might also like
Do you understand? Are you even listening?
This is the moment I will finally witness
I will finally witness
We all will witness

As it paints across our sky
Why stay and suffer with your kind?
Won't you?
Won't you join and leave with us?
Here, before your eyes
This holy moment
Can you feel it?

I can feel it
I can see it
I can taste it
This holy moment
Do you feel it? (I can feel it)
Do you see it? (I can see it)
Do you taste it? (I can taste)
This holy moment

Come and take us
Come and take us
Leave with us
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
End of suffering, this is the end
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
End of suffering, this is the end
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
This will be the end of all suffering
