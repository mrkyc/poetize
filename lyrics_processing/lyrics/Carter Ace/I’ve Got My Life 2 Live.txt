Yeah, yeah
Have you ever been so sad that you can't perform
And you can't pretend
Everything's all good when you're 'round your friends
And they call you up, but you don't respond
'Cause you took too long at the ringer
You're holdin' your finger up to the slidin' bar
'Til it disappear from your talking box
Now your phone is clear, but your conscious not
When you're thinkin' hard and it's hard to stop
When you fear that your life's at a constant stop
And you say you're fine, "No, I swear I'm fine"
"Bro, believe I'm fine," but we know you're not
And your girl or boy tryna cheer you up
With a lukewarm talk and a thick ass blunt
And you feel so rushed to be up again
But the last thing you wanna do is pretend

'Cause I want that brand new whip, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I want a brand new crib, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I wanna run this shit, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
Y'all can't tell me a damn thing 'cause
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live, life to live
You might also like
Mmm, yeah-yeah, life to live
I got to work like twice to live
Twice as hard as this dead end job
While I'm findin' days to have nights to live
Gotta find my own rights to live
Tryna find my own way out, lookin' for a pay out, but
I be gettin' pay cuts I don't want you takin', don't take no more
Yeah, I ain't one for the bitterness on the internet
I been on and off
Spendin' time on the better things
So I can't complain 'cause I'm movin' on
Hard to say where I'm movin' next
If I'm doing shows for these student loans
And the friends I knew, I don't know at all
And I'm I'm not involved, I don't know 'em, nah
Some of you talkin' like you used to know me
Surrounded by phonies that's actin' like homies
And I should have known from the things that you told me
Remindin' me not to be close to nobody
And I don't got no trust no more, I don't have fun no more
I just got enemies, they wanna end of me
They wanna see me go down, but then I bring my ass up

'Cause I want that brand new whip, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I want a brand new crib, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I wanna run this shit, yeah (Yeah)
I've got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
Y'all can't tell me a damn thing 'cause
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live (Yeah-yeah)
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live
I got my life to live, life to live
I got my life to live
I got my life to live
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live
I got my life to live
I got my life to live
I got my life to live, life to live, life to live
You tell us we've got our lives to live
Creators need to hear that
We be gettin' so caught up in perfection
We forget to live and enjoy the space we're in now
We've got our lives to live
