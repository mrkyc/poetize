Uh, everything that you gotta know
From my big brother D, to my little brother, Note
Started rapping when I got my mic at nine years old
Now I'm touring places that I've never even heard before
Called my mom and said I got off stage
She called me back and said, boy, you need straight A's
High school's a jungle, try not to get phased
Until you go to church and you try to get praise
Man I always with the government
Paying these bills that I never spent
Paying for cars that we never rent
Paying for dents, that we never dent
I dont think you've ever suffered
But when I suffer, I get a little tougher
Getting a little tougher kinda made me buffer
And getting a little buffer kinda made me rougher
Ain't no LeCrae, I dont wear Church Clothes
I ain't no play-er, I dont hang with hoes
Never had a father figure to hold my hand
And if you are a father, try harder to be a dad
Amen

I ain't never had thoughts to die
Cause I feel so damn alive
So damn alive
I ain't never had thoughts to die
Cause I feel so damn alive
So damn alive

Uh, everything that you gotta know
From my big brother D, to my little brother Note
From my baby sister J, to my little brother Steve
Now you know, it's better yet not to mess with me
Look at me now momma, I ain't what I used to be
I think that I'm a man but you think that I'm a wannabe
I wanna be that best, suprised, dont be
Its kinda sad that you didn't know that old me
The old me was wise, and could've been a minister
The new me is mean, the new sinister
At school I only acted like a thug
And then I go to church and expect to get, love from above?
God I think I made a fool f my self
Trusting my self and not trustin' on anybody else
But, I'm just a paper and a pen
And God is writing these hits for me, over and over again
Amen

I ain't never had thoughts to die
Cause I feel so damn alive
So damn alive
I ain't never had thoughts to die
Cause I feel so damn alive
