Start my day on my phone (Ooh)
There's no way I'm gon' talk (Huh)
I don't want you involved (Yeah)
Put my records on play (Ooh)
Cigarettes on the lawn (Yeah)
Stuff my head in my palms

There's a reason I'm lonely
Need more people to love me (Ain't that some shit? Yeah)
I don't want any company (Huh)
Did I mention I was too-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh down?

Don't know how to communicate but I'm cool with that (Yeah)
I be ridin' alone (Yuh)
For the girls in my car (What?)
I don't drink, I don't smoke (Ooh)
But my friends do the most (Do the most)
And I live on my own

There's a reason I'm lonely
Need more people to love me (Ain't that some shit?)
I don't want any company
Did I mention I was too-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh down?
