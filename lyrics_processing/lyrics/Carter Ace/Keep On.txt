Okay, I never doubted me, I knew I'd be just who I choose to be
So now I double down on who I care about and I choose to see
My calendar is taken up by family and music things
So if I add your name up to the wall then be of use to me
I'm fighting with contingencies and loving on consistency
'Cause if I see you trying then that's better than success to me
I'm thinking 'bout rekindling relationships with enemies
'Cause shit don't always gotta be this way, yeah

'Cause I'm a bigger picture, bigger picture nigga
If I'm dealing with you then you real official
If you're dealing with me then it's beneficial
I just hope my loyalty you won't betray, and here I say

Well I'm on the road to a long life
And it's hilly, bumpy, and a long drive
And sometimes the ride'll break, but it's alright
Just keep on, and on, and on, and on (Yeah-Yeah, yeah)

I mean it's dangerous, I mean, it's kind of dangerous
I mean, no workaround like you don't even know what danger is
I mean, I dream a lot, but don't refute that shit for laziness
I mean, my thoughts are racing, got my journal, lotta pages
I mean, I think I'm made for this, I mean, I hope I'm made for this
I mean, I know I'm made for this, I need to have more faith in this
I mean, I know this life I chose'll come a lot of shade to this
I mean, but I know shit don't always gotta be this way, yeah

Okay, I'm on the road to a long life
And it's hilly, bumpy, and a long drive
And sometimes the ride'll break, but it's alright
Just keep on, and on, and on, and on (Look)

This is for them days that you decided to move on
This is for them days you get inspired on your own
This is for them days that you wake up from that alarm
Knowin' that they don't appreciate you at that job
This is for them days you didn't know you'd live at all
Thank you for them extra days you let us be with y'all
This is for them days where all them people let you fall
This is for them days we keep calm and carry on (Yeah-Yeah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
