Yeah, yeah (Eh-yeah, eh-yeah)
I remember back before you met me
I was doing plenty, doing plenty, doing plenty (Doing plenty)

Yeah, I was plottin' plenty, talking plenty, fucking plenty
Fucking plenty, didn't know who could protect me, 2022 especially
Kicked my ass and tumbled me around 'til I was bruised and empty
Felt like God was sendin' demons out to ridicule and test me (Yeah)
No wahala, walahi, I can't be movin', even slightly under perfect
I been on my purpose since they closed that blue curtain
And they had my mama screamin', "push," around a few surgeons
Not there yet, but I'm workin' on it (Woah)

Started flying more, avoiding more, and talking less
I slept on the floor, I hated sleeping on my bed
Money started talking to me more than some of my friends
Do you get me? Need someone like you to check me

I was not a rookie when you met me
I was doing plenty, doing plenty, doing plenty, plenty, uh
I remember back before you met me
I was doing plenty, doing plenty, doing plenty, plenty
I was not a rookie when you met me
I was doing plenty, doing plenty, doing plenty, plenty
I remember back before you met me
I was doing plenty, doing plenty, doing plenty, plenty

Uh, look how far we travelled just to manoeuvre the violence
I'm sittin' in silence, tryna fall asleep to the sirens
What if a diamond is signified by what isn't shining?
What if alignment is only found outside the horizon?
Something inside me ignited that moment I started timin'
These repetitions of lightning, how many fleed and were frightened?
Finding keys just to kite 'em
Need a freedom from vices, I couldn't breathe, I was fightin'
So I could be more enlightened
I'm doing plenty, balancing all the heaviest challenges
I'm neglecting to handle what Heaven sent me
Hate channels your envy, pride channels what's empty
You needed someone like me to check you
Just don't you forget me
