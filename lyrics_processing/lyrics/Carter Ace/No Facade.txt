Love me like your friend, fuck me like your enemy
Call me while you can, when your roommates fall asleep
I condone the nastiness, baby
What's the point of watching and waiting?
Come here right now (Yeah, yeah)
Come here right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love me like you can, fuck me like you envy me
Show me why your friends worry 'bout me gettin' sleep
'Cause I condone the nastiness, baby
What's the point of watching and waiting?
Come here right now (Yeah)
Come here right now

As long as you love me (You love me, you love)
As long as you trust me (You trust me, you trust)
As long as you love me (You love me, you love)
As long as you trust me (You trust me, you trust, ooh)

Now, it's a fucked up situation that can probably get me killed
I keep my heart in isolation, 'cause it's not the time to feel
I barely got bread and my account on froze (Froze)
Late rent and my landlord knows
But I know that when I get up real close, boy, everything goes
Caught in your eyes, caught in your vibe, caught in your spirit
Can't analyze all of your thoughts, I wanna feel it
If I'm payin' the price, I wanna ride, I want it real
I don't care if it's wrong, know that it's right (Right)

You love me, you love, you trust me, you trust
You love me, you love, you trust me, you trust
You love me, you love, you trust me, you trust
