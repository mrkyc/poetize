I don't like memories no more (Slippin')
The fondest things are better to ignore (Slippin')
I just need now, right now
We'll figure all the other shit out
I don't wanna stunt your time but I'm longing for a lasting (You)
Are we good? Are we good? Are we great?
What should I do? Should I move? Should I wait?
I don't see the beauty in sharing pain
But I'm aching
But I've got a fake smile for you
That I put on for the cameras
It's a gift to the senses
I gotta bring 'em all back

Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
Catch you slipping up
Catch you tripping up
Catch you slipping and I hope that you don't trip, no
Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
Slip, slip, slip (Ah)
