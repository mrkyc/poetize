Guess it ain't too bad, I'm feelin' way too good
I'm in the back, relaxing
If I wasn't me, I'd probably feel some type of way (Right)
Thank God I am (Right)
I keep the biggest smile on my face (Right)
I keep the biggest pride on my team (Right)
I got my delegates swarming now (Yup)
They done broke me down every goddamn year
So I'm living in the moment now (Living in the moment now, woo)
And it feels amazing, I'm exterminating
All of the rodents that came to replace me (Fuck it)

I need that fufu, egusi for dinner, and I need a regional bag (Yes)
I need them people with horns on they skull
To take all they energy back (Yes)
I got the city to show me the ropes
And you couldn't take it aback (You couldn't take it aback, yes)
I wasn't taken aback (Yes), you wouldn't give me a bag

But I'm worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it (Ooh-ooh)
Each and every way, yeah, I'm worth it (Worth it), worth it (Worth it, nah-ooh)
Little bit insane, but I'm worth it (Worth it, worth it)
Might not understand, but I'm worth it (Worth it, worth it)
