I thought that I knew you
Thought that you were true too
Why couldn't I have been right, right?
While my spirit wasn't fighting
You were there in hiding
Didn't want to look in the light

While the words have escaped me
The love won't erase me
I just got so, so tired of asking why
While you were acting shady
I realized this shit's crazy
Nothing left to do, but say good-bye, bye, bye

Yeah, I'm already gone
Why are you trying to hold on
Stop trying, baby, it's to late
Yeah, I'm already gone
Guess our love wasn't strong
There's nothing left for you to say

Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Already gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Already gone

Don't want to re write it
Go back and define it
There's nothing here to make me stay
Day by day I'm stronger
My heart shows no longer
There's no guilt standing here in my way

While the words have escaped me
The love won't erase me
I just got so, so tired of asking why
While you were acting shady
I realized this shit's crazy
Nothing left to do, but say goodbye, bye, bye

Yeah, I'm already gone
Why are you trying to hold on
Stop trying, baby, it's to late
Yeah, I'm already gone
Guess our love wasn't strong
There's nothing left for you to say

Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Already gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Already gone
I'm not gonna look the other way
I can't let myself waste another day
I don't hate you, I don't blame you
I just got to know the truth
I don't hate you, I don't blame you
But I know I'm done with you

Ain't coming back, ain't coming back
Ain't coming back, ain't coming back
Ain't coming back, ain't coming back
Ain't coming back, ain't coming back
Ain't coming back, ain't coming back
Ain't coming back, ain't coming back

Yeah, I'm already gone
Why are you trying to hold on
Stop trying, baby, it's to late
Yeah, I'm already gone
Guess our love wasn't strong
There's nothing left for you to say

Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Already gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
