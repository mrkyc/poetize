We don't need no lights
Time to shine like a star
Tell the DJ turn it up
Fellas meet me at the bar
It's Girlicious
We don't need no lights
Time to shine like a star
Tell the DJ turn it up
Fellas meet me at the bar
Nichole:
Inside the last thing
There 'til the weekend
They're tryna throw us out
But you know we ain't leaving
Gotta drink a little more
Till we stumble out the door
And it's the best that we ever had, oh
All:
Grab a girl, grab a guy
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Nichole:
We about to set it off

Slide an ice cube down my neck
