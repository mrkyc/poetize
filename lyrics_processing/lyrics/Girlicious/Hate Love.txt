You know I'll be the one when you want me to
I always get the call when she's done with you
Maybe it's time I opened my eyes
Always feel the fool when you lie to me
You seem to make it up so easily
What's worse is that I let you every time
Natalie:
I wish that I could tell you
All:
You only ever let me down, but what I need from you right now
Just try to look me in the eye and baby tell me
Nichole:
Why do you hate love? (hate hate hate love)
Hate love, hate hate hate love
Hate love, hate hate hate love
(hate hate)
I wonder do you hate love? (hate hate hate love)
Hate love, hate hate hate love
Hate love, hate hate hate love
(hate hate)
Chrystina:
You like to glamour me, baby you do it well
I smile when I'm angry but you'll never tell
I see your lips moving, I don't hear a sound
I think you think I like it when you make me hurt
Sometimes I hate myself because sometimes it works
And I can never bring myself to talk you down

Natalie:
If I wanted this to be something less than rational
Somewhere lost to in between, I could let myself go
Nichole:
Now I need to make this right
Chrystina:
Get myself on track tonight
Nichole:
Before I do something, I might
Chrystina:
Make you wonder why do I?

Hate love, hate hate hate love
