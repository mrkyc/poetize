Take it off, come get it off
Slide down slow, push it up against the wall
All fours, walking like a dog
Dirty, dirty, I came to come hard
Off the meter and my swag off the charts
I'll flick your switch, you're scared of the dark
If you score, gotta hit out of the park
Baby, come and get it, here we are
All:
Don't you wanna ride with it, ride with it
Baby girl she ain't right with it, right with it
Whatcha say? I'm grinding (Natalie: Back it up, back it up)
I'm grinding (Natalie: Back it up, back it up)
Don't you wanna ride with it, ride with it
Baby girl she ain't right with it, right with it
(Hollaback girl) Grinding (Natalie: Back it up, back it up)
I'm grinding (Natalie: Back it up, back it up)
Let it in, bring it down, slide it up, pull it out
You gotta shake it, move it, twist it, push it, pop it to the ground
You gotta shake it, move it, twist it, push it, pop it to the ground
Chrystina:
Swinging low, red light go
Hold tight and ride the rodeo
Write your name on the wall, on the door
Break yourself, forgive me, let go
I'm the sheriff, can I lay down the law?
Quick on the job and bang on your floor
Carnivore I like my meat raw
Baby, come and get it, here we are

Natalie:
I come down like sweat, stain on your mind
How I get it so wet, I be, I be grinding, lock it down, check
I got 'em on rock, pick your new jet
Baby girl I got 'em going berserk, put it in the wizard
Sweet tooth melt in your mouth like dessert
My lips juicy, you gon' want a kisser
And if I let it you cut it like scissor
