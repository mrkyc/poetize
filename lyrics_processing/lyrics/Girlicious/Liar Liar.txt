'Cause I gotta a player on my hands
I gotta a bulljiva on my hands
I gotta faker on my hands
I gotta lil liar on my hands

Hey, shorty, why you ain't tell me you need the soap?
I supply you with sanitizer, you know
I do for you what I do for them girls that be getting
Low low low low, dirty at my show
Still I gotta write them plans, spit fifty grand
You get to know me I can get the liar off your hands
Since I clean you up baby we popping rubber bands
Lil' mama I'm the man, tell me what you're saying

Everybody gets
Gets a fair try
You alright with me
Till you tell a lie
From the top
You seem like a different type of guy
Did your own thing?
I gave it a try
You might also like
Then you
Told me you were catching feelings
Kind of unusual
Normally you don't
Let no woman
Ever see this side of you
And I'll admit
You had me goin'
Thinking that this was the move
Until I seen that girl all on you
Kissing you

Now your bridge is burned
Uh huh, uh huh
I guess I was wrong about him
Uh huh, uh huh
It looks like now I gotta a problem

'Cause I gotta a player on my hands
I gotta a bulljiva on my hands
I gotta faker on my hands
I gotta lil liar on my hands
I told my girls I wouldn't trip
I'm gonna stay calm
I'll just wait till later
Then give him a call
Now he's trying to convince me
That I didn't see what I saw
You're on the defense
'Cause you know you just broke the law

Now you're
Tellin me your all about me
And no other girl will do
But boy one thing about me is
I ain't a fool
But I'll admit you had me goin
Thinking that this was the move
Until I seen that girl all on you
Kissing you

Now your bridge is burned
Uh huh, uh huh
I guess I was wrong about him
Uh huh, uh huh
It looks like now we gotta a problem
'Cause I gotta a player on my hands
I gotta a bulljiva on my hands
I gotta faker on my hands
I gotta lil liar on my hands
