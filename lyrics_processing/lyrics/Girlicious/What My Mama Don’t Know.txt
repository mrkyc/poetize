Let's go
What my mama don't know
What my mama don't know

On the flip, I'm just coming at you
Tryna sing my tune and make your, make your body move
So you can show me what you do
If you feel this beat, then get your booty shaking please
And groove it just groove it baby, groove it just groove it
Cuz' I can keep on going boy I know you're gonna like it all night hey
You can't deny the way this beat just gets your body bouncing
Bouncing with some lettuce and a burger with some thousand island dressing
I reckon that you and me should be dancin' together, together yeah

(What my mama don't know, what my mama don't know)
(What my mama, what my mama, what my mama, mama, mama, mama.)

You wanna kiss me, you wanna love me
I drive you crazy, and I think it's funny
I'm gettin freaky your time to go go
I keep on doin d-doin what what my mama don't know

I've never seen a guy, lookin like that
Hot body and you know he bad
He outrageous and he don't hold back
And he fully equipped Louis Vuitton swag
Sexy, as hell what you need
Anything I want cause I got money
He know I can rock that swing
And I'm never gonna tell my mama I got my own dreams
He seen me riding round the dance floor like a pro
And he know, yeah he know

(What my mama don't know, what my mama don't know.)
(What my mama, what my mama, what my mama, mama, mama, mama.)

You wanna kiss me, you wanna love me
I drive you crazy, and I think it's funny

I keep on doin d-doin what what my mama don't know
(What my mama don't know, what my mama don't know.)
(What my mama, what my mama, what my mama, mama, mama, mama don't know)
On the flip, I'm just coming at you
Tryna sing my tune and make your, make your body move
So you can show me what you do
If you feel this beat, then get your booty shaking please
And groove it just groove it baby, groove it just groove it
Cuz' I can keep on going boy I know you're gonna like it all night
You can't deny the way I get your heart racing
Racing like a speaker hooked up to a nympho taking 808
This record this record my skin is a sin forever forever
(What my mama don't know, what my mama don't know.)
