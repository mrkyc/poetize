Sometimes you don't realize what you mean
Sometimes grass is greener than it seems
Sometimes we don't realize what we're worth
Sometimes we fall so hard that we're numb to all the hurt

Tell me, is there more to me than what you see in magazines?
Tell me if you think I'm what you see

Well, do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see? Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am
Here I am
But do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see? Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am
Here I am

Sometimes I wish I could be like you
Sometimes I need a break just to get me through
Most times I'm in love with the life I live
Most times I got so much more to give

You wanna see what I see? Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am

Take a good look at that face that's in the mirror
'Cause it's the only one you got
You look at me and say, "Damn, I wanna be her"
But, baby, you are everything I'm not

Well, do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am
Here I am
Well, do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see? Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am
Here I am
I don't do it for the fame, do it for the money
Do it for attention, I do it 'cause I love it
There's more to life than the glory and power
You gotta know who you are
I don't do it for the fame, do it for the money
Do it for attention, I do it 'cause I love it
There's more to life than the glory and power
You gotta know who you are

You look at me and say, "Damn, I wanna be her"
But, baby, you are everything I'm not

Well, do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am

Well, do you wanna be me? Here I am
You wanna see what I see? Here I stand
You wanna know what I know? Here I am

I don't do it for the fame, do it for the money
Do it for attention, I do it 'cause I love it
There's more to life than the glory and power
You gotta know who you are
I don't do it for the fame, do it for the money
Do it for attention, I do it 'cause I love it
There's more to life than the glory and power
