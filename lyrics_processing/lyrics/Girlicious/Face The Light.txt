Dance, d-dance, d-dance, d-dance

Keep it steady, steady rockin'
Don't take your hands off my waist, keep it right there
I wanna feel your body close to mine
You need to press rewind, just love me one more time

Don't hesitate, trying to fake the funk
Tryna' act like you don't like this
You know you wanna fall deep deep in love
So tell me why you're fighting
You know me baby, I'll break it off
Don't disturb this groove, come on
I'm bored, I'm bored but I'm not

I'm not ready to face the light (I'm not ready to face the light)
'Cause I really wanna dance all night (I wanna dance all night)
'Cause I'm sizzling from head to toe
There's a reason why I can't see straight no more
I'm not ready to face the light
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
You might also like
Keep it steady, steady rockin'
Don't tell me that you're tired already
'Cause it's my song, come on, it's lonely on this dance floor
Don't you dare take off yet

Don't hesitate, trying to fake the funk
Tryna' act like you don't like this
You know you wanna fall deep deep in love
So tell me why you're fighting
You know me baby, I'll break it off
Don't disturb this groove, come on
I'm bored, I'm bored but I'm not

I'm not ready to face the light (I'm not ready to face the light)
'Cause I really wanna dance all night (I wanna dance all night)
'Cause I'm sizzling from head to toe
There's a reason why I can't see straight no more
I'm not ready to face the light
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night

Keep it steady, steady rockin'
Keep it steady, steady rockin'
(Keep it steady, steady rockin'
Keep it steady, steady rockin')
I'm not ready to face the light (I'm not ready to face the light)
'Cause I really wanna dance all night (I wanna dance all night)
'Cause I'm sizzling from head to toe
There's a reason why I can't see straight no more
I'm not ready to face the light
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
