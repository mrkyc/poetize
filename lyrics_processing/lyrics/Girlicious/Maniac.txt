Lock me up, lock me up, lock me up up up
Lock me up, lock me up, lock me up up up

I got a love disorder sick from paranoia
'Cause my heart's been broken before ya
I need some anesthetic 'cause I start to panic
When the feelings get too familiar

And then I get that itch and my eyes begin to twitch
Dr. Jekyll Mrs. Hyde
Someone is taking over

The walls are shaking and I'm paranoid
Can someone stop the noise in my head?
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
The clock is ticking I'm about to crack
Just like a maniac on the eh-edge

No-Oh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, A Maniac
No-Oh-Wow-O-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, A Maniac

Psycho-logic could be schizophrenic
But all I know is I don't remember
Where they took my feelings, lost 'em in the whispers
Is it cold 'cause I got the shivers?

Can't feel my finger tips, seein' things that don't exist
Dr. Jekyll Mrs. Hyde
Which one is taking over?

The walls are shaking and I'm paranoid
Can someone stop the noise in my head?
Wow-Oh-Wow-Oh
The clock is ticking I'm about to crack
Just like a maniac on the eh-eh-eh-edge

No-Oh-Wow-O-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, A Maniac
No-Oh-Wow-O-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, A Maniac

Wah, Wah, Wah, Wah
I need a doctor
Ra, ra, ra, ra
C-C-C-Crazy
La, La, La, La
There goes the neighborho-uh-od
The neighborho-uh-od
They should
Lock me up, lock me up, lock me up up up (Uhh-oohh)
Lock me up, lock me up, lock me up up up (Ohhhh)

The walls are shaking and I'm paranoid (Para-nooooo-id)
Can someone stop the noise in my head?
Wow-Oh-Wow-Oh
The clock is ticking I'm about to crack (About to crack)
Just like a maniac on the eh-edge

No-Oh-Wow-O-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, (Ohhhh-Woow) A Maniac
No-Oh-Wow-O-Wow-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-O-Uh-Oh-Oh-Wow-Oh-Wow-Uh-Oh, (Ohhhh-Woow) A Maniac (A Maniac)
