Don't know who I am no more
For you I try to change
Keep messing with my head
Wanna be myself instead
It has been too hard on us
Thought we were so in love
But I was wrong
You didn't want what I wanted
And I've had enough

Had enough of playing games
The lies you said
The reason that I must let go
The things you put me through
You may never know
I know why it's taking all of this time
You're the reason why I cry
Now I know why I can't see

I can't see the girl you want me to be
When I look in the mirror
You don't know what you want so I'll leave
I have got to be me
Cuz what you want isn't me in the mirror
You might also like
You say you love me but
I think you see someone else
Always reminding me
That I'm not perfect enough for you, boy
I deserve so much more
I can't keep you happy
If I ain't' happy myself

Had enough of playing games
The lies you said
The reason why I must let go
The things you put me through
You will never know
I know why it's taking all of this time
You're the reason why I cry
Now I know what I can't see

I can't see the girl you want me to be
When I look in the mirror
You don't know what you want so I'll leave
I have got to be me
Cuz what you want isn't me in the mirror
I wanna love someone
Who loves me for me, yeah
For me, yeah
I wanna love someone
Who loves me for, for me
I can't see the girl, no
 
I can't see the girl you want me to be
When I look in the mirror
You don't know what you want so I'll leave
I have got to be me
