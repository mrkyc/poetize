Should've said goodbye, every time that I cried
I just couldn't find my way to the door
Should've realized, not pretend that I'm lying
When I knew it wasn't working no more

I used to think without you, there was no me
Suffocate myself to the point I can't breathe
Caught up in your trap, wishing I can just leave
So I've gotta let go, just a bad dream

Shut it down, wake up
It's time I made it about me
I'll see how you do without me
Breaking out your prison and now I'm free, I'm free

You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore
You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore

Always at your side every time we collide
Gotta surrender the war
'Cause I was on your side, you and I, do or die
But I can't take anymore
You might also like
I used to think without you, there was no me
Suffocate myself to the point I can't breathe
Caught up in your trap, wishing I can just leave
So I've gotta let go, just a bad dream

Shut it down, wake up
It's time I made it about me
I'll see how you do without me
Breaking out your prison and now I'm free, I'm free

You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore
You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore

I was scared of letting go, but I can't take this no more
And now I finally know I'm better on my own
This ain't what love's supposed to be, woah

Shut it down, wake up
It's time I made it about me
I'll see how you do without me
Breaking out your prison and now I'm free, I'm free
You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore
You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
You ain't gonna hold me down anymore
You ain't gonna hold me down, you ain't gonna hold me down
