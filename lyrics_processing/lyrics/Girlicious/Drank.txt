In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

I see these boys, and uh, they always think
"If I can hit it, I'd be the dopest"
I look like sex, with no regret
So Mr. Arie, go get me something

You won't get a chance 'less you spend it
Tell the bartender, have him send it
La, la, la, la, I'm still here waiting
Blah, blah, blah, blah, you just keep stuttering

In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask
You might also like
Like "oh my gosh," I think he looks lost
You pay the cost or I ain't going near that box
Until the taxi, until I'm tipsy
If you can't please me, then I'll be saying "next," peace

Jump on it, time is tickin'
If you don't come quick, I'll be bouncin'
La, la, la, la, I'm still here waiting
Blah, blah, blah, blah, last call is coming

In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask
Five, four, three, two, one

You wanna holla, so spend that dollar
Give me some alcohol, oh, yeah
I'm so impatient, boy, I ain't playing
No
Patron, yo no se porque no tengo un bebida en mi mano
Yo no se, diga me porque

In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

What the? Where is our drink?
I don't know, Nic
I don't know girls, I have no clue
What is taking so long?
So bullshit, Nat
I wanna drink
He was cute...
Wait, wait is that...
Ay, yo, yo, yo, shawty, here's your drink
Finally!
Finally you bring the...
You took forever, you idiot!
Aw, my God
Oh my God, all over my shoes
He spilt it
Are you serious?
We need to leave right now, valet!
