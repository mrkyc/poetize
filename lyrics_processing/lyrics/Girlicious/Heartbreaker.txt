Listen
Don't be mad at me
The tables are turning

I'm driving lone
And that is who
With the pedal to the floor
With the pedal to the floor
It's 2 A.M
I can't believe
What you did and said to me
What you did and said to me

I'm gonna get up dressed for nothing
I'm gonna go show up for cover tonight
I'm leavin', babe
Believe it, babe
Believe it, babe
I've got my heart set, I'll burn it
I'm gonna laugh 'till it's hurting, oh, yeah
'Cause I need you, babe
Believe me, baby
Baby

Time to leave me by myself
Time to leave my ass alone, yeah
Don't like the flowers that you sent
You just send them, where you've been?
Send them to your new girlfriend
I'm gonna get up dressed for nothing
I'm gonna go show up for cover tonight
I'm leavin', babe
Believe it, babe
Believe it, babe
