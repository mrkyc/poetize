The left held it tight
And you hold in your hand our love
You let it fall from the right
I fell for the love and it cost me
Another painful night
This time I'm afraid you lost me
And without a fight
Girl, it's so strange
Now my life's rearranged
How you want to say goodbye again
Oh, oh, girl, it's so strange
How your feelings can change
Are they real, are they only pretend
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
You might also likeOh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
And now that you have my heart
You walk away
One thing we never learned
Is how to make love stay
Oh, love is a lethal weapon
If you use it wrong
You carry with you my affection
But it's true, we don't belong
Girl, it's so strange
Now my life's rearranged
How you want to say goodbye again
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand
Oh, you held in your hand a diamond
The left held it tight
Oh, you held in your hand our love
It fell from the right
In closing, I remind you
Don't be callous with a heart
Love is just one step behind you
