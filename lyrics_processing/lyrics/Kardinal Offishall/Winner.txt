:
I feel, so good inside
You're my elevation
I need you in my life
I feel, like you're my fire
Addicted to your touch
You are my one supplier
:
Occupied with your love, ohhh
Put in work to get fly, ohhh
Friday night I got money
Just enough to get by, ohhh
I can't stop this feeling
I see how they try though
Letter to the one I love
:
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh

Walking like a champion 'cause I'm feeling so great
Que te tengo everyday
Tu amor me eleva por las nubes
Y me sube (yo yo yo yo yo)
Y eres lo que nunca tuve
No lo dudes (yo yo yo yo yo Joey)
