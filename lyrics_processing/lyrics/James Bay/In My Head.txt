I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget

I'm fed up with this profile
I don't sleep, I'm obsessed
I get worn out by my words
'Cause they sounded so good in my head

I'm confused and I'm lonely
So is everyone else
Where are you in this ocean
Of static and nothing much else?

I swear I got somethin' worth heart
I know you could find it

Say that you can see me, I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist, I'm in your atmosphere
I'm going out my mind
You might also like
I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget

I feel so lost in this city
In all its traffic and tricks
As if we didn't have enough
Of our own problems to fix

And now we're lost and lonely
I'll be lost 'til you want me
Take me home, take me home, take me home
I'll go

Say that you can see me, I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist, I'm in your atmosphere
I'm going out my mind

I'm gonna get you in my head whether I like it or not
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I swear I got somethin' worth heart
I know you could find it

Say that you can see me, I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist, I'm in your atmosphere
I'm going out my mind

I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
