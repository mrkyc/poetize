Hold onto something, I can feel the floor leavin'
We're done with coming up and way past comin' down
My body shakes, a part of missing you
I know you miss me too, I know you do

Is it a sane desire?
Is it insane to try?
We let this runaway train catch fire (I don't care)
I don't care, all I want is you

We can try to stop this bruising, we can be like novocaine
There's a high we keep on choosing, we don't wanna change it
Everybody calls us foolish, they don't know how foolish tastes
Every time we try to fight it, we just end up wasted (wasted)
Wasted on each other
Wasted on each other

Put your hands up!
We've both got people tryna creep in, policing
Since when was this thing so indecent?
Stop acting like everything's understood
I know you miss me, too
You might also like
We can try to stop this bruising, we can be like novocaine
There's a high we keep on choosing, we don't wanna change it
Everybody calls us foolish, they don't know how foolish tastes
Every time we try to fight it, we just end up wasted (wasted)
Wasted on each other

You build me up and in the same breath you knock me down
You turn me on, and just as quick, you might kick me out
Can't find a way to get away
So we might as well stay for another night

We can try to stop this bruising, we can be like novocaine
There's a high we keep on choosing, we don't wanna change it
Everybody calls us foolish, they don't know how foolish tastes
Every time we try to fight it, we just end up wasted
We can try to stop this bruising, we can be like novocaine
There's a high we keep on choosing, we don't wanna change it
Everybody calls us foolish, they don't know how foolish tastes
Every time we try to fight it, we just end up wasted
Wasted on each other

Wasted on each other
