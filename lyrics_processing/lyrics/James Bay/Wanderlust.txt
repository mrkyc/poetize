You get me high and low
No matter where I go, you're the first thing on my mind
We started to fade
I know I was supposed to call, I wasn't alone
And it was late in different time zones
You've got eleven, I was on your side
I was only waking up
I just need to see you, need to feel that rush
Again and again and again

Come on over and mend my heart

I didn't want to be here
I didn't want to be here without you
Want to be here
But everyone of us, every one of us got wanderlust

You get me high and low
I don't wanna fill this space
You're still the best I loved
And I'm still on the outside
You might also like
Standing on a corner in the rainy, hot night
Wonderin' if you were at home
My pockets full of someone else's cigarettes
And I don't even smoke (I don't even smoke)

Come on over and mend my heart
Come on over and mend my heart

I didn't want to be here
I didn't want to be here without you
Want to be here
But everyone of us, every one of us got wanderlust (Got wanderlust)

I just wanna be in
Be in the light, light that surrounds you
I just wanna be in
Be in the light, be in that light
I just wanna be in
Be in the light, light that surrounds you
I just wanna be in
Be in the light, be in that light
I just wanna be in
Be in the light, light that surrounds you
And I just wanna be in, be in the light
You get me high and low
We're always out of time
I didn't want to be here
I didn't want to be here without you
Want to be here
But everyone of us, every one of us got wanderlust

Every one of us got wanderlust
Every one of us got wanderlust
Every one of us got wanderlust
