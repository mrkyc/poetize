Blue is all I've ever really known
Playing records that I couldn't own
Walking fast into the ticket line
Walking slow to save a lonely night

I'm sweeping up at 9 a.m
Unable to pay my rent
Across the bar, beneath the mess of alcohol and cigarettes
There's ten more hours of life I missed
But I don't even need them back because I found you

I found you
I can't believe I get to know you
Woah, I can't believe I get to show you
I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you

Early mornin' in the market place
Freezing rain falling in my face
Heavy sky on the same old town
Heavy head, I'm slowly breaking down
You might also like
I'm sweeping up at 9 a.m
Unable to pay my rent
And across the bar, beneath the mess of alcohol and cigarettes
There's ten more hours of life I missed
But I don't even need them back because I found you

I found you
I found you
I can't believe I get to know you
Woah, I can't believe I get to show you
See, I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
'Til I really found you

When I found you
When I found you
There wasn't nothing left that wasn't love
Sinking deeper, sinking like a stone
When I found you
When I found you
I needed you more than I'll ever know
Slippin' deeper, deeper
I can't believe I get to know you
No, I can't believe I get to show you
I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you
'Til I really found you
I can't believe I get to know you
No, I can't believe I get to show, show you
I had no one
I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you
