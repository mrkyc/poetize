I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Started speeding now, beating half to death
'Cause you're here and you're all mine
I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to perfect
It can wait for a while

Scared of the hope in my head
It's been making me sweat, but it turns out
You're here with your head on my chest
I should've guessed

That the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete

I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow up against my skin
Let it all feel just right
You might also like
Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and we move on
All of the hurt gets left
I should've guessed

That the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This, here, now, it's where we
Touch down, you and me
Let's be incomplete

How'd we ever go without?
I don't know, but it looks like we've made it again
Tell me you'll never look down, down

'Cause the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incom...

I don't want to look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now
I don't want to look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now
And the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
And this, here, now, it's where we
Touch down, you and me
