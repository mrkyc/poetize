I've been looking all night
Watching them empty out
Invisible to this crowd
Always double vision
I've been losing my mind
Listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats
It's a lonely picture

And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can

As I'm sweeping up glass
I see the exit light so green
These people falling into the street
Something comes together
I've been here too long
And if I stay they'll tie me down
I know this chance won't hang around
So I'm gone forever
You might also like
And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can

Packing up my suitcase, racing down forgotten street
Making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
If you find me, you will find me on the run
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round their shopping carts
I've seen the greener grass, I've seen the faster cars
And I don't need your happy hours, I don't need your lonely bars
I'm ejecting like a bullet from a gun
So take your final look at me, maybe even take my hand
Standing on the staircase, come and chase the master plan
The long awaited getaway, play it like a grand slam
This is no encore, we have only just begun

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
