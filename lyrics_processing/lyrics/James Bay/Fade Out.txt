Tell me what this is for you
'Cause you only text me after 2
I wanna just be done with you
But I call you back 'cause I'm a fool
Come get me when your promises come true
Until then I'll keep driving out to you

You say nothing all night
I'm back burning, don't lie
All night, all night
You give me nothing, act shy
Tell your friends, I don't mind
All night, all night
Then we get drunk and repeat

If I got a little higher, every time our plans fell through
I could touch the moon
You try so hard to play this bullshit game
One night you even straight forgot my name

You say nothing all night
I'm back burning, don't lie
All night, all night
(Tell me what this is for you)
You give me nothing, act shy
Tell your friends, I don't mind
All night, all night
Then we get drunk and repeat
You might also like
You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out
You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out

You say nothing all night
I'm back burning, don't lie
All night, all night
You give me nothing, act shy
Tell your friends, I don't mind
All night, all night
Then we get drunk and repeat

You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out
You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out
It's happened again, it's happened again, it's happened again
I let you play me
I let you play me out
It's happened again, it's happened again, it's happened again
I let you play me
I let you fade me out
It's happened again, it's happened again, it's happened again
I let you play me
