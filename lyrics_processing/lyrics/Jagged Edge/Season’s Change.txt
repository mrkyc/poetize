Now when the seasons change
Hope we don't stay the same
Oh, we could use a break from the hurt and pain
When the seasons change, I know we can do the same
We can shed our leaves, with some light, we can grow today
When the seasons change
Winter, spring, summer, to the fall
Baby, by now we've been through it all
It ain't no summer if you be gone
And I know that we both can change, yeah

Oh-woah
Said we need a change, yes
Oh-woah
Said we all can change, yes
Oh-woah
Don't be afraid of the change, no, no
No,no

Never 'til the seasons change as we do too
Nothing remains the same, neither should me and you
Gotta have faith in the way, in the way that he moves
As the seasons change
