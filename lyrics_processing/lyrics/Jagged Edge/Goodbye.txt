(La-la-la-la-la-la)
What may be the best thing for you to do
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Sometimes that's the hardest thing for you to do
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
And that, that's real, 'cause
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
I know I love you, I know how I feel about you
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
But I also know that don't make everything alright
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
And for that reason
(La-la-la)
I gotta say goodbye

Tell me have you ever been in
A situation where the best thing you could do
Was the hardest thing you've ever done?
(The hardest thing you've ever done)
But you try to do what's right
And I know deep down inside
That I really wanna be there by your side
But I can't stand to see you cry
Not when it's because of me
Yeah, yeah yeah
