Know I'm done cheating
And know I'm done creeping
Tryna get it out of my life
Time to get myself right
And I know some gon' be mad
And some people gon' be sad
But they gon' be alright
I think I done found my wife
I won't be the one who's fifty and alone
I'ma have my family by my side 'til I'm dead and gone
Somebody say alright, alright, alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'm so ready to start this life, yeah-yeah

Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I think I'm trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to ring you up
Think I'm, think I'm, think I'm ready to feel your love
Think I'm, think I'm, think I'm ready to be in love
Think I'm ready to be in love, love, love

Girl, I'm done, done misleadin'
My karma took a beatin'
I can't go back and change things that were
Baby, startin' here today
I'm changin' all the ways
I'm racin' fast forward to your love, love, love, love, love
And I won't be the one who's miserable and alone (And alone)
I won't be the one who (I won't), I won't be the one
And I could sing this all life long as you are the song
I never thought I'd hear the words comin' out of my mouth
