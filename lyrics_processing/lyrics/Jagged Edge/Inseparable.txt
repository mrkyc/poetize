We caught it, instant like some Ramen, yeah
We got a lot of things in common, yeah
Before her, just wasn't shit (Nah)
'Cause I was pent up, she made me let it go, yeah
She all I needed now
Ayy, she my heart beating loud
My cutie with me, with me, yeah, oh
Our chemistry, babe, our chemistry, that shit on auto
We clicked so quick like lightning in a bottle, you know
I usually don't even follow
Now she all up in my photos
Me and her, we like inseparable

Know what you got when got that shit
Gotta know when you got that good thing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Know what you got when got that
Better know when you got that good thing
I usually don't even follow
Now she all up in my photos
Me and her, we like inseparable
Oh-ho (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

She came in banging from the door with it
Really had me changing up my flow with it
Came here with a whole new energy
Had me crushing old moves, questioning my energy
'Cause she's so fine, she main, we made it (Made it)
And all the other girls, they remain nameless (Nameless)
And all those secrets, they gon' stay with us
Really gon' ride with me the way I ride with her
Then that shit is dangerous (Our chemistry)
Our chemistry, that shit on auto
We clicked so quick like lightning in a bottle, you know
I usually don't even follow
Now she all up in my photos

Now she all up in my photos
Me and her, we like inseparable
When I first saw her, I thought that my DM's just caught a body, though
Every time that you see 'em, no, that's me, that's just so obvi', though
Still can't even picture myself being with nobody else
The DJ know that after the original, it's probably this
It's probably us
(I didn't mean to make you pay)
And don't worry, baby
I usually don't even follow (Usually don't follow)
