Baby, we'll be the ones to set the example for our love
Everybody wanna know (Know) what the secret is (Is)
How'd you keep the thing goin' up the way y'all did? (Did)
When you know she's the one, grab her, don't let her go
Not for nothin', not for nothin', oh, no, no (Oh, no, no)
I don't wanna overstate again
But you gotta know that she's your friend
You gotta know that she get down no matter circumstances

So we'll be the ones, a walkin' testimony on how far we've come
Couldn't plan on how far we've come (Come)
Couldn't plan on the way I fell or the way I feel, oh

How 'bout this love
When I look at you, girl, I see love, love
How 'bout this love
When I look at you, girl, I see love
Such a blessing for my soul, I found a mate
I'm down on my knees, not beggin' to stay
Love, when I look at you, girl, I see love
Lo-ove, oh, love

What you gon' do when the road get rough?
What you gon' do when the tears get real? (Oh-oh-oh)
I'll be your shelter (Ooh)
'Cause I know the way it feels when you feel you're alone (Ooh)
And I can't let that happen to you, not ever again
I'm a champion lover, I'm there 'til the end, girl (Ooh)
This the type of love that's gonna hold up against (Hold up against)
Any type of thing that we could come up against (Ooh, come up against)

No distractions, ain't no interruptin' this
People said we wouldn't make it, look at us
It's love, love, love
My glass half full, I'm such a effin' optimist
They don't like what we got, that's just some jealousness
It might get bad, it's gon' get better
We goin' down, we in this together
They can call it what they want, girl, I call it love
