I can't go one more day without your love, I'm giving up
Got all my niggas sayin' I'm a punk, and I don't wanna
Feel like I'm chasing, wasting time on you
If you're really through, that's cool
Don't hang up the phone as I pour my soul
It's been about two years, had fears, but, girl, I had to call you
I had to stop my drinking, smoking, even stopped my ballin'
I heard that y'all broke up, hope that you ain't too choked up
One day I just woke on up, baby, can we be tight?

Can we be tight?
I wanna be there for you all I can (Yeah-yeah)
Can we be tight again? (Oh-yeah)
I know you just got over your man (Yeah, woah)
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again? Again, again (Can we be? Can we, can we be, be, baby?)
Can we be tight?
I wanna be there for you all I can (All I can)
Can we be tight again? Again, again
I know you just got over your man (Know that you just got over your man, girl)
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again (Girl, I wanna do all I can)
Can we be tight again? Again, again (Again, yeah-yeah)
