(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
J.E., y'all, yeah
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah
Check it
I'ma send this song out to my dad
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause, uh, one day I came to him
And told him how I was feelin' about this girl
He told me he used to write poetry
So I'ma try to poetically explain how I feel (Ooh)

Girl, you know that you're the apple of my eye
To me, you're like the cherry in my cherry pie
I wake up early like the sunrise
To be there for you when you wake up (Oh, yeah)
And I, I can't seem to get you off my mind
'Cause since the day, we met I've been on cloud nine
I think that's why I didn't recognize
I wasn't putting in enough time (Girl, don't you leave, yeah)

I'm nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you (Girl, it's all you)
I can hardly maintain (You, you, you)
You with no me, the earth with no sea
The birds with no bees
That's the way I'm gonna be (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you (Girl, it's all you)
I can hardly maintain (You, you, you, you)
You with no me, the earth with no sea (Hey)
The birds with no bees
That's the way I'm gonna be without you, oh (Without you, baby)

You're just like a doctor that wouldn't work
I feel more like a fighter 'cause you made me hurt
'Cause I know all things ain't perfect, but in my heart, you're worth it
I hope you change your mind 'cause I'm worthless
Like a football player, put in overtime
Know that you ain't happy, wanna know just why
Give me half a chance, girl
I'm bringing romance, girl (And it's all)

I'm nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you (Baby)
I can hardly maintain (I can hardly)
You with no me, the earth with no sea (The earth with no bees, baby)
The birds with no bees
That's the way I'm gonna be (Ooh)
Nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you (Baby, baby, baby)
I can hardly maintain (Hardly maintain)
You with no me, the earth with no sea
The birds with no bees
That's the way I'm gonna be without you, oh

Ooh, baby, don't you leave
'Cause I'ma try my best to be
Everything that you might need
Tell me, baby, why'd you leave (Why'd you leave?)
Ooh, baby, don't you leave
Said I don't know everything
Just another young nigga from the street
Now I can believe (Just a little young, ooh)
Ooh, baby, don't you leave
'Cause I'ma try my best to be (Ooh)
Everything that you might need
Tell me, baby, why'd you leave (Why'd you leave?)
Ooh, baby, don't you leave (Yeah)
Said I don't know everything (Ooh-ooh, yeah)
Just another young nigga from the street
Now I can believe (Yeah)
I'm nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you (Fire with no flame, baby)
I can hardly maintain (I can hardly)
You with no me, the earth with no sea (Hardly, yeah)
The birds with no bees (Hardly)
That's the way I'm gonna be (And I don't wanna be alone, no, no, no)
Nothing without you
Like a fire with no flame, girl, it's all you
I can hardly maintain (Girl, it's all you, you, you, you)
You with no me, the earth with no sea (Girl, it's all you, you, you, you, you)
The birds with no bees
