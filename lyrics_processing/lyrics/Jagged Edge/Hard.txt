Oh. yeah

Every single night I've been without you, girl, is just so hard
Tryin' to fight myself 'cause I know that I was too hard
I still should've been lovin' you (I should've been lovin' you)
I should've been lovin' you (I should've been lovin' you)
Oh

Girl, it ain't the same
But I gotta get back my name (My name)
I don't put in all my change
Have enough money to get on this plane
And come and get my love
I ain't leavin' 'til I get my love, uh
Can you resist my heart and my soul?

I'm sayin' sorry now (Sayin' sorry now)
But I know that ain't gon' cut it
So I'm changin' now (So I'm changin' now)
Yes, I am (Yes, I am)
