This song goes out to everybody
Who had somebody and you knew they was right
But some kind of way, you messed it up anyhow (Uh)

I remember when we first met
You said you wanted everything
I tried my best to make it happen, but
What you said, you didn't mean, and
Now the tables turned
You feel like your bridges burned
I just tried to be a man, babe
Know you did the wrong thing, girl
You don't understand me
I don't think you heard me

First came the lies, then came the pain
You know you hurt me so bad, baby
But now I see, and now I know
Now I see that you really wasn't ready for me

That you can't handle a true man (Woah)
One who really, really wants to be
You can't handle a true man (I know you can't)
Girl, I give you my cream and everything (Everything)
You can't handle a true man
One who really wants to understand (Understand, oh)
You can't handle a true man
Said I gave you all my lovin', babe
Anytime you want it, babe

I tried my best to treat you right, girl
But you act like you don't like it (Act like you don't, act like you don't like it)
Now I see that we weren't meant to be
Even though I thought that you were made for me
Here I go again, it feels like a lonely sin, that I made
How ya just let me go, baby
And it really, truly hurts so bad
And why you wanna make me so sad? Oh

First came the lies, then came the pain (Ooh)
Why did ya hurt me so bad?
But now I see, and now I know
And now I know you wasn't ready, baby, you can't handle it

That you can't handle a true man (Yeah, oh-woah)
One who really, really wants to be (Really, really wants to be, baby)
You can't handle a true man
Girl, I give you my cream and everything (Girl, I'll give everything)
You can't handle a true man (Yeah)
One who really wants to understand (Girl, I really want you to understand me)
You can't handle a true man (I'm nothin' but a true man)
Said I gave you all my lovin', babe (And I'm nothin', nothin', nothin' but a true man for you)
Anytime you want it, babe (Yeah)
Know when I first saw you, girl
I truly thought that you were the one for me
And one day you finally made me see, baby
Too bad you couldn't handle (Too bad you couldn't handle) all that I had in store
Messed it up the first time and now you want some more (Now you want some more)
Wanting what you like and you ruined my life (Some more)
And now you wanna make it right (Now you wanna make it right)

You can't handle a true man (Yeah, yeah)
One who really, really wants to be (Yeah)
You can't handle a true man (You can't handle the truth, baby)
Girl, I give you my cream and everything (I know you can't, I know you can't handle the truth, babe)
You can't handle a true man ('Cause I'm a true man)
One who really wants to understand (And I thought you was a true woman, yeah)
You can't handle a true man (But I know like you know)
Said I gave you all my lovin', babe (Hey)
Anytime you want it, babe (Baby, come on)

Need a true love, baby, I need a true love
Someone to treat me right
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight
Need a true love, baby, I need a true love (Said I wanna make it right)
You can't handle a true man (Yeah)
Need a true love, baby, I need a true love (Ooh, yeah)
Someone to treat me right (Ooh, babe)
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (Yeah)
Need a true love, baby, I need a true love (Yeah)
You can't handle a true man
You can't handle a true man
One who really, really wants to be
You can't handle a true man
Girl, I give you my cream and everything
You can't handle a true man
