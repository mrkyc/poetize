Yo, sit back, relax
Get your car jacked
Get your car jacked
Get-Get-Get your car jacked
Get your car jacked

I was at the mall
Gettin' fresh for the weekend
When I caught a glance of some heavy tweekin'
Seen her straight from the back
Couldn't wait for this girl to turn around
Eyes was brown
Had the skin perfect match that
She round in the back, you know I likes that
Tryna floss like a movie
Anything so she don't lose me

(I was high)
See I, feelin' so high since I met you
Been on cloud nine since I met you (Since I met you)
Been lovin' my life since I met you
I'm so high, don't wanna come down (Baby girl, I'm so high)
I'm high, high, high (Yeah)
High, high, high
So high, high, high (I'm so high over you, yeah)
I don't wanna come down (And I don't wanna come down)

Towards the end of the fall
Where different color trees is everywhere
It's true beauty, just take a stare
You can't imagine what it's like to see her (See her)
Yes, you can
And when she's gone, I can't wait 'til we meet up
This girl is like my drug, I gotta re-up
'Cause without her, I'm like nothing at all
And she got me feeling

See I, feelin' so high since I met you (So)
Been on cloud nine since I met you (Yeah, yeah)
Been lovin' my life since I met you

High, high, high (I don't wanna come down)

I don't wanna come down (No, no, no)

Now I'm feelin' dizzy, now I'm feelin' shady (Oh)
Like somebody done spiked my drink, lookin' crazy (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Situation that she got me facin' (Facin' this thing and she playin' games with me)
I hope she's choosin' me 'cause I want her really bad
Now you know, I'm feelin' trapped
Like I'm cracked, split open, and roll up, and I feel it and I (And I know it)
I know you got me so high
I don't wanna come down
See I, feelin' so high since I met you
Been on cloud nine since I met you (Baby, no, no)
Been lovin' my life since I met you (I don't wanna come down, baby girl, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
