Man this a hard record
Man, I've been playin' around in these streets so long
I know my girl think that I'd never be ready
But I'ma do all I can to let her know I'm ready
'Cause really, she is worth it

From now on, I'm taking all her calls (All her calls)
From now on, I won't get lost at all (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
My time is runnin' out, I know (Mmm)
And right now, I'm just tryna restore her hope in me
'Cause clearly somebody don' hurt her
And I just wanna be the one who stands between
Anyone that don't do her right
I'd be there like every night
Tryna make these dudes see the light

Hope she don't just see a thug when she sees me (Mmm-hmm)
Hope she can see all this love that I'm filled with (All this love)
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is
Came up with this little plan
Put her hope back in a man
Hope she don't just see a thug when she sees me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hope she can see all this love that we should be (Mmm-mmm)
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is
Came up with this little plan
Put her hope back in a man
