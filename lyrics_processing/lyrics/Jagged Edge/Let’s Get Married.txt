See, first of all
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start? Yeah
When you think about all the years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (We ain't gettin' no younger, girl)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (Feelin' you all the while)
Girl, let's just get married, I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress (Yeah)
We ain't gettin' no younger, so we might as well do it (Yeah)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, and I must confess
Let's get married (Baby, let's get married)

Said I done it all, but frankly, girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause makin' love to just anyone ain't happenin'
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about us finishin' somethin' we started so long ago?
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about maybe us havin' some babies?
Come on, won't you be my lady, forever, girl?
