Man and boy go passing by my window
Stopping to rest for a while
Son says dad there's something on you mind
Tell me now, you know you never could hide it no
Tell me what's been bothering you
He turns to his son with love in his eyes
He's trying to think of a way- he starts to cry
The words just won't come
He says: "son I may not always be here for you
Remember in life, no matter what you do my love
Will always be there to keep you strong. I'd never
Steer you wrong
Chorus
And though the seasons change
Love still remains
Even through the pain
You've got to hold on
Love will always come and find you
And when summer turns cold, and
Back to spring
You never know what life
Is gonna bring remember
Love will break the chains that bind you...
Early on a Friday October night
Man and wife hand in hand walking in front of me
Just out for a stroll
"Tell me girl, cause I know that look...
Somethings wrong I can read you like a book"
You know its true. She says "baby I'll be honest with you"
She turns to her man, with love in her heart. she knows they're young
They've only just got started... what will he think of the news?
She says: "baby you know I'm gonna have your child. so tell me please
What you really feel inside"..
"You know that our love will keep us strong... oh baby go on...
Chorus
December morning its a snowy day
Father and child, they wrestle in the snow
Air filled with laughter and smiles
As the father shields son from the cold
Holding onto each other soul to soul the boy says
"You know its your love that keeps me warm
