I was a fool to ever think that I could run away from you
I broke the rule by running from a love that was true
I know that you have been right there beside me through thick and through thin
Maybe we two can start this love all over again
Let me make a brand new start (wanna make a brand new start)
I wanna open up my heart (let me open up my heart)
I owe it to you 'cause you are what's new in my life
(Girl, you brought the magic) You brought the magic back into my life
(Can't we keep it growing now?) Let's keep it growing 'cause it feels so right
(Want you here beside me each and every night)
Baby, you're the only one
I'm telling you the love I feel right now is love I felt all along
I was confused but now I see that you are the one
I wanna make a brand new start (wanna make a brand new start)
Let me open up my heart (let me open up my heart)
With you by my side, my life will be right once again
Oh baby
