I think I'm crazy living a fantasy
Girl don't love you, mama, she's just on the run
You better wise up, man, you ain't getting younger
Market value ain't getting stronger
Find another woman while the choice is up to you
A special friend of mine, he try advise me all the time
He talk to me 'bout my newfound lady
He say she's just no good, she all around the neighborhood
Do yourself a favor, boy, and let her be
Because the rhyme and the reason don't make no sense to me
I think I'm crazy living a fantasy
Girl don't love you, mama, she's just on the run
You better wise up, man, you ain't getting younger
Market value ain't getting stronger
Find another woman while the choice is up to you
Well, he confide in me, he see me kiss her 'neath a tree
And her smile, it say there is no other
But when he call my name, ooh, she'd nearly go insane
And the boy she with, he'd quickly run away
(She just don't know what to say)
Because the rhyme and the reason don't make no sense to me (oh no)

(Mama wanna run around town all day)
