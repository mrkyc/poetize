I don't wanna live not one day without your love
You know it's special to me, girl
I'm living in a fantasy, baby
You must have floated in on a cloud, just thrill me
Since I picked you out of the crowd
When will we leave this world behind? (this world behind)
I'll never get you out of my mind
You're my angel, loving you is easy
I swear you mean the world to me
You're my angel, every day you please me
We're living in a fantasy, baby
I can tell we were meant for each other
'Cause we never seem to fight like the other lovers
I'll never do you wrong
Can't you see our loving is strong?
Come on, baby, don't make me wait, I need you
Hurry, hurry, why hesitate? I'll please you
I give you loving at night
I'll make sure that everything's right
