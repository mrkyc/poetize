That I was what you needed to complete your life
Love was the key
To lock the doors on all those dark and lonely nights
Tonight, girl, your love's got me running
Is there something funny going down?
Could this be the end I see coming? (Could this be the end?)
Ooh baby, I know you'll come around
(Wait until tomorrow) Oh babe
(Just give me one more night to change your mind)
(Give me one more night to change your mind) Don't tell me it's over, no
(Better wait until tomorrow) Oh baby
(All I need from you is just some time)
I just need a little time (All I need from you is just some time)
I understand
The love you feel you're missing that I owe to you, yeah
Trust in your man (trust in your man)
This is what we need to see this love life through, yeah
Lately I'm staring in the dark, no
I'm thinking that you're gonna leave me
Oh baby, have a heart (don't leave me, baby)
I know, I know you still need me
