Pucker up you pig
Kiss me like I hear they kiss on oil rigs
(You know the drill)
Let's get third world
Me boy with one boom boom stick and you girl
(If you open your mind)
Put me down, draw blood
Like Mel Gibson taught you how to make love
Let the kitty be unleashed
Drop me like an injured wildebeest

Pirate hug, viking grasp
Positions learned in Pol Pot's yoga class
(War crime sex)
Smell the friction like fine wine
Oakland Raiders locker-room sixty nine
Gettin' lucky, then it hurts
Like a Wednesday's child at Joan Crawford's
Missing link, hardcore
Romance they don't even have words for
(Shane Crone got a space-whip)
