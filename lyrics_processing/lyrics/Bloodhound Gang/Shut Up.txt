I'm Jimmy Pop here in a jiffy, heat me up and add oil
I'm like a zit, a wart, a corn, a cyst, a festering boil
I get under your skin and I sebaceously form
I'm as deep as the plot to an amateur gay porn
Keep ya hungry for more like Bangladesh
Then I'll bork a bork a bork ya like the Swedish Chef
'Cause I'm one of a kind and kind of hard to find
Kind of like an Injun without his fire water wine
I'm like Schneider one day at a time
I'm feeling like Bob Vila nailing up your behind
To my wall like Daniel-san does
I'm waxing on I'm waxing off I'm waxing just because
I get wired like a Western Union and I got to be me
And I got more balls than the daily lottery
Like hemorrhoidal itch yo you can't ignore me
'Cause I'm more tongue and cheek than a lesbo orgy

And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me

Second verse is different than the first
I'm Jimmy Pop, I am
Jimmity Jimmity Pop, I am, I am
See my name's not Hoover and I don't give a damn
And I got a different angle like a parallelogram
And you'll be all ears like a field of corn
I'll make you Dizzy like Gillespie as I toot my own horn
Like a No. 2 pencil, I always got a point
You'll want to share it with friends like a poorly rolled joint
I'm Jimmy Pop y'all
I'm Jimmy Pop y'all
I'm an Alka Seltzer that's
Right you're a seagull
As I continue to expand your head is gonna burst
Leave a bad taste in your mouth like moldy liverwurst
Like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'll get in your face
But then I'll brush you off like Aqua-Fresh toothpaste
'Cause I'm letting off steam like a Chinese Laundromat
But I'm not a roll of Charmin so don't give me no crap

And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
I hate a lot of whites and I hate a lot of blacks
I hate poopin' in public places but we all hate that
I hate lesbian feminists 'cause they're all so damn ugly
I hate Spin Magazine 'cause they never ever plug me
And I hate Regis and I hate Kathie Lee
I hate every single movie by that midget Spike Lee
I hate people that think that I care what they think
I hate people that think that their ass don't stink
I hate Jon Bon Jovi but I hate his music more
I hate killing people 'cause I hate to keep score
I hate you but you hate yourself too
I hate to be honest but I'd hate to be you

And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
