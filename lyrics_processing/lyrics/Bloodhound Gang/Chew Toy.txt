Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)

Can't buy love so let's just make it
Jealous of your dog cause he's seen you naked
I'll sniff your rear if I get my paws on ya
Think that's weird, wait till ya hear how we're gonna
Role play The Color Purple
Do shit you'd read in Trent Reznor's journal
Fuck to the sound of a zombie choir
Till your private parts look like they've been in a fire
Turned on but it feels so wrong
Like when you relate to a Nickelback song
Inhibitions gone with the blinds drawn
But you don't mind doing it with the lights on
Cause I bet the kind of love that you'd make to a man
Would look good as a mural on my uncle's van
He rents to own, lent me his cologne
Now I feel like a wolf with a saxophone

You make me looney tunes
I hallucinate
When I see you
I see steak
You might also like
Smirk, nod, wet my lips
Like when a black running back knows how great he is
With an amazing win back in the stadium
Full of motherfuckers that regret trading him
But I digress why's your dress not on the floor
Thighs and breast make the best fried chicken
But yours made the bucket list
Don't know what the fuck that is
Something like a dying wish, wish I was dying with
You on top of me like a fraction
The ten that's over eighteen can't do the math and
Cram time, we got behind, let me school that butt like it's Columbine
So fine, like Charlie Brown's hair
Out to get you over here and in your underwear
Hit that pussy at home like a predator drone
Now I feel like a wolf with a saxophone

You make me looney tunes
I hallucinate
When I see you
I see steak

My jaw hit the floor as someone played a trumpet
My tongue rolled out now ain't that some shit
Heard a fog horn then my heart popped out
It was shaped like a heart what the fuck is that about
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)
Woah uh oh, woah uh oh (oh oh oh)

You make me looney tunes
I hallucinate
When I see you
