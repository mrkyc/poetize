Do you still go to raves?
Do you think Christ saves?
Do you spend your days in a Purple Haze?
Do you contemplate what a grape nut is?
Or could you live drinkin' your own whiz?
Are you hooked on a feeling? Are you hooked on gin-n-tonics?
Are you hooked on fistin'? Are you hooked on phonics?
Did you ever have sex with a box of Kleenex?
Did you like the movie Malcolm X?
Or do you own a record by Stryper?
Do you have a mongoloid cousin wearin' diapers?
Were you born and raised in New Jersey?
Did you like the taste of Crystal Pepsi?
Are you deaf? Well if you are you can't hear me
But what's the use of living if your ears be
Broken? Even if I spoke clearly
You're still not able to hear me

'Cause life is a game that no one wins
But you deserve a headstart the way your life's goin'
So throw in the towel cause your life ain't shit
No take that towel and hang yourself with it
You might also likeLife's short and hard like a body-building elf
So save the planet and kill yourself
If you're feeling down-and-out with what your life's all about
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out

(Lift your head up high and blow your brains out)
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out
(Lift your head up high and blow your brains out)
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out
Does your girlfriend look like the chick from M*A*S*H?
Dead ringer for Klinger with a thicker mustache?
When you're at a get together does everybody always ask
"Ain't no Halloween party, why's she wearin' that mask?"
Does she got more chins than the Chinese phone book?
Would you rather make out with a rusty fish hook?
Does she stick to linoleum when she squats?
Does she look pregnant although she's not?
Did you first see your boyfriend on COPS
Or at a Star Trek convention, or on top
Of your best friend, or maybe at Wendy's
Workin' third shift late New Years' Eve?
Does he live under a bridge, scare kids, and kill squirrels?
Does he do keg stands until he hurls?
Could a blind man mistake his complexion for braille?
Does he have time to sit around and wait for the mail?

Life is a game that no one wins
But you deserve a head start the way your life's goin'
So throw in the towel cause your life ain't shit
No, take that towel and hang yourself with it
Life's short and hard like a body-building elf
So save the planet and kill yourself
If you're feeling down-and-out with what your life's all about
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out

(Lift your head up high and blow your brains out)
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out
(Lift your head up high and blow your brains out)
Lift your head up high and blow your brains out
So take your life, instead of taking it for granted
I'm thinking you should can it I think I'll help you plan it
Live today like it's gonna be your last
Hang out blow your mind have yourself a gas
I hope you take this the wrong way
And misinterpret what I say
Rewind and let me reverse it
Backwards like Judas Priest first did
