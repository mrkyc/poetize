I'm quite the sped, I never shred
Not cool (Not cool)
But my bros all call me Itch (With the silent "B")
But that spells "Bitch" (Fits you perfectly)
Chaz Bono dickbag, word fuck tick
Not cool (Not cool)
And I smell like regret and tequila (What's that even mean?)
I have no idea (You're livin' the dream)

Hey, you
You dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
Hey, you
You dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me

And I dance!
They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your stepdad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules
You might also like
I'm such a tit, I say dumb shit
Not cool (Not cool)
And my friends think that I like men (That's because you do)
Don't even listen to them (No one's judging you)
John Goodman gut, slow kid haircut
Not cool (Not cool)
Do you like Renaissance fairs? (Where'd you get that scarf?)
'Tis what thy lord doth wear (I'll be in the car)

Hey, you
You dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
Hey, you
You dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me

And I dance!
They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your stepdad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules
Dancin' with myself in the dark on the ceiling
Dancin' with myself in the dark on the ceiling

And I dance!
They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your stepdad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules

Let's go to Civil War reenactments
Throw some back and yell "Too soon!" at them
