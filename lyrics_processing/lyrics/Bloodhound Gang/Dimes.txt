Where to begin? They call me tropical storm Jim
Here's your really local forecast, there's a warm front moving in
Pin drop, yeah you heard it when I moon walked in the room
While around the water cooler at the Legion of Doom
They're shouting "Why's the new guy with the sweet moves talking that smack?"
Well I'm the kind of crazy made from the shit of a bat
I swing like hell but know full well that I won't win the fight
But big man I'm the beta male that's gonna ruin your night

My rhymes score dimes ain't nothing you can do
It's hard to clap with your dick in your hand dude
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

What? Who me? Who am I? Well I'm just awesome
Like watching someone else getting kicked in the balls
And DJs hit pause when I waltz in, my thoughts enthrall crowds for hours
And it would come as no surprise if I had magical powers, poof
Buy me beers, cheers, here's to blood, sweat and Tears for Fears
Yes I get stupid like a baby with pierced ears
So drop me like them panties drop when I drop knowledge
Danger was my middle name but I changed it in college

My rhymes score dimes ain't nothing you can do
It's hard to clap with your dick in your hand dude
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

I write the songs that girls like to dance to
