It's not your fault that can't use words
Your eyes a force I can't fight
Never touching, they're as dark as night
Holding on, now I'm a stranger, I know I'm gone
The highest love isn't always the best
Racing my heart breaks through my chest
An electric reaction in me
It's not a choice to dance dangerously
Sometimes, the highest love is too far to feel
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, these dreams into the Sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong
When there's nothing left we'll walk away
Chasing a feeling we can't tame
You know the darkness no one believes
I know there's no relief in these dreams
Whenever there's nothing left for us to feel
You might also likeI'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, these dreams into the sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong
In a time without memory
It's more than a fantasy
Time without memory
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving
Let go, don't try to hold on
Let go, don't cry about it
Let go, don't try to hold on
Let go, don't cry about it
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up, these dreams into the Sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
