When you got it so good, but you still want more
But I know, but I know, but I already know your game
There's something that you want that you never took
You should leave it alone, but it tasted too good
And I know, and I know, and I know that it won't be tamed
You wanted to believe in me
You followed on
You followed close behind
And all you gave you gave it all
You thought you had
You thought you had me blinded
But I don't know if I can be your fighter
And I don't know if I can be your gun
I give you all you need, I surrender
I give you back the power that you want
When you give me your arms, I will give you my soul
When you fly with me, I'll turn your silver to gold
And I know and I know and I know that we'll never fall
And there's something in the air and you know it's good
But you'll never believe until you're ready to lose
And you know, and you know, and you know when you hear me call
You might also likeYou wanted to believe in me
You followed on
You followed close behind
And all you gave you gave it all
You thought you had
You thought you had me blinded
But I don't know if I can be your fighter
And I don't know if I can be your gun
I give you all you need I surrender
I give you back the power that you want
Surrender to you
Surrender to me
The power I give
The power I feel
Surrender to you
Surrender to me
The power I give
The power I feel
But I don't know if I can be your fighter
And I don't know if I can be your gun
I give you all you need I surrender
