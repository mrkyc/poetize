Can you feel it
In the spaces all around and in-between it?
Did you mean it
When you said "I hate you"?
'Cause I fucking believed it
If you can't see the signs
And I can't reach your mind
I'd be scared of what I might find
And I'm sorry
I'll take the blame, but you came at me kamikaze
A tsunami is heading our way
So is your apology

We really should have thought it through
Just what this would do to me and you
So ask yourself, is it worth it? (Worth it)
And take it from me
Nobody is perfect
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
To drift away and hold on to
Is it worth it? (Worth it)
Tell me, is it worth it?

Is it pointless
To be helpless, optimistic, non-conformist?
Am I annoying?
I tried as hard as I could, but you couldn't ignore it
'Cause I'm so sick and tired
Of these late nights and getting wired
On our fucked insecurities

So ask yourself, is it worth it? (Worth it)

Can you feel it
In spaces all around and in-between it?
Did you mean it?
'Cause I fucking believed it

Think it through
And what this could do to me and you
Yeah, ask yourself, is it worth it (Worth it)
To pour the gasoline if it's already burning?
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
To drift away and hold on to
Is it worth it? (Worth it)
Tell me, is it worth it?
Ask yourself, is it worth it?
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
