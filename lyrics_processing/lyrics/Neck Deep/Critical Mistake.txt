You have sixteen new messages
First new message:
Why do I even bother calling you
I've called you sixteen times today
And I know you've been online
So stop ignoring me

I made a critical mistake in a momentary lapse of judgement
Now you've called me up again
To remind me of the ways I fucked up
So then I'll take all the blame
It all just feels the same
And we move on
Then I screw it up again
Are you noticing a trend?
Should I go on?
So I said:

I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be

I'm the sinner, you're a saint
You will always have your way
Will you let go?
But when a cynic and a snake come together
It could take a miracle
But it only lasts so long
I know it won't be long 'till I screw up
Can we start it all again
And go back to when we were both wrong?
'Cause we're both wrong
So I said

I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be

And it all just seemed too perfect to be true
There's nothing perfect about me and you
And I tried to see the best
But I saw right through you
And I know I could be better
But you won't let me forget
That it always seemed so perfect when I played it in my head
You made a critical mistake in a momentary lapse of judgement
Now I'm walking out the door
Like all those times before
Guess I fucked up
So I said

I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be
I could be everything you need
