The leaves fell off as I did
Guess it held some kind of meaning
I've been lying in this bed of nails
Let the wind out of my sails
She left me on the bridge she's burning
Hell, maybe I deserve it
I'm just trying to find my purpose
I hope that it's all worth it

And there will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity

I'll be alright
Your bark was worse than your bite
Left a scar that faded with time
Echoed out to the back of my mind

The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity

And I've been walking round in circles
Cursed every corner of this town, will I make it out?
And if I do then it's a godsend
I caught a bullet in between my teeth
Could this finally be the end?

There will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside
The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors (I'll be alright)
Jump ship and head for failure (Your bark was worse than your bite)
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity
Find yourself a tragedy
