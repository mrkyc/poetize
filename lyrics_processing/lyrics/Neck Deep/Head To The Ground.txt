Run for your train or you might miss it
But I know I'd miss you more
So here's this song that I've been listening to
It reminds me of you
It reminds me of you

And I hope I don't drag you down
Cause I'm starting to feel alright thanks to you
And I hope this can all work out
Cause I feel like myself when I'm running my head to the ground

When's the next time that I can see you?
Got so much time on my hands but it's slipping through my fingers
How the fuck did I even meet you?
I can only hope that it's fate and this all fell into place

And I hope I don't drag you down
Cause I'm starting to feel alright thanks to you
And I hope this can all work out
Cause I feel like myself when I'm running my head to the ground

Can't control myself
I do this every time
It's such a fatal flaw of mine
Such a fatal flaw

But I hope that you feel the same
And I hope we can both adjust to the pace of this
Maybe we'll be ok
Maybe you'll stop me from digging my own fucking grave

And I hope I don't drag you down
Cause I'm starting to feel alright thanks to you
And I hope this can all work out
Cause I feel like myself when I'm running my head to the
And I hope I don't drag you down
Cause I'm starting to feel alright thanks to you
And I hope this can all work out
Cause I feel like myself when I'm running my head to the ground

Cause I feel like myself when I'm running my head to the ground
