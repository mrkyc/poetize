Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

I guess we'll never know
If when we're gone there's a place to go
Or if we don't see anything at all
Is that what we're supposed to call faith?
Well if that is that, and it all just fades to black
And we don't see anything at all
We don't see anything
What are you waiting for?

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

The world is a funny place
It kicks you when you're down
And knocks you out when you get up again
I don't think it's worth suffering through
But on the other hand
There's a world full of possibilities
And a million other people just like you
Who've all been through what you've been through
They were singing...

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

I saw it all flash and pass by with bright lights
And right before my eyes was the exit sign
I saw it all flash and pass by
And asked why I wasted precious time
It just passed me by
It just passed me by
We are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by
Oh we are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I don't wanna wait for that goodbye to see what could've been
