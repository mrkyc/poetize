Take it slow
Tell me all how you've grown, just for me
Could we all reminisce?
Better yet, here's a pen
Make a list
Fill it full with all the things I've missed
'Cause I could barely drive past the school
Without stopping to think of you
And how we used to act the fool
But worst of all I wish I'd called
At least a thousand times or more
Just to hear what I've been missing
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
"I know anywhere's better than here"
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here

And they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
Too bad it's not what I believe
'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here
Yeah they say you're in a better place
They say you're in a better place
Either way, I still wish you were here
They say you're in a better place
They say you're in a better place
