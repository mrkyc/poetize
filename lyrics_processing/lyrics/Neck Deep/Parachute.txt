It's another day
Wanna get away from here
There's a plane out on a runway
Gonna run away from here
'Cause the rain is so terribly dull
And it bores me
Yeah misery adores me

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could've had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

I'm done with small-town politics
I need to make my way to where the action is
I'm done with it, so the question is
Are you coming with?
'Cause baby, if you like, I'll take you there
Imagine all the places we could go to disappear
Or we could turn the light off and go back to bed
Stare at the stars on your ceiling and pretend that we're somewhere else

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

We don't need a God to take a leap of faith
Listen when I say that if we don't try (That if we don't try)
Then we won't believe (Then we won't believe)

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe
That we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm ready
I wanna do the things that you only read about
