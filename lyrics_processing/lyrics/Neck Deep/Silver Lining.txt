Can you see what I have become?
I've grown so cold, I'm getting numb
Down to the bone
Because being real never worked out for me
Playing these games is such a waste of time
Somewhere down the line
We'll just do this again
I wish you could take me
Or leave me as I am

Drown your sorrow in this bottle
It's full of the things I'll never say to you

What you felt was placebo
Those stories that we wrote
Are nothing more than ghosts
Of time we spent
And you know that I know
As long as the wind blows
I'll always be here
Searching for a silver lining in this

"Get off my back", she said to me
Well, get off my chest, you should have seen yourself
A few drinks and you missed me
I told you not to kiss me
But you still did
And now you pull me under
Fuck with my head and steal my thunder
How typical
And it's no wonder
I'm stupid enough to think that there's something left

Drown your sorrow in this bottle
It's full of the things I'll never say to you

You always want what you can't get
And I always want what I'll regret
Try walk a day in my shoes
You'll know exactly how I feel
I can't get you out of my head
But I can't get out of my own bed
Try letting this pull me down
I guess I'll see you around

What you felt was placebo
Those stories that we wrote
Are nothing more than ghosts
Of time we spent
And you know that I know
As long as the wind blows
I'll always be here
Searching for a silver lining in this
