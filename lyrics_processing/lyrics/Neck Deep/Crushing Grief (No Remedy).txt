She's dressed in blue and black again
Sometimes red or yellow dress
She can't seem to make up her mind
A shed of light is hard to find
She was too cool for me to catch
Or was I too slow and second best?
I always knew this day would come
I've got some things to get off my chest

This whole thing's open to conversation
But I'm not holding my breath about it
I'm sick and tired of all your bullshit
When all it is who can scream the loudest
And it's funny how the time it flies
And the people how they change
You know it's funny how you changed

Crushing grief, there is no remedy
The mess you made of me
Sleep with the enemy and
I'll miss that old routine we had:
Get high, have sex, get high again
I know you wanted more from me
It's something I could never be

This whole thing's open to conversation
But I'm not holding my breath about it
I'm sick and tired of all your bullshit
When all it is who can scream the loudest
And it's funny how the time it flies
And the people how they change
You know it's funny how you changed
(I don't need you) This whole thing's open to conversation
But I'm not holding my breath about it
(Keep your distance) I'm sick and tired of all your bullshit
When all it is who can scream the loudest
(I don't need you) And it's funny how the time it flies
And the people how they change
(Things have changed) You know it's funny how you changed

Crushing grief
There is no remedy
The mess you made of me
The worst I'll ever be
I started looking past the point
That you were always best for me
I've fought my way through all of this
I've learned and loved and fell apart
I came through unscathed
Albeit betrayed
But fuck playing safe
