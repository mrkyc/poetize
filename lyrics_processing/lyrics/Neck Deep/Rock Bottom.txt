Dancing on the grave you made to hide me
Remove the pictures from the wall 'cause they're reminding
You of all the things you try so hard to hide and
She digs the grave so she knows just where she can find it

And I don't have much to offer
But had you loved me, I'd have loved you back forever

Here I am again, rock bottom
Dug this hole to hell to rot in
Shouldn't have ignored my friends
It frayed the rope that they dropped in
Here I lay again, rock bottom
What was life like?
I've forgotten how the sun felt on my skin
Resurrect and start again

She said, "You're distant from the world and self-destructive"
But she still smiles and laughs along for self-indulgence
She's got her finger on the pulse and she feels nothing
She digs the grave so she can dance like no one's watching

And I know you're chasing something (I know you're chasing something)
Or has what you wanted got you scared and running?
And I know you're missing something (I know you're missing something)
Because I felt it there that night and caught you blushing

Here I am again, rock bottom
Dug this hole to hell to rot in
Shouldn't have ignored my friends
It frayed the rope that they dropped in
Here I lay again, rock bottom
What was life like?
I've forgotten how the sun felt on my skin
Resurrect and start again

The ebb and flow of life's a mystery
So I guess I'll never know
Yeah, I got caught up in history
So I think it's time for me to let this go

(Break out, I need to break out, I need to break out)
(Gotta get me out or I'm gonna break down)
(I'm gonna break down)
(I've hit rock bottom) Resurrect and start again
