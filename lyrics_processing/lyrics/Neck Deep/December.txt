Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You'd never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing, and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could've been
My mistakes were not intentions
This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent, but tonight it's killing me

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more (I miss you, but I wish you well)
But I was passed out on the floor (I miss you, but I wish you well)
That's the last thing I remember (I miss you, yeah, I miss you)
