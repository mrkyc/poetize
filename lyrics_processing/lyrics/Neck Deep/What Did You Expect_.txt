6 months have been and I'm still sick of everything that makes you smile
I've been here before, I'm just hoping this will die down
But I've learnt from experience, that love is a risk and I'm just hoping you're hearing this
So maybe you'll know just how it feels to be sitting here
Wide awake and far from dreaming
Don't tell me that I'll be fine

My broken bones are caving in
I feel you crawl beneath my skin
You went and fucked this up 'cuz you couldn't keep your legs shut

And you'll find me burning bridges
Searching for some sense of distance
Tearing out post trauma stitches that held me together
So far gone, my mind is racing
Back and forth I can't stop pacing
Thinking where we could have been if you just braved the weather

Fuck his car and fuck his money
He might pay for you but he's got nothing
I won't be in sight when you realise that I might just have been a more stable support
To the life that you'll build when he cuts himself short
Don't tell me that I'll be fine
I'm so sick of hoping you're right

And you'll find me burning bridges
Searching for some sense of distance
Tearing out post trauma stitches that held me together
So far gone, my mind is racing
Back and forth I can't stop pacing
Thinking where we could have been if you just braved the weather

Take all I am
Tear me into pieces
Deconstruct my bones and tell me you still don't know who I am
You've got some nerve thinking we could be friends
Well what did you expect? A fucking compliment?

So take whats left of me
A broken fragment from before
I guess I'll try to be the best I can without you here
I know I'll find myself along this beaten track
I'll have to let you go and let these ghosts stay in the past
