Let's start it here
Back in nineteen-seventy-sumthin'
I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who'd lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
"If I could, then I would save you"
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying "I do"
Oh, love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

And now its two-thousand-and-sumthin'
We made it here my dear
Grandkids and the mortgage paid off
Is this what dreams are made of?
'Cause baby we made it
Yeah baby, you saved me
But nothing could save him
From the ambulance that day
When he went away
The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me (Saved me!)
Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But he's a part of all of us
And we will hold you when you cry
