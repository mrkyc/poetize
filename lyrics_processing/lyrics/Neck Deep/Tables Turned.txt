I felt the weather getting better, but I couldn't feel my feet
I always felt so cold in your company
I guess that maybe we should settle this
Blame it all on me
I don't care anymore, won't you please just let me be?

Bend the rules until they break
You always knew just how to make me fall to me knees
I felt so sick, ill at ease
But I'm getting better

And I hope that this time you finally see
That you can't get away with everything
I moved on and the world opened up for to me
The thought of you use to make me cave in
Gave you a chance but you threw it all away
The tables turned and there's nothing left to say
Done being a wall you lean against
Just needed some time so I could
Open up my window
Let the air clear out my head
Think how fast the years go and all the things I left unsaid
Another old regret that I'll hide beneath my bed
I guess some distance was the best cure for this
'Cause rest assured it's not you I miss anymore
And I don't care where you lay your head at night

Because with you it's all swings and roundabouts
Gave you a chance but you still wouldn't hear me out
And I hope that it kills you I'm happy now
I hope you hate the taste of your own medicine
Those skeletons buried in my head
And all the thoughts I have of you, make me wish we never met

And I don't care where you lay your head at night
I know I won't miss the smell of you in my room
You presumed that I'd feel the same


Drive home and think about the things I said
You never learn from this you just expect
You are my hesitant smile
You are my crippling doubt
You're everything that I hide about myself
You are every lesson I've learned with every leaf that I've turned
The very reason why I won't let this happen again
I found the side of myself I thought I left behind
