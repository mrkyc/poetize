We couldn't wait for the days to get longer
Spend nights sitting up, wasting away
All the shit that we did when we were younger
Think back and it feels like yesterday
We were losing teeth
Stayed up again last night, talk some sense to me
But so it seems the time has come
To pack your bags, close eyes and run like I did
If you do it first, I'll follow straight behind you
'Cause growing old is a waste of time
To say goodbye is a waste of breath
We'll stick it out till the bitter end

I remember every night that we spent on the edge
The cold warmth and the bitter taste that it left
Young, dumb, carefree and reckless
But there's some method to the madness

Passed out in the living room
Moved on, but I'll see you soon
Bored now you're absent
Back home, there's still nothing to do
Though we complained about it all
Was such a worthwhile waste of my time
Each day and each night a memory
Take care and please don't forget me

Don't give a fuck what they have to say
'Cause we'll just do it anyway
And if I break a bone or it fries my brain
We took a risk and laughed at our mistakes
Give a fuck if we don't fit in
We don't need them
They don't know a thing about us
All the times we shared
The world at our feet and in the wind in our hair

But some things must change
And as much as I hate it
It kills me to say our goodbyes as we turn the page
And move on to the next chapter
And hope it won't hold disaster
Now the world's so big, it seems
But the blank white walls won't let me breathe
And if the big wide world caved in tonight
I'd see you on the other side

Passed out in the living room
Moved on, but I'll see you soon
Bored now you're absent
Back home, there's still nothing to do
Though we complained about it all
Was such a worthwhile waste of my time
Each day and each night a memory
Take care and please don't forget me
