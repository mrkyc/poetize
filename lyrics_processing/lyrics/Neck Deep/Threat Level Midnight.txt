I've had a steady stream of lonely nights
For the past few weeks in this room
I'm locked away from it all
Just need a break from the walls that close me in
I'll see this out standing on pins
I'll fall asleep with my eyes open
Just to see if I could focus
On something more than my loneliness
None of my friends seem to give a shit about the way I am
I know full well they understand that
I get myself way too deep in what she said
But they'll bail me out when I'm in over my head

I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

Of all the things I hope to keep
A childhood sense of opportunity
Grab life by the wrist and jump
Take the chance while I'm still young and dumb

Passed out but on my feet
With years ahead to get some sleep
And so much time to face defeat
So write our names in wet concrete
To seal our place in space and time
Before we have to walk the line
Before we all move on in life
Before the sun comes up tonight

I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell
I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell
A swift farewell
