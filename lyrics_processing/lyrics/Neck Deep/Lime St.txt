It's been a few days since I saw you last
And there's a few things that I have to ask
And so the first is, do I hold you back?
And did I fuck up too many times?
Found the bad I know you'd find
And just need some time and space
We've fallen out of place
But I pray to God we don't lose connection
Just need to see you smile or maybe stay awhile
Before we lose all sense of direction

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, "Oh God, not this again"

And I haven't seen you smile this whole time
It bums me out and makes me wonder why I can't do right
And I'm trying my best, I promise
And I want this as long as you want it

I found you there at Lime Street
One cig left in the packet
Stood shy in your dad's jacket
A moment I'll always keep
Oh, take me back to Lime Street
I swear to God you save me
Oh, I swear to God you save me

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, "Oh God, not this again"

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, "Oh God, not this again"

Is it too late to say, too late to say
Is it too late to say, too late to say
Is it too late to say, too late to say
I swear to God you save me
