I sat inside with a heavy heart
Just wish you would think of me
Are you listening?
Ran round in circles 'til after dark
Didn't get very far
Wasn't meant to be
I never thought it would be this hard
It feels like you walked through me
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

And maybe you would know just how it felt to be like me at my lowest
As you let me out the door, you tore me open
My final words were left unspoken

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then it's too little, too late
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then you'll be stuck in this place
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

And every day that's passing is surely mine to seize
Did every wave that crashed in leave you washed up at her feet?

Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be okay, I'll be okay"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be okay, I'll be okay"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
"I'll be okay", say "I'll be okay"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
