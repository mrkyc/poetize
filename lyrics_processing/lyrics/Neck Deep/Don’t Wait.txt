Disrupt and keep dividing, the government is lying
I'm not gonna be a fallacy of this society
Turn off your TV station, that's not real information
Trying to define the human mind, it's like puppetry
And they've got you by your strings, playing God for money
A sorry, sad charade, you can see right through it

Don't wait for anyone to say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference? Would you open your eyes?

Suspend your disbelief, are you paying close attention?
If you blink, then you might miss their tricks and their deception
Distrust and disobey the lies they say 'cause all the world's a stage
And if you choose to read the news, then you must question everything
And they've got you on your knees, they've got your milk and honey
Then we put them on parade and celebrate what's coming

Don't wait for anyone to say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference? Would you open your eyes?
