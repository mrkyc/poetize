I've been stuck in the middle pages
Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (Fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)

'Cause sometimes things will bend you

'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

So pick yourself up
You can't change what's been
You must go on
And learn while you live
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead
Then you're right on track for a better end

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
Yeah, life's not out to get you
Get you!
