I say D-O
D-O-D
D-O-D-G
D-O-D-G-E-R-S
Team, team, team, team!
Oh!
I say O-M
O-M-A
O-M-A-L
O-M-A-L-L-E-Y
Oh really? No, O'Malley!
Sandy Koufax, oh my Drysdale
Maury Wills, I love you so
And we defy
Defy the J-I
J-I-N
J-I-N-T
The J-I-N-T-S, Gi'nts!
Play ball!
Orlando Cepeda is at bat with the bases jammed
Orlando Cepeda, with a wham, bam, he hit a grand slam
In the very first inning, but it's only the begining
In the third, like a bird, we get two on, none away
Then Fairly hits into a double play
Here comes Big Frank Howard, yessiree
Boy, what a swing! Strike three
Oh dem B
Oh dem B-U
B-U-M
B-U-M-S
Dem bums, dem bums, dem dry bums
Oh they may be bums, but they're my bums
Top of the fourth, say hey Willy Mays
Hits a three bagger down the right field line
Then he's out trying to stretch it to a homer
As Roseborro tags him on the bottom of the spine
With a crack you can hear
All the way back up to
San Francisco, open your hospitals!
Charge!
Inning six, Maury Wills
Draws a walk, in the coach's box
Leo Dourochure, Leo Dourochure
Starts to wiggle and to twitch
A signal? No, an itch
Go Maury, go Maury, go go go!
Maury goes, the catcher throws
Right from the solar plexus
At the bag he beats the tag
That mighty little waif
And umpire Connlin cries, "Yer out!"
Out? Out???
Down in the dugout Alston glowers
Up in the booth Vin Scully frowns
Out in the stands O'Malley grins
Attendance fifty thousand
And what does O'Malley do?
Charge!
Bottom of the ninth, four to nuttin'
Last chance, push the button!
Oh we're pleading, begging, on our knees
Come on you Flatbush refugees!
Maury Wills at bat, hit it for me once
Stu Miller throws, Maury bunts
Cepeda runs to field the ball and Hiller covers first
Hallah runs to back up Hiller
Hiller crashes into Miller
Miller falls, drops the ball, Connlin calls "Safe!"
Yea, Maury!
Gilliam up, Miller grunts
Miller throws, Gilliam bunts
Cepeda runs to field the ball and Hiller covers first
Hallah runs to back up Hiller
Hiller crashes into Miller
Miller falls, drops the ball, Connlin calls "Safe!"
Yea, Connlin!
Willy Davis gets a hit
And Frankie does the same
Here comes Mr. Howard
With a chance to win the game
Hit it once!
Big Frank bunts?!?
Cepeda runs to field the ball and Hiller covers first
Hallah hollers "Hiller"
Hiller hollers "Hallah,"
Hallah hollers "Hiller," points to Miller with his fist
And that's the Hiller Miller Holler Hallah-luia Twist!
The Davises score, it's four to four
And Howard's still rounding the bases
>From second to third, it's almost absurd
Amazement on everyone's faces
He's heading for home, he hasn't a chance
The poor lad is gonna be dead
But the ball hits him right in the seat of his pants
And he scores! That's using your head
So I say D
I say D-O
D-O-D-G-E-R-S
The team that's all heart
All heart and all thumbs
They're my Los Angeles, your Los Angeles
Our Los Angeles...
Do you really think we'll win the pennant?
Bums!
