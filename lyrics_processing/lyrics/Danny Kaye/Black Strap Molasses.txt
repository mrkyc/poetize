Black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

My grandpa's older than the old grey mare
He sits a-rockin' in his rockin' chair
But now he's got a smile that he can't lose
Grandma's sittin' knittin' baby shoes

From eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

I gave up cherry pie and T-bone steak
Chicken fricassee and ice cream cake
I don't need vitamins or pills at all
I even mix it with my Hadacol

I'm eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
You might also like
My nerves were jumpy and I'd walk the floor
I never got to sleep till after four
But since I'm eatin' right I feel okay
I'm sleepin' every night and half the day

From eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

Now I was thinner than a pencil line
Had no muscles and I had no spine
But now I'm friskier than a pup
All you have do is prop me up

Just feed me black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

I know a fella who is ninety-two
Doctors told the guy that he was through
But now that the doctor has been proven wrong
He's got more hop in him than Hopalong
From eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
