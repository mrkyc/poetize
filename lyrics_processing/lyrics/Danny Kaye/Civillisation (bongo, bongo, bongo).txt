He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree
That civilization is a thing for me to see
So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no bright lights
False teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
That no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed
(Magazine? What happens?)
I see how people who are civilized bang you with automobile
(You know you can get hurt that way Daniel?)
At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to
See (What do they see, Danny?)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me
So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't want to leave the
Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
So, no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train
And though it's smoky and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain
When they've got two weeks vacation
They hurry to vacation ground (What do they do, Danny?)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no jail house, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
So, no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
They have things like the atom bomb
So I think I'll stay where I am
Civilization
