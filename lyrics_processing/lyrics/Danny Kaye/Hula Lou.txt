Said a sailor known as Dan McCan
And if you really want to know about women
You've got to talk to a sailor man
Now I don't know how many woman the sailor met
And I hope there isn't that any he'll regret
For if he'd only met me I'd a given him some trimmin'
I'm one gal he'd never forget
Well who are you?
Who am I? I'm Hula Lou
I'm the gal that can't be true
I do my nestin' in the evenin' breeze
'Neath the trees
You oughta see me shake my BVDs
I never knew
A man who wouldn't hula dance or woo
And sail across the briny blue to who
The lady known as Hula Lou. That's me
Now you ask any sailor and he'll tell you
That this lady is the greatest dancer he ever knew
There isn't a ship in the Navy
That I haven't got a friend in the crew
There's not a cruiser on the waves
Without someone who is my devoted slave
And I don't care how nasty I may be
I'm the one gal the sailors all crave

You don't believe me?
No!
Well you travel in and out
You travel in the south
You travel back and forth
You travel in the north
You see them shakin' east
You see them shakin' west
But boys I do my shakin' where the shakins' best
I gotta hula smile
Lots of hula hair
A little hula here
A little hula there
I've got the cutest eyes
Never mind what shade they are
But (lookin' at them the boys*) will never get very far
'Cause I'm Hula Lou
I'm the gal that can't be true
I do my nestin' in the evenin' breeze
'Neath the trees
I got more sweeties than a dog has fleas
I never knew
A man who wouldn't hula dance or woo
And sail across the briny blue to who
