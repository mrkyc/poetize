There are many minds in circulation

Yeah

Believing in reincarnation

Yeah

In me you see
One who doesn't agree
Challenging possible affronts

Yes, yes

I believe I'll only live once

Hear, hear
You might also like
And I want to make the most of it
If there's a party, I want to be the host of it
If there's a haunted house, I want to be the ghost of it
If I'm in town, I want to be the toast of it
I say to me every morning
You've only one life to live
So why be done in?
Let's let the sun in
And gloom can jump in the riv'
No use to beat on the doldrums
Let's be imaginative
Each day is numbered
No good when slumbered
With only one life to live
Why let the goblins upset you?
One smile and see how they run
And what does worrying net you?
Nothing! The thing is to have fun
All this may sound kind of hackneyed
But it's the best I can give
Soon comes December
So please remember
You've only one life to live
Just one life to live
I say to me every morning
You've only one life to live
So why be done in?
Let's let the sun in
And gloom can jump in the riv'
No use to beat on the doldrums
Let's be imaginative
Each day is numbered
No good when slumbered
With only one life to live

Why let the goblins upset you?
One smile and see how they run
And what does worrying net you?

Oh, ho, nothing! The thing is to have fun

Let's go

All this may sound kind of hackneyed
But it's the best I can give
Soon comes December
So please remember

You've only one life to live
