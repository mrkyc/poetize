A broken man, a broken heart
A brand new life, a brand new start
The lights ahead are on the tracks
Full steam ahead, no coming back
They say you've got to feed your soul
But I've been left with just a hole
There's nothing left inside of me
Just want to live, just want to be

The roads ahead are paved with gold
I can't believe the lies they've told
There's no more vision to behold
We've lost it all, we've all been sold
The trust is gone, the love is lost
The truth's alive, but only just
We pray for peace, if needs we must
If needs we must, deliver us

Breathe, I want to breathe
I want to fly away up to the stars, so I can spread my wings
Breathe, we need to breathe
And let us fly away up to the stars, so we can spread our wings
