Almost has gone
Why don't you show me
Just how our poor lives have gone wrong
I'll understand if you tell me it's another man
But don't abuse me, refuse me
And mess with my mind
Don't you need me
'Cause I'm lost without a friend
Well do you need me
'Cause I can't hold you tight
'Cause I want you to know
That I've had enough of fooling around
And I want you to show
That you'll give us just one more chance
Will you be ready tonight
'Cause I hope so
Let's make a deal, go away for a day or two
Maybe revise, compromise, do what we want to do
You'll have your coffee in bed
But you'll share it with me
I'll kiss you everywhere, hold me
Don't let me go free
Don't you need me
'Cause I'm lost without a friend
Well do you need me
'Cause I can't hold tight
You might also like'Cause I want you to know
That I've had enough of fooling around
Ah don't stop at nothin'
And I want you to show
That you'll give us just one more chance
Ah don't stop at nothin'
Will you be ready tonight
Will you be ready tonight
Even if you never leave me
I keep dreaming sentimental reasons
For your lovey-dovey honey I'm your once in a lifetime
Always be your prime time
Looking backwards see the blue sea
Will you kiss me, hoping that you'll miss me
Please don't tease me, love me please me
Let's make a deal, go away for a day or two
Maybe revise, compromise, do what we want to do
Don't you need me
'Cause I'm lost without a friend
Well do you need me
'Cause I can't hold tight
You give me nothing but your heartache tonight
But if you love me won't you hold on to me tight
'Cause I want you to know
That I've had enough of fooling around
Ah don't stop at nothin'
And I want you to show
That you'll give us just one more chance
Ah don't stop at nothin'
'Cause I want you to know
That I've had enough of fooling around
Ah don't stop at nothin'
And I want you to show
That you'll give us just one more chance
Ah don't stop at nothin'
