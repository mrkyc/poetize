Your life is blinded by the powers that be
Your feeling trapped, you just want to break free
Oh god, relief us, give us sanctuary
Sometimes you see it in the simplest of things
A homeless man can be the wisest of kings
Love is the answer, we've all heard it before
Living and breathing, it means so much more
Oh, life is deeper than the sea
Oh, close your eyes and learn to breathe
Cradle life and love and let it flow
'Cause I believe that everyone's the same
'Cause we're all so disconnected
But I have realized every moment there's a sign
Hidden in the rhythm of the mind
That guides us all to where we ought to be
Time bloomed illusion find us drowning in doubt
But if you listen you will find a way out
Learn how to trust your intuition and see
Your shadow floats away and set you free
Life deals you questions that you'll answered with fault
But have you learned enough to balance the score?
Life's fragile moments make us question our faith
Don't wait forever, you might be too late
You might also likeBut, oh, life is deeper than the sea
Oh, close your eyes and learn to breathe
Cradle life and love and let it flow
'Cause I believe that everyone's the same
'Cause we're all so disconnected
But I have realized every moment there's a sign
Hidden in the rhythm of the mind
That guides us all to where we ought to be, ha
Save our souls and 
Save our souls and  cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh, life is singing in the rain
Oh, open up your heart again
Cradle life and love
Cradle life and love and let it flow
'Cause I believe that everyone's the same
'Cause we're all so disconnected
But I have realized every moment there's a sign
Hidden in the rhythm of the mind
That guides us all to where we ought to be
