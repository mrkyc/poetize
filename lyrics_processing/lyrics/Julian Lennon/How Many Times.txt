How many times must I catch you from grace
And how many times must the lamb go to slaughter
It seems that things will never change
How many times can you trust your conviction
How many times can you feel your own pain
And how many days of your life are prediction
It seems that things will never change
How many times can we develop something we've just done
And how many times can we re-run the race that we've just won
Well, we're always looking, for something new
But what difference does it make, when there's no point of view
'cos when you can't even take care of the past
How do you expect the future to last?
Well, there's people in pain, all over the world
And if something doesn't change, between man and his world
Say goodbye to all the birds and the bees
Deforestation and the death of the trees
Immunization, as we fall to our knees
I'm begging you, please! I'm begging you, please!
How many times can we live without loving
How many times can we choose our own fate
And how many times can we clip the white dove's wing
It seems that things will never change
You might also likeHow many times can we sin without savior
And how many times can we cloud our own truth
And how many times must we judge our own failure
It seems that things will never change
How many times can we develop something we've just done
And how many times can we re-run the race that we've just won
Well, we're always looking, for something new
But what difference does it make, when there's no point of view
'cos when you can't even take care of the past
How do you expect the future to last?
Well, there's people in pain, all over the world
And if something doesn't change, between man and his world
Say goodbye to all the birds and the bees
Deforestation and the death of the trees
Immunization, as we fall to our knees
I'm begging you, please! I'm begging you, please!
How many times can we develop something we've just done
