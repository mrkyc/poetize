Cope with what your life demands, leave it all behind
Free yourself from all the lies
Free yourself from what's inside, leave it all behind
Oh, can't you see we're a part of destiny?
We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive, will I be strong enough?
We all need a helping hand
We all fall but then we stand
And show the strength I see in all of us
Every single day
Feel your heart and feel your pain
We have lived a life of blame
Leave it all behind
(Leave it all behind)
Don't be frightened by your love
Always learn to rise above
Leave it all behind
(Leave it all behind)

We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive, will I be strong enough?
(If I touch the sky)
We all need a helping hand
We all fall but then we stand
And show the strength I see in all of us
Every single day
(Every single day)
, love is lost as we decay
Beg for mercy as we pray forgiveness
Try to see the light today, look around you, all is dead
All of us have been misled, forgive us now
We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive, will I be strong enough?
(If I touch the sky)
We all need a helping hand
We all fall but then we stand
And show the strength I see in all of us
(If I touch the sky)
We all want to touch the sky
How do I survive, will I be strong enough?
(If I touch the sky)
We all ask the question 'why?'
We stand and show the strength I see in all of us
(If I touch the sky)
I just hope and pray
