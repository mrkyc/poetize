Everyone is searching, trying to find a new religion
Some peace of mind, peace of mind
Don't wanna let go of all of my intuition
I need a sign 'cause love is blind

I feel a change is coming, I know
A new revolution's knocking on my door
I feel a change is coming, so strong
It might not be forever, but I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones

Everyone is hurtin' tryin' a find a real solution
Well, you might find that love ain't blind
The world is burning while we're dancing in our own pollution
Well, is there time, or did we cross the line?

I feel a change is coming, I know
A new revolution's knocking on my door
I feel a change is coming, so strong
It might not be forever, but I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones
You might also like
We gotta find a way to get better
The only way through this is together
It's not too late, so never say never
I know that we're the lucky ones
Look at us, we fucked up the weather
If we unite, we'll get through whatever
We need this world to last us forever
I know that we're the lucky ones

A new revolution's knocking on my door
We're gonna stop at nothing, oh no
The hurt won't last forever
'Cause I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones
I know that we're the lucky ones

We gotta find a way to get better
The only way through this is together
It's not too late, so never say never
I know that we're the lucky ones
Look at us, we fucked up the weather
If we unite, we'll get through whatever
We need this world to last us forever
