Hmmmm...Hmmmm...Hmmmm...
When you're going through and you don't know what to do...
When the fire gets too hot, don't draw nigh!
Hold your head up high and be of good cheer
Oh you need to know, your deliverance is here!
Oh ooooh oooh yeah!
(Chorus)
Count it all joy. (Count it)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)

Count it all joy. (That's what you oughta do!)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. (Whoo whoo whooo whooo)
Count it all joy. (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Verse 2)
I know you sit and ask yourself
So many times, "Why does it seem like I am losing my mind?"
As I sit and reminiscence on all that I've been through
I'm realizing it's not about me, but about You
Count it all ooooh!
(Chorus)
Count it all joy
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. (That's what you oughta do!)
Count it all joy. (Count it all joy)
Count it all joy. Oh! Oh! Oh! oooooh!
Oooh! oohh! oooh!
