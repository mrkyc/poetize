Tarralyn need to rock, rock on
Nice Boi need to rock, rock on
Casablanca need to rock, rock on
Philly need to rock, rock on
NY need to rock, rock on
West Coast need to rock, rock on
Down South need to rock, rock on
Everybody just rock, rock on
When I first saw your face
A memory I can't erase
I knew that we were meant to be
I look into your eyes
That moment I realized
You were my destiny
And to my girls said, "I ain't trippin'"
I don't even listen
They don't know what they're missing
Until they found what I've found
You turn my night to day
If I had it all my way
You would stay by my side
Never be apart
Together we would stay
You might also likeI wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
Oh oh
I wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
Oh oh
Usually when I have to leave
You don't know what it does to me
Baby where you are I want to be
Don't you know you're a part of me?
I don't want you to think I'm sweating you
All I want you to know is I'm loving you
No one makes me feel the way you do
So you should understand why I wanna be with you
I wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
Oh oh
I wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
Oh oh
Nice Boi:
Ladies and gentlemen
You are now witnessing
The crowning of the new diva of divas, y'all
She goes by the name of Tarralyn
She's on a new label
So all I got to say is
Casablanca better rock, rock on
I wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
Oh oh
I wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Any, anywhere you are
