So you say things are impossible for you
And life keeps playing its tricks
And giving you blow after blow
One minute you're up and then the
Next you are down
One day there's a smile
In the midst of a sound there's a frown
But you can make it...
Chorus:
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Oh, yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can...
As long as your heart says yes
Always try hard and do your best
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it...
Verse 2:
There is nothing in life that you cannot achieve
No matter how far away it seems
You just keep on, keep on believing
You might also likeAnd soon one day, you'll see
You will finally reach your goal
And all that you've worked for
Was worth it and more but you
You can make it...
Chorus:
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Oh, yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can...
As long as your heart says yes
Always try hard and do your best
Bridge:
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
Gotta see yourself fighting through
And all things done
If you can dream it, you can mean it
Just believe it
If you can dream it, you can mean it
Just believe...
Believe...
Chorus:
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Oh, yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can...
As long as your heart says yes
Always try hard and do your best
Yes you can yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Oh,Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can make it
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it, you can win
Yes you can, yes you will
You can make it
