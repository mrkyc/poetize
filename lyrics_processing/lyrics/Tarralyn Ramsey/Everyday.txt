You're the morning light
You're the air I breathe
You are my inspiration
Never needs my wings
You are my joy, dear Lord
You are my soul
You are my sunshine
In the middle of the song
You give me peace
(When I'm surrounded by confusion)
If I ever have a problem
(You offer a solution)
Can't put Your trust in man
(People always changin')
No matter who may come and go
I know that You'll be stayin' by me
Everyday the same
Jesus, You'll never change
You make me wanna sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing

There ain't no way
That I can live without You
You are my consolation
When I'm sad and blue
You never flip or scream to me
Like some of my friends
You were there from the start
And I know You'll be there till the end
You give me peace
(When I'm surrounded by confusion)
If I ever have a problem
(You offer a solution)
I can't put my trust in man
