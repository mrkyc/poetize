Back row, honor roll
I'm head of the class
Wet bleachers, student teacher
Better start kissing some ass
Bad weather, let's get together
I never went in line
Night lessons, study sessions
You know you work so fine

So what's your name, new kid in school?
Tell me something, do you feel lonely yet?
Come sit next to me
Tell me, honey, do you feel lonely yet?
Come get closer to me
It ain't that bad
You know, it really ain't that bad (Whoa-oh-oh)
You can't avoid it, might as well enjoy it, 'cause I do
While you're the new kid in school
You're the new kid in school

Best dressed, be my guest
I'll take you to the top
School nurse, you're not the first
And I won't tell you to stop
Burned leather, let's come together
No time to educate
I've tried the parking lot
Before you graduate
