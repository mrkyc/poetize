On the floors of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go, go
With the record selection and the mirror's reflection
I'm dancing with myself
When there's no-one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Well, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, uh-oh-oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the one to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself
You might also like
Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Well, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
And I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, uh-oh-oh
Oh, uh-oh-oh
Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh

Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh

Dancing with myself (Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh)

Dancing with myself (Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh)
Sweat, sweat, sweat (Oh, uh-oh-oh, oh)
