Everyone is gonna be there! We'll be a little late
But no one really cares...
(pre-chorus)
Its a party when we start playin'
Come on baby thats what I'm sayin'
(chorus)
Don't try to stop me Freddy
Cause the nights a neverender!
Now I'm drinking steady...
Tell your mom i didn't mean to offend her!
And if you can't keep up
Then you better shut up!
Cause tonight I'm gonna stay out till 5 o'clock in the mornin'!
(v2)
Well I really like you
But I just can't talk right now
Sure, I'll sign your shoe
Since you got backstage somehow...
(pre-chorus)
Its a party when we start playin'
Come on baby thats what I'm sayin'
You might also like(chorus)
Don't try to stop me Freddy
Cause the nights a neverender!
Now I'm drinking steady...
Tell your mom i didn't mean to offend her!
And if you can't keep up
Then you better shut up!
Cause tonight I'm gonna stay out till 5 o'clock in the mornin'!
(bridge)
It's time for everyone to get out of here!
But I think we'll stick around and finish off the beer
Dont get lazy, it's about to get crazy
Just wait till you see what we did with the chandelier!!
(v3)
Well theres nothing to eat
But we got a big bottle of liquor
Its a little to sweet
But it always works so much quicker
I get so excited and ready to go
Sweats gonna pour all through the show
Yea-ah!
(chorus)
Don't try to stop me Freddy
Cause the nights a neverender!
Now I'm drinking steady...
Tell your mom i didn't mean to offend her!
And if you can't keep up
Then you better shut up!
Don't try to stop me Freddy
Cause the nights a neverender!
Now I'm drinking steady...
Tell your mom i didn't mean to offend her!
And if you can't keep up
Then you better shut up!
