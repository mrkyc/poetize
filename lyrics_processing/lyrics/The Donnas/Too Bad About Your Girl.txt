I got the bait but I got no bite
Wanna have some fun, wanna have someone
Who can make me feel alright
I'm lookin at you, you're lookin' at me too
Yeah you know what I wanna do
But your girlfriend wants the night to end
Baby, tell me somethin' new

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
'Cause you're lookin' like you're the one
She left but now she's back, stickin' out her rack
She's got you runnin' down the wrong track
Can't wait to see her face when I'm in her place
And I'm tryin' get you in the sack

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you've got a date tonight
'Cause you're lookin' like you're the one
You might also likeTell her to leave
Soon it'll be too late
It's like New Year's Eve
'Cause I just can't wait
Too bad
(echo) You got a date tonight!
Too bad about your girl
Yeah, it's too bad
(echo) You got a date tonight!
Too bad about your girl
Yeah!
If you were smart, you'd send her home on bart
Before the real trouble starts
'Cause who's she gonna slap when she sees me in your lap
And you say you had a change of heart
I gotta make you mine but we're runnin outta time
But she's got you guarded like the Guggenheim
It's all that I can take, let's make a jailbreak
Or we'll be doin' time in Anaheim!

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
'Cause you're lookin' like you're the one
It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
