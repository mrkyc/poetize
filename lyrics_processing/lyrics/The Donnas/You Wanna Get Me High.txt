Oh yeah, you're that popular guy
You always made fun of my crew
And now you wanna get me high?
Yeah!

You wanna get me
You wanna get me high
You wanna get me...

Now you know my name, you wanna get me high
You're tryin to get with me and I don't know why...
Call me on the phone, you wanna get me high
Don't remember your name, don't really wanna try
You always said I was doin' it wrong
But it looks like you forgot!
'Cause now you sing along to every song
I'm hot and you're not!

You wanna get me
You wanna get me high
You wanna get me...

You wanna get me...
It's too late, so don't even try!
You wanna get me...
You had your chance but you let it slide
And now you act like you're on my side!!
Dude, you gotta say it
Don't spray it!
You never talked to me before
No, I don't wanna Cafe' Au Lait it
I'll make Narci show you the door!

Now you know my name, you wanna get me high
You're tryin to get with me and I don't know why...
