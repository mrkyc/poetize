Well it's only Thursday and it's no one's birthday
But we're goin' out for the night
Make a few stops, avoid the traffic cops
Pick up some whiskey and some dynamite

But there's always someone who's gotta spoil it for the rest of the gang
You're such a little Bogart, and I'm sorry, but you just can't hang

Why don't you pass it around?
Don't bring the party down
If you don't pass it around
We'll run you right outta this town

Well it's already Friday, gonna do it my way
Everything's ready to go
But later on, all the beer is gone
Downed by some guys I don't even know

But there's always someone who's gotta spoil it for the rest of the gang
You're such a little Bogart, and I'm sorry, but you just can't hang
You might also like
Why don't you pass it around?
Don't bring the party down
If you don't pass it around
We'll run you right outta this town
Why don't you pass it around?
Don't bring the party down
If you don't pass it around
We'll run you right outta this town

Pass that glass! Pass it around!
Pass that glass! Pass it around!
Pass that glass! Pass it around!
Pass it around, don't bring the party down!


Saturday night, don't really wanna fight
You get none if you didn't pay
Tell your little brother to go buy another
And give me back my Tankeray

But there's always someone who's gotta spoil it for the rest of the gang
You're such a little Bogart, and I'm sorry, but you just can't hang
Why don't you pass it around?
Don't bring the party down
If you don't pass it around
We'll run you right outta this town
Are you pickin' up what I'm putting down?
Why don't you pass it around?
Don't bring the party down
If you don't pass it around
