I'm an American teenage raider
You better be in by eleven o'clock
But I never come in 'til later
What you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?
I ain't in to going steady
Don't do this, don't do that
I'll grow up when I'm ready
And I don't wanna be just a weekend kid
I wanna party whenever I can

'Cause I don't care about going to school
And I don't care about having friends
And I don't care 'cause I'm a rock 'n' roll machine
It's a Saturday night
And I'm looking for some party action
I don't care about getting laid
I want some quick and easy satisfaction
What you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?
I ain't in to going steady
Don't do this, don't do that
I'll grow up when I'm ready
And I don't wanna be just a weekend kid
I wanna party whenever I can
You might also like
'Cause I don't care about going to school
And I don't care about having friends
And I don't care 'cause I'm a rock 'n' roll machine
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
It's a Saturday night
And I'm looking for some party action
I don't care about getting laid
I want some quick and easy satisfaction
What you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?
I ain't in to going steady
Don't do this, don't do that
I'll grow up when I'm ready
And I don't wanna be just a weekend kid
I wanna party whenever I can

'Cause I don't care about going to school
And I don't care about having friends
And I don't care 'cause I'm a rock 'n' roll machine
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
