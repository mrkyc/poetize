Heard you're in the booty club, tryna get a new love
I wanted to scream and shout
But I went home, just picked up the phone
Cleared your bank account out
It's gonna be such a shame
What I'm gon' do to you
Revenge is a must when my heart you crush
You know I'm gon' burn your house to dust
Cause a girl really gets so serious
When you really make a girl so furious
It's such a shame
What I'm gon' do to you

This is the last time
That I'm gon' let you get away
With all these games that you're playing with me
(You better quit playing with me)
Cause I kept seeing the signs
But I ignored them anyway
I once was blind but now I see
(Oh I see your game going)

Cause when you came home last night
You just wasn't smellin' right
And that look in your eyes
Was telling me what is going on
What the hell is that smell?
Could it be someone else?
(Oh so you try-na play me)
Oh, what I'm gon do...

Cause a girl really gets so serious
When you really make a girl so furious
It's such a shame
What I'm gon' do to you

I'm getting so tired of you always coming in late
With the scent of some female on your face
(What's that smell?)
There's only so much I can take
And you know 'homeless' just might be your fate
If you keep pushing the limit with me
(He-heh I wouldn't do that if I was you)

Cause when you came home last night
You just wasn't smellin' right
And that look in your eyes
Was telling me what is going on
What the hell is that smell?
Could it be someone else?
(Oh so you try-na play me)
