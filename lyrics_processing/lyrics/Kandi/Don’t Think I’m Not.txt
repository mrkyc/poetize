Now, I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie
But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone, I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot
Getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot
Getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine

When I try to get your attention
You ignore me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt that
You didn't notice mine
Well, I couldn't put up with your schemin'
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs won't make it right
But it's suiting me just fine

When you're feeling good in somebody's spot
Getting hot, don't stop

Don't be so surprised to know that sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it but it's real
The game is so real (Game is so real)
So real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it
When you're out in the club

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not (Don't think)
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not (I'm not)
