This song
Is dedicated to my brother
Patrick Odell Riley
Ooh
Oh-oh, ooh

I was in misery without you
I could not imagine life without you
It was such a painful thing to go through
Have you being taken away
But I, I dried my tears
Even though it took a couple of years
I guess I had to just let go over my fears
Of being alone
But it gets

It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
You might also like
I thought my life was over without you
Thought I would be oh, so sad, darling
Cause you left me here, to face all my fears
All by myself, with nobody else
Now that you're gone, I just gotta move on
But my loving's never changed, it'll always stay the same
I felt you were wrong, the lonely nights alone
I get weak, then I'm strong
It gets easier

It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier

Sometimes it's really hard to just let go
Don't feel like moving on, oh, yeah I know
Just breathing air is hard to bear
When the one that you love is not there
Thoughts of you sit heavy on my mind
I always reminisce on our good times
I just take it day by day
I know that it'll never be easy
But I can say it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
But it gets, it gets easier
It gets, it gets easier
Without you
I won't feel right, I can't feel right, without you
