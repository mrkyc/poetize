I was a sucka for you
So crazy in love with you
But I'll be damned if I do
Nothing else you want me to do
Cause I got played for the fool
And you know that wasn't cool
You made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust 'em

I thought it was all good, me and you
Sayin' that you my boo
But never knew that you was doin' the do
With every girl, givin' out hoochie coo
But now I find, and it just blows my mind
That everytime, I said that you were mine
They were laughin' behind my back and
When I found out, I was so sad

Then I said hold up, wait a minute
Slow down, turn around
Are you really gonna let that bull-shhh go down
Letting him back now, I don't see how
When you know that he's been getting around
With every girl in town, throwing down
And everybody knows about it
Made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust em
You might also like
I was a sucka for you (I was)
So crazy in love with you (So crazy)
But I'll be damned if I do
Nothing else you want me to do
Cause I got played for the fool (The fool)
And you know that wasn't cool (Not cool)
You made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust 'em (Oh no, no)

I thought I had turned you out
Cause you told me I was the fire
Never knew that was just a line
That you said just to get my time
You had me feelin' like such a fool
Cause I gave you the booty too
You were playin' with my head
Just to get me in your bed

Then I said hold up, wait a minute
Slow down, turn around
Are you really gonna let that bull-shhh go down
Letting him back now, I don't see how
When you know that he's been getting around
With every girl in town, throwing down
And everybody knows about it
Made it harder for the brothas
'Cause of you, I just don't trust em
I was a sucka for you (I was)
So crazy in love with you (So crazy)
But I'll be damned if I do
Nothing else you want me to do
Cause I got played for the fool
And you know that wasn't cool
You made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust 'em
I was a sucka for you
So crazy in love with you (Oh no, no)
But I'll be damned if I do
Nothing else you want me to do (I won't do, no)
Cause I got played for the fool
And you know that wasn't cool
You made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust 'em
