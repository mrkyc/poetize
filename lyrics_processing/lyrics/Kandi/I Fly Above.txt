I, I fly above, fly above
I'm so comfortable in the skin I'm in
I'm secure about who I am
So you can go ahead and talk all you wanna
I built up a shell and it's hard and it's armored
It seems like every step I take up
Drama comes along with the bread, I cake up
But you ain't doing nothin' if you don't have haters
So I welcome you to do what's in your nature
I'm like a jet airplane, way too high
To hear you throwing salt on my name
I know I'm not the only one who people love to hate
You go and throw your hands up
Go ahead and spread your wings
'Cause you gotta fly above
I fly above all the drama
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
So I fly above all the haters
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
If everybody hatin' 'cause you fly
Then go and throw your hands in the sky
If people jealous 'cause you live yo life
Then go and throw your hands in the sky
See, I ain't even worried 'bout you and your insecurities
The only thing that matters is my family and GOD
I'm a shooting star but my feet still on the ground
And when you're flying high, they just wanna shoot you down
I'm like a jet airplane, way too high
To hear you throwing salt on my name
I know I'm not the only one who people love to hate
You go and throw your hands up
Go ahead and spread your wings
'Cause you gotta fly above
I fly above all the drama
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
So I fly above all the haters
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
All you haters, you're the wind beneath my wings
You just make me fly higher, higher, higher, ooh
You just make me fly higher
Make me fly high, make me fly high
Make me fly higher
You just make me fly
Make me fly higher
I'm like a jet airplane, way too high
To hear you throwing salt on my name
I know I'm not the only one who people love to hate
You go and and throw your hands up
Go ahead and spread your wings
'Cause you gotta fly above
I fly above all the drama
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
So I fly above all the haters
I, I fly above, I, I fly above, I, I fly above
It's beneath me, it's beneath me
It's beneath me
