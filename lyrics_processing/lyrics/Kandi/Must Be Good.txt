Breaking all her plans
Don't wanna do nothing
But hang up under her man
It must be good, good, good
It must be good, good, good

Chasing women
Somebody tryna tell her
But she ain't listening
It must be good, good, good
It must be good, good, good
It must be gooooo, oooo, ooooo, oooood
Good like a lollipop
Good like a candy yam
Good like the wham-bam
Da, da, da damn
It must be gooooo, oooo, ooooo, oooood
Good like a jawbreaker
Good like a baby maker
Good enough to make her just forget all the haters
