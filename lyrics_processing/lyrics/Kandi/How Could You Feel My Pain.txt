How could you do it?
Jeopardize our family
Jeopardize our hopes and dreams
Jeopardize you and me
How could you do it?
When she don't even look that good
And she don't even dress that good
And she ain't even half as good as me
Oh, how could you break me down
When I'm the one who lifts you up
I am the one who loved you good
I am the one who loved you
Loved you, loved you
But you don't care, do you?
No, you don't care, do you
I wish you could feel my pain
It's like you stuck a knife in my heart
And turned it 'round
Like you drove a car
And knock me down
I wish you could feel my pain

Take her out so folks can see her
Be out and embarrass me
And have our business in the street
How could you do it?
Buy her all kinds of gifts
Take her on a fancy trip
While I am home with your kids
How could you break me down
While I'm the that lifts you up
I am the one how loved you good
I am the one how loved you
Loved you, loved you
But you don't care do you?
No, you don't care, do you?
I wish you could feel my pain
It's like you stuck a knife in my heart
And turned it 'round
Like you drove a car
And knock me down
I wish you could feel my pain
How could you do me
The way you do me
How could you say you love me
And still make me cry
Time after time, oh you just
Break me down and down and down and down
Break me down and down and down and down
It's like you stuck a knife in my heart
And turned it 'round
Like you drove a car
And knock me down
Knock me down, knock me down
