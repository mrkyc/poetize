Since you've found love elsewhere
I try to move on and pretend like I don't care
I try to get you out of my head, baby boy
I swear
But the more I try
The more I die inside
I try to not look when I see you out hanging with her
I try to be cool and seeing ya'll don't hurt
I try to fake a smile
But sometimes that don't work
Cause the more I try I die inside
I try to keep going like everything's still all good
I try to stop myself from driving by your neighborhood
And I tried to throw away your old letters
But I just can't do it
Cause the more I try
I die inside
La, la, la, la
(The more I try)
La, la, la, la
(The more I try)
La, la, la, la, la
(The more I try)
The more I try
The more I die inside
You might also likeI try to change the radio
Every time I hear our song
I tried to erase your number off my cell phone
I try to still be your friend
But I ain't that strong
Cause the more I try
The more I die inside
I walked away from you
But somehow you still have my heart
And even though we've grown apart
I wish I could be where you are
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried
I've tried to get you out of my mind
But it seems the more I try
The more I die
La, la, la, la
(The more I try)
{I try, I try, I try}
La, la, la, la
(The more I try)
{To get you out of my mind, baby}
La, la, la, la, la
(The more I try)
(Oh, I miss you, boy, I miss you so)
The more I try
The more I die inside
I try to tell myself
I should let your memory go
I try not to reminisce about you
And just give up hope
I try to keep pretending
That I'm really happy for you both
But the more I try
