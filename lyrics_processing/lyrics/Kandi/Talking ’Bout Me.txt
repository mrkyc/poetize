My woman's gotta have skills in the kitchen
She's gotta keep it real with nothing missing
(You talkin' bout me)
And when she hanging with her girls, getting tipsy
She call me where she at and say she miss me
(Yeah, you talkin' bout me)
She gotta give me good lovin' though the night now
No matter where she at she be like 'right now'
(You talkin' bout me?)
And when a brother's goin' through some of that raw stuff
She got my back like 'sho nuff
(Yeah, you talkin' bout me)

As a woman, it's my job
To make sure my man is happy
Always assure him
That he has all that he needs in me
As a woman, it's my job
To make sure he's so satisfied
Keep it tight, day and night
So that I never have to worry 'bout him straying

See I'm a real woman who wants a real man
And when I find him, I'm gonna keep him all I can
You'll never catch me stressin' him
You'll only find me lovin' him
I'm a real woman who wants a real man
And when I meet him, I'll give him all I can
You'll never find me tripping on him
I'll only be giving love to him

Every man wants a woman
Who really has the skill to cook his meals
Mac and cheese, collard greens, cream corn, baked beans
I'm a Southern lady, my cooking's got him crazy
I hear they all want a woman
Who can rock 'em all night, make 'em feel right
Do a lot of tricks and keep him hyped
You know, the housewife freak type

You talkin' bout me? 'Bout me?
Boy, don't you see

Boy don't you see?

Real, check it out
From the first time I met her, I knew she was heaven sent (Uh-huh)
After bomb sex, it's been on ever since (Damn)
Caramel complexion, lips sweet as candy
Perfect vision, standing in the t-shirt and panties
From the kitchen to the sheets, and next to me at the Grammy's
Thinking "damn, got a best friend like Brandy"
Never stressing when I run the streets with my family
Sometimes it seems she's the only one that understands me
No need to creep, she knows what I like
On top of that, keeps me laced from my neck to my Nikes
Got my back when I'm , holds me close on cold nights
Accepts my collects,  spoiled wife
Searching my whole life for Ms. Right
Home-cooked meals and good sex, just a little bit of spice
With my luck, I know I only get one in this world
And thus Westside riders love big Southern girls
