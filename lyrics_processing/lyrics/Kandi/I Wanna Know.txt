If you got kids back home, I wanna know
If you don't, I wanna know
If you're straight or ya ain't, I wanna know
If you're broke, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know

If you wanna be with me, I gotta know
What you doin', where you're goin'
Where you have been
Who you loved, who you liked, who you seein'
Before I let you in
Because I learned from my past, oh yes I did
Met a guy that I liked, he was my type
But he lied 'bout his wife and he tried
To play me, play me

Now how long was he gon'
Wait before he told me 'bout that
I can't believe he did me like that
Something I should've known, oh yeah
But I've learned my lesson
Not again will I be naive
I need to know the secret ya'll keep
Cause what I don't know can come back on me

Deal with cheatin', but not that way
