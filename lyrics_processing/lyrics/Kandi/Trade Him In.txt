You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You thought I was playing
I told you I was so sick and tired of complaining
That's why I finally traded you in
I treated you like royalty
But you didn't ever wanna give me the same courtesy
You treated me like a toy that you didn't need
Kept me in a box
And every now and then
You played with me
I tried and tried
And tried to tell you how I felt
But you kept on doing your thing like you just didn't care
Something 'bout the time I told you that I wouldn't share
But I guess you thought that I would never go nowhere no, no
Now you're missing my kisses
You're missing my hugs
You're missing my juice box
You're missing my love
You took me for granted like I wasn't enough
That's why I finally traded you in
That's why I traded you in

Let's ride and hold your head high
And trade him in
Trade him in
Now you begging, baby, please
Cause you missing all the good love that you used to get from me
You miss how I do every single thing you like
But now I be using them tricks on somebody else tonight
Guess you ain't heard when a woman's fed up and through
There's nothing in the world
That'll make her come right back to you
You never ever thought that I would make a move
How long you thought I'd sit and be played like a fool
You thought I was playing
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Why thought I was playing
I told you I was so sick and tired of complaning
I was waiting for you was straying
That's why I finally traded you in
That's why I traded you in

That's why I traded you in

Trade him in

She hired me
Then fired me
She hired me
Then fired me
She fired me
I'm tired
Said she stayed out
So she lied to me
Untradeable
Unfadeable
Tell B I'm irreplaceable
Gucci cash
Is that's fine and dandy
Let me see you step it up
Never will I stress
One on to the next one
Just missed a good one
Always trying flex something
Would you leave a keeper?
Trade a Bentley for a reagle
Evidently bluntly speaking
Me and him are not an equal
Fifty grand
One shoulder shower
He make 13 bucks an hour
We make love each night for hours
He don't beat that thing with power
Tell the truth
That boy's a coward
Come back
I can't live without you
He say let me get that out
Ya sorry
Send that boy some flowers
If he don't act right, girl
(Trade him in)
If he breaking you down, girl
(Trade him in)
Treat him like a car
And get a new model
Trade him in
Trade him in
If he got screw loose
(Trade him in)
If he slow you down
(Trade him in)
All my girls
Let's ride and hold your head high
And trade him in
Trade him in
Trade him in
Trade him in
