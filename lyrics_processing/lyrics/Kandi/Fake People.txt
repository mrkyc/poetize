They always want something for nothing
But they ain't doing nothing for me
I can't fuck with fake people
Smile in my face no doubt while you plotting on me
I can't fuck with  em' no way
I'm good on you, I'm good on you
I'm riding around making moves while you do what you do
Fucking over good people like me
So I'm good on you, I'm good on you
I'm cool on you, I'm cool on you
I gotta protect my energy from people like you
'Cause you don't mean me no good
(Oh no)
Now here you come
(Oh no)
With all that dumb dumb dumb
There once was a time when we were cool
But that was before I finally saw through you
(Aye yo, aye yo)
You're a user
(Aye yo, aye yo)
Such an abuser
So please don't hug me, please don't touch me
Please miss me with that fake shit
You might also likeI can't fuck with you

I can't fuck with fake people
They always want something for nothing
But they ain't doing nothing for me

Smile in my face no doubt while you plotting on me
I can't fuck with fake people
They always want something for nothing
But they ain't doing nothing for me
I can't fuck with fake people
Smile in my face no doubt while you plotting on me
See that fake shit, becomes a cell
'Cause you can get out, and be yourself
Being fake has you overwhelmed
It's starting to affect your health
'Cause you keep stressing
About what I'm doing
How I make moves and
Wonder how I do it
'Cause I cut off all the people who don't wish me well
Cut off all the people who don't wish me well
Throw up the middle finger, tell em' go to hell
Bitch get out my pocket, get it for yourself
Who's gonna post my bail
You gon' fuck around and make me go to jail
I don't fuck with you
I don't fuck with you
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I can't fuck with fake people
