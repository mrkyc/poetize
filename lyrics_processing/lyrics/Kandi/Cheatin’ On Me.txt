Oh, I can't believe it

When I got home last night
Something didn't seem right
I think I know what's goin' on
There's been another hoe in my home

Cigarettes in the trash, he doesn't even smoke
Two glasses in the sink, the Dom is still cold
Trojans come in three, but one is gone
Hell no, I said I know what's goin' on

My man's been cheatin' on me (My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me (Oh, yeah-yeah)
My man's been cheatin' on me (My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me (Cheatin' on me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How could he do this to me?
Turn around and smile in my face
While he was out with somebody else
Doin' her in my place?

Cigarettes in the trash, he doesn't even smoke
Two glasses in the sink, the Dom is still cold
Trojans come in three, but one is gone
Hell no, I said this brother's got to go, yeah

So, what am I supposed to do
When I put my trust in you?
And what am I supposed to say
When you gave my love away?
I gave you all my love
Repaid me with your lies
Not checkin' for your games
Don't wanna hear your alibis
And now, I'm out the door
'Cause I just can't take it no more

Cheatin' on, cheatin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me
Creepin' on, creepin' on (Creepin' on, creepin' on)
Creepin' on, creepin' on me (Cheatin' on me)
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me
Creepin' on, creepin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me
My man's been cheatin' on me (My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me (Oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh)
My man's been cheatin' on me (My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me (Cheatin' on me, cheatin' on me, yeah)
My man's been cheatin' on me (Boy, I gave you everything, but I guess that wasn't enough)
My man's been cheatin' on me ('Cause you would give it away, all of my lovin', oh)
My man's been cheatin' on me (How could you do it, how could you do it?)
