Yeah, I want you and I want you to want me too, baby
Yeah, I want you and I want you to want me, yeah
I've been wondering what you're thinking
Every day, hanging out as friends
I can't wait 'til next time that we meet again
I walk away hoping you grab my hand and share how you feeling
I wanna tell you how you make me feel so warm inside
How all day I think of you and can't get you off my mind, no
When I'm with you I hate when it's time to say goodbye
And I hope this feeling is mutual tonight
Ain't no need in playing games
'Cause I want you and I want you to want me, yeah
And I hope you feel the same
I want you and I want you to want me too, baby
I want you and I want you to want me too, baby
I want you and I want you to want me, yeah
I don't want seem aggressive, but why wait around on you to step to me?
'Cause I just miss my opportunity
So here I am showing you all my cards
I'm gambling with my heart
