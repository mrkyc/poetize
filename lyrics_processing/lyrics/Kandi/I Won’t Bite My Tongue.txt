You stood there, thinkin' you were all that
And I did too
You took too long to step to me
So I just stepped to you, uh
We talked all night about all
That you could do
If I could've foreseen what's behind the jeans
So I'd have never talked to you, ha

'Cause damn, I thought you'd be packin' and
Damn, I thought you'd put your back in it
Damn, no you didn't, so you're finished
And I gotta let you know
'Cause you gotta lose my number
Damn, you had the worst sex and
Damn, you didn't last a second
Damn, no you didn't, so you're finished
And I gotta let you go

I won't bite my tongue (I won't)
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (I won't)
Our first will be your last (I won't)
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know (You need to know)
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know
You might also like
Don't kid yourself, baby
I'm not impressed
You talk too much, couldn't back it up
And your stroke was just a mess
I won't bite my tongue
'Cause you said that I would be sprung
I can't tell what you did to me
'Cause before I got mine, you were done

'Cause damn, I thought you'd be packin' and
Damn, I thought you'd put your back in it
Damn, no you didn't, so you're finished
And I gotta let you know
'Cause you gotta lose my number
Damn, you had the worst sex and
Damn, you didn't last a second
Damn, no you didn't, so you're finished
And I gotta let you go (Go)

I won't bite my tongue (I won't)
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (I won't, I won't)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know (You need to know)
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know
Before you take me (Take me)
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Make sure that you know how to make me (Make me)
Fulfill me (Fulfill me)
If not, don't you come my way

Oh no (Oh no)
Oh no (Oh no, oh no)
Oh noooo
Oh no, no, no (No no no, no no no, no no no)
'Cause I won't, I won't

I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know (You need to know)
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know (You need to know)
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none (Get none)
Our first will be your last (Your last)
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none
Our first will be your last
The D was trash, sorry-ass, and you need to know
I won't bite my tongue
You wasn't good, so you can't get none
Our first will be your last (Baby)
