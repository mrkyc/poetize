To all my single mothers out there
Turn this song up
And if your mom, sister, cousin or whoever is a single mother
Turn this song up
Tiny
Try to maintain, keep my head up and do the right thing
Stay living like a queen
But everyday im paying for the gifts and the money I receive
From the hustling to the mourning
I never thought I never seen you and I
And now all my kids wanna know why
Daddy's been gone (for so long)
But they need a man in their life
Kandi
Single mothers
Now do yall hear me
Like a real struggle
Hands up if yall feel me
Chorus (Tiny)
If you're the only one that takes care of home
Then girl you're a superwoman (you're a superwoman)
If the daddy done left you alone (if the daddy let go)
Then girl you're a superwoman (you're a superwoman)
If you be working all the time for your child with a smile (child with a smile)
You're a superwoman (a superwoman)
If you sacrifice to better your child's life (to better your child's life)
Then girl you're a superwoman (you're a superwoman)

Never wanted to be somebody's baby momma
But when you really think about it, what girl would wanna
Sit around a raise a child all on her own
Like me that why I put a verse on the song
Just like my mother
Raised me and my brother
That why I love her
Cause she's tougher and those busters couldn't touch her
But lord I know she suffered
And right now I just continue to struggle of being a strong mother on my hustle
(Tiny)
Single mothers
Now do yall hear me
Like a real struggle
Hands up if yall feel me (feel me)
Chorus (Kandi)
If you're the only one that takes care of home
Then girl you're a superwoman (girl, you're a superwoman)
If the daddy done left you alone (left you alone)
Then girl you're a superwoman ( girl, you're a superwoman)
If you be working all the time for your child (yea) with a smile
You're a superwoman, a superwoman (whoa whoa whooo yea)
If you sacrifice to better your child's life (better your child's life)
