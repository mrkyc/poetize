Haven't even mingled
Taking time for me
But everytime I see you
My body feels tingles
I wanna taste the air you breathe
I love your conversation
Feel my admiration
When I look deep in your eyes
I feel a connection
I wasn't expectin'
Way deep down inside
(CHORUS)
It's been a long time
Long time since I...felt like
Giving my love to someone
Giving my heart to someone
Giving my love (repeat 2 times)
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
Wanna give it to you baby
Oooh I, Oooh I
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
Wanna give it to you baby
You might also likeI'm tryna be good
I wanna be bad
I'm tryna hold my dirty thoughts back
No fly by night romance
I want substance
Something real that will last
The more I get to know ya
The more I wanna hold ya
The more I wanna be your girl
The closer I get to ya
I can see your future
A vision of me in your world
(CHORUS)
It's been a long time
Long time since I...felt like
Giving my love to someone
Giving my heart to someone
Giving my love (repeat 2 times)
It's been a long time since I wanted to give my love away
It's been a long time since I met someone worth it anyway
It's been a long time since I wanted to give my heart and soul and more
But right now I wanna give it all to you
I wanna give it to you
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
Wanna give it to you baby
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
Wanna give it to you baby
It's been a long time, long time since I...felt like
Giving my love to someone
Giving my heart to someone
Giving my love
Oh it's been a long time, long time since I...felt like
Giving my love to someone
Giving my heart to someone
Giving my love ~And I wanna give it to you~
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
Wanna give it to you baby
I wanna give it
Wanna give it
