The man that I was born to love
Yes, you are
The one that I can't get enough of
You are
Everything I've been missing
You are
So I won't put up a resistance
People ask me how I know
Cause I feel it in my heart
How I feel so strange inside
Whenever we're apart
I just know
Cause I can feel it in my soul
I just know
Cause I've never felt this way before
I just know
Because I've got this special feeling
I know I feel it with everything within me
Yes, you are
Everything that I need
Yes, you are
I feel that you're the other half of me
Yes, you are
The air that I breathe
You are the man that makes me so complete
