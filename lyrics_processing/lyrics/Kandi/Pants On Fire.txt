Eenie-meenie-miny-mo
Caught yo' ass right by your toe
Hanging out with some h-o
Thought I wouldn't know
Well it looked to me like you were free
You told me that you'd be busy
I'm not the one to wait around
So this is how it all went down

You were leaving at 12 o'clock
I was leaving at 12:02 and that ain't cool
But I was with some other dude
So I dipped when I saw you
You were leaving our favorite spot, baby
Or so it was I thought, baby it's crazy
But who's to blame when
Game recognized game

You said that you were at your boy's house
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I was sleep but I lied
Pants on fire - liar, liar
You said that you were working all night
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I never called that guy
Pants on fire - liar, liar

Nanny-nanny-boo-boo
You just mad cause I caught you
Thought I was some type of fool
So I did what I had to do, and
I don't know how but you forgot
When you're out in the club "Don't Think I'm Not"
You're not the only one getting hot
Yeah I'm blowin' up your spot

You were leaving at 12 o' clock
I was leaving at 12:02 when I saw you
But how could you have an attitude
When you do the same thing I do
My intentions were to stop baby
Before it went too far baby it's crazy
But who's to blame when
Game recognizes game

You said that you were at your boy's house
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I was sleep but I lied
Pants on fire - liar, liar
You said that you were working all night
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I never called that guy
Pants on fire - liar, liar
We said
We lied
Who's wrong
Who's right

You said that you were at your boy's house
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I was sleep but I lied
Pants on fire - liar, liar
You said that you were working all night
Pants on fire - liar, liar
I said that I never called that guy
