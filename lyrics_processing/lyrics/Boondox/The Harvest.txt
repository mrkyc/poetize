It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
It's the time of the harvest, your time
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
It's the time of the harvest, your time

My ride broke down on a mountain of dust, I'm lost
With nobody around I can't fuck with the cost
Of the cell phone or tow truck or even the cops
Nobody gonna find me until my cold heart stops
I started walkin' and all of a sudden, the sky became rain
Seen a house down the way, lookin' fuckin' insane
With no windows or locks, so I stepped inside the room
Anything can really happen, so I'm tryin' to leave soon
And then I seen the blade, hangin' down from the wall
There's no explanation for the crazy shit I saw
It got me trippin' but I reached for the steel anyway
That's all I can state because after that day
They say too many people died at that main highway
I guessed I murder 'em all when I'm possessed by the blade (Possessed by the blade!)
So they lockin' my up for life and now I'm gone (Now I'm gone!)
And the only thing on my mind is what I did wrong

It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die!)
You might also like
When I feel I got the urge to kill
As if for real, I draw a blank and then I'm reachin' for steel
The sharpest razor blades that made my first rate
Hands of unbelievers full of murder and hate
Used by many souls, many years on the crops
Slicin' through dicin' though wheat and corn stalks
But when I grab it, somethin' happens that hears all of my confessions
Takin' control of my emotions like a demon possession
No remorse in my heart for the things it made me do
All the blood that was shed like it wasn't even true
Wake up in cold sweat, sheets covered in red
Then the flashbacks hit me of all the bodies we bled
Was it true? Did I do all these things in my brain?
Was the sling blade cursed or was I going insane?
I ran out the front door and just looked all around
100 headless corpses layin' all over the ground

It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die!)
I got it in my hands and a feelin' rush though
Ain't nobody know what to do when my sling blade fucks you
Cuts through with a one, two
I drop poison on my airplane when I crop dust you
See, I gotta put food on the table
And give sacrifice to the gods that I pray to
And that means that nothing can save you
Apologize to Mother Earth for what the humans raped you
I race through the fields and chase you
With fast pace your back breaks when the sight takes you
Then I drag you back by the hair to my shack
Button up my coat and dissect your throat
I cut out the flesh, the pieces are so big
I put 'em through a shredder then I feed 'em to my pig
And I know the job will move a little slow
But the harvest is in and I'ma sweep what we sew

It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
(When the sling blade works in ways, it's so wicked to y'all to die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
It's the time of the harvest, your time
(In the field with cold chills, when blood spills is drippin', we all die, die, die, die, die, die, die!)
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
It's the time of the harvest, your time
It's the time for the harvest, time of the harvest
It's the time of the harvest, your time

She's lickin' my balls (Lickin' balls)
Behind the shed (Behind the shed)
I skeet on her face (In her eye)
And puke on her head (On her head)
