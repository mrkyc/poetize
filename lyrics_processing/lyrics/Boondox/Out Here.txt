(Out here) Out here, where the sun don't shine
We 'bout that hard corn liquor and that muscadine wine
Out here, it's a fight even to survive
You a lucky motherfucker if you make it out alive
Out here, all night, wolves howl at the moon
Bodies' down, floatin' up, down by the lagoon
Out here, you might get bitch-slapped by a black bear
And drug through the woods by your matted up hair, out here

(Out here) We have darker nights
(Out here) We like startin' fights (Out here)
Know as the weed grows, we risin'
Know as the weed grows, we risin'
(Out here) Dirt roads and passage ways
(Out here) Swamp, fields, and massive graves (Out here)
Know as the weed grows, we risin'
Know as the weed grows, we risin'

(Out here) Out here, you might get your throat slit
By a crazy-ass hillbilly, drunk on a fifth
Out here, you might wind up skinned to the bone
Butt-naked in the dirt and you're miles from home
Out here, don't go walkin' too deep in the sticks
Some folks got a strange way of gettin' they kicks
Out here, they get crazy and dance by the fire
To a demon playing banjo along with Hell's choir, out here

(Out here) they cookin' 'possum and hog nuts
That's mountain oysters, to all ya'll who don't know what's up (Out here)
Out here, they all about that country lifestyle
Shootin' shotguns, getting fucked up and buck-wild (Out here)
Out here, even childrens overgrown us
That double barrel sure to send that ass into a coma (Out here)
Out here country folks don't play
Chop your fucking ass up and won't hesitate, out Here

Uh, you don't wanna go up that way, boy
Ain't no tellin' what's out there and them folks...
They a long ways away from the rest of us
And they won't take to kindly to you comin', meddlin' around
They like to be left alone
