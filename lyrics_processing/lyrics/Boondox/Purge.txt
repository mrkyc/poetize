The fuse is lit and drowned in accelerant
Exposive situation and I am in my element
Fire, brimstone, bring it on, no testament
Everybody duck when the fan hits the excrement
I'm on a highway to Hell with no soul left to sell
The smell of sulfur got a motherfucker straight buzzin'
I'm locked and loaded, Lord I'm out of control
And I know that we are at the end aand I'm ready for the second coming
Wreck a neck with a Kel-Tec
And check another name off the list like a neurotic Saint Nick
I am the reaper reaping, creeping up on demons
With an army full of heathens who are ready for the same shit
Apocalypse, it's time to purge (It's time to purge)
Death is in the air and I got the fucking urge
To bring 'em all to their knees (To their knees)
This is what they wanted, make 'em bleed, motherfucker bleed

I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to elevate life here
Always have me pulling my energy

I never thought that it would come down to this
But there was never any way that we could ever exist
In a world with the people crushed up under a fist (Under a fist)
They wanted puppets but it's time that we resist (Time that we resist)
I'm feeling evil like Knievel, we will kill so many people
There won't be nobody left to make a sequel (Make a sequel)
These fucking weasels always praying on the feeble
Need a lethal from the needle it's too late to make it peaceful
You always reap what you sow and now it's out of control
The dice are rolled and they all coming up seven (Up seven)
Always spreading the hate and now it's too fucking late
They made the plate, bring it on, this is Armageddon
They want to keep us all in chains (Us all in chains)
False sense of freedom while leeching on our veins
Always selling us a lie (us a lie), but we've had enough
Time to die, motherfucker, die

I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to elevate life here
Always have me pulling my energy

Yo, it's looking like the time is right
To grab an axe and hold it tight
And turn off each and every light
And murder what is shining bright
This is what I'm bringing to the party of destruction (Destruction)
I need no introduction
Let the fire burn inside the circle of pain
And we can all stand in the middle I'll be the one to remain
And you can put that in a riddle we can solve it all the same
I'd rather battle like a Viking and put you all in the grave

Earth rumblin'
Must have summoned a two headed dragon of destruction
To make a promise that'll punish them
With purge tactics open the closed caskets
Our enemies in evil motherfuckers die faster (Die faster)
Push 'em to the foot of the line
They say that we're evil and they despise mine
My kind is killers that roll deep
Like oars from moonlight to sunshine
Destined to blow mine, say it for me one time
I want them all dead, I want them all dead
I want them all dead, I want them all dead
Want them all dead, want them all dead
I want them all dead,  I want them all dead
I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to elevate life here
Always have me pulling my energy
I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to elevate life here
