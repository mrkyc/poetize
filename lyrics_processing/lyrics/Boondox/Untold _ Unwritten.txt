Hey! Hey! Hey!
Look what you've done
Stupid little brat
How dare you! Stupid!
How dare you!
What's wrong with you?

I ain't never had no easy life
What I have become didn't come from thinkin' twice
Put that on everything (Everything), everyone (Everyone)
Born to fill the prophecy, the son of the seventh son
I ain't never had no easy life
What I have become didn't come from thinkin' twice
Put that on everything (Everything), everyone (Everyone)
Born to fill the prophecy, the son of the seventh son

I was born with a forked tongue, born to spit the wicked shit
Childhood circumstances made the motherfucking shit legit
Even as a little kid I knew that most would hate me
My uncle tried to kill me, that's the things that help to make me
Lost up in my mind, never fucked with any medications
Slowly over time went from crazy into desperation
Never learned to cope with feelings, Never felt a fucking thing
Never gave a fuck enough, so never placed no fucking blame
Neighbors talked about me, they knew something was wrong
Starting choking out my friends and they knew that I was gone
I was labeled as a bad seed said I needed therapy
In and out of schools for drug abuses and vulgarities
Sent away so many times try to fix a broken child
He's so mean, he's fucking sick, the little bastard never smiles
A lot of doctors, teachers, family members, had they own say
I wanna take the time to thank them for the man I am today

When the Devil came to Georgia, made his first stop at Covington
Looked me in the eyes and told me son your the seventh one
Put ya pen to paper, put ya blood in every fuckin' line
An angel on my shoulder, put my blood in every fuckin' rhyme
Still a little crazy but I got a way that I can deal
Now I got some people understandin' how the fuck I feel
Instead of choking bitches out and catchin' me a murder case
I get up in the booth and let the mic take these bitches place
Many trials and tribulations put me in this situation
Went from sittin' in the back to preachin' to the congregation
Many tried to douse the flame, throw some salt up in my game
Stab me in my fuckin' back and I ain't gotta say no names
Came from rehabilitation runnin' streets and pocket change
Now I hit the road in busses people screamin' out my name
I ain't think I make it thought that adolescence was the end
But I'm just getting started, let the age of the crow begin
I ain't never had no easy life
What I have become didn't come from thinkin' twice
Put that on everything (Everything), everyone (Everyone)

I ain't never had no easy life
Everything, everyone
I ain't never had no easy life
I ain't never had no easy life
Everything, everyone
The son of the seventh son
I ain't never had no easy life
Everything, everyone
The son of the seventh son
I ain't never had no easy life

I ain't never had no easy life
