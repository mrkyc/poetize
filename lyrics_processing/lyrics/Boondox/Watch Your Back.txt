Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back

Fire up the grill, it's time to sharpen up the steel
Hold your nose, light a match, this shit's about to get real
And I'm 'bout to get a whole lotta all kinda drastic
Execute your ego then throw it in the casket
I'm talkin' to these freaks and geeks 
You'll reap, retreat and fall asleep when heat deletes your fuckin' teeth
That red dot pointed at you means that you've been chosen
Bite the bullet, trigger, pull it, leave you decomposin'
I'm giving you no sympathy, and I feel no empathy
When the evil enter me from my chosen prophecy
And it was meant to be, that you was my enemy
And you see your destiny, and you ain't likin' what you see

Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back
You might also like
I'm outta control, and you out of a soul
And you act like a ho, then you out in the cold
With no clothes and frozen, looking like an ice pop
Burn your ass with gas, but I'ma wait until the price drop
Wait until the , you're comin' up 
And I'm coming up behind you with a baseball bat
In a baseball hat, and I'm swingin' for the fences
Taking your defenses, I'm charging you expenses
Thinkin' you can hustle me and not end up a casualty?
Fuckin' with the scarecrow, bitch, you fuck without no Vaseline
Comin' up short's like a joke you use for pissin'
You got caught slippin', now your whole crew missin'

Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back (Bitch!)
Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back

The Buzz Saw, they call me the Buzz Saw
More homicidal than a maniac on drugs, ya'll
Spittin' slugs all day, bodies in the hallway
Bodies outside, bitches screamin' "It was all J!"
You come a long way, listen to what my song say
Raised on a double dead-end, two wrong-ways
I fuckin' showed up high, ninja kicked you in the face
You got a blowed up eye, I'll be that clowny mental case
That'll chase you, catch you, Stu Hart stretch you
Let you recognize, it's wicked shit in my eyes
Watch your back, or I'ma have to crack it in half (What up)
Tear your fuckin' head off, smack it and laugh, Violent J
Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back (Bitch!)
Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back

Shaggy Shaggs, from rags to riches
Toe-taggin' scally-wag **** and bitches
Watch your back, if you're comin' our way
I walk around big in the game, see Andre
Slice through your neck, meat cleaver to butter
Dice your tongue off, mail it to your mother
'Cause we heard that shit and turned the whip
Jumped out and plant a brick smack dead in your lip, for Boondox

Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl (Watch your back, bitch boy)
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back (Bitch!)
Look out, 'cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers, gonna take 'em out (Huh!)
And right before you know you find the hatchet attacks
