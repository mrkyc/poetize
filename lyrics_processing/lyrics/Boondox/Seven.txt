A tisket, a tasket
The scarecrow's out his casket
Turn out the lights and lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes

A vision of the dead and the inbred of the backwoods
Motherfucker born inside a tool shed
Momma never loved me, never paid me no attention
Daddy was a rapist 30 years, up state Fulton County Prison
And I was raised by my own will (Rain)
Survivin' off of scraps and bones, bear traps and roadkill
Spendin' my days and my nights all alone
And my mind is gone, there's somethin' wrong with my dome
They should've put me in the tomb, I didn't ask for this life
When they cut me out the womb with a dull pocketknife (Rain)
Now I walk with a scythe and a murderous ability
A corn-fed motherfucker filled with hostility
Cracked out and I'm gone off the moonshine
180 proof wine, made from a muscadine
Out in these cornfields, learning all these wicked skills
Swingin', slicin', choppin', dicin', country boy, born to kill

A demon spawn, the child of a bastard son
Seven born at seven and the seventh child fathered one
A soul black, full of pain
Bodies in the field, blood pourin' like rain
A demon spawn, the child of a bastard son
Seven born at seven and the seventh child fathered one
A soul black, full of pain
Bodies in the field, blood pourin' like rain

Don't get lost in the woods in your black Expedition
On a dark dirt road, so suspicious, just trees and ditches
Headlights flicker and it's got you turnin' switches
Now you so damn scared, you're 'bout to shit in your britches (Rain)
You can't think straight, all you hear is heavy breathin'
Are your eyes deceivin' what it is that you seein'?
When I pull up in the 84, pistol in the floorboard
Blast out your back glass, got you screamin' "Oh No"
You finna know the reason and you 'bout to find out
What it is to suffer with a rusted blade in your mouth
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Bein' stalked by the scarecrow, the bloodline of Malakai
I hear there voices talkin', they won't leave me alone
Tell me snatch this bitch up by her hair and drag her home
Over my shoulder in the back of a pickup truck
Can't wait to get her home and hold her, bleed her, then chop her up (Chop her up)

A demon spawn, the child of a bastard son
Seven born at seven and the seventh child fathered one
A soul black, full of pain
Bodies in the field, blood pourin' like rain
A demon spawn, the child of a bastard son
Seven born at seven and the seventh child fathered one
A soul black, full of pain
Bodies in the field, blood pourin' like rain
A tisket, a tasket
The scarecrow's out his casket
Turn out the lights and lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes
A tisket, a tasket
The scarecrow's out his casket
Turn out the lights and lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes
A tisket, a tasket
The scarecrow's out his casket
Turn out the lights and lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes (Seventh child fathered one)
A tisket, a tasket (Pain)
The scarecrow's out his casket (And then the seventh child fathered one)
Turn out the lights and lock the doors (Pain)
Prayin' that he passes (And then the seventh child fathered one)
Prayin' that he passes (Seventh child fathered one)
A tisket, a tasket (Pain)
The scarecrow's out his casket (And then the seventh child fathered one)
Turn out the lights and lock the doors (Pain)
