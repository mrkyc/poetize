"Oh Shit, you look cute as hell. Now you move over here and let me start massaging that fine ass of yours."
"Ah, that feels wonderf- ah"
"What the fuck's up with these bitches? I got dick for days, and these hoes wanna keep their face buried in some pussy!? Bitch, you ain't even gay."

She got a Katy Perry ringtone, plays it like her theme song
Kissed a girl and liked it, now she's swearin' off the ding dong
Back and forth like ping pong, she really strictly dicky
Then Madonna screwin' Britney, now the bitch is strictly licky
Suck a dick or suck a titty, she don't really give a fucky ducky
Rainbow or her Prius mean she always gettin' lucky
Had her first fish platter on her girlfriend's futon
Hidden Valley, tossin' salad, lickin' on the crouton
No shame in this fake bitch game
Swervin' in and out of traffic, never stayin' in her own lane
She want her piece of cake and yeah she wanna eat it too
Pay her some attention and the bitch will go down eatin' you

Drop the act and lezbehonest
No more trips for you down south
Ding-a-ling, you know you want it
Take the pussy out yo mouth
You love the peter! Bitch, don't lie
You love the cock! Don't even try
No more cooter! No more coochie!
Vajayjay, time to say good bye
You might also like
Girls gone wild, spring break, college road trip
In some wet t-shirts, wrestlin' in cool whip
Flash a nipple, slap a pussy for attention
Just turned eighteen, now she on a fuckin' mission
Got a make her daddy listen, maybe show a little anger
Four shots of jagermister, tongue kiss a perfect stranger
Three full fingers deep in some bleach blonde bimbo
A double headed dildo beatin' like it's Kimbo
Put in on her YouTube, the pictures on her Myspace
Just so I can peep it, wish the bitch would sit on my face
Two straight broads tongue kissin' by the swimmin' pool
Fake dyke bitches eatin' coochie 'cause it's cool

Drop the act and lezbehonest
No more trips for you down south
Ding-a-ling, you know you want it
Take the pussy out yo mouth

Bitch, you know you want it, don't say that you don't want it
Bitch, you know you want it, don't say that you don't want it
Bitch, you know you want it, don't say that you don't want it
Bitch you know you want it, bitch, you know you want it
You went from blowin' beater, now you're lickin' on the cooter
One day she was a friend and the next she went to screw her
Now I'm massed out with no luck, can't even get my dick sucked
Jerkin' off in the corner watchin' her and you fuck
Don't get your panties twisted, shit, I love them freaky bitches
Daisy chains and runnin' trains, girl on girl and pussy fistin'
All I'm rally tryin' to say, girl just don't claim your ass is gay
I laid the pipe the other day and fucked your girlfriend yesterday
Tell the truth, don't even trip, you know you like to wrap them lips
'Round the peter lick the tip 'cause little girls don't come equipped
Bitch please, you ain't right, what you really tryin' to prove
Carpet muncher donkey puncher 'cause you claim you so confused
Yeah it puts my dick on hard to see you sixty-ninin' neden
But two brides up on your cake won't be the case up at your weddin'
Put in perspective, cut the act, you ain't no thesbian
Just a chick who love the dick but perpetrate a lesbian

Drop the act and lezbehonest
No more trips for you down south
Ding-a-ling, you know you want it
Take the pussy out yo mouth
You love the peter! Bitch, don't lie
You love the cock! Don't even try
No more cooter! No more coochie!
Vajayjay, time to say good bye
