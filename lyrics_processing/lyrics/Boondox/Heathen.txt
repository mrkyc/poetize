I'm the first born child of a seventh born heathen
Had hell on my mind since I first started breathin'
I'm a sick motherfucker with a capital "S"
They need to call up Merry Maids because my life's a mess
I'm from the bottom of the barrel valley livin white trash
In a hundred yard dash I'm last place third class
I ain't never been shit and my outlook is grim
And my chances of survival are none to slim
I stay straight fucked up off whiskey and water
Fuckin' farmers daughter in the back of Toyotas
Poppin' so many pills that I piss codeine
My system ain't been clean since the age of fourteen
Hood rats fat bag lot lizard lovin' fat cats
Snortin' lines off of titties bustin' on they back tat
Trailer park livin' straight screen door junky
The mainstream hate me but the underground love me

Comin' from nothin' we livin' the good life
Stay high just to make it but we goin' be alright
Don't worry bout me 'cause bitch I'm free
And I'm gone
Keep shit wicked, keep killin' some bitches
Gon' get it how I get it this country fuckin' livin'

Country life  tried to fuck a skinny dyke
Rush to the corner store drunk on a mini bike
That's how I do it never sober and I stay strapped
Shawty on my back and a Rugie on my lap
You won't never wanna bring it to a killa from a dirt road
In a full of buckshot, thrown off in a dirt hole
Kidnap your girlfriend and bring her to my pokin'
Before the night is over she'll be 'bout a heavy stroking
Just a couple pounds of Xanies, bring the bitches out they panties
I think that's how my pappy first got up wit my granny
Back wood motherfuckers don't give a fuck
Huntin' haters spotlight I'm in a pickup truck
Moonshine steady flowin' and my buzz keep growin'
Keep them rats out hoin' while crows keep croakin'
Sit back on my porch and in joy what I'm givin'
Might seem fucked up but this is how I'm livin

Comin' from nothin' we livin' the good life
Stay high just to make it but we goin' be alright
Don't worry bout me 'cause bitch I'm free
And I'm gone
Keep shit wicked, keep killin' some bitches
Gon' get it how I get it this country fuckin' livin'
