Drowned you in the undertow
All in search of antidotes
Something to relieve us from the condescending, overbearing Bitches selling rainbows
And Soundscan barcodes
Tell you what...
I've heard more heart come from an artichoke
Shadow bearer, my aura greyscale
Any measure they say killing's free
Cuz they know that the murder sells
All going to hell, but seems we've been here all along
So welcome home motherfucker
Now you're outlined in chalk

I choke these bitches out they riches
With a rope made out of switches
Ridin' witches down on Webber Hollow
Underneath the bridges
In the boondocks
Where they're all summoned up by heathens
Seeking blood and retribution from a scarecrow demon
I rose up out the red clay
Them Georgia dirt roads
With a crow up on my shoulder and a hole for a fuckin soul
To join a group of misfits with the same type of interests
To kill all these sons of bitches, we the fuckin' Magik Ninjas
You might also like
Outlined in Chalk,  so many fuckin bodies any fucking body?
In line they fall
Nobody's leaving cuz we're killing everybody
Killing everybody, no regret
Killing everyone, welcome death
Killing everything, in this motherfucker
Till the last one stands and there's no one left

Outlined, X'd out
Like yellow tape he's stretched out
Put the .45 up to his dome and go BLAOOW!
Let it rain, chunks of skull bits of brain
Cuz the Dead Man walks the street once again
Staring death in the face, got a casket yard space
And an opportunity to drag you back into my place
A necrophiliac, in the shadows I attack
You know it's Blaze Ya Dead Homie, motherfucker
Run tell dat

We don't need to tell me "bring the duo"
Nothing is half as brutal
But now we got a crew though
But fuckin that ain't new though
Everybody that you know is rockin' a a bunch of pseudo
While my lyrics do backflips and I spit that evil Judo
I get drunk off the blood like I was sippin' on that Ouzo
But no I'm not a thug I just wanna kill the untruthful
The perfect murderous pupil
You can hear it when I talk
If I could, I'd leave the whole world outlined in chalk

G-Mo!
Cremated ashes, hash and a couple moon rocks
I'll smoke your whole crew in a blunt the size of a shoe-box
Immortal technique, I'll fuck a bitch on a rooftop
And throw her off the roof with 2Pac
And walk off drinking a Juice Box
Put a pool ball inside of a tube sock
Crack your head open and Skull Fuck you with a huge cock
And leave your body in the cornfields with Boondox
Get outlined in piss and tell the cops to bring some new chalk

I hide in plain sight, day monster walk with the public
They'll never suspect the black motherfucker
Subject - Being a day one serial killer - guns
Dance in my arsenal but my sickle's so fun
The sun it cooks the blood for me
Just mixing the mix, at my regular job
Shifting the big, the tick the tock
No 48 because they'll never catch the ROC, The R.O.C, Whatever they choose to call me
Murder they think but me? Shit I know better
I'm a trooper a patriot that makes the planet fresher
With the bodies that lay
In my house decayed
One less mouth to breathe, ozone will flourish indeed
(HAH!)
Pay attention to these lessons
I spit like a lethal weapon
Possessing the sickest methods
To turn your city to wreckage, Who can handle us?
Wicked band of thugs, put your hammers up
Queens County Strangler, bangin you till you bandaged up
Use your right handed crutch, I don't play no characters
Real life savage, will choke, smack, and embarrass you
After running after you, half of you niggas nervous
While talkin crazy on verses, while Lex is ugly in person

It's Y Dubb ho
Coming and killin em and swim in the blood yo
I'm keeping the wicked shit breathin'
Tryin' to get even, givin' no fucks bro
Young cut-throat
Servin' em up with that nutso, Psycho, Sick Shit
The sound of the flesh when I rip it, so sadistic
I'm gonna walk in the house with a killer intention to choke
Wake you up with the edge of a blade of a butcher knife to your throat
Keep your body with me cuz it help me feel like I'm not so alone
Cut off the skin and then make me a coat
Put it on and I'm gone, Young Wicked


I'm that new classical placid
I'm draggin these raggedy old dogs off into the pasture
I'm laughing and leading Lassie out back for the final chapter
It's graphic they're gonna be Casper
I'm laughin and grabbing the chalk
And outlining these bitches caskets
Everybody wanna be bumpin they cum dumpstah
Thinkin they run somethun
But I'm an insane Usain Bolt
With the pace of a four-four slug in the back of the skull
Tacticals and Napalm tickin away till the pain won't wait no more, I'm a Gorilla, My Gorilla
You writing that fiction I'm living the war

You don't wanna fuck with a Grey Gorilla goon
I'm a vicious visionary, bury em deep and consume
Hail to the blood moon it's the year of the Sword
See the stains on my blade
Put fear in your ass call me Rap Lord
Drinking Coors Light with the Children of the Corn
Fuckin whores right
Chuckin Molotovs, bitch it's Fight Night
Riots will incite, Inside of my insight
Dark hoodie and an old knife
Apezilla bark and bite
