-shine!

This is for all my drinkers in Newton County, Covington, Jackson lake area, 

Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up a another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up another cup of sippin' on down

12 gauge double barrel, loaded full of buckshot
Brewin up that Mountain Dew, it boilin' like a crockpot
Deep out in these southern woods and far away from everything
Out amongst the tombstones, cookin' up that hurricane
Take a sip for testin', then pour a little on the ground
Soak up in that Georgia clay and now I'm waitin' for the sound
150 years, buried deep in the earth's grip
And soon they're gon' be dancin' when that cool water hits their lip
Made from the mill at a field cursed by hoodoo
Water from a well, straight outta hell, cursed by voodoo!
Stir it up, cook it to the point that it evaporates
173 degrees, boilin' up the dead awake

Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up a another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up a another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up another cup of sippin' on down

A hundred gallons of that right good top stock
Ready for the shippin' in a heavy Chevy small block
Foot to the floor, ridin' mean like an outlaw
Duckin' dodgin' road blocks like boxing with a south paw
These dark and dusty roads lit up by the full moon
Comin 'round the corner, muffler soundin' like a monsoon
I got the devils, mean as demons, ridin' shotgun
Strapped with a Winchester, case they have to pop one
We headin' for the next county on the southin trail
G man and revenue, hot on my southern tail
Hang out the window, one blast with the buckshot
Needs to get 'em off my ass so that I don't get got

Wild lightning, sugar whiskey, stump pole, skull cracker
Alley bourbon, city gin, wildcat, block and tackle
It's how we do it, how we get it to the next level
Have us huntin' bitches down with big axe and shovel
Gone of that good shit, hit you like a mule kick
Pick a hater out the crowd and hit 'em with a pool stick
Hallucinations, seein' shit got you climbin trees
Passed out in a ditch like a bitch down on your knees
Don't even give a fuck when the spirits hit your brain
Four shots is all ya need, certified gone insane
Lets get it crack-a-lackin', one more 'gain for the pimpin'
Take the jug, and turn it up, chug it down, and start the sippin'!
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up a another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
Tippin' up a another cup of sippin' on down
Sippin' on down, sippin' around
