I suffer from depression
Complete depression
Had it my whole life
I have had it so bad that uh
I've had anxiety
Been diagnosed with major depression
My OCD, which was in control, exploded
Lots of phobias, lots of fears
Anxiety, panic attacks
I had depression before, I didn't know depression could be so bad

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everything around me closing in, it's starts to grow colder
It's like I'm sitting on death row and waitin' for conclusion
Shits real fucked up, my brain's filled with much confusion
Do you know what it is to sit a 3 AM
With a gun pressed to your temple on your knees prayin'
Or in the bathroom, on the floor, a handful of pills
'Cause the fuckin' rent's due and you can't pay bills
Have you ever felt the cold grip of death in your heart?
I'm talkin' rips right in your cavity and pulls it apart
Ten motherfuckin' seconds just from ending this shit
Flames rising from the actions that your about to commit
Have you ever stopped your car somewhere far from everything
Sat a half an hour, just thinkin' of a better way
To put your soul to rest and set your mind at ease
Put the barrel in my mouth, I wanna sleep for all eternity

Dear cold cruel world, why am I here?
I never asked to be alive
Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive
Dear please just wipe away the tears
I'll be better off when I'm gone
In my own private Hell and left all alone

So many reasons just to leave this fuckin' planet
Pressure gets to me so much to where you just can't stand it
People hatin', credit problems, bitch be fuckin' your friends
A million reasons, circumstances for your soul to transcend
Nobody like me, I'm a loser, parents wish I was dead
I'm overweight, can't get a date, I'll turn my walls to red
I lock the door, turn up the music, flip the T.V. screen
I'll leave a bloody fuckin' mess all for my moms to clean
It's's to the point that I can't stand it, I can't even try to cope
And you don't know me, you can't help me, you can't offer me no hope
It's too late to try and stop it, I done lost the fuckin' war
I ain't gon' write no fuckin' letter, leave my answers on the floor
I'm a do it I swear, don't even think I'm even fuckin' lyin'
Nobody gon' remember me, nobody gon' be cryin'
All alone in my death like I was in life
Let me take my final breath, they can bury me tonight
Dear cold cruel world, why am I here?
I never asked to be alive
Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive
Dear please just wipe away the tears
I'll be better off when I'm gone
In my own private Hell and left all alone

You won't miss me when I'm gone (Flames risin', flames risin')
I know you did me so wrong (Flames risin') *Gunshot*

Dear cold cruel world, why am I here?
(Flames risin', flames risin')
Dear please just wipe away the tears
(Flames risin', flames risin')
Dear cold cruel world, why am I here?
(Just wipe away, just wipe away) (Flames risin', flames risin')
Dear please just wipe away the tears
(Just wipe away, just wipe away) (Flames risin', flames risin')
Dear cold cruel world, why am I here?
(Flames risin', flames risin')
Dear please just wipe away the tears
(Flames risin', flames risin')
