She was new in town
She was a treasure that I found
She liked to swim at night
And she was angel like
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
When she swam under the moonlight
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
She was angel like
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
When she swam under the moonlight
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)

She grew popular
There was no stop'n her
She started to lose sight
And she forgot about
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
Me and her in the river at night
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
The girl forgot about
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
Me and her in the river at night
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
You might also like
She was merciless
Her love was poisonous
I had to take her life
And now she's angel like
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
Float'n dead under the moonlight
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
She's so angel like
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
Her skin all pale and white
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
The girl is angel like
(Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck? Who the fuck?)
Me and her in the river at night
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
(Who the fuck you dissin' bitch, remember me? I was there for you)
And everything is alright
And everything is alright
