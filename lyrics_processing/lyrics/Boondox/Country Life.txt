Country life

Front porch livin' swiggin' whiskey and mescaline
Swingin' fly swatters catchin' trails from that Ketamine
We on some other level, country like a motherfucker
Ask the way I'm living, shit, they ain't no other motherfucker
Give me mosquitoes and a moonlit night
Give me a red dirt road and I'll be doin' alright
Sittin' down by the river - bottle of Gristmill
Double fistin' Evan Williams steady climbin' Heaven's Hill
This is what it's all about I couldn't ask for nothing better
Me, myself? I'm high fucked up and light as a feather
I hear them crickets chirpin', I think I'll lay back and listen
I got a line off in the water but I ain't thinkin' about fishin'

This that country life (This is the life for me)
(Liquor, cars, and titty bars, this is the life for me)
Country 'til I die (This is the life for me)
(Liquor, cars, and titty bars, this is the life for me)

I like them bitches talk that dirty south slang
I like them bitches, they be walkin' shake that dirty south thang
That be the hoes up on that cornbread chicken and collard greens
Ham hockin' bitches, sweet potatoes and red beans
Where do ya get an ass like that? Pissed off in that baby fat
Suckin' on a Dr Pepper, shorts all in her booty crack
They come up speakin' slow like "how are you?"
Always sassy, kinda nasty and with somethin' to prove yeah
Y'all know them ones from Kentucky and Alabama
Them swamp livin' Cajun bitches straight out Louisiana
The Carolinas, Georgia, Florida even Mississippi
Country girls with fat ol' asses actually let me see them titties

Country 'til I die (This is the life for me)
(Liquor, cars, and titty bars, this is the life for me)

Rusty cars off in the yard, bitches, booze, and titty bars
That's the way we livin', drink our liquor straight up out the jar
Rollin' wood, we blowin' smoke, poppin' pills until we choke
180 proof to wash it down and that's all she wrote
And if it kills me, bury me in red clay
And let it all be catered by the Ol' Country Buffet
Pass the whiskey bottle and drink it like you're full grown
And let the bitches dancin' fuckin' naked on my tombstone
