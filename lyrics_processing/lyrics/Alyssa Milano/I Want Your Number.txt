Ooh
(Wish I had that number)
(Want your number
Want it, yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Woah-woah
Woah-Woah
Hey!
Hee-hee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ee-yeah

In our time
Love is everything
And I know
Most girls like diamond rings
No time
Just to sit and stare
In deep
Or in the cold somewhere

Everybody wants to get ahold of me
Suck my blood away
They're all out to ruin my credibility
That ain't me, boy
I just want your number
You might also like
(I want your number)
C'mon and write those 7 digits on my hand
(Give me your number)
'Cause when it comes to lovin', you're my man (yeah)

There's hope
When I dream of you
Every night (every night)
It's just the things you do
So tender
When were one on one
A love so strong
*'Til the taxman come*

Everybody wants to get ahold of me
Suck my blood away
They're all out to ruin my credibility
That ain't me, boy
I just want your number

(I want your number)
C'mon and write those 7 digits on my hand (woah)
(Give me your number)
'Cause when it comes to lovin', you're my man
(I want your number)
You can write it anywhere at all (anywhere at all)
(Give me your number)
As long as it's correct, you'll get a call
Only 7 digits to love (only 7 digits, baby)
(Now let me tell you 7 reasons that's why)

One, a personality, loaded with ability
So much sensuality
A living, breathing entity
What is it specifically
Draws me irresistibly
Something scientifically
Makes you look good socially

(Baby, I got it)
*Alyssa laughing*
(Woah)
I don't know what to say!
Dance? (dance, yeah)
*Alyssa laughing*
(Woo!)

In my eyes, you are everything
So sweet
You're just a sexy thing
(Everyone, everywhere, should tell me how much I need you
Give me your number!) (ow)
