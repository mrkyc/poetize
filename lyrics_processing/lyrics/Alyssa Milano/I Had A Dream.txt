Sometime it's seems the world is getting you down
Sometimes it's seems a friend could never be found
And your lost in an desporation with no rainbow inside
But sometimes you find your dreams can really come true
If you belivie it might just happen to you
How I bless the day, that you came away
You made everything better
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above me
That you'll aways stay in my heart
I had a dream
Sometimes you think your best is never enough
Sometimes the world you choose is lonely and tough
And you search for the conceration
That's just nowhere around
But then there are times when things will all go your way
Each day of the week feels like a holiday
Give your heart to me, for eternety
I will love you forever
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above me
That you'll aways stay in my heart
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above
That you'll aways stay in my heart
I had a dream
When all my hope was out of sight
You came along and made it right
Oh, how I thank my lucky star
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream dream dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream dream dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above me
That you'll aways stay in my heart
I had a dream
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above
That you'll aways stay in my heart
I had a dream
I had a dream that you'll always gonna love me
I had a dream that you'll always be there
I made a wish to the stars that are above me
That you'll aways stay in my heart
