I thought my dream came true
You said you wanted me
And I changed my world for you
I gave my heart to you
I pledged you everything
I proved my love for you
I even wore your ring
You promised that our love would never ever die
You promised that you'd never ever say goodbye
You lied to me
Played me for a fool
Had to learn the hard way
That you don't play by the rules
You lied to me
Boy you broke my heart
Should have seen it coming
Should have known it from the start
You lied to me
My friends would tell me
That you'd turn and walk away
I didn't listen to
The words they had to say
Your reputation proved
You only played for fun
The record clearly showed
You liked to hit and run
You might also likeI trusted you
And every single word you said
I trusted you
I should have run away instead
You lied to me
Played me for a fool
Had to learn the hard way
That you don't play by the rules
You lied to me
Boy you broke my heart
Should have seen it coming
Should have known it from the start
You lied to me
When I remember all the good times
And all the happiness we shared
If only love could last forever
If only you had really cared
You said you needed me
And I gave my heart to you
But you played me for a fool
You lied to me
You lied to me
You promised that our love would never ever die
You promised that you'd never ever say goodbye
You lied to me
Played me for a fool
Had to learn the hard way
That you don't play by the rules
You lied to me
Boy you broke my heart
Should have seen it coming
Should have known it from the start
