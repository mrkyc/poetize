You should've known that people talk
You didn't try to cover up
I really thought I'd win your love
But that's all over
You didn't think that I would know
I didn't want a Romeo
A lot of guys come onto me
But I stood by you

It could've been one for the other
I've always given you everything
And when you run for cover
Don't come to me in the heat of the night

'Cause it's no secret
Everybody says you've been playin' around
And it's no secret
All my girlfriends saw what's been goin' down
You're busted

You wanna be a friend to me
Why don't you try reality
And what am I supposed to do
When you won't respect me
I thought that we could have some fun
Now everything's been said and done
I know when I get over you
I'll find someone
You might also like
You shouldn't have told me you loved me
'Cause now I'm never gonna feel the same
I figured that I could trust you
I know to you that this love's just a game

And it's no secret
Everybody knows you're just playin' the part (yeah)
And it's no secret
I was to you and you broke my heart
It's no secret (it's no secret)
Wouldn't know a good thing if it came around (woah-aoh-oh, oh)
And it's no secret (it's no secret)
That you've been doin' every girl in town

You do what you want, you don't think of me
You better know my love ain't free
I sit at home while you play the town
You think you're a man, but you're gettin' down
Go do your girlfriend, I hope you have fun
If I see you again, you better run
You think you're a playboy, that's fine with me
But understand somethin', sucka, you're history
(Hey!)
(Uh!)
(Hey!)
(Check this out)
(Hey!)
(Uh!)
(Hey!)
(Aw, yeah)

It could've been one for the other
I've always given you everything
I figured that I could trust you
I know to you that this love's just a game

And it's no secret
Everybody says you've been playin' around
And it's no secret (it's no secret)
Everybody knows you're just playin' the part
I was good for you and you broke my heart (broke my heart)
It's no secret (it's no secret)
Wouldn't know a good thing if it came around (wouldn't know a good thing, boy)
And it's no secret (it's no secret)
