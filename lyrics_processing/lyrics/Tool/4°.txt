Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now
And free yourself from yourself
Free yourself from yourself

Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
Is a cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and then take it back in

You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way
I'll kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Take it all
Take it all in
You might also like
All the way in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in

You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way
I'll kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to lap it up

If you knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way in
All the way in
All the way in

Kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Take it up
Take it up higher
Four degrees now
Four degrees warmer
Give in now
Give in now
And let me in
You'll like this
This brings us out
You'll like this
It brings us closer than dying and
Cancer and crying, this
Take it, take it
You can take it all
Take it, take it
Come on, you can take it all
Take it all in
Take it, you can take it all in
Take it, you can take it, you can take it
Take it, you can take it, you can take it
Take it, you can take it
Take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it

Kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to reach it
Just like that
Just like that
