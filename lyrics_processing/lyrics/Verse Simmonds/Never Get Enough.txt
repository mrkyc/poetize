I swear I never get enough
I swear I never get enough
I'm out here tryna feel the love
I swear I never get enough
No no, I never get enough

Sipping on all of this liquor
Fuck the hell wrong with a nigga
I'm fucking bitches on bitches
I got a good girl and I know it
I swear that a nigga never satisfied
I could have the best and fuck it up for a bitch on the side
And I know I ain't right
Man I know I ain't right

Maybe I'm just like my father
Sometimes I just cannot bother
Got options like maybe I'm just like my mother
Or maybe I love too easy but I can't judge that easy

I swear I never get enough
I'm out here tryna feel the love
Don't know how perfect they know
Oh no, I never get enough, I never get enough
I swear I never get enough
All of these bitches down to fuck
Don't know how perfect they know
Oh no, I never get enough, I never get enough
You might also like
And I promise I gave you the best of me
I'll admit it, I'm scared of the rest of me
Put my heart in that coffin like 'posed to be
Grab the liquor and pour it, it's a brand new me
Up in the club in a brand new piece
Indian bitch bitch just like turkey
She brought a friend, now I make it 3
We hit the telly soon as we leave
And I missed all your calls, all your calls

Maybe I'm just like my father
Sometimes I just cannot bother
Got options like maybe I'm just like my mother
Or maybe I love too easy but I can't judge that easy

I swear I never get enough
I'm out here tryna feel the love
Don't know how perfect they know
Oh no, I never get enough, I never get enough
I swear I never get enough
All of these bitches down to fuck
Don't know how perfect they know
Oh no, I never get enough, I never get enough
Don't you ever question your worth girl
Ain't no limit to the shit that you deserve girl
You a down ass chick, you a real ass woman
World full of bad bitches, you a good girl
World full of bad bitches, you a good girl
World full of bad bitches, you a good girl

I swear I never get enough
I'm out here tryna feel the love
Don't know how perfect they know
Oh no, I never get enough, I never get enough
I swear I never get enough
All of these bitches down to fuck
Don't know how perfect they know
