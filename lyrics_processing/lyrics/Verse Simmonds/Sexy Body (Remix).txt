Sexy, sexy body, sexy, sexy body

I need that body cold as a freeze pad
Front to the back, I'm just giving you my feedback
Every time I look your way I see you cheesin'
Young Pocahontas know a nigga cheefin
Lalalala, that punanana, on my mind a lot, the timing now
Dancing on my lap, like a MacBook drop, all night the shots ain't never gonna stop
I came to turn the party out, old school game like I brought the Atari out, you ain't gotta say much
See your body calling out, don't get lost in the crowd make sure you pay attention when we walking out

He acts like he don't want you
When he should be gettin' that every night
Puttin' you to sleep like a lullaby
Baby, there's somethin' about you (Somethin' about you)
And if he don't want it, I get it, I get it
You know they say one man's trash is another man's gift
She got it all together, got her own thing goin'
She ain't got a lotta friends, she ain't got no time for it
And she dress to the team when she in that Tom Ford
And you best to believe she gon' gimme that oh oh!
He been playin' with it
Girl, you badder than all these hoes, I don't get it
Let me get all of the things you ain't gettin'
Sexy body, your body party I wanna feel it

It ain't too much I won't do, ah
And I can already tell that you're a freak
Can't explain how bad I want you, oh oh na
And I know that you ain't had a real nigga like me
I put it on you, after you take it off
I'ma turn your body on just to break you off
Tryna make you moan while I play this song
Got you turnin' off your phone cause you know
I'm tryna give it to you like it's your birthday
Got me thinkin' bout it all night, in the worst way
Say you wanna ride all night, you can surf, babe
