Standing by the ocean, watch it tear away the shore
Glide out upon the desert, the horizon is the door
And though your voice is shouting, above the wind it can't be heard
Drop all sense of reason, it's there, you'll find your worth

And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone
There's a light to guide you home

If you stand with your face to the wind off the water
At the point of lands end where the ocean begins
Look to the memory of the ones gone before
The light and the meaning of the voices on the wind

Searching for safe passage as you knock on every door
You still can hear the howling of the mongrel dogs of war
You call our for some comfort, seeking shelter from the night
A raging rain's upon you and you're tired of the fight

And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone
There's a light to guide you home

If you stand with your face to the wind off the water
At the point of lands end where the ocean begins
Look to the memory of the ones gone before
The light and the meaning of the voices on the wind

Their words carry over water, and fall back down to earth
What follows is the silence as you contemplate their worth
A vision comes before you, but the meaning's still unclear
Standing at the threshold as you watch it disappear

And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone
There's a light to guide you home

If you stand with your face to the wind off the water
At the point of lands end where the ocean begins
Look to the memory of the ones gone before
