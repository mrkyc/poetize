This is a sad story about a girl named Mary Mac and her wondering lover Bob Needle
(Oh! Softly)
I can hear her callin'
Hey Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle
Hey Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle
Hey Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle
Hey Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle - Bobba Needle
Hey Bob
Hey Bob
Mary Mac Mac Mac
All dressed in black black black
Don't cha know I'm tryin' tryin' tryin'
Just to come on back back back
Cause I took a plane plane plane
But there was some rain rain rain
And there was no flyin' flyin' flyin'
So I took a train train train
Oh Mary Mac Mac Mac
It went off the track track track
Can't you see I'm dyin' dyin' dyin'
Just to come on back back back

Well I took a boat boat boat
But it wouldn't float float float
So I kept on a puffin' puffin' puffin'
That was all she wrote wrote wrote
So I must wear my cross cross cross
And I bought a horse horse horse
But it just keeps runnin' runnin' runnin'
All around the track track track
Baby I ain't lyin' lyin' lyin'
Can't you see I'm tryin' tryin' tryin'
Don't cha know I'm tryin' tryin' tryin'
Just to come on back
To Mary Mac
