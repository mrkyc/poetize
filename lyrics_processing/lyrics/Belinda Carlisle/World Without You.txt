If there was no sunshine
I could learn to live with the rain
Darling, if I had to
I could trade pleasure for pain
I could live without food or money
Wouldn't be so hard to do
And if the the stars fell down from the sky
Baby, I would make it through

But in a world without you
Where would I be?
Where would I be without you, babe?
(Where would I be without you, babe?)
I couldn't breathe without you, babe
(I couldn't breathe without you, babe)
In a world without you
Where would I be?
Where would I be without you, babe?
(Where would I be without you, babe?)
I couldn't breathe without you, babe
(I couldn't breathe without you, babe)

Wouldn't be no music
No reason to laugh
No reason to smile
Couldn't call it living
Nothing to make the living worthwhile
You know that it would all seem worthless
If you weren't here with me
I could have the world in my hands
But I wouldn't have a thing
