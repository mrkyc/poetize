I can't be responsible
For anything I do now or say now
I get too excitable
To control the way I behave now
I'm afraid of what I do
If I find myself in love with you
It's just a crime of passion baby
Don't hold it against me
I'm innocent
I'm just out of my mind

I plead insanity
Ooooooh I'm so mad about you
I can't think straight, I can't see straight
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you
I can't work days, I can't sleep nights
I plead insanity
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

I know that there are rules to this
And I plan to break every one of them
And if I go too far tonight
Baby you can be my allaby
And if I act irrational
I'm not responsible
For anything that happens here
Don't hold it against me
I'm innocent
I'm just out of my mind

I plead insanity
Ooooooh I'm so mad about you
I can't think straight, I can't see straight
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you

Ooooooh I'm so mad about you
I can't think straight, I can't see straight
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you
I can't work days, I can't sleep nights
I know my fantasy
All I need is to see it come true with you
I plead insanity
