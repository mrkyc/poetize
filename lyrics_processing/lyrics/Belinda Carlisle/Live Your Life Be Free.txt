Live your life, be free
Live your life, be free
Open up your mind and you will see
You should be with me, baby
You should be with me

I see you walking with her
I see you all around
But you don't seem very happy now
You seem very down
I know you feel an obligation
To her emotional state of mind
But this is the time in your life, baby
And you should be having a good time

And if you want me, I'll be there
To run my fingers through your hair
If you need me, it's alright
Come on over baby, and see me tonight

You got to live your life, be free
Live your life, be free
Open up your mind and you will see
You should be with me, baby
You should be with me
