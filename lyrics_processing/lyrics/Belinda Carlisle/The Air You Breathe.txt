Well I've been a long long way since then
But if I could go back there again
Baby would you come back
Forget the rings love put us through
Cause paradise shining like a jewel
Was waiting so patiently for you
Oh Babe
I was driving on against the wall
Hitting it like a wave
Trying not to feel at all
Oh but
You don't die from love
Your heart won't breat
You don't die from love
It just fades away
You hit the ground
You touch the sky
The tears will come
You don't die from love
We need to reason with your eyes
Take me where I loose track of time
I didn't mean to be unkind
Baby don't you know that
I need to breathe the air you breathe
I'll show you the dreams that no one's seen
Put yourself back where you want to be

Your little heart
Will open wide

You don't die from love
You don't know what it too to leave you
You don't know what it did to me
Oh Oh
Every steps that I took just told me
That the battle was easy for me
Baby just let me make it up to you
I'll make it on up to you
I'll make it on up to you

You don't die from love
It just fades away
You hit the ground
You touch the sky
