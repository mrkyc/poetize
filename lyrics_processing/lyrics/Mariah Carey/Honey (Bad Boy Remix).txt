Oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that
I thought I told you, oh
That we won't stop
Oh (Come on)

All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey when it melt in your mouth (That's right)
It's The LOX and Mariah as you check'n us out
You know they deal, a few mil every time she come out
With her blowin', and us flowin'
There ain't nuthin' left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of dough

And every current affair, we there
Keepin' your hands in the air like we just don't care (Come on)
Don't be a liar, would you change your attire? (MC)
Get a farm like Hillshire wit the honey like Mariah
Scape to the ranch and ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce

Oh honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there (Uh-huh)
And you're the only one who makes me come runnin'
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, oh
See Mariah Carey LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' (Dyin') for ya, cryin' (Cryin') for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you, honey (I like that)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you (Yeah)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey (Honey)

You know Ma$e huff, we puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem World sound directly to your town
In fact, this is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single and made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well 'cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot, I get 'em from the shop
Buy them everything they got, from the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me, wanna spoil you with my riches
And you could tell that Mase is real 'cause he do real things
And I make things that's average look real mean
When it comes to sex, I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth, I hear you still scream

Harlem World, we won't stop, Mariah, you're fire
Harlem World, we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Harlem World, we won't stop, Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem World, we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
(Breakdown) Ooh, whoa (Yeah)
Every little thing you do
(Now what we gonna do right here, is we gonna smooth it out) (Come on)
Ooh, whoa, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet (Oh sugar, you know)
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
(Oh, I need your love right now, baby)
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
(I need a taste of honey)
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya (Honey, I)
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day (Oh honey, I)
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey (Honey, I)
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
