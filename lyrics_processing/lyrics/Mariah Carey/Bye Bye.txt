This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face-to-face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye

And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by (As time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye (Oh)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Bye)
Bye bye (Bye bye)

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye
Bye

Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And every day life rolls on (Every day of life, I wish)
I wish I could talk to you for a while (I wish)
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
As time goes by (I'm wishin' as time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you (And be right here next to you)
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So come on, somebody sing it with me)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Wave your hands up high)
Bye bye (Hey)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for my peoples who just lost somebody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for everybody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Just keep your hands to the sky)
