Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Break-breakdown
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Break-breakdown
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Steady breaking me on down
(Underneath the guise of smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Break-breakdown
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
Steady breaking me on down
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Break-breakdown
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Steady breaking me on down

So, what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I will survive"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Under the smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel? I'm suffering, what do you think?)
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

Gonna break you down, down, down
Only if you let it (don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Trying to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing "it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright, yeah"
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
P.O.D. but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong
Hold on-on
Aw yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over, it's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing! Bailing!
Bailing! Baby gotta get up
Can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me, if we lived a lie would our souls unite?

Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Came to get my vibe on
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'mma tell you right now I'mma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
(I'm crying)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
(I'm gradually dying inside)
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
(In my heart, I'm crying)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?)
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
(I'm losing my mind)
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
(So I breakdown and cry)

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Break-breakdown
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Break-breakdown
(But in reality I'm, I'm slowly losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Steady breaking me on down
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Break-breakdown
(How do I feel?)
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
(What do you think? You gotta know I'm suffering, so I...)
Steady breaking me on down
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Break-breakdown
(I turn off the lights and breakdown and cry)
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Steady breaking me on down

Cry, cry, cry
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Cry, cry, cry
Break-breakdown
