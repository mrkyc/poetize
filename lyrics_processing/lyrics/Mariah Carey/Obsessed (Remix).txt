I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"

I guess shorty mad he don't got you no more (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
So just like Pinocchio, his nose gon' grow (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
Gucci Mane, Mariah Carey bling blaw wow (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I had a lie detector test right now (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
He hit my girl, word? Oh that's what you heard? (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
He know he a bird, I know he a nerd (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
Catch me in the A with a bad yellow bone (So oh, oh, oh, oh)
9, 10, 11, 12 diamond chains on (So oh, oh, oh, oh)

All up in the blogs
Saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Say we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you're so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be poppin', hood, you get it poppin
Oooh whooa
