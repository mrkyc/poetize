Oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da
Hey, hey

I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything okay (Okay)
But we just threw the blame (Ay) back and forth
We treated love (Ay) like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky

And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

C'mon, babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive (Yeah, yeah)
As the angels cry

I thought we'd be forever and always (Always)
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right, but it was okay
I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me (Stay with me)
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone, and

We were so good together (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
How come we could not weather (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
This storm and just do better? (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Why did we say goodbye?

'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I (You and I) said goodbye (Said goodbye)
I felt the angels cry (Oh)
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm (In a storm)
Now every night (Every night), I feel the angels cry
C'mon, babe, can't our love be revived? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Bring it back and we gon' make it right (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm on the edge just trying to survive (Oh)
As the angels cry

Baby, I'm missing you (I)
Don't allow our love to lose (Don't let our love)
(Don't let our love)
We gotta ride it through (Ooh)
I'm reaching for you (Baby, I miss you)
Baby, I'm missing you (Ooh-ooh)
Don't allow our love to lose (Don't let our love break, you can't)
We gotta ride it through (Ride, we gotta ride it)
I'm reaching for you (Ayy, and I'm gonna say)
Baby

Lightning don't strike the same place twice
You and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
