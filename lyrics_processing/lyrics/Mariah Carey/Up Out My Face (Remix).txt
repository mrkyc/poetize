It's not chipped (No)
We're not cracked (Uh-uh)
Oh, we're shattered

Mariah, Young Money, Nicki Minaj
You're such a Barbie
Yo, Mariah
I was in the million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away, well the mice will play
Lol smiley face, have a nicer day
'Cause pop pop pop it goes my rubber band
So stop stop stop sniffin' that contraband
'Cause you was penny pinchin'
My account's laced
Attention, about face

I thought we had something special
And we had something good
But I shoulda had
Another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by ya
Boy don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa
And I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy this ain't no promo
See Mariah Carey LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your
Momma's house

When I break I break, boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
You ain't never gonna feel
This thing again
You're gonna get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends
I ain't walkin around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby
I break
(Mariah)
So look who's cryin' now, boo hoo hoo
Talkin' about you're missin'
Your boo hoo hoo
No you ain't getting it
No you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop
Spittin' it - ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
You'll wonder who I'm messin'
With while you ain't next to me
I'm going bye...
So pay the consequences
Cause you acting all ignorant

So you're ashamed now
Wherever you been layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your (yo)
Momma's house (yo yo)

Stylin' on 'em, big B's, bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Cop those then we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees wit a snot nose
They be like she next, Kawasaki T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left
Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on it
Vroom vroom, with the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave 'em, hit him with that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in the yellow bag
And no super glue can fix this shhh
When I break I break I break (break on them girl)
Not even a welder and a builder
Can rebuild this shit when I break I
Break, I break
Not even a nail technician
With a whole lotta
Gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

When I break, boy
(Up out my face boy)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
(No no nooo-oo)
(I break I break I break)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
I will roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
Like straight up and down
I am Nicki Minaj, can't say "ask about me"
Young Money, up out my face
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
(Cause when I break baby baby)
I break, boy
(I brea-ee-ek)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face boy, up out my face boy)
Up out my face, I break
(I tell you what)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Tell you nothin')
Up out my face, I break
(Here, I'll tell you something)
(I'm outta here)
