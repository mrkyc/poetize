Let me define it
Had to fled to avoid the faina
But you still in mental captivity
Made sense

I'm exhausted
It's like ah traveling circus
Then I ask myself
Is it really all worth it
This treacherous trails
The libra scales
Under cover muthufucker
Dodging federal jails
The shit I've been through
And the shit I've seen
Sound like a script
For the movie screens
I puff green though
To feed my dream
You know the routine
How I spit 16's
I took time out
To write this rhymes
I'm a muthufucken poet
In modern times
A million times
I spoke on subjects
That scary ass vatos
Would never touch it
I'm fed up with the war
That they put me through
I feel like an animal
Caged in the zoo
I'm a jaguar
A spotted cat
That stalk and ambush
Then you fade to black
You might also like
I'm burned out
What you talking about
I rhyme for the streets
And I rep for the South
I'm from the West
I could take you there
By the look in your eyes
I could tell your scared
I'm just saying
This is my rutina
Taking out my own
Plus the enemigas
I'm just tired dawg
But I will maintain
Even though I'm burned out
That's why the fuck I came

I wish I was home
For some home cook meals
It's been so long
I don't know how it feels
I pull up to the pad
Like welcome home
Here's 80 keys
Stay away from the phones
That's Los
Where I was raised
It's the place that I spent
All my juvenile days
It was graze
And the wife so amazed
How many people rose up
From back in the days
I'm telling parts of my life
To leave something behind
So it'll stay locked
In my devilish mind
I was blind
Now I see it clear
I'ma make moves
And persevere
Though it get me so mad
That I can't do much
I'ma stay true, to what I do
They assume
That I'll be sentenced to doom
I'll get old in this world
Before I see that tomb
I'm burned out
What you talking about
I rhyme for the streets
And I rep for the South
I'm from the West
I could take you there
By the look in your eyes
I could tell your scared
I'm just saying
This is my rutina
Taking out my own
Plus the enemigas
I'm just tired dawg
But I will maintain
Even though I'm burned out
That's why the fuck I came

As my destiny unfolds
Right in front of my eyes
So many questions
Got me asking why
I know that you see
That the game is fucked
Cus we on the same page
Homie that's what's up
It's like a puzzle
That I'm piecing together
Ese best seller rhymes
Get the wife from the cellar
A celebration
A pasanofacation
The time I invest
Just to be on location
Meditation
About the things in my life
That's why I cut muthafuckers
Like a surgical knife
Don't trip, cus I don't sleep
A hundred round drum
Turn around and sweep
I look around
And recognize no body
I'm looking at my wrist
9 o'clock Bugatti
Now I'm back
After so many years
And they still trying to kill me
Cus I just reappeared
I'm burned out
What you talking about
I ride for the streets
And I rep for the South
I'm from the West
I could take you there
By the look in your eyes
I could tell your scared
I'm just saying
This is my rutina
Taking out my own
Plus the enemigas
I'm just tired dawg
But I will maintain
Even though I'm burned out
That's why the fuck I came

Take your wreckage
All over the world
While thee authority pursue me
Ain't no joke
For real, it could drive a man insane
PD's, Martials, FED's, AOPO
Man, this the man hunt
That get's you burned out
Real talk

I'm burned out
What you talking about
I rhyme for the streets
And I rep for the South
I'm from the West
I could take you there
By the look in your eyes
I could tell your scared
I'm just saying
This is my rutina
Taking out my own
Plus the enemigas
I'm just tired dawg
But I will maintain
Even though I'm burned out
