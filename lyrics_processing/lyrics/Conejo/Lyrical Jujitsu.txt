When we come to see you
The teddy bears are here to play
If you don't come play with us
Then we will kill you


I'm the hunter
Behind the veil
More drug sales
When you come from hell
That's jail
Anatomy
A psychopath
Academy
No record deal
No contract
Just a pact with the devil
To kill the track
That's what you call
Ese bound for honor
I got stronger
When i made that dollar
Wisdom curse
Heroic verse
Shot em but he ran
So i hit reverse
True crime
Arrival time
3 am
Put it on the line
Mass graves
Is all you see
You get buried next
To your enemy
Ese felony case
Entertainment
Ese blood on the wall
And your brains on the pavement
You might also like
Lyrical jujitsu
The flow is hard
Scarred by the pain
Of memories i guard
We on the ground
I go for the kimura
Snap his shoulder
Now he feel the horror
The jujitsu
Is lyrical
Imperial material
That's pinnacle
I'm up here
With the best that done it
In the octagon
Getting drunk and blunted

I got the fuel
For the fire
And that right there
Fool you can't acquire
Molotov
Holocaust
C - rock chilling
With the monologue
But the face
It stay hidden
You know its him
From the written
You get stricken
Your death it quicken
Tick tock tick
Dog the clock is ticking
Invisible secret
Awaken the wild
A savage forest
Thee attack is vile
A crazy crew
Car bomb the crowd
Half your click
Is powder now
And you
Is a headless corpse
Scared of the shit
That i got in the works
Time warps
And absorbs the force
Dark horse rode in
Pin point the source
Lyrical jujitsu
The flow is hard
Scarred by the pain
Of memories i guard
We on the ground
I go for the kimura
Snap his shoulder
Now he feel the horror
The jujitsu
Is lyrical
Imperial material
That's pinnacle
I'm up here
With the best that done it
In the octagon
