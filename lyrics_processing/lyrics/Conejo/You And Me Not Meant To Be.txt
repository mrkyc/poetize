Let Me Tell You A Story
That Happened To Me
There Was A Little Fine Bitch
That Kept Lying To Me
I Love You C-O-N
That's What She Said
But When A G Wanted More
She Had Nothin' To Say
And When I Think About It
I Was Riding A Wave
Thinkin' About Her Lips
And The Head She Gave
I See The Stars
And Forget About Bars
I'm Talkin' Bout Them Lyrics
Not Them Jail House Walls
It Was Confusing
There Was Emotions Involved
Open Up Her Legs
The Problem Was Solved
At First It Didn't Bother
She Had Somebody Else
But Then It Got To Me
It Became My Hell
She's Coming Over
Not To Confess
She' Was Wearing Nothin'
Up Under That Dress
And Yes
We Going At It Again
I Was Fucking Like A Rabbit
Both Hands On Her Breast

You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
(I Trust No Bitch)
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
(All Bitches Rattle)

Is It Sex?
Or Is It Love?
It's A Thin Line
I Think It's All Of The Above
Jump Out The Shower
She Was On The Phone
With That Same Muthafucka
Explainin' Why She Ain't Home
She Turned It Off
And Did Him Dirty
I Dropped Her Off Early
Bout 7:30
Block Away
She Gave Me Some Excuse
That Her Girl Was Coming By
They Had Something To Do
I'm Not A Fool
I'm Just Lettin' It Slide
It's Like Tony To Manolo
Chico It's All In The Eyes
And I Could See
Where It Was Goin'
I Got Years In This Game
I Thought This Bitch Was Knowin'
I Was Flowin'
You Know Doing My Thing
Meeting Groupies Out Of State
To Break Her Off I Can't Wait
Leaving The Airport
I Chose My Route
I Pulled Up At Her Pad
His Truck In Front Of Her House
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
(Better Check That Hoe)
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
(But I'm Like Fuck That)

Right There I Knew
That He Spent The Night
I Felt Like Calling Up A Team
To Kill His Ass On Sight
All Night
It Was Like Over & Over
I Could See Him In My Mind
Fucking Bending Her Over
Busting Nuts
All Up In That Pussy
Same One That I Eat
Coming Out The Jacuzzi
Got the Uzi
And I'm Mad As Fuck
But Should I Use A Bomb?
Plant The Shit In His Truck
Boom
To Smithereens
But Is She Really Worth It?
Let Me Get Serene
Cause Someone Told Me
You Should Fight For Love
But How I'm Gon' Fight
When You Know Its Not Love
I Was Hurt
I Won't Deny It
Words Of Advice
Homeboy Don't Try It
If You Do
You Know The Consequence
Lose Control Of The Shit
And It Equal To Violence
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
(I Thought You Would Die For Me)
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
You And Me
Not Meant To Be
And The Whole World Could See
