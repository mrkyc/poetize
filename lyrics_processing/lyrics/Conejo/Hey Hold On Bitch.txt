What's up Conejo?
 I wanna fuck
   What a coincidence, so do I
 Let's handle that shit
Check it out, check it out
Hey hold on (bitch)

Baby would you like
To have sex on the beach
With sand up your butt
The water at your reach
Cuz maybe if you have it
Then maybe I can show you
I know we're moving fast
But I wanna get to know you
Give you hickies on your belly
You call me on the celly
To pick you up from college
Take it straight to the tele
So we can shower naked
You're begging me to take it
I carry you to bed
So we can start to make it
I'm staring at you're body
Every last curve
We're laughing cuz we're high
Me and baby smoking herb
I'm a gangsta
And I'ma live for the moment
So I can come and hit it
Mama, any time you want it
You say you want a tat
Put Conejo on your tittie
I'm the Duke of Earl
Baby we can run the city
We're dancing at the club
And you ain't got no panties
All the trips to the bar
Got us fucking in the car

Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on, baby baby
Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on (bitch)

You look good babe
And my intent is dramatic
Cuz everytime I see you
Got a player getting at it
I like your smile
And I dig your style
Just to see you everynight
I'd walk a hundred miles
When I look into your eyes
You can tell I wanna fuck you
I'ma whisper in your ear
And then I'll start to rub you
Diverse, I unbutton your blouse
I kissed you in your sleep
Spent the night at her house
Eyes glossy
You're known for smoking that weed
Now that we're stoned
Come on, let's do our thing
Then we lay half naked in bed
Girl you look so fine
Victoria's Secret in red
We work in secret
Just to keep it intense
Erotic, acrobatic
Like a gold medal gymnast
Check this, I wanna die in your arms
Don't trip baby girl
Cuz I can bring you no harm
Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on, baby baby
Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on (bitch)

Hey Hold on, hold on, girl
I know you ain't acting up
They hating cuz this dirty paper
Keep stacking up
What you think?
I wanted to cuddle and all that?
Don't mean no disrespect
It ain't going down like that
Only killing from the back like
Smack smack
Oh you're joto's calling now
That's positive feedback
Better believe that
Bugsy do it too much
Got Sandy sucking dick
And three friends
Cuz two ain't enough
Some find that nasty
Most are with it
Come out the closet
Exotic, triple X, explicit
Don't get me wrong
Ain't gotta give me the thong
It's my Brown fast lifestyle
That got me hot and turned on
This that gangsta shit
Watch how they pause
Shake it, shake it
Stiptease if it's helping your cause
Pero bump this
Turn around with a tounge kiss
Keep taking it off mama
And stacking your hundreds
Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on, baby baby
Hey, hold on, baby baby
Stop, hold on, baby baby (bitch)

   Hey Bugsy
  Hey hold on, hold on
   Hold on?
You better come over here and then put it on me
  Yeah, we can do this
That's right homey
 That's right
  Hold on
 That's right baby girl
   I just wanna put it on you
  That's how we do it in the West
Come here girl, we can do this
   Right now, right now
  Smack smack
Check it out, check it out
