All the devastation's, you go into a seizure
Doing all this damage, my criminal procedure
First of all, they get exterminated
And their weak ass foundation, ese get's separated
Vatos ain't stable so how could they be able
To battle, or kill, I can't keep still
Any longer, I'm stronger than the average mind
You figure there's insanity, trapped in my mentality
Madera, is that Harpy's gang
In your eyes there is fear cause the calles are severe
There's no more laughter, can you deal with disaster?
Did me wrong in the past, you're the one I'm after
And I'm fatal, check through my file
Eliminating thee opponent, no fucking trial
Soy Conejo, possessed in a dream
The gates have been opened and the outcome's muerto fin

The devil's playground is where it starts
Your thoughts get cold, your heart turns to stone
I'm out to run a check, ese I'm out to get the feria
In the way I operate brings endless lokera

There's no more tomorrow, today is the end
Strap yourself down, this journey would end
Blind man can't see so take off that blind fold
I got a wicked verse that's just like a curse
There's a format, the way that it's arranged
Las puertas del infierno is where it's contained
They jump out the rabbit from the big magic cat
With a big ass trueno for the punk ass rats
The devil's playground is where it starts
Your thoughts get cold, your heart turns to stone
I'm out to run a check, ese I'm out to get the feria
In the way I operate brings endless lokera
Conejo, I've been there and done that
Open the condado up in '95 hundred
Where vatos acting psycho, tormented as dimension
And all that I felt was nothing but the tension
You might also like
The devil's playground is where it starts
Your thoughts get cold, your heart turns to stone
I'm out to run a check, ese I'm out to get the feria
In the way I operate brings endless lokera

Definition of demolish to destroy and ruin
Demonic ass acts like the rest be doing
I'm in dueling, you can't brake my curse
My perception is of death and death comes first
The complexity, the dimension that I've taken
It all comes to pieces when the earth be shaking
Explosive devices, men become mices
I'm all into lokera cause the dragon hypnotizes
You render in affected to my diabolic eyes
I dictate the words that make you realize
Todo evidently, very young I was blinded
Brought up in this world to become evil minded
Hypnotic and yet it can affirm it
As real as you can feel it, the carga hypodermic
So come overdose in my laboratory
Tracks made of steel at the gates mandatory

The devil's playground is where it starts
Your thoughts get cold, your heart turns to stone
I'm out to run a check, ese I'm out to get the feria
