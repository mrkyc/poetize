Thee Unforgiven
He Got Something To Say
Homie It Was High Noon
At The Harpy Saloon
When I Stepped Out
And Lit That Chronic Joint
Ese Point The Glock Nine
Drop 2 Of Your Boys
G's Die
Or End Up In Jail
Ese Kites From The Homies
Penitentiary Mail
No One To Trust
These Wicked Women Deceive
The Feds Watch Us
And Automatically See Terrorist
They From The City Of Angels
Bitches All Up On The Dick
So We Gots To Bang 'em
You Assume
Because I Grew Up With Nothin'
Age 13 I Started Conducting:
Roberry - Burglary
Grand Theft & Arson
Drug Deal - Gotta Eat
Gotta Roll No Pausin'

Muthafuckas Better Listen
I Got Something To Say

I Drop An "H" Bomb
Then Set Up Shop In Your Building
The Fiends Started Coming
So We Making A Killing
And I'm Willing
To Go To War For The Spot
Undercover ATF's
And Them Local Cops
Shots Fired
And One Of Them Went Down
I Scored A Point For The Hood
So I Blazed A Pound
And Still I Come Write
And Serve On Sight
With My L.A. Blue Cap
And My All White Nikes
You In A Trance
I'm In A Kenpo Stance
Feed A 4-5 Slug
In A Fucking Flash
That's What'll Happen
I Put Your Ass In A Casket
Enemies Ride Through
And Half Your Crew Get Blasted
Your Shit Get Jacked
Ese I'm That Thief
That G5 Mac
And That Stash Of Weed
That's Greed
For My Addictive Needs
C-O-N Stab The Track
Til Your Headphones Bleed

I'm The Boss Of Bosses
Not A Fucking Stranger
When It's Musica Asesina
Then You Know It's A Banger
Conejo
Fuck With The Criminal Gangs
Sometimes It Was Good
Some Times Were Bad
Dead Rappers
And Still I Ain't Done
Known To Kill With Intrigue
Under The Scortchen Sun
I'm Lone Wolf
Out The Chamber Of Death
C-Loco Strolled Up
Put A Strap To Your Head
I'm A Bad Ass Kid
King Pin In The Hood
You Slip Up Once
And I'll Do You Like Suge
Straight Punk You
This My G'd Up Raps
Homie Back On The Scene
Ese To Peel More Caps
Cause I'm In Too Deep
I'm On The Run With Guns
Ese Born As A Harpy
I'm A Die As One
Harsh Times
And Never Fell With Yay
Ese 36 O's
Off That Chicken Of Caine
