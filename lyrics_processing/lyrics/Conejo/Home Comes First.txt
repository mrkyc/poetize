First Time I Saw You
I Knew I Wanted To Be With You
(You'll Never Understand My Love)
Only To Find Out
That You With Someone I Know
Damn, Consequences
This A Love Song
Verse 1:
I Was So Low
So Many Times Before
I Broke So Many Hearts
I Did It So Cold
I Remember The Day
I Heard You Say
You're My Only One
Please Babe Don't Play
I'm a Stay Love
Until You Say We Done
Then I'm Gone With The Wind
Porshe Truck On Dubbs
The Break Up
Was a Curse To Us
Now I Miss You So Much
That I'm Insane For Your Touch (This Love)

You'll Never Understand My Love (My Love)
You'll Never Understand What Went Wrong
You'll Never Understand Why I'm Gone
All The Struggles I Took On
All The Times I Fought To Hold On
All The Things We Knew Were Wrong
All The Times You Drove Me To Em
You Didn't Know How To Love Me Right
Took You Back One Time (Time)
You Convinced Me Things Would Be Alright
Don't Get Me Wrong
I Try To Hold On
Verse 2:
The First Time I Saw You
At That Slow Jam Concert
You Was 10 deep
With Your Girls Just Flossing
I Showed Up
I Was With My Ex
She a Thick Ass Freak
Indonesian And Mex
Eye Contact
You Was Feeling My Vibe
You Was Turned On
By My Criminal Mind
My Ex Tripping
Saying Who Was That
Had To Take Her Ass Home
And Get Right Back
You Was Sweet
As Cherry Pie
You Wrote Love Letters
When I Did My Time
This Paradise
Not Rolling The Dice
And Not Loving You
Would Be Committing a Crime
Slick Moves
To The Game I Brung
I Was Raised In The Streets
But You The One
I'll Tell You Now
That You My Favorite Girl
And If I Leave This World
I Wanna Die In Your Arms
Chorus:
You'll Never Understand My Love (My Love)
You'll Never Understand What Went Wrong
You'll Never Understand Why I'm Gone
All The Struggles I Took On
All The Times I Fought To Hold On
All The Things We Knew Were Wrong
All The Times You Drove Me To Em
You Didn't Know How To Love Me Right
Took You Back One Time (Time)
You Convinced Me Things Would Be Alright
Don't Get Me Wrong
I Try To Hold On
Verse 3:
You Bailed Me Out
Before My Prints Came Back
I Was Out The Door
Before The Hold Came Back
Next Day In The Morning
P.O. Talking Shhhhhhh
Cause I Ain't Got No Job
I'm Just Hustling
Violate My Parole
You Talked Him Out Of It
There's an Angel On My Side
And I'm Proud Of It
This Relationship
You Kept It Strong
You Held Me Down
They Couldn't Break Our Bond
Wouldn't Do You Wrong
At Least Not Willing
Should Of Known From the Gate
That With a Player You Dealing
You Caught Feelings
I Ain't Even Gonna Lie
Oldie Playing In The Back
Say I Rather Go Blind
You Made That Mistake
You Took Me Back
You Trusted Me
Had To Win That Back
I See the Sadness
In Your Teary Brown Eyes
I Know You Say It's over
But You Dying Inside (Forever Mine)
Chorus:
You'll Never Understand My Love (My Love)
You'll Never Understand What Went Wrong
You'll Never Understand Why I'm Gone
All The Struggles I Took On
All The Times I Fought To Hold On
All The Things We Knew Were Wrong
All The Times You Drove Me To Em
You Didn't Know How To Love Me Right
Took You Back One Time (Time)
You Convinced Me Things Would Be Alright
Don't Get Me Wrong
