Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song

Yeah Yeah
That's Right
This For You C-E-B
See I Never Got A Chance, To Say Goodbye
And A Motherfucker Missing You Fo'real Right Now
I Remember Going To See You
When You Moved Out To SD
Going TO School There To Get Your Masters
Shit I Remember When You Use To Page Me
2425 2425 That Was Our Code
Reminisce

I Remember When I Met You
Right In Front Of The Bar
We Took Your Girl Home
Rode With You In The Car
So That You Wouldn't Come Back
All Alone
As We Listened To Them Oldies
I Knew It Was On
We Parked On Catalina
In Front Of Luckys House
Then You Sat Over My Legs
And Put Your Tongue In My Mouth
In No Time At All
You Became My Girl
It Was Just Me And You
Against The World
I Got Sent To The Pen
And Then I Paroled
And You Was Right There
With Your Heart So Warm
You Took Me With You
The Move Was Good
Especially Cause You Lived
In The Heart Of The Hood
And I Just Wish
You Would Of Had My Baby
Back Then In Them Days
The Drugs Had Me Crazy
I Was Crazy
In Guayaveras And Staceys
We Partied At The Dead End
And You Was My Lady

Verse 2:
I Found Out It Was Over
I Almost Died
I Didn't Understand
How You Felt Up Inside
You Was Moving On
Your Dreams Came True
No One To Really Blame
Cause You Paid Your Dues
And Then I Started Searching
To Fill Them Shoes
I Quickly Realized
That Was Hard To Do
So Many Songs
That Remind Me Of You
Smoking Weed Watching Movies
The Shit Was Cool
These Fake Scandalous Broads
With No Education
Only Good For One Night
Or A Ghetto Vacation
I've Been Patient
To This Very Day
But Knowing Damn Well
That You Was My Soul Mate
And This Just Something
To Let You Know
What You Meant To A G
I Didn't Wanna Let Go
If You Was Right Here
I'd Give You A Hug
And Tell Cuca That I Miss Her
For Showing Me Love
I Can't See Em'
Coming Down My Eyes
So I Gotta Make The Song Cry
I Can't See Em'
Coming Down My Eyes
So I Gotta Make The Song Cry
I Can't See Em'
Coming Down My Eyes
So I Gotta Make The Song Cry
I Can't See Em'
Coming Down My Eyes
So I Gotta Make The Song Cry
