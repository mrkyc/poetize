Yemaya This For You

Mother Forgive Your Son Venom
For I Have Sinned
Yeah I Know
I'm Notorious

Mother Forgive Me
For This Life I Chose
Selling Drugs On The Street
To My Friends And Foes
Be On My Toes
They Wanna Shoot Me Cold
While You Wait Up At Night
Just For Me To Come Home
You Hear The Phone
Pray It's Not Bad News
You Fell Asleep On The Recliner
Watching The News
2 Gang Shootings
Happened Blocks Away
You Don't Know About Guns
But You Know It's A K
From The Sound
How It Spray So Loud
You Was Crying So Hard
It Wasn't Me In The Crowd
I Got You Scared
The Whole Family Hostage
When Killers Came Here
You The Ones That Dodged It
Menace
Ain't No Room For Repentance
You Ain't The One That Taught Me
Bout The Rules Of Vengeance
I'm Ashamed
But You Still Come Hug Me
Cause I'm Still Your Baby Boy
When Situations Get Ugly

So Many Visiting Rooms
In California State Prisons (C.D.C)
You Made It Out To See Me
Even Though It's A Mission
Tell Dad That I Miss Em
And I'll Be Home Soon
And You Can See Past
All The Gang Tattoos
But You Worried
That I'll Never Change
Cause For Every Young Latino
It's A God Damn Maze
It's Kind Of Strange
Being Locked In A Cage
Then To Be Set Free
And Go And Find Your Grave
It Felt Good Though
To Be Back In The Hood (O.G.Hood)
Disappointed When You Knew
I Was Up To No Good
Misunderstood
But You Still Brought Me Breakfast

No Turning Back
She Never Kicked Me Out
But She Told Me To Leave
It's To Late For Me
I Was Decieved By The Beast (Baphomet Aka The Goat Of Mendes)
And The Streets
They Blinded Me
Instigating Shit
This Is My Destiny
What Should I Do
I'm Criminal Minded
Go Looking For Some Trouble
And I Always Find It
So I'm Rhyming
For All The Mothers In Pain
That Lost A Son
They Could Never Regain
Got A Visit

Cause When I'm Locked Up In A Cell
No Ones Missing Me
Mother Forgive Me
For I Have Sinned
Cause I Finally Realized
From Inside The Pen
