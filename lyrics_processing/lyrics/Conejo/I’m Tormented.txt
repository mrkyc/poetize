I can't cope
It got me slamming dope
That china white shit
Not that average dope
You hear the sirens that's a overdose
In the ambulance I'm comatose
Get the picture C Rock imperish
When I touch down in Los
Violators will perish
30 shots coming at you
You know it's on
Ese they don't know what happened
Till your face is gone
I'm so immerse
In the danger zone
That's my throne can't be no clone
I see the drones up high in the sky
But I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get mine
Regardless of the consequence
It's common sense
Ain't no regrets
Your gun slip, banana peel
Them foo's riding venture
They about to get killed
You might also like
I'm tormented
Como una tormenta
The war in the streets
Si se pone violenta
Sangrienta, que tengo ramienta
Bullets fly through the sky
Como avionete
Y cuando llega se lleva todo
I pull up at the place yo los ago lodo
Sobre todo, en mi codo
Loc'd down dirty homie killing todo

Territories I'm well mapped out
Disrespect and they'll take you out
No me crees then try it out
It's guaranteed muthufucker
That they'll drag you out
Cus I'm is never wasted
See your homies on the corner
They about to get wasted
I'm so wasted
But that's the business
Of me in the street
Catching all these cases
Know you waited
To hear this hatred
Some don't like it
To some it's sacred
Have this feinind the watertainment
Right now I'm with your bitch
And she getting naked
I created, music gang related
With my down low chick I'm getting sedated
I'm the greatest
The one you hated
For all these years
Now I'm elevated
I'm tormented
Como una tormenta
The war in the streets
Si se pone violenta
Sangrienta, que tengo ramienta
Bullets fly through the sky
Como avionete
Y cuando llega se lleva todo
I pull up at the place yo los ago lodo
Sobre todo, en mi codo
Loc'd down dirty homie killing todo

It's like all of a sudden
Shit started coming down like ah thunder storm
I was over here trying to pick out the rocks
Simon on the horizon
I was dropping down from the sky
Parachuting in
Tactical urban warfare
Sinister Kingdom

I'm tormented
Como una tormenta
The war in the streets
Si se pone violenta
Sangrienta, que tengo ramienta
Bullets fly through the sky
Como avionete
Y cuando llega se lleva todo
I pull up at the place yo los ago lodo
Sobre todo, en mi codo
