A world without drogas
Vatos would get high off of letting teflon bullets fly
Till death do us part

With the stroke of my venom, I say let's ride again
Till death do us part, I'm gonna make this end
Got the older veteranos that'll back my play
Put a shank in your back with nothing to say
Enemigas wanna die, I say let's ride again
There will be no hesitation, I've been waiting in vain
Strange, why do they play these games
When it's all about your hustle, heroin, speed, cocaine
Where will I end up when all this unfolds
In the joint doing life, paralyzed, I don't know
The way that things are going, shit is getting is shady
Fucking every broad, including homies' ladies
Emotional slaughter when I'm heavily sedated
Gave birth to a menace, look what the streets created
Armageddon, ese dreams and illusions
I'm the master of your wishes, put it down so vicious
Love my girl and my mom, and when they're gone
Everything that was right will turn to wrong
So don't you try to cross me, double cross me
The times are really hard but I kill for this money
Turn down in the pages till the day I'm paroled
To these bitch ass haters, let's go blow for blow
Eternal endings that'll count your dope
Got the hood strung out, gotta get your own
You might also like
Moving with the force of wind
Knocking bullets in your system, your chest cave in
Transfer, all day to recover
A trunk full of dope coming over the border
Replacement killers aligned in arms
I don't give a fuck, battlewounds and scars
Causing panic cuz my hunger is solid
Your poor state of mind got the drogas you wanted
Unconsciencely I'm sinning, beginning to win
I toss lethal bullets when I spray mack tens
Santana's Greatest Hits in a '63 bumps
Throwing gang signs with no tears of a clown
I'll get a tat on my head that covers it all
Got a bad ass bitch that fucks them all
She's all about the paper and so am I
So I tax that bitch on my natural high

Raised in design where you had to be strong
Theatrical debate, there's death at dawn
Touched on axis, I got you all faxes
Slipping into darkness when the drum be tax this
Drogas, I got them raw
Fuck what you saw, put a bullet in your jaw
You get wet or you get stuck in a pen
With a nine inch shank that was dipped in lead
The way to get this money is simple and plain
Gotta cop a clavo, heroin, speed, cocaine
The way to get these broads is simple and plain
X for the sex and the rest is game
That's right dog I call this home
These vatos contemplate us so I watch this full of papers
Serio, we engage in riots
So if you're out of town ese don't even try it
Check it out perro
This goes out to all them caniving ass vatos
Trying to creep and crawl
They get gunned down
And this goes out to all them poisonous snakes
That know what time it is
You know why
Cuz they won't be pleased until they see us go to battle
Que no
Motherfuckers don't want guerra
They overdose on the spot
That's what I'm talking about
What the calle
