I Was A Youngsta
When The Gypsy Women Told Me
About The Honeys In My Life
And How Tightly They Would Hold Me
I Didn't Believe Her
Puppy Love Back Then
With This Spooky Little Girl
From Around The Way
The Shit Was Fucked Up
Cuz The Homies Want To Fuck Her
There's A War Going On
Ducking Bullets Mothufucka
And Maybe I'm Tripping
And Its All In My Head
Stabbed Me In The Back
When She Should Have Shot Me Dead
Now I'm Drinking
Trying To Drown Myself In Sorrow
Empty Out The Bottle
Then The Cocaine Would Follow
The Substance Got Me Wired
Like A Murder For Higher
I'm Acting Like A Buyer
Just To Jack The Supplier
I'm Living Suicidal
Death Was Passing Me By
And I Just Want To See It
With My Own 2 Eyes
There She Was
And It Was True
I Should Have Killed You Both
But I'd Be Sad Without You
You might also like
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
Nothing Without You
Nothing Without You

I Was Remembering
What The Gypsy Women Said
That There'd Be Another Cutie
With The Long Black Hair
I Had Issues
And I Needed Escape
We Was In The Same Position
So We Staid Up Late
We Talk For Hours
And It Felt So Right
Especially When We Fucked
For The Very First Time
It Was Different
But Why'd It Have To Be So Distant
I Was Sitting Up In Prison
I Could Say I Really Missed It
Man Ma You Ain't Changed A Bit
And You Said You'd Be Around
When My Time Was Finished
I Parole Baby
And You Took Me Home
I Was There By Your Side
I Never Left You Alone
Never
So Damn Babe
Why'd You Have To Leave Me Now
When You're The Only Friend
That I Know Of Now
I'm Feeling Evil
For What It Did To Us
Cuz Even Though We Parted Ways
We Experienced The Love
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
Nothing Without You
Nothing Without You

Now I Find Myself
Amongst All These Wicked Women
Me And Buggs
Its Like The Fucking Unforgiving
They So Cold
That's Why My Heart So Cold
So When You Look Into My Eyes
You See The Shit Just Froze
I See Her In My Mind
But Where The Fuck She At?
Cuz If She Only Knew
That I Was Down Like That
She Be With It
She Be Like Daddy Just Hit It
Out The Corner Of My Eye
Baby Strolling Right By
It Was Clear
Cuz She Come Over From College
She Ain't Talk About School
Cuz The Streets My Knowledge
A Bit Younger
She Caught Me Checking Her Ass
Counting My Money
Distributing That Glass
Just Come Back Girl
I Made Her Leave Her Man
He Ain't Nothing Without You
His From The Rival Gang
I'll Fucking Smoke Em
If The Punk Wanna Play
Ese Conejo Don't Play
Mija Just Come My Way
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
I'm Nothing Without You
Nothing Without You
