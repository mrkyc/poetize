Cause I was so high
Off my own supply
Seen 'em shooting at me
With an MP5
Wasn't my day
For a coroners visit
Everything running smooth
Till they sent out to kill me
Used the waiter as the shield
And he caught some led
I hit 'im in the eye
Out the back of his head
Other shooter kept spraying
Anything in his way
I took cover by the bar
All my blood beaning
Ese two rookies down
First shell got 'im got
Ese out the back door
Before shit got hot
I never should'v roll
Like I own this bitch
I underestimated
How this foo's could snitch
I staggered out
Jumped in the SS
Slip a clip on the heat
Like on two way street
Back at the hood
The dukes ready it's on
We rolled out the block
And hit this foo's real strong

How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the cops swerving
So I left the place
I poured out a bottle
As I watch the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's
How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the bitches scream
So I left no trace
I fired up a blunt
As I watched the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's

Chosicasa's muthufucker
Every subject matter
Ese gamble with death
The shit that make you scatter
For this LA City product
That's very devoted to crime
I stepped on the scene
With them gangster rhymes
I got ghost
And ese now I'm the most
Pay attention muthufucker
When it comes to dope
I took my dose
And pin pointed my foe's
I clipped the enemy
I let that cocaine flow
I was raised West Adams
Smoking bomb ass Kush
Everything in my past
Bout the drugs I push
8th letter 8 tons
To the sinners stack guns
A hundred round drum
For the selfish ones
Fucking rabbit
You a Gee at this
Wear your tactical vest
The swat shoot in the head
Colisionar cops
When you enter my block
Don't try to apprehend
The one that's flooding the spot
How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the cops swerving
So I left the place
I poured out a bottle
As I watch the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's
How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the bitches scream
So I left no trace
I fired up a blunt
As I watched the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's

I'm real shit talking
Forcing the sector
Building get packed
With drug dealing gang members
At it's cold as you'll be
Ese we'll put you beneath
Baby Glock 26
Hoover mini 14's
Russian PSO's
You was slobbing his case
Detachable mags
And 20 body bags
And everybody know
How CON get down
Spit a prankster in the club
Lay his bitch ass down
Like the time I was drunk
At a downtown bar
Old school enemies
Tried to break in my car
I started dumping
Fucking strippers was running
Their titis was bouncing
And fucking bullets was coming
From all around
From the enemy crowd
Nine millimeter
Three civilians went down
My HK
Killed the one in my car
I bet they know by now
Who the fuck we are
How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the cops swerving
So I left the place
I poured out a bottle
As I watch the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's
How many did I smoke
HK at my waist
I heard the bitches scream
So I left no trace
I fired up a blunt
As I watched the news
That's how I found out
How many caught the blue's
