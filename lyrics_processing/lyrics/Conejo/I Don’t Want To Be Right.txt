The Hood Took Me Under Homie
Where You From Ese?

If Being From The Varrio
(If It's Wrong, So Wrong)
I Don't Wanna Be Right

I Was Raised In The Calles Homie Much Like You
Cooking Rocks For The Fiends Perro Just Like You
Gang Banging
To Let All Them Haters Know I Been Accumulating Cream
Vatos Die In War It Ain't No Joke Doggie
Ese This Life On The Streets
But I'm A Hustle Til It's Dawn Count My Feria I'm Gone
Moms Get A Share That's Off The Top
But She Don't Want This Dirty Money
All She Wants Me To Stop
From The Age Of 12 I Chose My Path
My Brothers Court Me In Now We Running In Packs
So How I'm Gonna Leave A Place Like This
Outsiders Getting Shot And Its The Same For A Snitch
Big Homie Slinging Ink At The Parque Today
He Just Got Out The Pen And He O.D.'d Today
Ese Probably Do Some Time Behind This All
But I Got Love For The Varrio
So I Can't Be Wrong
