I'm with you homie, till the muthafucken wheels fall off
Shout out to the whole High Caliber Family
JokaBoy, Loco Negro, Buyo Rida Fo Sho
Muthafuckas can't fuck with this
Fo' real homie

I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright

I did what I did
That's why I'm highly respected
I came from a varrio
 west connected
Ese drug dealing nights
And gang banging days
I blaze more haze
Then I spit that phrase
The law can't stop me
Nor the drought
This a cocaine world
It's what the game's about
I went that route
This a dirty business
I'm talking about that heroine
That I put in your district
I said it once
And I'll say it again
You step on my toes
Aim shots at your head
This ain't hard for me
This how I be
Shit I've seen in my life
Affected me
I knocked out teeth
With shotgun handles
And I been in dark rooms
Only lit by candles
To the skethos
I make money regardless
I assess I'm a bless
The whole west regardless

I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright

It's that west coast
Where we bang them hammers
I stay in the kitchen
With that arm & hammer
We don't smoke bammer
Pure Cali funk
AK and a body stashed up in the truck
You're shit out of luck
Come fuck with a rider
City of Compton
All golden wires
On that blue Six-Four
Sitting on rosecrans
Underneath the bridge
With the guns cocked back, yeah
I'm a beast just like a grizzly
I'm from the golden state
Where them guns stay busy
I'm a warrior, call me Baron Davis
Known to send shots through your ben davis
City of God, who the fuck gon' save us?
It hasn't been the same
Since Davis took the Raiders
All black khakis with that all black Glock
I roam with outlaws just like 2Pac
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright

I cleaned up the mess
With the SKS
Ain't much I could tell you
But I want success
Biographical verses
They fascinated with mines
I'm a D-boy serving
Fucking gripping my nine
And when I take the stage
One thing's made clear
From a lyrical sparring
To a death in the rear
For real holmes
That's word out here
Muthafuckas want beef
They get dealt for real
And you got damn right
Your shit don't sell
So you better watch your mouth
I got street intel
Naw naw
It ain't none of your business
We the west side car
See the smoke in the distance
Brick flippin'
In this underworld
Ese buddah cigarettes
All my steps get twirled
Spark a doobie
For the homies that knew me
All bullshit aside
This Conejo: The Movie
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I got the G shit
I got that shit that'll make you feel alright
