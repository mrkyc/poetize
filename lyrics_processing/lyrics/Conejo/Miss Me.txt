They Always Hear My Voice
They Don't See My Face
I Wanna Do A Show
But That's A Fucking Waste
Of Time
Cause I'm On My Grind
They Gotta Understand
I Specialize In Rhymes
In The West
Well I Just Can't Do
Cause I'm Involved In The Streets
You Ain't Got No Clue
But Soon
I'll Get That Shine
For All The Sacrifices
That I Made In My Life
But Tonight
I'm Feeling Home Sick Baby
Let Me Pull Up To That Couch
And Spend a Week There Maybe
As Of Lately
I Been Reflectin'
Deep Meditation
Deep Concentration
Its Like I'm Waitin'
For Things To Be Right
My Lawyer Say He Ready
For The Fucking Fight
Is It The Moment?
Anticipated
On Some Real Ass Shit
Now I Wanna Get Faded

I Know They Miss Me
That's What Ol' Girl Told Me
Cause All They Really Want
Is To Fucking Know Me
Will It Happen?
I Just Can't Call It
I'm Still That Angel
From The Sky That's Falling
Drogas Callin'
But I Gotta Maintain
So I Jump In The Booth
And Go Off Insane
The Shit Is Soothing
To Your Soul
I Made A Pact With The Devil
So Mine Was Sold

In Rap Circles
I Stay Relevant
A 100 Miles An Hour
Ever Since I Left
Its Not The Same
But Nothing Ever Is
I Created My Own Lane
Fool I Handle Biz
I Realized
They Wouldn't Give Me A Deal
So I Did It On My Own
Homie Had The Steel
To Give Back
To The Loyal Fans
Of That Underground Shit
That Got Me Banned
From Appearing
In Your Area Code
Fucking All These Little Bitches
Back At The Moe
I Don't Know
If I Will Go About It
In The Very Same Way
That I Used To Dog
It Don't Matter
I'm Alive & Breathing
Open Up The Page
To The Book I'm Reading
Bleeding Knowledge
Out The Vocal Box
De Las Puertas Del Infierno
Boy I'm Big C-Rock
I Know They Miss Me
That's What Ol' Girl Told me
Cause All They Really Want
Is To Fucking Know Me
Will It Happen?
I Just Can't Call It
I'm Still That Angel
From The Sky That's Falling
Drogas Callin'
But I Gotta Maintain
So I Jump In The Booth
And Go Off Insane
The Shit Is Soothing
To Your Soul
I Made A Pact With The Devil
