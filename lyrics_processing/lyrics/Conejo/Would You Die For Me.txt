That Chick He's With (Yeah)
She Like Me
Oh She Like You Huh?
How Do You Know?
I Know
The Eyes, Chico
They Never Lie

Yeah That's Right
On The Real
I Just Wanna Let You Know How I Feel
And Ask You A Simple Question
Would You Die For Me?
Come On

I Never Felt This Way
Baby What Can I Say?
I Know I Left You Once
Your Heart I Betray
Let Me Explain
Before You Walk Away
I Ain't Gonna Waste
Your Time Today
Hood Life
I Was Put Between You & I
Won't Deny That I Lied
Just To Keep You By
July 17
We Severed Our Ties
Didn't Cry But It Hurt
Didn't Sleep That Night
And Now You Got a Daughter
With Some Doctor Fool
And Now I Got a Son
With A Girl From School
Break Up To Wake Up
Is What It Was
I Recover But I'm Stubborn
Though It Made Me Pause
I Won't Lose You Again
Get It Through Your Head
Cuz Girl You The One
That I Wants To Wed
The Tears Came Down
From Her Pretty Face
She Looked Me In The Eyes
And Her Body Embraced

Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Would Never Go Away
Like An Old Tattoo
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Know I Never Said It
And It's Overdue
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
Cuz I Lied Made You Cry
I Was So Untrue
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Know I Been Away
But It's Time To Renew

What's The Reason
I Can't Stay Out Of Jail
Parole Agent Came Through
And Put Me Back In My Cell
I Live In Hell
I Know I Let You Down
9 Months Ain't Nothing
Ma Hold Me Down
Then You & The Kids
Where At The Gates
Released From The State
A Happy Home That Awaits
We Celebrate
That We Together Again
Tell You What You Wanna Hear
I'll Never Leave You Again
And With A Woman Like This
I'm A Make It I Know
Ese Get A Little Job
On The Side Sell Dope
Keep It Low
Cuz Although She Know
She Don't Really Like It
But She Like The Doe
Enemies Recognize Me
One Day At The Store
I Pushed Her Out The Way
And I Got Hit With Four
She Started Screamin'
And Had Blood On Her Hands
This Ain't What I Wanted
But It's Part Of The Plan
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Would Never Go Away
Like An Old Tattoo
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Know I Never Said It
And It's Overdue
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
Cuz I Lied Made You Cry
I Was So Untrue
Would You Die For Me?
I Would You Die For You
I Know I Been Away
But It's Time To Renew

Please Understand
That I Only Wanted Us To Be Happy
And In The End We Was
