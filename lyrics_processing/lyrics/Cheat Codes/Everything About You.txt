The way you got me goin', movin' 'til the mornin'
Everything you did, it got me sayin', "Ooh, la-la"
I can't get you out my head 'cause I'm still whirlin'
 everything, I'll still be sayin', "Ooh, la-la"

I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
I miss everything, everything
I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
I miss everything, everything

I know you're gone
But I miss everything about your lovin'
The only one
I'm so lost without ya
Don't wanna live without ya
Baby, I

I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
I miss your love
I miss everything about you
I miss everything, everything
I miss you
I miss everything about you
I miss everything about you
Yeah, I miss you
I miss everything about you
I miss you
I miss everything, everything
