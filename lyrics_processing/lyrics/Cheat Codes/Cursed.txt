I feel like I could die
And I know why
I could feel you here in my room
Lookin' in my eyes
Something's not right
There's a shadow learnin' my moves

I'm a heartache, can't take too much, snowfake
Bend me back, I might break
I'm a stupid, hopeful, brainless sucker for you
It's the way you talk, I'm in your spell
Then you leave me sad and lonely
But it's just the way you want me, don't you?

And you know it's true, it's true
I've been hung over your heart and the words you use
And I know, I know
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you

I feel like I could die
And I'm goin' white
And the pain is goin' in soon
Every little lie
You listen like a spy
And I can't keep nothing from you
You might also like
It's the way you talk, I'm in your spell
Then you leave me sad and lonely
But it's just the way you want me, don't you?

And you know it's true, it's true
I've been hung over your heart and the words you use
And I know, I know
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you
It's hard to forget it, you won't let it
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you
It's hard to forget it, you won't let it
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you, yeah

Heart keeps bleedin'
And all your demons
Get high on the feelin'
Get high on the feelin'
Heart keeps bleedin'
And all your demons
Get high on the feelin'
Get high on the feelin'

It's hard to forget it, you won't let it
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you
It's hard to forget it, you won't let it (Oh no, no)
I'm another one that's motherfuckin' cursed by you
Cursed by you
Heart keeps bleedin'
And all your demons
Get high on the feelin'
Get high on the feelin'
Heart keeps bleedin'
And all your demons
Get high on the feelin'
