Some days, I'm at the bottom of the ocean
I'm getting too deep and I don't know if
It gets any better when I see the light, light
The only thing that I want is a distraction
I just can't explain the way I'm actin'
I know it'll hit me when it all slows down, down

Scared to be all alone
Can no one else hear?
I gotta be lonely for the night
I'm stuck in my mind
But I want outside
So I'ma get it right

Like, ooh (Ha)
All the things that money can do
I was sad 'til I bought something new
I don't even care if I'm wastin' my time
I don't even care like ooh, ooh, ooh

I don't take a break, I'm always crashin'
I'm scared of the things that wouldn't happen
Like what if the sun came shootin' out the sky, the sky
You might also like
Scared to be all alone
Can no one else hear?
I gotta be lonely for the night
I'm stuck in my mind
But I want outside
So I'ma get it right

Like, ooh
All the things that money can do
I was sad 'til I bought something new
I don't even care if I'm wastin' my time
I don't even care like ooh, ooh, ooh
All the things that money can do
Why be sad, I can buy something new
I don't even care if I'm losin' my mind
I don't even care

Scared to be all alone
Can no one else hear?
I gotta be lonely for the night
I'm stuck in my mind
But I want outside
So I'ma get it right
Like, ooh
All the things that money can do
I was sad 'til I bought something new
I don't even care if I'm wastin' my time
I don't even care like ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, I don't care)
All the things that money can do (Can do)
Why be sad, I can buy something new
I don't even care if I'm losin' my mind
I don't even care
