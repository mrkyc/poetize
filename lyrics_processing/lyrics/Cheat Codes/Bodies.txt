I would bury bodies for the ones I love
They gon' crucify me when my time runs up
Mama, please don't worry 'bout the things I've done
Just know that right or wrong, I did it all for us

Like, oh (Ayy)
You know, you know
Baby, for your life, I'd give mine up
You know, you know (You know)
I'll put 'em in a bag for my bloodline

Oh, no-no-no-no
Back up to the wall-wall-wall-wall
I'ma stand up tall-tall-tall-tall
For my, for my
For my, for my day ones
Two feet on the ground, hand touchin' Heaven
Everything with God, it was hard gettin'
We done made a fortune, countin' blessings
Countin' blessings

I would bury bodies for the ones I love
They gon' crucify me when my time runs up
Mama, please don't worry 'bout the things I've done
(Things I've done)
Just know that right or wrong, I did it all for us

Ayy, when shit ain't easy
Show up when you say you don't need me, yeah
I ride for the home team
You don't gotta question my loyalty

Oh, no-no-no-no
No matter the cause-cause-cause-cause
I'ma take it all-all-all-all
For my, for my
For my, for my day ones
Two feet on the ground, hand touchin' Heaven
Everything with God, it was hard gettin'
We done made a fortune countin' blessings (Count 'em up)
Countin' blessings

I would bury bodies for the ones I love
They gon' crucify me when my time runs up
Mama, please don't worry 'bout the things I've done
