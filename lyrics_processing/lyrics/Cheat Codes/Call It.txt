I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I can't think, yeah
When I'm lying alone in this cold bed
I keep prayin' it's all a nightmare
That we're not (Not), that we're not dead

We used to smoke and chill, talk about our future plans
Feel it in the hills (Ayy), makin' more than we could spend
I still think about that (Yeah) every now and then (Yeah)
Yeah (Ayy)

So why'd you have to call it off? (Call it off)
All of a sudden, we're not good enough (Good enough)
Like you've forgotten we're a goddamn team (Goddamn team)
You said forever, you don't know what that means (You don't know what that means, no)
So why'd you call it off? (Call it off)
All of a sudden, we're not good enough (Good enough)
Like you've forgotten we're a goddamn team (Goddamn team)
So why'd you call it? (Yeah)

Givin' my liver too much to handle
Just drank a handle, she took to limbo
Cried me a river, drownin' in liquor
I still remember
Ayy, ayy
