Still caught in a new love state of mind
Just broken souls stayin' one in the night
All the space in between us a lie, lie, oh
Still torn by the way we used to be
Takin' freedom over loyalty
Doin' whatever, whenever we please, please

Yeah, you push and you pull
And I'm indecisive
But I can't let you go
It's wrong, but it's right
Yeah, the tension is high
But it's just how I like it
Yeah, you always remind me

That I hate you, love you at the same time, oh
Hurts good, but you know I don't mind, and I
Want you even after we fight
Hate you, love you the rest of my life (Hey)
Sometimes wanna get up and scream, but it's
All gone when you're lookin' at me, and I
Let you put your name on my sleeve
Hate you, love you the rest of my life (Life)
You might also like
You're like the definition of bittersweet
You're the poison and the remedy
Only addiction that I wanna keep, keep

Yeah, you push and you pull
And I'm indecisive
But I can't let you go
It's wrong, but it's right
Yeah, the tension is high
But it's just how I like it
Yeah, you always remind me

That I hate you, love you at the same time, oh
Hurts good, but you know I don't mind, and I (Know I don't mind)
Want you even after we fight
Hate you, love you the rest of my life
Sometimes wanna get up and scream, but it's
All gone when you're lookin' at me, and I
Let you put your name on my sleeve
Hate you, love you the rest of my life (Life)

Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you the rest of my life
Hate you, love you, I (Ooh)
Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you the rest of my life
Hate you, love you at the same time (Same time)
Hurts good, but you know I don't mind (Know I don't mind)
Want you even after we fight
Hate you, love you the rest of my life (Hate you, love you, oh woah)
Sometimes wanna get up and scream, but it's
All gone when you're lookin' at me, and I (Lookin' at me)
Let you put your name on my sleeve
Hate you, love you the rest of my life

Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you, I
Hate you, love you, I
