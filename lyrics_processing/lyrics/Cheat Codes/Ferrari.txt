Uh

Gimme a chance (Yeah)
Gimme the car
Get rid of your friends
I don't want, I don't want
None of these people involved (None of 'em)
I know what I did (Yeah)
Do I have an excuse?
They say money talks
I got my money talkin' big like gimme the loot
I might just be in the Benz
Just for my baby, just in the whip
Might roll up a couple of grams
Look at the stars, look at the drip
Black and red on the inside
Got her bloody like Tarantino
Makin' these bitches sweat, run 'round
Paint it cherry red, Paschino

I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
Only to say, only to say, "I'm sorry"
Let's hop in the whip, I'll take you to San Diego
Let's lay on the beach, baby, we smokin' that fuego
I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
Only to say, only to say, "I'm sorry"
Let's hop in the whip, I'll take you to San Diego
Let's lay on the beach, baby, we smokin' that fuego
I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
I bought you a new, I bought you a new
I bought you a new, I bought you a new
I bought you, bought you, bought you...

Cashed out the Beemer
Makin' my mama cry (Cry)
Guys shoot, two-seater
And I say, "Hello, goodbye" (Hello, goodbye)
USD more than Padres
I slid home like a ball game
We burn trees like it's whoozy
That's a hell of a night (Hell of a night)
Autodealer on first names
Carnotes like it's loose leaves
Spent more on you than my mom
That's a hell of a high (Hell of a high)

I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
Only to say, only to say, "I'm sorry"

I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
I bought you a new, I bought you a new Ferrari
I bought you a new, I bought you a new
I bought you a new, I bought you a new
I bought you, bought you, bought you...
