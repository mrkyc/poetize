Elizabeth, Elizabeth, she's the girl next door
But she's a little bit
Yeah, to me, she's a little bit more
When I'm with her, then I feel like a king
Yes, I feel like a king
To be in her grace, I would do anything
I would do anything

I would go down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees

Elizabeth, I am here at your beck & call
And in a little bit, I'll have you climbing the castle walls
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Can't keep me away, keep me away
I'll be you knight any time of the day, any time of the day

Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my

Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
My Queen Elizabeth

A prince if you want to
Lay with me, we can rule the world together
You're royalty in my eyes

Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
My Queen Elizabeth
Give it up, give it up, give it up just a little bit
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with now
You're the one that I wanna be with now
You're the one that I wanna be with now
