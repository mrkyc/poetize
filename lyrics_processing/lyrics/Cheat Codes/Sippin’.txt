I'm the type of guy to do a right thing wrong
Always holdin' off instead of holdin' on
But that's not true
When I hold you
Baby, I'm so tired of bein' on and off
Maybe we should throw some whiskey on them rocks

Baby, you're the only one I want

Give me everything you got
I been doin' you and me all wrong
What the hell have I been waitin' for?
I want you straight from the bottle, pour me a double
I been sippin' on your love too long (Too long, too long)

Nothin' tastes sweeter than your lips on mine
If everything's better when we're together
Why are we wastin' time?

I been sippin' on your love too long
Baby, you're the only one I want

I want you straight from the bottle, pour me a double
I been sippin' on your love too long (Too long, too long)
Yeah
Mm (Too long, too long)
Yeah, I been sippin' on your love, sippin' on your love, I been
I been sippin' on your love too long (Too long)
Mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Too long, too long)
Straight from the bottle, I been
