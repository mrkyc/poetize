Think he's got one up, but we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback, payback
You know you better run, flying too close to the sun
Now it's payback, payback

Girl, I see you're getting used to turn a blind eye
Girl, he keeps you in the dark, it's messing with your mind
I don't wanna see you waste another night out
Always lookin' at your phone like he will call you back

I just can't believe
Thought he could play you easily
Sweet revenge is all you need
It's time, don't send a warning

Think he's got one up, but we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (Time), payback, ooh
You know you better run, flying too close to the sun
Now it's payback (Time), payback
We're comin' for you, ooh

Everybody knows he's playing on your heart strings
Rumour has it he's been getting down with anything
Did he really think that we would never find out?
Girl, I got you, now let's show him what it's all about
You might also like
I just can't believe
