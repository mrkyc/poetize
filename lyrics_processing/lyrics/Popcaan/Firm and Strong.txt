Yea, so much problem with mi so-called friends
Problem with the girl I love
Whole heap a dem weh seh dem know Popcaan
Dem never know the place I was
People weh know the real struggle mi feel
A people like Squid and cuz
This music biz is like a battle to me
So much fucking hatred and grudge

But inna the midst of all these enemies
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Bad mind and jealousy just get defeat
Jah, you keep me firm and strong yea
Gi mi the energy me need
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Unruly keep winning by any means, yea
Jah, you keep me firm and strong, yea

Strong already, strong already you know
Strong already, strong already, strong already you know

Everyone already know
Some people guh believe everyting dem see pon TV
Everyting dem hear pon radio (Fool)
Dem see you with you ting a it dem want
Dem plan up how fi take it from yuh
God nah guh vex if a mi gun mi draw
Empty a matic pon yuh
