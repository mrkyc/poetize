Every Hot Skull...

No listen to badmind talk, or message weh pagans send
Anuh everyting weh glitter a gold, so look out fi badmind friend
Nuff time, mi say, life unfair, look how much good people life end
So me haffi tell every ghetto youth, no bite the hand weh feed dem

'Cause
Dem say, me nah go noweh
"Youth, you nah go make no money"
And dem say me soon haffi run away
But dem a dream
Notnice, dem say mi clothes dem never clean
And me nah live fi see 17
But, now mi clothes dem ever clean
From me get the big song pon the scene
