Sad to say
But...

White people a bawl
Indian people a bawl
Black people a bawl
Chinese people a bawl
System design fi set we up
Yeaaaah
Dem give we di guns, then dem same one come wet we up

Dre Skull, wha' di system do fi ghetto youth? Nothing
Wha' dem do fi ghetto youth? Nothing
Every day another mother bawl
Dem don't do nothing at all, yeah
We've been suffering from we small

So
Some think say a bed of rose true pretty clothes inna mi closet
None of dem nah see me pain
Furthermore, dem never ask yet
Silence a di baddest weapon, so you know wha' me do, me talk less
Man a work every day down a wharf, and a three grand a week dem a accept
Dem no waan me fi build mama house, don't waan me fi own no assets
Sufferation everywhere me turn, so give thanks to Jah when you pass it
So, ghetto youth, don't make silly plans
Believe in yourself, be a man
Dem waan we fi dead pon di road
Dem don't waan we fi make billions
