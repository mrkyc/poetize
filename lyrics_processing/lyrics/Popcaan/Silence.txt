Dre Skull, woi

Watch who you tell when you a buy new bimma
Careful who you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drink
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust yuh enemy, hard fi trust yuh friend
Trust yuh friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust di whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fuck up but dat's how me feel
Big up unruly cuz up a sunny hill
All a me long time bredda from Titchfield
Long time Petro dem a hold it pon di bakklefield
Some a dem heart filled with grudge
My thugs are the realest thugs
And my heart clean, filled with love
And mi meditation sharp like studs

Tell Dre Skull
Evil dem send me seh di whole a dem a miss
Go fi di psalms dem a send fi di chalice
Dem just a watch me like a radio analyst
But me unstoppable memba me tell you dis
In the music I'm like a fucking senator
Dem a the fucking janitor
None a my link no regular
Mad sick, head no good like predator
Wo
You might also like
Watch who you tell when you a buy new bimma
Careful who you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drink
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust yuh enemy, hard fi trust yuh friend
Trust yuh friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust di whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fuck up but a so me feel
Big up unruly cuz up a sunny hill
All a me long time bredda from Titchfield
Long time Petro dem a hold it pon the bakklefield
Some a dem heart filled with grudge
My thugs are the realest thugs
And my heart clean, filled with love

Thank God I'm blessed so
Badmind cyaa defeat me, yeah
Every day Jah surround me
When me cry out Him hear my plea, yeah
Some girl work every day til dem knee dem knock
Some cyaa manage di pressure and go turn pon crack
Some man sidung and a hope sufferation stop
Too much ghetto youth a fall fi di system trap
Hombre a from me little bit me go fi wah me want
No man a reap from di seed no weh me plant
Sleepless days, sleepless nights
Whole heap a rough road weh me walk tru
No, man a win in advance
Dutty badmind, you nah stand a chance
Me and Dre Skull collect the check dem
Then dem see di few black bimma pass
Anyhow
Watch who you tell when you a buy new bimma
Careful who you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drink
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust your enemy, hard fi trust your friend
Trust your friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust the whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fuck up but a so me feel
Big up unruly cuz up a sunny hill
