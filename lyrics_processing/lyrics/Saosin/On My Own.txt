(Just say, say it ain't so)
(This is not the home that I know)

Just say, say it ain't so
This is not the home that I know
I never thought I'd let you down
Never thought I'd let you down
(You promised)
You promised not to let me drown

In my daydreams, you take over me
In these daydreams, you take over me

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

No way, it's not the same
This place has had its way
I swore to never let you down
I never thought I'd let you down
(I'm sorry)
I'm sorry that I let you drown
You might also like
In my daydreams, you take over me
In these daydreams, you take over me

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?
Am I losing my mind?

Something's always pulling me underground

Is there something staring back at me?
Is there something waiting there for me?
But there never really was
(Something's always pulling me under)
No, there never really was
And there never really was
(Something's always pulling me under)

Will my daydreams take over me?
Will these daydreams take over me?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

Something's always pulling me under

Open your eyes, tell me why
Open your eyes, you still sleep with it
Open your eyes, tell me why
Open your eyes, you still sleep with it
Open your eyes, open your eyes
Open your eyes, open your eyes
