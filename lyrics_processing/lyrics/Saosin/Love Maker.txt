Run away and play your games, hide well so I can't find you
I'll wait for summer to come
Then laugh as the trees burn down around you
Your body was just a test for me and if I run as fast as I can
The thought of your memory will catch up with me
Will catch up with me

I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared
You always mislead me
I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared
You always mislead me

You always got the worst of me

It's a shame that you're still lying broken here
In this moment, everything just seems so clear
Because her body was just a test, you see
And if you run as fast as you can
The thought of my memory will catch up, you see
You might also like
I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared
You always mislead me
I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared at all
You always misled me

When summer passes, I'll let go (I let go)
If you don't free me, just dig yourself out
When summer passes, let me know
So I can find meaning to live

I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared
You always mislead me
I'm always late with my words
We tried so hard, we tried so hard
I should have told you, but I never really cared
