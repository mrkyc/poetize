Keep me a secret

So tell me why you've come here to bend and break
I know that you have made the same mistake
Just shut your eyes for me, this world of sound is floating away
And I don't know why

You keep yourself so tightly wound, it's about time you break
But it's not enough, my foolish words will never

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
(Woah oh)
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you
(Woah oh)
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom

And I have always been the same
You know that I will clean up your mistakes
Just tell me you've found a way to stop that believing
Everything you say is a lie
You might also like
You keep yourself so tightly wound, it's about time you break
It's not enough, my foolish words will never

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
(Woah oh)
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you
(Woah oh)
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom

I never had the faith to pick myself up
Come down and take me
I never had the faith to pick myself up
Breathe in, breathe out
Like a magnet, you can pull me closer
All these words will end like this
I was stagnant
Then you entered my life and held it in your hands
(Oh well, you'll never know what happened)

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
(Woah oh)
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you
(Woah oh oh)
Is this the end of myself?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
Is this the end of myself?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
