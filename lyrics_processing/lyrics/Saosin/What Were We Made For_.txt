I imagine we were made, I imagine we were made
I imagine we were made, I imagine we were

Woke up again, sweating out all the pores
And then I feel it again, I know it's coming again
So I try to make it for an hour or two
But I know in the end, yeah, I know in the end
This place will hit me so hard, this face will end up so hard
Because of you, it's all because of you

I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
'Cause I don't remember anything (Don't remember anything)
And I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
'Cause I can't remember anything

Feels like a bomb going off in my conscious
And I feel it again, I think it's coming again
How can I run away from all of the sadness
When no one's around to tell me where to begin
These steps I climb up are so hard
Your voice will hit me so hard
Because of you, it's always because of you
You might also like
I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
'Cause I don't remember anything (Don't remember anything)
And I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
'Cause I can't remember anything (I can't remember anything)

Now I know the hardest part is letting go (I can't let you go)
I just cannot be afraid of what's below

And I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong? (Do wrong?)
'Cause I don't remember anything
And I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me what did I do wrong?
'Cause I can't remember anything (Can't remember anything)
And I can't carry this all, I can't carry this on my own
Tell me, what did I do wrong? (What did I do wrong?)
I just can't remember anything

I imagine we were made, I imagine we were made
