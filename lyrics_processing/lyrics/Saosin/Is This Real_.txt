Time's runnin' out and I have been betrayed
Gotta cast my stone into the lake
(It didn't work, I didn't feel it sink in)
That's all it takes my son then you are safe
When the end comes, everything's okay
(We take it back, you take it away)

Take my skin, we're diving in
It doesn't make a difference if I sink or swim
There's a line drawn thin or so they tell me
I'll never know the difference if we sink or swim

Is it real?
The choices that we make
(Is it real?)
The smiles that we fake
(Is it real?)
I know it hurts but is it real?
The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake for my own sake
I know it that it hurts but is it

I can't help feelin' like I've been betrayed
Should have cast that stone into the lake
(Stone into the lake)
Chased in the wrong direction, led astray
And I know you don't believe a single word you say
(I can't believe that you can)
You might also like
Take my skin, we're diving in
(We're diving in)
It doesn't make a difference if I sink or swim
There's a line drawn thin or so they tell me
I'll never know the difference if we sink or swim

Is it real?
The choices that we make
(Is it real?)
The smiles that we fake
(Is it real?)
I know it hurts but is it real?
The choices that we make
(Is it real?)
The smiles that we fake for my own sake
I know it hurts but is this real?
Is this real?

I don't want to buy into the lie
Stare up at the sky but is it real?
Show me something real
I don't want to buy into your lies
Stare up at the sky and say:
I surrender myself for this, I'll take the blame
(I'll take the blame)
I surrender myself for this, I'll take the blame
(Oh, oh)
For peace or war
For rich or poor
For loss
For gain
Dor everything that I loved
I see
I feel
I've become one with words not real to me
So I'll stare in silence
Forward, backwards
Just to realize we all fall down

Is it real?
The choices that we make
(Is it real?)
The smiles that we fake
(Is it real?)
Just tell me is this real?
(Is it real?)
The choices that we make
(Is it real?)
The smiles that we fake for my own sake
I know it hurts but is this real?
Is this real?
Is it real?
