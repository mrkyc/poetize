I knew I never deserved you
I just felt so high inside
I move along, I shuffled in place, then
Back hand and you're pulling me in
Will I ever find anyone?
You make me feel like I've been lost somewhere
Now it's morning, so it's over
Now it's over

Am I right where I need to be?
Or is this another distraction?
Is this how I'm supposed to feel?
I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see?
Or is this another disaster?
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel
I've been trying to wake you

No, this is never what I wanted
Never what I thought I signed up for
And I keep moving away
To the edge, then I'll decide whether jump or stay asleep
Sometimes the leap of faith is all
Faith is all we have
Why won't you tell me?

Am I right where I need to be?
Or is this another distraction?
Is this how I'm supposed to feel?
I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see?
Or is this another disaster?
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel
I've been trying to wake you

Oh, why won't you wake up?
Wake up, nobody's sleeping anymore
And I've had enough of the ground
Made my escape, fell in love with the sound
And I'll pound my fists 'til you wake up
So, why aren't you waking up?

When the sun is coming out
When the sun is coming out
And I can't hide here anymore
No, no, oh, no
When the sun is coming out

Am I right where I need to be?
Or is this another distraction?
Is this how I'm supposed to feel?
I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see?
Or is this another disaster?
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel
I've been trying to wake you

Why, why won't you wake up?
Why don't you wake up?
