You fall apart each time you start
To say goodbye, but there was nobody watching
(Nobody watching)
You've lost your grip, you start to slip
But don't know why, and this is just the beginning
(Just the beginning)
You had the hopes to make it last
It's moving fast, but now you're realizing
(Realizing)
That in the past, the dreams you had
Made people feel like you were just reciting
(Just reciting)

Bathing in the afterglow
The chance and luck and pride
Where we end up, we could never know
And all I know is we seem to be

Changing, better to turn and walk away
Fading, all these lights just turn to gray
Changing, better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing is that I don't feel a thing
You might also like

The things you lost cannot replace what's missing
(Replace what's missing)
And from the start, you played the part
And now your arts become the great deception

Bathing in the afterglow
Chance and luck and pride
When we end up, we could never know
All I know is we seem to be

Changing, better to turn and walk away
Fading, all these lights just turn to gray
Changing, better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing is that I don't feel a thing

One last breath to say goodbye
I tell myself another lie
Stripped of all I hold so dear
The moment's lost and I am sinking down lower
I drown myself in the water
And I am watching my life pass before my eyes
It comes as no surprise
You fell apart and then you stop
You fell apart and then you stop
You fell apart and then you
Stop

Changing, better to turn and walk away
Fading, all of these lights just turn to gray, now I'm
Changing, better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing is that I don't feel a thing

You fell apart and then you stop
You fell apart and then you stop
You fell apart and then you
