You seem so disappointed within
This act of yours is just a sin, you know
It's so easy to tell you
Abuse it, don't tell me you're useless
They told me you're happy now

I can't keep holding you up
I'm overcome by the weight of the mud
Drying up around you
(You're pulling me under)
You know I'll never forget you
(You're pulling me under)
I can't keep pulling you up
Tell me if you ever stop
I'll never forget you, oh no
I'll never forget you

Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope Hollywood cares
I'll open the lens up so you all can
Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope somebody cares
And you'll see that nobody's watching
You might also like
Tell me why you wanted to change
Tell me why you're so nervous to say
What you're really thinking
The feeling of sinking is setting in
You used to be so much happier

I can't keep holding you up
I'm overcome by the weight of the mud
Drying up around you
You know I'll never forget you
I can't keep pulling you up
Tell me if you ever stop
I'll never forget you, oh no
I'll never forget you

Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope Hollywood cares
I'll open the lens up so you all can
Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope somebody cares
And you'll see that nobody's watching

You can't turn away
Make up your face and get high
Make up your face and get high again
You can't turn away
Make up your face and get high
Make up your face and get high again
'Cause when you sign your deal
You're as good as dead
Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope Hollywood cares
(Hollywood cares)
I'll open the lens up so you all can
Say goodbye, it's all you wanted
Let's hope somebody cares
And you'll see that nobody's watching
