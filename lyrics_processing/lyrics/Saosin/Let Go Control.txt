And I know I should let you go
To let you be with all the thoughts you loathe
Awake and stare across the sea
In hopes that you will dream, but nothing's free

We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one

I'll give you time to spend alone
And once the pain is gone, your light will let us know
Set free, now you can try and speak
The words that you would see, I already know

We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one

We changed our lives, we'll never die
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We changed our lives, we'll never die
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one

We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
This chance won't be the last one
This chance won't be the last one
We take our lives, we'll never die
And we'll learn what was right
We take our lives, we'll never die
