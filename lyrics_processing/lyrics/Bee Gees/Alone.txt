I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started tremblin'
Oh, what a night it's been
And for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (Always end up alone)
Always end up alone

So I play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far (So far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
You might also like
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute, I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't Heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain?
Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
So I play, I'll wait (In time)
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far (So far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
So I play, I'll wait (I'll wait)
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far (So far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruisin' on your ocean
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
(And I don't want to be alone)
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruisin' on your ocean
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
