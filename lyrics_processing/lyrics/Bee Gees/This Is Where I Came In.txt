I've seen the story, I've read it over once or twice
I said that you say a little bit of bad advice
I've been in trouble happened to me all my life
I lie and you lie and who would get the sharpest knife

You shouldn't be somebody like that
Not the kind of man to throw his hat into the ring and
Go down without following through the day turns into night
Go down without following through the day turns into night

Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

Hope rides on, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

This is the danger zone this is where I came in
They know not what they do forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away what you have given me
You might also like
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

Fade into color, color into black and white
Under the bedclothes everything will be alright
I know that you know nothing ever stays the same
Said so, I said so love will never speak it's name

Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run

Hope rides on, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

I always told myself I would regret this day
That I would fall apart and watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud and I would stand aside
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

I can fly, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time goes by, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

This is the danger zone this is where I came in
They know not what they do forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away what you have given me

Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
