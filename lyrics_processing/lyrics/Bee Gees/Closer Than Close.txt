She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
She'll suck you dry
But look at how much I drip?
At the point of ecstasy
I write a symphony of poetry in motion
And leavin' me there to die

I tell myself let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid?
I want you next to me
Call it telepathy
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see?
(Ah, ah-ah)

I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry
Livin' in each other's lives
And tryna make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
You might also like
Your soul is naked, it tells you what you want
I read your letter
And look at how close I've come?
There's more for us to see
In this philosophy
We both end up in Heaven
And look at how close we'd be
(Ah, ah-ah)

I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
Nothin' last forever, see
We can turn eternity into

I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover what the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry
Livin' in each other's lives
And tryna make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
I just wanna get closer than close to you
(I just wanna get closer than close to you)
(My love)
To the moment you discover what the best of my love can do
(My love)
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
(I just wanna get closer than close to you)
(My love)
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
(My love)
