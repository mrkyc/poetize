Now it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
If millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When that someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind
De de de de de    de de de de de de de
De de de de de de de de de de de
I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
I guess that I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be
You might also likeI can't see nobody...no
No, I can't see nobody...oh no
My eyes can only look at you...
Baby...
I can't see nobody...oh no
No, I can't see nobody...oh no
My eyes can only look at you...
I started a joke, which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no
I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me
I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said
Til I finally died, which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh no, that the joke was on me...oh no
That the joke was on me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh no
Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts
Something's telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own
Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen
I will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah
I will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah
