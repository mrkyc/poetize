Despite the solitude of his empty car, he feels he is being watched by more than just the curious deer and west Texas highway transients. At dawn, he begins to feel the at first nearly imperceptible signs of the drugs taking effect. As he crosses the border east into New Mexico, there is now no question in his mind about the flavor of the coffee and the sardonic smile of the crusty over-made waitress. He's crossed into more than two states at once. His watch stops. He picks up a hitchhiker -- some young lady -- but unfortunately, as he's been expecting, his car breaks down. It's an abandoned shanty town known only as Brubaker
"Just remember," she says. "I'm holding you responsible for all of this."
He cringes at the tone of her voice. A quick glance into the rear view mirror yields to him the vision of the third unattached eyeball. A star of dried cream at the bottom of the styrofoam coffee cup (?)ing on the dashboard smiles at him and somehow, in their loneliness and boredom, her twelve-pack dwindling in the midday heat, he forces her into sex. The Chevrolet temporarily fixed, they drift on and come upon a small bar in no place specific. Drunk by evening, she complains of morning sickness, and by morning has noticeably grown in size. Two days later, still heading east towards the holy angelic temple he has been envisioning in his sleep, she is nine months pregnant. Later that day she gives birth to their son. Born with gingham snakeskin cowboy boots and three umbilical cords he is within hours cursing his parents in some otherworldly alien language. And he mutters in perfect English in his sleep, while sucking his mother's breast, his twisted utopian visions. She looks at him terrified and says, "Remember, I'm holding you responsible for all of this."
LEFT CHANNEL BACKGROUND LYRICS
Too much open space
Makes me nervous
Too much ginseng
I go to Wyoming
Then they cull the whole fucking state
Then they doctor some fucking open spaces
Give some cowboys some acid
Too many good things
Makes me nervous
Nothing seems right now
Too many open spaces
Makes me nervous
Yes, Wyoming can make me nervous
So we're gonna go up to Wyoming
And open some fucking open spaces
And call for some hotel rooms
And look at the turd in the open spaces

Don't say its a bad thing
You don't know what you're doing
You can do anything
Yeah you can do anything
Yes you can do anything
You don't know what you're doing
You do nothing at all
Because there's dry wide open spaces
And voodoo children
Cos you can stay here forever
Yeah I can see enormous cowboys upon the horizon
They're all on acid
They don't know what they're doing
So they can do anything in hotel rooms
...horizon
Enormous cowboys on acid
Enormous cowboys on...

I've got to drive faster
The road is falling
In front of my eyes
I've got to drive faster
If I want to get home
If I don't look where I'm going
I'm gonna get killed
If I don't look where I'm going

The road is falling
In front of my eyes
I've got to drive faster
