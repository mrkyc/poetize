But I got these at Payless on my lunch break
My sister did this makeup
She calls it "Get-Over-Your-Breakup"
She said,  "Get out there and work it, girl"
So I'm working it
This ain't no drugstore perfume
I'm talking Chanel No. 5
A little sample that I saved some from our prom night
I know this is a sports bar
You know I'm a fan of NASCAR
I'll have two Coronas
One for me and one for the hot girl I just turned into

I came in here to get a man
And I know the man I want
Do you like the new me I am
Cause that's the one he's taking home
Get your hand of my mmm-mmm
Wipe that grin off your face
It ain't you I'm looking for
I'm looking for someone to take your place
Sorry
You might also likeI heard Brittany and your best friend finally called it quits
Has he still got that real good job
And that pretty Beamer?
Do you know that guy shooting pool
That dragon tattoo's so cool
Hey, light my cigarette
I'm about to do things you won't forget

On the couch
On the bed
On the porch
In the truck
Hey, up on the Maytag
With some money
Who can kiss
Who can dance
Any chance
You could find me a little ashtray?

Little boy, you're in my way
It ain't you I'm looking for
I'm looking for someone to take your place
It ain't you I'm looking for
