Firin' at everybody
Firin' at everybody
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Firin' at everybody

I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

I used to pray for a plug who gon' go out the way
And come back with a lot of them bitches
I used to dream about condos when we leavin' Lenox
Now I stay on top of them bitches
I wouldn't give a damn if he ran him up a whole billion
I still wouldn't acknowledge the nigga
He put my name in a song, what the fuck is he on?
I don't care, boy, we gotta go get him
House big as fuck in the middle of nowhere
I dick her down, I don't care what my ho wear
I made Lil' Cam spin the block on a four-wheel
Nah, for real, spin the block on a four-wheel
Five million dollars, for me, that ain't no deal
I done made that times six in like three years
Off this rap shit, I can't even talk about this trap shit
I just hope they can take it, I keep me a stallion like Megan
A residency out in Vegas
Might fly to L.A. and go fuck with LeBron and the Lakers
Come back to Atlanta with Jayda
Bruh told us to take care of the neighbors and stack all the paper
Whatever we want, buy it later
I know how to shit on a hater and handle the business
Whatever God give me, I'm grateful

Cartier watches for everyone 'round me
I ran it up, how the fuck could you down me?
She set for life, how the fuck could you clown her?
Bought all this water, I'm never gon' drown
I'm in the 'yo, I'm perfectin' my sound
I helped 'em out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend
I done geared up the motor
My brother in prison in Polo
I jumped in the game and went loco
I put on these clothes like a hobo
That's layers of drip
I showed my ass in Phipps
You play, ya mans get killed
Said that before, but I'm dead for real
Lil' bro jumpin' 'round like his leg done healed
I ran it up off of vacuum seal
If I fall off today, I'm a legend still
Bro showed me the way, I ain't never steal
This Glock ain't no prop, it'll pop for real
I fuck with that syrup, I don't pop no pills
My young niggas turnt, they don't got no deals
I need me a billion so I can chill
I'm drivin' like I ain't got no license still
My Trackhawk move like it got nitrogen, I'm poppin' seals

Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

I paid attention and found out the recipe
I take a seat and they still won't get 'head of me
I'm on my shit, now a bitch can't get next to me
You ain't got a hundred thou', you can't have sex with me
Ain't showed the best of me yet
And ain't in nobody debt, I'm somethin' like a vet
I bought my big brother a 'Vette
My numbers so good, my label probably owe me a check
They play with Lil Baby, I swear it's gon' go down
The biggest lil' nigga that's over at Motown
Jumped off the porch and went straight kicked the door down
Flip the clip, switch the clip, then some more rounds
Rappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round
I took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces
Ask around, we them guys, I do no clownin'
If I can, I'ma try keep the smoke down
Once it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down
Like to switch where I sleep, I got four houses
Every time the heat come, I make four thousand
Big done gave me the game and I ran with it
Milk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it
Could've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas
Make me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers
Bought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger
Never been to it once, that's a great feelin'
I'ma go there when I get a chance
I lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal
Swear to God, I still got my advance
Yeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up
Yeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up
Ain't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women
I promise they swallow us all
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
