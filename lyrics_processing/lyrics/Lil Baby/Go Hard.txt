I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

You pillow talkin' to hoes again
You breakin' the code again
I'm on the road again
We snuck in this bitch with them poles again
This chopper do tricks, you gon' go fold it in
I know they be hatin', I still post they shit
We slid on they block like we 'posed to slid
This Glock been with me on my road to riches
We done over-sold the load again
Too many plays, been up for too many days
Boy, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
I get the drop, I'ma pay, they gon' spray where you stay
I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

He tryna diss me, that shit ain't gon' get to me
I can't give pussy-ass niggas my energy
He say that shit when I see him, then he'll see
Know they mad 'cause they can't take a seat with me
Got the best of the best in the sheets with me
Hands down, can't nobody compete with me
I eat filet mignon, I'm a cash cow
I got ten million cash from my last album
I'm just waitin' on bronem to max out
Every show that I get, it be packed out
Five K for your teeth, you got ripped off
Spent a hundred thousand on mine
Crack a smile just to show the diamonds
From the corner to another continent
Got a baby daddy? I don't wanna hit
Need a Nike deal how I'm runnin' shit
He can't come to the A, he on punishment
Catch that boy out of place, we gon' punish him
Take his chain and his watch on some funny shit
Brodie ready to crash on some dummy shit
Gotta fuck me for free, ain't no money, bitch
I've been on some pimp shit lately
I been off a jet with some made men
We had twenty vibes out in Vegas
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

I go hard as I can go to win
I go hard as I can go to win
I go hard as I can go to win
Hard as I can go to win
