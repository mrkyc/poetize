I wanna waste a little time with you
I got no money, got no mind to lose
Wanna go where the tears that you cry
Are shine, shinin' so pretty
A fallen angel in a Chevrolet
I'm on your lap, what would my daddy say?
He don't know where we go, where we go
So let's go to Hot City

When you're close to me
Boy, you make my temperature rise (Hee)
Wanna feel that heat
Won't you take me to paradise?

Come on, let's go to Hot City
Fire up the boulevard
Hot City, stealin' cars and breakin' hearts
Hot City, just a rebel in the dark
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hot City, all the girls and all the boys
Hot City, yeah, we're young and unemployed
Hot City, get in the streets and make some noise
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

Take off your shirt, I wanna feel your skin
Sweet chemicals are sinkin' in
How I love, how I love, how I love it
When you like to get gritty, oh
Lookin' like a dirty magazine (Magazine)
Peelin' out like a tangerine
Here we go, here we go, here we go
We'll live it up in Hot City

When you're close to me
Boy, you make my temperature rise (Hee)
Wanna feel that heat
Won't you take me to paradise?

Come on, let's go to Hot City
Fire up the boulevard
Hot City, stealin' cars and breakin' hearts
Hot City, just a rebel in the dark
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hot City, all the girls and all the boys
Hot City, yeah, we're young and unemployed
Hot City, get in the streets and make some noise
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Palm trees and pink skies
(Turn it up hot, baby, don't stop)
Be my ride or die
(Turn it up hot, baby, don't stop)
Two electric hearts
(Turn it up hot, baby, don't stop)
Until we kiss the stars
(Turn it up hot, baby, don't stop)

Hot City, fire up the boulevard
Hot City (Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh), stealin' cars and breakin' hearts
Hot City, just a rebel in the dark (Just a rebel in the dark)

Hot City, get in the streets and make some noise (Oh)
