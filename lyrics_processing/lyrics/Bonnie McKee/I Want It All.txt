I, I would make a deal with the devil
Turn my heart into metal
Just to get to you
Baby, I would sink to your level
Put my foot on the pedal
Just to get to you (Wow)
(Hey)

I'll give you my soul to keep
The golden key forever, yeah (Hey)
If you'll rock n' roll with me
Then we can be together, yeah

I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love
I, I want it all (Hey)
Your fear
I want your lies
I want your mind
Oh, I want it all (Hey) (I want it all)
Oh, I want it all
You might also like
Yeah, you know I would cut like the razor (Hey)
Sign in blood on the paper
Just to get to you
And baby, I would yell like a rebel
Take the pain with the pleasure
Just to get to you

I'll give you my soul to keep
The golden key forever, yeah
If you'll rock n' roll with me (Hey)
Then we can be together, yeah

I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love
I, I want it all (Hey)
Your fear
I want your lies
I want your mind
Oh, I want it all (Hey) (I want it all)
Oh, I want it all (I want it all)
Oh, I want it all (Hey) (I want it all)
Oh, I want it all (I want it all)
Oh (Hey)
I want you
Down on your knees tonight
Bring your dreams to life
I need you
Need you to long for me
To belong to me
I want you (Hey, hey)
Down on your knees tonight
Bring your dreams to life
And I need you (Hey, hey)
Need you to long for me
To belong to me (Ha)

I want your touch
I want your kiss
I want tough love
I, I want it all (Hey)
Your fear
I want your lies (Woo)
I want your mind (Woo, woo)
Oh, I want it all (Hey) (I want it all)
Oh, I want it all (I want it all)
