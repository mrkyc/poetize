Medicated, guarded, jaded
Promise, baby, I'll be worth the ride (I'll be worth the ride)
Warm heart, cold blood, soft touch, tough love
Burnt down, fucked up, just the way you like (Just the way you like)

There's something in my nature
That seems to fascinate ya
You got a taste for danger
Don't know why

I got, I got thorns
Wear them like a crown, yeah
(I got, I got) thorns
You should know by now, yeah

I got (Ay)
That's what you get when you pick a rose
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Thorns, thorns
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Easy to love but I'm hard to hold, thorns

I got, I got
I got, I got (Got)
I got, I got
I got (Ay)
That's what you get when you pick a rose
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Thorns, thorns
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Easy to love but I'm hard to hold
Thorns
To hold, to hold
To hold on
To hold, to hold
Easy to love
To hold
That's what you get
To hold on
