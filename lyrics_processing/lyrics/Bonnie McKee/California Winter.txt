Dreaming of palm trees tonight
This is the season, the city is sleeping
Gleaming and glistening white
It's always summer with you

Outside it's cold and grey
All the streets shine like silver lakes
And the stoplights are blinking red and green
Like something in a movie scene
It's snowing, it's in the air
And I'm frozen but I don't care
'Cause I'm golden as long as I'm with you
'Cause when I'm in your arms it's like a

California Winter
Yeah, your love can keep me warm
When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
California Winter
Yeah, your touch is like sunshine
When I'm on holiday, feels like I'm in LA
Cause I'm yours and I know you're mine, oh baby
You might also like
California, California Winter
California, California Winter
When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise, oh

Dark skies, December hail
But I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
Like I'm poolside and soaking up the sun
Even though my toes are numb
You are my angel wings
You are my North Star, watch over me
And when it gets dark you always light the air
Cause when I'm in your arms it's like a

California Winter
Yeah, your love can keep me warm
When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
California Winter
Yeah, your touch is like sunshine
When I'm on holiday, feels like I'm in LA
Cause I'm yours and I know you're mine, oh baby
California, California Winter
California, California Winter
When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise, oh

Sparkling icicles freeze
You light a fire inside of me and it feels like a tropical breeze
Melting my heart, like a cinnamon candle
Burning on Christmas Eve
Sweeter than candy and cozy as flannel
Hot, like I'm out at the beach
When you dance with me, baby

California, California Winter
California, California Winter
When it's storming outside and you're holding me tight
It's like you take me to paradise
(Take me to paradise)
California, California Winter
California, California Winter
When I'm on holiday, feels like I'm in LA
Cause I'm yours and I know you're mine, oh baby
Fa la la la la la la
Fa la la la la la la
I'm gone with my baby
Dance with me, baby
California, California Winter
