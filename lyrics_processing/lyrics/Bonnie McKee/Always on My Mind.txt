They say you never know, what you got 'til it's gone
But how am I to know, if it's right or it's wrong?
It's breaking my heart, 'cause I don't wanna go
But staying here baby is just gonna slow us down
So let the credits roll, 'cause it's time to move on

Say goodbye to the world we set on fire together
I won't cry, 'cause I know we'll both find something better
Promised myself I would never look back
But baby, it's hard when you know what you had
I said goodbye but you're always on my mind

So now I'm on the road and they're playing our song
Turn off the radio, but I'm singing along
I try so hard but I can't shake you off
I want to hold on but it's something I got to do
Gotta face the cold, 'cause it's time to move on

Say goodbye to the world we set on fire together
I won't cry, 'cause I know we'll both find something better
Promised myself I would never look back
But baby, it's hard when you know what you had
I said goodbye, but you're always on my mind

I don't know how to say goodbye
'Cause you're always on my mind

Say goodbye to the world we set on fire together
I won't cry, 'cause I know we'll both find something better
Promised myself I would never look back
But baby, it's hard when you know what you had
I said goodbye, but you're always on my mind

I don't know how to say goodbye
I don't know how to say goodbye
I don't know how to say goodbye
'Cause you're always on my mind
I don't know how to say goodbye

'Cause you're always on my mind
