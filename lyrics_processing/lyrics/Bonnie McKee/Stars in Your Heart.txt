You're dressed to kill be you've got nowhere to go
Just waiting on your heart to call
There is a rumble in the streets of your soul
But you don't care at all
Empty halls and empty feeling abound
And everything you start you stall
I'm right behind you if you just turn around
I'll never let you fall
No...

Go to the ends of the earth
You'll never find a love like me
Take my hand I will help you see

That after the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm
Here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart
Again
Yeah...
You might also like
You've won the fight but you've got nothing to show
Just choking on the velvet rope
Those disco lights can leaving you feeling so low
But I will give you hope, yes I will

Go to the ends of the earth
You'll never find a love like me
Take my hand I will help you see

That after the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm
Here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart
Again
Yeah...
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart again
Mmhm...
Stick with me and I will help you see

That after the world is frozen
And after the sun goes out
I'll keep you warm
Here in my arms
When you think the spell is broken
When you think the magic's gone
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart
So baby stick with me
I'll be the one to collect all the stars in your heart
In your heart
I'll collect all the stars now
Oh yeah
I'll be the one to
So stick with me
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
