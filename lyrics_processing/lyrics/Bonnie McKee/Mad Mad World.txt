When I open my eyes, for a moment, I'm fine
Until I'm scrolling through the days headlines
Try to keep myself numb, turn the radio on
Hoping to shake it but it burned my mind

Wish that I could go somewhere the news is good
And throw away my phone
(Oh, oh) I don't wanna look 'cause
I don't wanna know
But I can't ignore it now
Baby, if I'm bein' honest
I wish I could check out (Don't do it)

I need a vacation (Don't do it)
I just need a break right now
Get away, get away
From a cold and crazy world
I need a vacation
'Cause it's a mad, mad world

Mad, mad
Mad, mad
'Cause it's a mad, mad world
You might also like
Do the best that I can, standing up to the man
Fighting the power tryna hold us down
Never give up the fight, risin' up for what's right
But I need to take a breath before I drown

Wish that I could go somewhere the news is good
And throw away my phone
(Oh, oh) I don't wanna look 'cause
I don't wanna know
But I can't ignore it now
Baby, if I'm being honest
I wish I could check out (Don't do it)

I need a vacation (Don't do it)
I just need a break right now
Get away, get away
From a cold and crazy world
I need a vacation
'Cause it's a mad, mad world

Mad, mad
(Mad)
Mad, mad
'Cause it's a mad, mad world
Mad, mad
(Mad)
Mad, mad
Got me on my knees, got me on my knees (Don't do it)
I won't let myself give up right now (Don't do it)
I get up on my feet, I get up on my feet
And get to it
Even though the world is upside down, oh

I need a vacation (Don't do it)
I just need a break right now
Get away, get away
From a cold and crazy world (Cold and crazy world)
I need a vacation
'Cause it's a mad, mad world

Mad, mad (Oh, I)
Mad, mad
'Cause it's a mad, mad world (Ooh, ooh)
Mad, mad
