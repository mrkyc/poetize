I went to the beach
I felt, I felt nothing
I listened to beats
I felt, I felt nothing
I went to a bar
I felt, I felt nothing
I totaled my car
I felt, I felt nothing
When I watched The Hills
I felt, I felt nothing (Uh, uh)
I swallowed some pills
I felt, I felt nothing

But you wake me up
I was just a sleepwalker
You wake me up
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of the living

You wake me up, I was out of my mind
I was just a sleepwalker
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up, I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of the living
(Living, living, living)

Tequila and lime
I felt, I felt nothing (Uh)
My card was declined
I felt, I felt nothing
They made me a star
I felt, I felt nothing, oh
I broke a few hearts
I felt, I felt nothing
Cut into my skin
I felt nothing, oh-oh, ooh
I did it again
I felt, I felt nothing

But you wake me up
I was just a sleepwalker
You wake me up
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of the living

You wake me up, I was out of my mind
I was just a sleepwalker
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up, I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of the living
I was out of my mind, I was just a sleepwalker
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up, I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of the living (Living, living, living, living)
I was just a sleepwalker (Living, living, living)
You wake me up
Bring me back to the land of the living
(Living, living, living, living, living, living)
