All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted, all

I can't look at you lately
I can't figure you out
I wanna make you my baby
I wanna mess around

I can't keep on pretending
That we're just friends
When my body's calling for you late at night
But I try to be patient

Oh, so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone
I'm so restless, baby and I'm risking it all
Oh, oh, it's too late for taking it slow, baby yeah
I only want what I can't have
Oh I've got it bad
I'm so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone
How can I get you alone?
All I ever wanted, all
You might also like
Well I feel like I'm naked
When your eye's on me
Like you hear what I'm thinking
I'm afraid you'll see

That I can't keep on pretending
That we're just friends
When my body's calling for you late at night
But I try to be patient

Oh, so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone
I'm so restless, baby and I'm risking it all
Oh, oh, it's too late for taking it slow, baby yeah
I only want what I can't have
Oh I've got it bad
I'm so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone

Can't keep my cool
Burning up around you
Are you feeling it, are you feeling it
Are you feeling it too?
Baby can't keep my cool
Burning up around you
Are you feeling it, are you feeling it
Are you feeling it too?
Oh, so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone
I'm so restless, baby and I'm risking it all
Oh, oh, it's too late for taking it slow
Oh, so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone
I'm so restless, baby and I'm risking it all
Oh, oh, it's too late for taking it slow, baby yeah
I only want what I can't have
Oh I've got it bad
I'm so restless, baby that I'm out of control
Oh, oh, I can't wait to get you alone

Can't wait to get you alone
I can't wait, oh I can't wait
