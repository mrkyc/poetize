I want the honey
But I don't wanna get stung
We're trigger happy
Shouldn't be playing with guns

I've never felt this way
I know it's dangerous to play these games
The higher we get the further down we'll go
But I can't help it even though I know

Somebody's gonna get hurt
This kind of love was never built to last
But now we're fallin' head first
You know it's reckless when you move too fast
And it keeps me awake that the spell might break
It's too good to be true i'm afraid
Somebody's gonna get hurt

You're hearing whispers
That my behavior is bad, oh
You're posting pictures
Looks like you're having a blast
You might also like
You've never felt this way
You know it's dangerous to play these games
The higher we get the further down we'll go
But you can't help it even though you know

Somebody's gonna get hurt
This kind of love was never built to last
But now we're fallin' head first
You know it's reckless when you move too fast
And it keeps me awake that the spell might break
It's too good to be true I'm afraid
Somebody's gonna get hurt

But when we're here in the dark
I'm not afraid anymore
Your fingers trace a heart upon my pillow
Gave me the key to your place
You told me I would be safe
But still you got that lock up on your cell phone

I've never felt this way
I know it's dangerous to play these games
The higher we get the further down we'll go
That I can't help it even though I know
Somebody's gonna get hurt
This kind of love was never built to last
But now we're fallin' head first
You know it's reckless when you move too fast
And it keeps me awake that the spell might break
It's too good to be true I'm afraid
Somebody's gonna get hurt
