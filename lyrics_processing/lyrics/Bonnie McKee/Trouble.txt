How hard I tried avoiding your spell
It was a cold October night
It was a far from sober night
And I was taken at first sight
And this was much to your delight
I'd heard that you were lookin' for prey
Hungry for a different girl everyday
But you were so sly in coming in
I wouldn't fight, I let you win
Although the blood upon your chin
Told me exactly where you'd been
Trouble, trouble
(Troublemaker)
Who woulda thought I'd ever let somebody get to me?
Who woulda thought I'd ever give a damn? (Troublemaker)
I gave to you the one thing that I can never retrieve
And now you're leaving my heart bleeding in my hands
You told me all about your dreams (Troublemaker)
You were so "deep" - or so it seemed (Troublemaker)
Although I'm young, I'm not naive
I am not easy to deceive
You might also likeI see the danger that lies behind your eyes
And I wanna scream when you're rubbing on my thighs
Oh, I know I should, but I can't say no
Oh troublemaker, gotta let you go
Trouble, trouble
(Troublemaker)
Who woulda thought I'd ever let somebody get to me?
Who woulda thought I'd ever give a damn? (Troublemaker)
I gave to you the one thing that I can never retrieve
And now you're leaving my heart bleeding in my hands
I thought I knew you well (Troublemaker)
I thought you'd catch me if I fell (Troublemaker)
But when I fell, you never came
That's when I knew this was a game
I thought because I knew that I'd won
But honey, that's easier said than done
'Cause I lose my breath
When you're kissin' on my neck
Boy, you've got me in check
But I haven't lost yet
Trouble, trouble
Trouble
Troublemaker, troublemaker
Don't you bring it round here
