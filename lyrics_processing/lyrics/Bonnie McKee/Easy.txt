All I need, all I need
I need something easy
Need something easy, need something easy, need something easy

You walked right in as I was closing the door
I'm just escaping from the eye of the storm
I didn't mean to tumble into your arms
They're not my baby's, but they're keeping me warm

'Cause you touch my skin and the pain is fading
(Fading, fading, fading fading)
You're my medicine and I wanna take it (Take it, take it)

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me?
Give me what I need
Easy
Come on and just heal my hungry heart
Get me through this part

All I need (Oh), all I need (Oh)
I need something easy (Oh)
Need something easy, need something easy (Oh)

You are a candle and I'm scared of the dark (Ah)
I couldn't handle this, without you, I'm lost
I'm sorry, baby, 'cause I know you want more (Ah)
Slow down the pace until my heart's off the floor

'Cause you touch my skin and the pain is fading
(Fading, fading, fading)
You're my medicine and I wanna take it
(Take it, take it)

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me?
Give me what I need
Easy
Come on and just heal my hungry heart
Get me through this part

All I need (Oh), all I need (Oh)
I need something easy (Oh)
Need something easy, need something easy (Oh)

Help me, help me, help me, help me
'Cause I don't know how to be alone
When I'm on my own, I'm afraid to close my eyes
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
'Cause when you're here with me, all I have to feel
Is your body heat, when you're laying next to mine
'Cause you touch my skin and the pain is fading
(Fading, fading, fading, fading)
You're my medicine and I wanna take it
(Take it, take it, take it, ah)

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me?
Give me what I need
Easy (Oh)
Come on and just heal my hungry heart (Heal my heart)
Get me through this part

All I need (Oh), all I need (Oh)
I need something easy
(Need something easy, need something easy, oh)
Whoa, oh-oh (Oh)
All I need (Oh), all I need (Oh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Oh, oh)
