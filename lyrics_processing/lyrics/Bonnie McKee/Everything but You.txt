I put on my boots, my red leather coat
The one with the silver spikes
The one you used to tell me that you liked the most
I'm ready to move, my nails lookin' fly
Yeah, I got everything a girl could want except for you by my side

(Whoa) I love my friends, yeah, 'cause got my back
(Whoa) But don't know about the nights we had
(Whoa) It doesn't matter
(Whoa) 'Cause you're not mine anymore

But I know that I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
Everything but you, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
Everything but you, baby

When I'm alone, I picture your face
The way that you used to smile
Every time I sang along to Ace of Spades
So turn up the lights
Remember the highs
Yeah, I had everything a girl could want when I had you by my side
You might also like
(Whoa) I hear that song on the radio
(Whoa) It's the same shit everywhere I go
(Whoa) But it doesn't matter
(Whoa) 'Cause you're not mine anymore

But I know that I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
Everything but you, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
Everything but you, baby

Got sunglasses, fake lashes, and everything
I got hair-dye and wi-fi, and everything
Got my girls in bikinis, they're drinkin' Bellinis
My phone's always ringing a melody
Got that vintage t-shirt you were looking for (Everything but you)
And I'm thinner than I've ever been before (Everything but you)
Fridge is full of Corona's, I'm never alone (Everything but you)
'Cause I don't wanna know who you're fallin' for (Everything but you)
I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
Everything but you, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I know time is on my side
I have got everything but you, baby
