S-L-A-Y

Welcome to the part of the show
Where we fake it 'til we make it, oh
Livin' in the shadow is cold
Wanna burn bright, like the sunrise

'Cause I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
Let's show them how it's done

Come on everybody, let's go
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slayin' like 1999
Come on everybody, let's go
This is our universe
Feelin' flyer than firebirds
We'll keep slayin' it 'til the day we die
Come on everybody, let's

Once upon a time you believed

But then you didn't land on your feet (Uh)
In the jungle, better hustle (Oh)

I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
Let's show them how it's done

Come on everybody, let's go
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slayin' like 1999
Come on everybody, let's go
This is our universe
Feelin' flyer than firebirds
We'll keep slayin' it 'til the day we die
Come on everybody, let's

Tonight, you and I
We can shine like razor blades
Light 'em up and blow 'em away
That's right, you and I
We'll forget our yesterdays
Light 'em up and blow 'em away
Oh, I
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slayin' like 1999 (Yeah)

Come on everybody, let's go
This is our universe (Oh-oh)
Feelin' flyer than firebirds (Oh-oh)
We'll keep slayin' it 'til the day we die (We'll keep slayin' it 'til the day we die)
Tonight, you and I (Oh)
We can shine like razor blades (Oh, oh)
Light 'em up and blow 'em away (Oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh)
