Guarded, jaded
Promise, baby, I'll be worth the ride
Warm heart, cold blood
Soft touch, tough love
Burnt down, fucked up, just the way you like

There's something in my nature
That seems to fascinate ya
You got a taste for danger, don't know why (Uh)
And I don't want to hurt ya
I want your hands all over
But do you know how to handle me? 'Cause I

I got, I got thorns
Wear them like a crown, yeah
I got, I got thorns
You should know by now, yeah
I got, I got

That's what you get when you pick a rose
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Thorns
(That's what you get, what you, what you, what you get)
(That's what you get, what you, what you get, get, what you)
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Easy to love but I'm hard to hold
Thorns
(That's what you get, what you, what you, what you get)
(That's what you get, what you, what you get, get, what you)

Love me, hate me
Ain't no daisy
You want safety, find a daffodil
I can't help it
Wild, reckless
Leave you breathless, tangled up in silk

I got, I got thorns
Wear them like a crown, yeah
I got, I got thorns
You should know by now, yeah
I got, I got

That's what you get when you pick a rose
That's what you get when you pick a rose
Thorns

Easy to love but I'm hard to hold
