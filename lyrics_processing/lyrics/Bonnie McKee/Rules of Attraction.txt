Living my...
What's wrong with me?

I listen for your footsteps in the hallway
I'm waiting for the phone to ring
I know you're taken, baby, but I want you anyway
My own worst enemy
I see the way you push her hair from off her pretty face
And how you look at her
I see you whispering the words that you will never say to me
To me

Oh-oh, oh, it's getting serious
I don't know just what I gotta do to let you in

But these are just the rules of attraction, chemical reaction
You're totally unreachable
A victim of the rules of attraction
Want, but I can't have it
They're always unavailable
Tell me why I'm living my, the rules of attraction
You might also like
Why can't you see that I will never let you down
Or leave you in the dark?
Waste all this unrequited love, I feel like I could drown
It's gonna break my heart

Oh-oh,oh It's getting serious
I don't know just what I gotta do to let you in

But these are just the rules of attraction, chemical reaction
You're totally unreachable
A victim of the rules of attraction
Want, but I can't have it
They're always unavailable
Tell me why I'm living my, the rules of attraction
Loving my, the rules of attraction

If I can't be laying beside you
I'll just keep dreaming of your touch
I'll close my eyes and love you from afar

But these are just the rules of attraction, chemical reaction
You're totally unreachable
A victim of the rules of attraction
Want, but I can't have it
They're always unavailable
But these are just the rules of attraction, chemical reaction
You're totally unreachable
A victim of the rules of attraction
Want, but I can't have it
They're always unavailable
Tell me why I'm living my, the rules of attraction
