I fell in love in a 7/11 parkin' lot
Sat on the curb drinking Slurpees we mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams
And how we would show 'em all
Whoa-oh-oh
I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be gettin' in my way
But if you talk with your hands, then we can negotiate
Whoa-oh-oh

I'll just keep movin' my body (Yeah)
I'm always ready to party (Yeah)
No, I don't listen to mommy (Yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

I am an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world
Hot blooded, all-American girl, whoa
I was raised by a television
Everyday is a competition
Put the key into my ignition, oh, ayo
You might also like
I wanna see all the stars and everything in between
I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
'Cause it's a free country, so baby, we can do anything
Whoa-oh-oh

I'll just keep movin' my body (Yeah)
I'm always ready to party (Yeah)
No, I don't listen to mommy (Yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

I am an American girl
Hot blooded, and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world
Hot blooded, all-American girl, whoa
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key into my ignition, oh, ayo

You know we're gonna shine so bright
(Oh, we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh, baby, gonna go all night
(Oh, we're gonna go all night)
You know we're gonna shine so bright
(Oh, we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh, baby, gonna go all night
I am an American girl
Hot blooded, and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world (I'm takin' over)
Hot blooded, all-American girl
(I am an American girl)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key into my ignition, oh, ayo
I am an American girl (Oh)
Hot blooded, and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world (I'm takin' over, whoa)
