A promise I intend to keep
But the subject matter hits
A little too close to home
And now I can't take back what I gave
With all the times we've seen
The states that we've been in
You always saved me from my troubled self
It seemed...
But now I'm hearing all these words you say
And I'm not sure if I can stay
And listen to you melting all my dreams
Baby it's you that kept my feet on the ground
Thought that I could choose
If I always wanted you around
Darling, I do
Think we need time apart
I still need time to mend my broken seams
I told you I'd listen to you
So I'm all ears
But don't ask me to respond to your pleas
For my advice
'Cause now I'm too burdened to speak
You might also likeBaby it's you that kept my feet on the ground
Thought that I could choose
If I always wanted you around
Darling, I do
Think we need time apart
I still need time to mend my broken seams
I can't be by myself
But there is no one else
And well it hurts to know someone else
Tastes your lips
And I can not forget how hard I cried
When I'd discovered you had lied
When you said I could never hurt like this
Baby it's you that kept my feet on the ground
I thought that I could choose
If I always wanted you around
Darling, I do think that we need time apart
And I think the time has come for me go
'Cause I'm weary, I'm so weary
I told you I'd be there
I'm broken I'm so broken
But I'm here
It's painful, it's so painful
I told you I'd be there
These are secrets I cannot afford to hear
