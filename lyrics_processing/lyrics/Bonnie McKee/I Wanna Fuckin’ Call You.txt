Hot kiss on a Saturday night
One wish under neon light
So good that it's out of control
One look and I'm ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
One look and I'm ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go (Go, go, go)

I wanna fucking call you
Put the phone away
'Cause even if I want to
I know I gotta wait, wait, wait
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name?
Boy, it's such a shame
Because I wanna fucking call you
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
I want it now

Brown eyes, are you thinkin' of me
And that night, on the washing machine?
A rough draft that'll never get sent
I just wanna do it again
Do it again, do it again
I just wanna do it again
Again, again, again, again
You might also like
I wanna fucking call you
Put the phone away
'Cause even if I want to
I know I gotta wait, wait, wait
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name?
Boy, it's such a shame
Because I wanna fucking call you
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
I want it now

So, I'm gonna wait for you
I wanna see your move
Come on and quit the teasing
But don't call me up too soon
'Cause, baby, if you do
You're making it too easy

You guys, don't let me text him
Do not let me text him
Oh my God, it's him
I mean... really?
It hasn't been two days yet, bro, relax
I wanna fucking call you
Put the phone away
'Cause even if I want to
I know I gotta wait, wait, wait
I wanna know
Is it a mistake, dialing your name?
Boy, it's such a shame
Because I wanna fucking call you
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
