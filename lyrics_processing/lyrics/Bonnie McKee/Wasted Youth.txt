They say youth is wasted, wasted on the young
So then tell me why are we having so much fun?
All the midnight dreamers, falling into love
In our torn up sneakers, yeah, we were born to run
So I'm begging you

Hold on, hold on to your wasted youth
Hang on, hang on 'cause it's gone so soon
So let's get it while we're young
(We're the wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)

Yeah, we're bored and jaded, sharin' bubble gum (Oh)
But these nights are sacred, there's freedom in our blood
Oh, so I'm begging you

Hold on, hold on to your wasted youth
(We're diamonds in the rough)
Hang on, hang on 'cause it's gone so soon
(Let's get it while we're young)
And shine on, 'cause we'll never be the same
We'll never be the same
(You know, you know the truth)
Hold on, hold on to your wasted youth
Let's get it while we're young
Let's get it while we're young
(Get it while we're young, get it while we're young)
Let's go
You might also like
Let's get stupid right now
Get to fooling around
Jump in the pool with your clothes on
Sleep in your shoes on the futon
'Cause all we got is right now
So we're makin' it count
Roll down the windows and scream it
Let's get it while we're young

Hold on, hold on to your wasted youth
(We're diamonds in the rough)
Hang on, hang on 'cause it's gone so soon
(Let's get it while we're young)
And shine on, 'cause we'll never be the same
We'll never be the same
(You know, you know the truth)
Hold on, hold on to your wasted youth
Let's get it while we're young

Whoa, whoa
We're the wasted (Wasted, wasted)
Let's get it while we're young
Whoa, whoa
Let's get it while we're young
Let's get it while we're young
Whoa, whoa
We're the wasted (Wasted, wasted)
We're the wasted (Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)
Whoa, whoa
We're the wasted (Wasted, wasted)
We're the wasted (Wasted, wasted youth)
Whoa, whoa
