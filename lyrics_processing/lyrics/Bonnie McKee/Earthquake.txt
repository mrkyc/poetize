It starts with the sonic boom
Stepped into the room
Got me like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You, you're just like a beat
Knock me off my feet
Got me feeling low, low, low, low

The way that you're moving me, I know
The tremors I'm feeling ain't no joke
It's scaring me, I can't get away
You rock my world

You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
You're like a heartbreak
And the pieces shatter all on the floor, all on the floor
I look at you and my defenses come tumbling down
You got me falling, head spinning 'round and 'round
You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
Earthquake

Bang, caught me by surprise
Aftershocks subside
But I miss them, go, go, go, go
I'm barely holding on
Kinda like the ride
Got me feeling go, go, go, go
You might also like
The way that you're moving me, I know
The tremors I'm feeling ain't no joke
It's scaring me, I can't get away
You rock my world

You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
You're like a heartbreak
And the pieces shatter all on the floor, all on the floor
I look at you and my defenses come tumbling down
You got me falling, head spinning 'round and 'round
You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
Earthquake

Ten point O on the Richter scale
Brace myself for another wave
Buildings start falling
When you touch my body, body
You're breaking me down
Down, down

The way that you're moving me, I know
The tremors I'm feeling ain't no joke
It's scaring me, I can't get away
You rock my world
You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
You're like a heartbreak
And the pieces shatter all on the floor, all on the floor
I look at you and my defenses come tumbling down
You got me falling, head spinning 'round and 'round
You're like an earthquake
Got my body shaking out of control, out of control
