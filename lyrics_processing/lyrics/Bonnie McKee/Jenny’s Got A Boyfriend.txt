Jenny's got a boyfriend, I see them out all the time
Jenny's got a boyfriend, he's a perfect design
The way he wears his clothes and smokes his cigarette
I wonder if he throws her all around in bed
Jenny's got a boyfriend, and he's gonna be mine

And when the night is over
And I go home all by myself
Pretend that he is closer
I say I promise not to tell
So won't you give it to me?

Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your boyfriend
I think I'm falling for your man
Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your man
I think I'm falling
We were sittin' in the cab, he was thinkin' something bad
I could feel it (Can you feel it, baby?)
Oh Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your man
Mmm, so won't you give him to me?

Jenny's got a boyfriend, I gotta keep him away
(Girl, you better lock him up)
'Cause every time I see him, I wanna make a mistake
(Why you lookin' at me like that? Nuh-uh)
I wanna get to go and workin' up a sweat
I wanna let him know what what he could have instead
I feel my body shaking when he's looking at me (Woo)

Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your boyfriend (Woo)
I think I'm falling for your man
Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your man
(Ooh Jenny)
I think I'm falling (I'm sorry)
We were sittin' in the cab, he was thinkin' something bad
I could feel it (Can you feel it, baby? I think he felt it too)
Oh Jenny, Jenny, think I'm falling, think I'm falling for your man
Oh girl, mmm, so won't you give him to me?
