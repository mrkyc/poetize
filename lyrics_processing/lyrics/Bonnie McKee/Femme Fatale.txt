You think I look free
You wanna own me
I know I'm making your heart pound
And it's all with the wink of an eye
It's all with the wink of an eye
You're coming near me, you don't even fear me
You on my trail like a bloodhound
Baby, I'll play a trick on your mind
I'll play a trick on your mind, whoa

Come on, tell me, baby, can't you feel it?
I'ma catch you in the web I'm weavin'
Oh, with just a smile I can take you down
Baby, I'm a femme fatale
I can turn the bass into the treble
I can be an angel or a devil
You can love me but you should be careful now
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Femme fatale)
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Oh oh oh)
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Femme fatale)
(Oh oh oh) Baby, I'm a femme fatale (oh oh oh)
Baby, I'm a femme fatale

I'm on a mission like a magician
I'm gonna use an illusion
And they fall for it every time
They fall for it every time
I got the power search and devour
And I like the way that you're moving
So tonight I am making you mine
T-T-T-T-Tonight I am making you mine

Come on, tell me, baby, can't you feel it?
I'mma catch you in the web I'm weavin'
Oh with just a smile I can take you down
Baby, I'm a femme fatale
I can turn the bass into the treble
I can be an angel or a devil
You can love me but you should be careful now
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Femme fatale)
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Oh oh oh)
Baby, I'm a femme fatale (Femme fatale)
(Oh oh oh) Baby, I'm a femme fatale (oh oh oh)
