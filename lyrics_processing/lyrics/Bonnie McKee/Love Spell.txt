I've been stuck in the dark
Stumbling around, reaching out for my heart
Wonderin' just how I allowed you to turn the light out inside of me
You got tricks up your sleeve
And you hold the power to keep me intrigued
Well, I guess I should have known
I guess I should have seen
That you would pull the love right from underneath

I'm under your love spell, I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares, no one even comes close, baby
You got that magic I need and it's holding me hostage
And now I've just become prisoner to your love, baby
Well, I'm trying to let go but I don't know how
Won't you set me free? Give me the remedy
For this love spell, yeah, love spell

Should have heard what they said
When they told me I end up caught in your web
I thought that I was strong, don't know what went wrong But now I'm frozen in your captivity

Under your love spell, I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares, no one even comes close, baby
You got that magic I need and it's holding me hostage
And now I've just become prisoner to your love, baby
Well, I'm trying to let go but I don't know how
Won't you set me free? I need a remedy
You might also like
From this love spell that you cast over me
I can't speak, I can't see
I've been poisoned with romance
And it's cruel 'cause you know what you're doing
You cast this illusion that I stand a chance
But I'm just standing

Under your love spell, I'm just trying to forget you
But nobody compares, no one even comes close
You got that magic I need and I can't let go
Won't you set me free? I need a remedy
For this love spell, hey, love spell, oh

Love spell
