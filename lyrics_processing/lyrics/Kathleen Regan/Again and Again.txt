You said "Alright, if you could trade a life
Be anything you like
What would you choose?
There's no answer that is wrong or right
Be famous over night
Take a rocket to the moon
Being heiress to a fortune
Win every game show that you go on
Be 1560 Shakespearse's girlfriend"
And I said

I'd do this again and again and again
It's all I'd ever know
Retrace every step to get to you
I'd still follow
And take my time
Through every high and every low
Never ever letting go
If I had a million other lives to live
I'd do this again and again and again and again and again
I'd do this again and again and again and again and again

They know the face that you're giving me
How could you really be somebody's favorite?
How out of any other life to lead
Even make-believe that I wouldn't trade it
For some distance private island
Make some archeological finding
Odds are I would still be trying
You might also like
To do this again and again and again
It's all I'd ever know
Retrace every step to get to you
I'd still follow
And take my time
Through every high and every low
Never ever letting go
If I had a million other lives to live
I'd do this again and again and again and again and again
I'd do this again and again and again and again and again

Every slow dance, too unforgettable
Every late night talk, sorry for the slamming door
Every morning, we falling back in bed
Why would there e anything I would want instead?

I'd do this again and again and again
It's all I'd ever know
Retrace every step to get to you
I'd still follow
And take my time
Through every high and every low
Never ever letting go
If I had a million other lives to live
I'd do this again and again and again and again and again
