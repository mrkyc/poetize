I've let my past decide how I should feel today
And look where it's got us, babe
It's eating me alive even to say
I'm here (here always)
Tryna stop the flood from where the flowers lay
I might let the levee break

I will for our sake
Let it break, let it break
I will for our sake
Let it break, let it break

I know I'm way too old to play these little girl games
'Cause look where, it's got us, babe
You've been so good to me
I can't sit here and make you wait
Like you'd be here (here always)
Tryna stop the flood from where the flowers lay
I might let the levee break
Break

I will for our sake
Let it break, let it break
I will for our sake
Let it break, let it break (yeahh)
You might also like
Oooh, for our sake
I heard if you force things they will break
'Cause now I'm conscious of the risk (yeah)
I scream them out just like an activist
I'm still young
I'm cut out for love but is love cut out for this
I've had my guard up, can you blame me?
But you had yours up too when I met you, ain't that the same thing?
(It's the same thing)
All this here finger pointing let's get together
Nothing flamboyant
My heart is calling out for you to fill the void and
Stay
Every night and every day
I think of ways to stop tip-toeing round you like ballet
Like come on T, he has a key - pull up, valet
All the things he do for you, know you wanna downplay
Let's start a clean slate, cause you know what it's been
You got me
So now rapping, here's a sister who can sing
It ain't a thing, let's make a date
'Cause I ain't on a lay, lay
Kicking flows that'll make him say... Hey

I will (will) for our sake (for our sake)
Let it break, (let it break) let it break
I will for our sake (for our sake)
Let it break, let it break
(Let it break)
I will for our sake (let it break)
Let it break, let it break (let it break yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will for our sake
Let it break, let it break
(Break)
(Break)
(Break)
(Break)
(Break)
(Break)
