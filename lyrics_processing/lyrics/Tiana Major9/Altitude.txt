Oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I
Oh-oh I, oh-oh I

I woke up early today
Opened my eyes
Only to see the sun shining down on me
I can hear the birds outside my windows
Chirping and singing songs and flying free
I turned my radio on and I hear my favourite song playing
The music is moving something inside me
And I can only pray
This mood won't change

Oh, come with us and you'll see something
That you've never seen before
How about if you, take flight and reach my altitude?
There'll be no need for the floor

Oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh-oh-oh
You might also like
Fasten your seatbelts
And turn on your flight mode
'Cause we're going up
Surfing the galaxies
I hope that my nose don't bleed
Staring at stars while they smile at us

On my way to work
I see the same faces that pass me each and everyday
The mandem selling CD's
The schoolkids, the mums
And the beggars dressed way better than me, yeah
Getting on with their lives
I doubt they even have time to sing
Or notice the beauty they missed, 'cause their duties exist far from this city
Oh, what a shame

Oh, come with us and you'll see something
That you've never seen before, yeah
How about if you, take flight and reach my altitude?
There'll be no need for the floor

Oh oh, oh I, oh I, oh-oh, hey
Uh
Fasten your seatbelts
And turn on your flight mode
'Cause we're going up
Surfing the galaxies
I hope that my nose don't bleed

Fasten your seatbelts
And turn on your flight mode
'Cause we're going up
Surfing the galaxies
I hope that my nose don't bleed
