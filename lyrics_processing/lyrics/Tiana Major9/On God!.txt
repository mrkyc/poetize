It's like I'm not around or something
Like you're waiting for me to change
If I gotta move at your speed of love
We gotta get the you out the way
Over complicating what's easy
Asking what we doing
But you like the way I do it
When we do it

You've been around for too long
If I didn't want you, I'd go
I can't imagine life without you now
Feel like it's me that did wrong
Need something sure to lean on
But I can't imagine life without you

We ain't gotta make it too hard (Too hard)
Know you got a piece of my heart (My heart)
I'm for you, baby, that's on God (on God)
I love you, baby, that's on God (I love you, baby, that's on God)
We ain't gotta make it too hard (Too hard)
You got me pouring my heart out
I'm for you, baby, that's on God (on God)
I love you, baby, that's on God (I love you, baby, that's on God)

Ooh, you touching me like that
You know what's next
You're talking bad, now you're on your back
You on that push and pull, where you running to?
I got time today, we ain't through
You touching me like that
You know what's next
You're talking bad, now you're on your back
You on that push and pull, where you running to?
I got time today, we ain't through, yeah

Ooh-ooh, you're gonna miss it
So make a decision right now
Is you with it or is you not with it?
I ain't tryna press ya
So don't get defensive
Make a decision right now
Is you is or is you not ready?
