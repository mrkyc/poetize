I love it when I'm in your car and in your presence
I'll show you all these songs
I wrote about you baby
I'll play you the songs that you inspire
Babe, are you home? Let's take a ride
I love it when I'm in your car and in your presence

I'm on your ends
Let's get in the wind
I don't know when I'ma be back
This way

Yeah, yeah
Yeah
I'm never not thinking
I think I think too much
I keep the feelings tucked
Playing though, hoping you
Don't call my bluff
This is scary are we getting close?
When you're around me I do the most
Can't hide it no more, it shows
I introduce you to D'Angelo and Esperanza
Tryna impress you is all I do Stevie Wonder
We feeling mellow so I play some JD
Queue up the Kanye cause I see you waiting
I'm taking you to places you ain't been
My playlist is how you get to know me
Ain't nothing hidden wear my heart up on my sleeve
But still I keep it Gucci like I'm rocking red and green
You know I'm fire
And I'm your number one supplier
I take you higher
Word to that tree and the messiah
Hope you play this when you feel euphoria
Yeah they say they love you
