Oh, here we go again
This might be the 80th song you'll never hear based on you
I'm stacking paper, and it's not the kind in rubber bands
All my free time is spent on you
I feel psychic, I know what's next
But, I don't know how the ink's still wet
Maybe my dried cries are in my head
If I came out my shell, will it stop the carousel?
And will my force be at rest?

This is the part where I
Try my hardest not to cry, but
I still end up with sore eyes

This is like a merry go
Move so fast, I can't let go
Will it stop? I'll never know
Probably grave your name in stone
You know that I hate sequel
But you move so fast I'm holding on to something like a merry go. Maybe this is like a miracle

This is the part where I
Try my hardest not to cry, but
I still end up with sore eyes

Songs of starvation and drought
Never seem to leave my mouth
I'm far too concerned with my own thirst
World peace and racism should be on my cranium
But my mind always seems to put you first
I could try lying in my songs
But they wouldn't connect with the people listening at home
Paint a pretty picture with my words
But I would rather prefer inspiring little boys and girls show 'em they deserve so much more than what I settled for (yeah yeah yeah), but then my pen touches my pad and I'm right back on course

This is the part (This is the part) where I
Try my hardest (Where I try) not to cry,but
I still end up with sore eyes (Ahh!)

This is like a merry go (This is like ahh)
Move so fast, I can't let go
Will it stop? I'll never know (ooo)
Probably grave your name in stone
You know that I hate sequel
But you move so fast I'm holding on to something like a merry go Maybe this is like a miracle

This is the part where I
Try my hardest not to cry, but
I still end up with sore eyes (Oooh, ohh!)
