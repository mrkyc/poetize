I'm straight slapping with this track a classic I must say
The hot pocket popping in the back of the mustang
Dumbys stay slumped backing up in that one way
Fuck with D you stay broke like hobos with no bus change
For fucks sake I'm tryna get this paper like asap
No rocky but I rock the town like Stray Cats
Ace back with heat, baking meats
Poppin lames in the street, that's what the fuck I call gangsta beats
All I see is carbon copy your style's kinda sloppy
Y'Need to pack your bullshit back up in that jalopy
These phasers tryna stop me man they looking like octagons
Box the don pop you on this beat that I'm dropping on
Rocket launch a jocker through the fire like Chaka Khan
Play with muah you'll top and sliced like Papa Johns
C'mon dog y'allready know how it goes
It's Out Con Westside no love for hoes let's go

Yeah we be rolling straight up potion straight up down the street
Yeah Outer Concept got them freakin' funky gangsta beats
Yeah we be riding straight combining all the sounds we know
Yeah we be hollering non stop yeah yeah we out here hoes

It's Majedi I spit raw I hit you with the southpaw
Call my lawyer Harvey Birdman at law
I play games like saw that leave you dead
A bullet to the head if you fuck wit Majed
You acting crazy welcome to the sanitarium
Got more stars than a fucking planetarium
And yeah we scaring them we in ya nightmares
You can't come to our side without the right fare
And check my light hair it's flowing in the breeze
Our Out Con power bring you to your knees
Don't wanna hear please, thank you, welcome
Cause we cooking up beef hope it's well done
And that smell son is what the Rocks cooking
We building up an empire when you not looking
Up in your spot cooking because I mastered this
And watch out cause Majedi can be hazardous

Hitting hydraulic switches rolling down the boulevard
Letting all these ratchet bitches know who is really hard
The Concept bitch that's the gang I bang with
Ima let y'all know that we the wrong niggas to fuck with
Some young wild niggas drinkin' 40s hangin on the block
Doing what we doing in the streets saying fuck cops
We some true ridas their ain't no hiding from us
We really out here kicking dust is a must
Niggas say the West is dead but I'm bringing it back
Bangin on wax I said before this shit ain't for wacks

So I keep two Glocks Thug Life is in me

Yeah we be rolling straight up potion straight up down the street
Yeah Outer Concept got them freakin' funky gangsta beats
Yeah we be riding straight combining all the sounds we know
