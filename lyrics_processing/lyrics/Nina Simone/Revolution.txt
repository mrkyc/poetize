And now we got a revolution
'Cause I see the face of things to come
Yeah, your Constitution
Well, my friend, it's gonna have to bend
I'm here to tell you 'bout destruction
Of all the evil that will have to end
(It will, oh, yes, will end
Don'tcha know it's gonna be) All right
(It will end) Well, all right
Well, all right
Some folks are gonna get the notion
I know, they'll say I'm preachin' hate
But if I have to swim the ocean
Well, I would just to communicate
It's not as simple as talkin' jive
The daily struggle just to stay alive
(Alive and well on Earth
Don'tcha know it's gonna be) Well, all right
(Stay alive) Alive and well
Sing about a revolution
Because I'm talkin' 'bout a change
It's more than just air pollution
Well, you know you got to clean your brain
The only way that we can stand, in fact
Is when you get your foot off our back
(Get off our backs, get back
Don'tcha know it's gonna be) All right
(Well, get back) Get back
Well, all right
