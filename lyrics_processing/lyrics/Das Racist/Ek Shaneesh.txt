I'm from Queens, man
Ain't shit to do but cook
Watchin' Tony Bourdain
Plus I copped his book
Plus I copped his look
That means T-shirts and jeans
Catch me in my borough chasin' breezers with creame
Squeezes with dreams
Do you
I'mma do me
Catch me in my borough burnin' L's, readin' Rumi
Flippin' pies, readin' fries
I'm advising Kabir, smokin' hash
Making cash, spinnin' Sufis
Drinkin' beer, forty kufi rock a sheer
Sportin' loosies in the clear
Drinkin' beer, drinkin' beer, probably drinkin' some more beer

Yeah, beers for years
Chuckin' Shaka Zulu type-spears for ears
Jakaya Kikwete
Machete, machete
Ek Shaneesh, Cheech
Eddie said speaks, sheesh

Who you calling a dandy
Our love is like candy
The rich pour brandy
What do the poor pour
Why we at the candy store for
Why we at the Mandy Moore tour
Band du jour or brand du jour
Or the land before time
The wartime Andy Warhol, the war crime
Nancy Drew

Dancing bear in cahoots with the man who shot ya
Who shot ya
Who shot ya
Who shot ya
Who shot you
