Me and Maya Angelou
Playin' double dutch
She got a bubble butt
Said I like you too
Then we smoked two dutch
That's a double dutch my dude
I really like her views
Yes
You could say
Angelou's my muse
Skinny jeans
Fat wallets
Chakras from papa
I'm in Maracaibo
Vic is in Caracas
He Cuban, movin'
Eatin' a Cuban sandwich
I'm pukin'
Tryin' to write some rap tracks in Sanskrit
Now I'm in Vioco(?)
With yoke by the boatload
Head tight
Egg whites
Red lights, go though
MoMA, Mama
Thrown off the train
General Dyer
Blown off the brain
Gats in the camera
Cats in the bama
Throw out the lame
Step up the game
Cash in the Jansport
Grass in my hand, Ma
So cra- cra- man
So insane

Tougher than Ethiopian warfare
Mohair coats from the goat's back
Cocaine blunts we smoke that
Kodak moments
Eating donuts
Listening to coke rap
Listening to joke rap
Listening to Donuts
Listening to grown-ups
Listening to Camus
Listening to Cam too watching Shampoo
Washing my hair with shampoo
