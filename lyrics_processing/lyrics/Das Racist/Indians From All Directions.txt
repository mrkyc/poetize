Yo I'm an Indian, from all directions
From the west to the east
I'm the best and I keep weapons in reach
 down on the streets
Getting head on the beach
Counting bread in my sheets
In my bed when I sleep
In my head's Pete and Pete
Polaris, Hey Sandy
Putting knots in my pocket
Putting knots in my back
Getting guap off the rap
I'm like, "How can she slap?!"
How can a beat slap so hard?
I cross the street, Queens Boulevard
So many cars, got so many bars
Born to be wild I get kicked out of bars
Get your motor running, riding on the highway
Yo, I did it my way, yeah she likes it my way
Hanging out Heems, I be hanging out in Queens
I be hanging out in Brooklyn
My clan is the ???
Trying to make a milli, with the thrilly, I'm in Philly
Now New Delhi, I'm so silly, willy nilly, yo for realy

On the track with a dot and a feather
Y'all white, we not, we better
We hot, y'all not, need sweater
Pussy get wetter
Hit it with a Pearl Jam, that Vedder
That kid Kool A.D., oh yeah you're a real go getter
Y'all not nice, think twice, think better
Faster, stronger, fitter, happier
?? up, ?? up, 'cause I did it from flow up
Game sold up, we all grown up now
What now
You don't really want to with the K to the O to the O to the O
To the L to the L to the L to the Ella
Hey dudda dudda damn!
Put my money in my motherfucking hand
I'm a motherfucking man
Doing what I motherfucking can
Wherever the fuck a motherfucker stands
Red Woods to the New York islands
What up to the white man
You aight, but this ain't your motherfucking land
