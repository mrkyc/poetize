It's 1991 and the party is fun
It's 1992 and the party is you
It's 1993 and the party is me
It's 1994, do you want more?
It's 1995 and the party is live
It's 1996 and the party is sick
It's 1997 and the party is ill
It's 1998 and the party is great

It's irrelevant tell me where my cheddar went
Money is my time and I like my time better spent
How do you 'splain, how do you 'splain
Money missin', from the end listenin' dope boys trippin'
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, once I hit it, I ain't quit it
Want it back like a rebate, like I'm on a sweepstakes
Replay, can't stand straight, can't speak straight
Replay, replay, replay, lovers played each other
Now I got another son with another mother
He don't look nothing like his older half brother
Scold him when he, hurt her, love him if he murder
Brother like a lover, cook the best burgers
Never though I'd get my cream tooken, Queens, Brooklyn
Shook him I'm a shook hand
I miss my duffel bag, how you run with that?
Want my burner back, you got no, gun to clap
Streets chit chat deadbeat dad
Woulda let you have it if I thought you need that
Funny that, thought you loved me back, want my money back
How you gonna laugh me and leave me? Heartlessly
G me? Love me and be me? Believe me we
Need me, you skeevy and greedy, Johnny need his mom
