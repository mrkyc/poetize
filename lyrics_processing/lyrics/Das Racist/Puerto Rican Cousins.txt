V-I-C droppin' styles you ain't used to
New school, old school, cocoa puff, coo-coo
Choo-choo-choose to be half Lisa Simpson, half Ralphie
Put my T.V. to Pacini falling off the balcony
South Beach diet
Powder me up, powder me down, white riot
Sublime cover band-types like it, maybe you should try it
Maybe you should buy it, you should probably buy it

Shorty said we look like (like Puerto Rican cousins)

I wanna ride on my own, though
Try to save the world like Bono
Be the token brother in an ad for Disaronno
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Ramadan
Got more rhymes than Jay Elec got ramalama-ding-dongs
Parmesan cheese on the ravioli
Holy Spicoli, Batman! I'm Sean Penn (whaat?)

Bug's Life tatty on my stomach cause we buzzin
Shrug life tatty on my back cause I'm shruggin

On the Upper West Side like Jews do, one line
Seen JuJu's cousin on the F-train one time
I be like Eli Porter, yes, I got dumb rhymes
Sit back, relax cause we finna have a fun time
People think I'm Rican 'cause of the way that I be speakin'
And the shorties I be freakin plus the people that we reaching
With this music; people think we stupid
Then they peep the tape and smarten up to the movement

Bagged a degree in English but proficient in Blackanese
Smoke so many trees I'm turning Japanese
I really think so; commie, pinko
Schizo, ginkgo biloba
Performing "My Sharona" at talent shows across Girona
Drinkin Coronas in Daytona, loner
Bulova on my wrist, beluga cavi in my tummy
Brendan Fraser in The Mummy
Type-casted time-traveller, action!
I'm counting Jacksons with black friends
Counting tens in Benzes with white friends
Wondering if suicide's a largely white trend
Google it later and confirm that, a'ight then
Stars and stripes, man, give me my stipend
We alright, type type man
