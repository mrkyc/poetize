The white man can't even go outside
He'll get a disease
I'm talking about how like
White people can't even go outside into the sunlight
Without contracting a disease
Like that skin cancer
Got their SPF3000s
Can't even go out into the sunlight!
What good is that?
So they stay in their computer shorts
On their computers

All tan botanical fanatic; saboteur
With the Thandie Newton-type tan chick
Your man sick, I'm known to eat a sandwich
Last tan nobleman of the last apocalypse
On the metropolis, an acropolis, poppin' shit
Out my esophagus, no, my voice box
Das Racist, we kinda like rap noise pop
Mad rhymes, finna blow up like landmines
All tan everything, shout out to tanlines
All tan khaki king, last white mogul
All you see is rupees when you Google
Rubies in his doo-doo, emeralds in his turban
Nervous, swervin' in the Suburban in Durban
All tan mans, stay tangent to Tanzania
With a Mia Farrow-looking sparrow to help me re-up
