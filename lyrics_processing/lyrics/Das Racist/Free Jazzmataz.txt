Innocent eyes like that of a turtle
Purple nurple, titty twister
Wet willy, my fuzzy verbal math is
Silly but cute, a fat gerbil
11foot8.com
Hot mom, Dodge Caravan
Monster truck wheels, who cares, man?
New Chairman Mao
But dumb, gun shy, dumb guy
Run blind towns with one eye
While any child pop star malfunctions
All black Maybachs turn to pumpkins
In 2012, oh welly well
In a belly shirt, R. Kelly
Kirk Hammett shredding bananas
Damn, blood

Damn, blood
I lay back to the max like why gild the lily
Rock shows from Philly to the Billy Billy
For silly kids who burn Phillies
Swishers, Dutchies, East Indian Masters
With the ghetto blaster, talk about Shasta
Vijay Iyer, DR
It's free jazzmataz
Scream on your ass like a minority dad
Minorities mad, who you foolin, B?
White people's skin is their jewelry
You might also like
Do it Hima, me?
Maneuvering's nothing new to me
Ma, Nuva ring's nothing new to me
Cuban, B, poking the baloney
You people so Ponyboy
Macho Man Randy scandalous savages more noble
Porno, global, corner store, Pedialyte
Mosquito bite Peter (???)
And politics is no fun for young guns
Young ones want fun
Give it to them, take it from them, make them want it
Wake and bake, one take Jakes taking bacon from them

I take one of your chicks
Straight from under your armpit
The brown Brad Pitt, Mark Ruffalo
Something like the Duffman
Tough man, duff your mans like w's, man
Yoga fire, copyright infringement
Kids is getting it in
Babies having babies, navy colored avies
Maybe you could pay me
Cyberbully lame bands until they murk themselves
Working themselves up over nothing
Bumping something cooler than what bump in your tape player
Playa, I'm great, stay away, rare flare mayor
Good luck
Hooligans packing toolies, acting unruly
Fiji water, greed disease
Please, all I need is sess and a cool breeze
Maybe some palm trees, some leaves to eat
And a roof over my dome, a home
Alone, MacCaulay Culkin Straw Dogs
Don't even go there again, girlfriend
There's your man, spray-tanning Dakota Fanning
At the Getty gas station
Petty cash making
Chuck E. Cheese, mouse traps, star power
Nap 20 minutes like Da Vinci did
Lewinski lips on the Frisbee
Quick, look, it's the Dixie Chicks
RISD, bricks, thizzy(?), get with me
If you want it, and if you don't want it, then don't

I won't
The brother cold, scold foes
Ace Ventura seventh grade humor tumor
Family Guy quoting for laughs
You played out
See something, spray something
Get sprayed out
No way out
My senorita que loque
Like no way ose
Dimelo hombre que fue
This is your brain on drugs, frying
The white man like Simba, Mufasa, lying
If I'm lying I'm dying, trying, buying time
More the Rafiki type, freaky deaky type
Poo poo pee pee type, tonight get light
Get right, right in the head
New Jamba Juice is my house
New my house is your house
My new mouth is your blouse
I GMail spoken word poetry to a cloud
That Dick Cheney made with his brain piece
Diplo's drunk ass approved it
For bringing back all that smart shit that's actually stupid
I'm actually pooping in my hand and throwing it at Superman
Spiderman vs. X-Men, who's gonna win?
Tannins, Obama
Structural steel, what's it all mean?
Bear Vasquez, pause
I wear baskets on my head sometimes
Don't ask me where, ask if you can buy some and how much it is
Your sister put me on her bucket list
If you don't like this song, go suck a dick
This is the best song ever
Better than "Juicy," better than "Fur Elise"
Better than any song made by Jay-Z
Better than "Two Weeks" by Grizzly Bear
That's a pretty good song, right? You like that one?
It's better than the intro song to Pee-Wee Herman
