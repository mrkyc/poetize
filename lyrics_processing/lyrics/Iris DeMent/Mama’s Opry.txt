Her daddy played the fiddle
And used to do the calling when they had hoedowns
She says the neighbors would come
And they'd move all my grandma's furniture around
And there'd be twenty or more there on the old wooden floor Dancing to a country sound
The Carters and Jimmie Rodgers played her favorite songs
And on Saturday nights there was a radio show
And she would sing along
And I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me
That she'd dreamed about singing at The Grand Old Opry
Her eyes, oh, how they sparkled when she sang those songs
While she was hanging the clothes on the line
I was a kid just a humming along
Well, I'd be playing in the grass
To her, what might have seemed obliviously
But there ain't no doubt about it she sure made her mark on me
And she played old gospel records on the phonograph
She turned them up loud and we'd sing along
But those days have passed
Just now that I am older, it occurs to me
That I was singing in the grandest opry
You might also like
And we sang "Sweet Rose of Sharon, Abide With Me"
Until I ride "The Gospel Ship to Heaven's Jubilee"
And "In That Great Triumphant Morning" my soul will be free
And "My Burdens Will Be Lifted" when my Saviour's face I see

So "I Don't Want to Get Adjusted to This World below"
But I know "He'll Pilot Me" until it comes time to go
Oh, nothing on this earth is half as dear to me
As the sound of my Mama's opry

And we sang "Sweet Rose of Sharon, Abide With Me"
Until I ride "The Gospel Ship to Heaven's Jubilee"
And "In That Great Triumphant Morning" my soul will be free
And "My Burdens Will Be Lifted" when my Saviour's face I see

So "I Don't Want to Get Adjusted to This World below"
But I know "He'll Pilot Me" until it comes time to go
Oh, nothing on this earth is half as dear to me
