Well, I looked up into heaven, I thought I'd solve life's mysteries
I observed the constellations for a clue to my destiny
The rhyme of life confounds me, things will be as things will be
So I'll just dance the shores of Jordan till the angels carry me

I'm gonna let my feet go dancing to my very favorite songs
'Cause I know my time for leaving is bound to come before too long
And there ain't no way of me knowing how tomorrow's gonna be
So I just dance the shores of Jordan till the angels carry me

And I travelled to a prison, I saw my share of shattered dreams
Were the tables slightly tilted? I could be bound, they could be free
But I believe no tear goes wasted and so I fell there on my knees
Vowed I'd dance the shores of Jordan till the angels carried me

I'm gonna let my feet go dancing to my very favorite songs
'Cause I know my time for leaving is bound to come before too long
And there ain't no way of me knowing how tomorrow's gonna be
So I just dance the shores of Jordan till the angels carry me

And I saw a weary traveller heading down a dusty road
And I said, "Friend, please may I help you? It seems you haul a heavy load"
But he said, "Though my burden's heavy, in my heart I'm traveling light
So I can cross old river Jordan when I'm called to the other side"

I'm gonna let my feet go dancing to my very favorite songs
'Cause I know my time for leaving is bound to come before too long
And there ain't no way of me knowing how tomorrow's gonna be
So I just dance the shores of Jordan till the angels carry me

I just dance the shores of Jordan
Until the angels carry me
