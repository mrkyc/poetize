My father died a year ago today
The rooster started crowin' when they carried Dad away
There beside my mother, in the living room, I stood
With my brothers and my sisters knowing Dad was gone for good
Well, I stayed at home just long enough
To lay him in the ground and then I
Caught a plane to do a show up north in Detroit town
Because I'm older now and I've got no time to cry

I've got no time to look back, I've got no time to see
The pieces of my heart that have been ripped away from me
And if the feeling starts to comin', I've learned to stop 'em fast
Because I don't know if I let 'em go, they might not wanna pass
And there's just so many people trying to get me on the phone
And there's bills to pay and songs to play
And a house to make a home
I guess I'm older now and I've got no time to cry

I can still remember when I was a girl
But so many things have changed so much here in my world
I remember sittin' on the front yard when an ambulance went by
And just listening to those sirens, I would break down and cry
But now I'm walking and I'm talking
Doing just what I'm supposed to do
Working overtime to make sure that I don't come unglued
I guess I'm older now, I've got no time to cry
You might also like
I've got no time to look back, I've got no time to see
The pieces of my heart that have been ripped away from me
And if the feeling starts to comin', I've learned to stop 'em fast
Because I don't know if I let 'em go, they might not wanna pass
And there's just so many people trying to get me on the phone
And there's bills to pay and songs to play
And a house to make a home
I guess I'm older now and I've got no time to cry

I sit down on the sofa and I watch the evening news
There's a half-a-dozen tragedies from which to pick and choose
The baby that was missing was found in a ditch today
And there's bombs a-flying and people dying not so far away
And I'll take a beer from the refrigerator
And go sit out in the yard and with a cold one in my hand
I'm going to bite down and swallow hard
Because I'm older now, I've got no time to cry

I've got no time to look back, I've got no time to see
The pieces of my heart that have been ripped away from me
And if the feeling starts to comin', I've learned to stop 'em fast
Because I don't know if I let 'em go, they might not wanna pass
And there's just so many people trying to get me on the phone
And there's bills to pay and songs to play
And a house to make a home
I guess I'm older now, I've got no time to cry
I guess I'm older now
I just ain't got no time to cry
No time to cry
No time to cry
