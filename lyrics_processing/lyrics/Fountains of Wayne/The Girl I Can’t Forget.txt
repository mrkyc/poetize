And she took me out to an Irish bar
Where I drank some beer in a plastic cup
'Til I had some trouble standing up
And then she drove downtown to a strobe-lit space
Where all the guys wore chains and the thumping bass
Was so intense I could barely feel my face
Then I think I asked her back to my place
But that's all I recall
And when I woke up in the hall
I was alone and softly groaning
And I lost my keys, and I lost my phone
And I wondered what I did or said
That I might soon regret
It was the night I can't remember
With the girl I can't forget
Well, I was reeling, watching the ceiling spin
The next evening when my friends walked in
And when I asked them if they knew where I'd been
They didn't speak at first, they only grinned
You see, I'm not the type to get in fights
But that might not have been the case last night
Because they heard that I had a word or two
With the man who asked, "Is she with you?"

I guess that's not for me to say
Though it seems I may have slipped up
When I offered him some grooming tips
But at least that helps explain
The cuts and bruises on my head
From the night I can't remember
With the girl I can't forget
And it's all coming back now
Don't know how to react now
Guess I'll let it go
I'm not so sure I want to know
Well, I was back at work at 9:15
When a message popped up on my screen
It said, "Pick me up at 8:45
And we can give it one more try"
And now that I'm with her
The whole thing seems a bit absurd
Though she never fails to tell the tale
Of the time she had to post my bail
And for giving me a second chance
I'm forever in her debt
Since the night I can't remember
