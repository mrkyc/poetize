Both of them look quite a bit like Carl Reiner
One of them is smoking even though the sign says not to
The waitress says to stop, he says "Sorry, but I've got to"
They tell each other jokes that they both know that they both know
They talk about real estate, prostates, Costco
And when they finish up they leave a twenty on the table
The waitress picks it up with their half-eaten bagels
And when her shift is over she goes back to Mineola
Sits on the couch, opens up a diet cola and says
I'm so
I'm so sick of this place
I'm so ready for a change of pace
I'm just looking for a new routine
So she spins her globe
And the next thing you know
She's living in Liechtenstein
She doesn't speak German, only high school Spanish
But within a few weeks she discovers she can manage
But there's not much going on except for banking and skiing
So she breaks up with the man that she just started seeing
He drops her at the airport in a diesel Mercedes
Thinks to himself "I'm so feeble with the ladies and I
You might also likeI'm so
I'm so sick of this place
I'm so ready for a change of pace
I'm just looking for a new routine"
So he grabs his cap
Throws a dart at a map
And now he's living in Bowling Green
He talks his way into
A job at La Quinta
Falls for the manager
Who's moving back to Canada
She's tried Roanoke, Reykjavik, Rome
Says "You're really sweet but I just want to go home"
Two men sit in the corner of a diner
One of them says "I might take a trip to China
It's one of those things we should do before we're too old"
"Thanks but no thanks, bring me back an egg roll"
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
