I bought a car off a couple of ladies way upstate
Took off the Greenpeace sticker and the New Hampshire plates
My friends are saying that I may have made a mistake but I
I tell 'em to have a little faith, now, fellas, just you wait
Put in the new shocks and the anti-lock brakes
One-touch ignition for convenience's sake
And when I'm through it's gonna look and run better than new

So baby don't make a move
Because I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
You better make way 'cause I'm coming through
In my late '92 baby-blue Subaru

My cousin Kerry is taking a look at the transmission
Putting in the lime-green plasma-screen television
Seats feel like leather, you can't even tell that they're fake
And I only got a couple easy payments left to make
Just a little alcohol in the glove compartment minibar
Open up the moon-roof so we can sit back and watch the stars
Oh, yes, and the GPS so I always know where you are

So baby don't go too far
Because I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
You better make way 'cause I'm coming through
In my late '92 baby-blue Subaru

Pumping in oxygen from some Swiss mountain
Alarm system so confusing you can't even get in
This thing is a beast, value will only increase
In negotiating terms like peace in the Middle East
There's only three of it's kind, they're never easy to find
Got people waiting in line to pay me double for mine
So baby just let me know
Are you ready to go?
C'mon, sugar, let's roll

You know I'm coming for you
That's what I'm gonna do
You better make way 'cause I'm coming through
In my late '92 baby-blue Subaru

You know I'm coming for you
Babe, y'know it's true
You better make way 'cause I'm coming through
