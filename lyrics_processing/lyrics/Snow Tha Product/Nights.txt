Right here face to face in your sheets
We're tucked underneath all these city street lights
Where everything starts with your kiss
Didn't I do it all for the nights like this
So I...

What's a little liquor to a cold heart?
What's a little pill but a little number feeling now
It can never end if it don't start
You can never do it all, if you are never willing uh
Hold up I think my phone vibratin'
Slow up I think the whole world hatin'
Came up and now the whole view changin'
I've been up on game, I've just been waiting
What's a little change to a pocket full?
What's a little party when the work already done
You got that drink up in your system and it's audible
Words are getting slurred and now your vision kinda trippin'
If it's vibes you want then it's vibes you get
What you want, baby I'll do that
Glad you chose to be my new friend
What you tryna be and what's next?

I can tell that you wanna come with me, what's poppin' then?
Don't gotta tell me 'bout your past, tell me 'bout your future
Got me feelin' sleepy, I've been fuckin' with them two cups

You falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
