I be like, '"Ayy dios"
I been woke even wit' my eyes closed
Diles que sin quieren mas
Mira que esto va pa largo
Tiren barrio, ride slow
Live fast, better get that cash flow
Anybody wanna stand in my way, I got people yellin', "Whoop that ass, Snow"
Snow Tha Product got fed up with the shit
Life already hard enough as it is
I dont need these muthafuckas shadin' me or talkin' shit about where the fuck I am
I been out here gettin' cash on my own
Travel the country, headlinin' my shows
I ain't askin' anybody for favors
You muthafuckers wanna hate on Ms. Snow
Man, tell me 'bout it, I know how you feel about me
Lyrically, I can threaten anybody's fuckin' career, how you feel about it?
Since we're being honest, I can give it all up
Have a couple babies; when they learn to talk, then they will spit some bars
And I can guarantee you that it's fire somewhere in they first verse, they will say, "You garbage"
I'ma muthafuckin' problem for real
Money talks, I'm talkin' a mill'
Mac is out, don't gotta conceal
Mac is out, don't gotta conceal
Top five? I'm top two
Talkin', spittin' bars and that grind too
Y'all child's play like Caillou
And by the way, that was a haiku
Look, god damn it
Atlantic better get it together before Strange hit 'em wit' the Tec
Slept on so long, got a kink in my neck
I been thinkin' it's best we relinquish the debt
Got it all in cash or I can write a check
Or y'all could buy me lunch or y'all can gimme a desk
And let me write for rappers, y'all do get press
I feel like Piper Chapman how much time is left 'cause god damn (God damn)
I'm just kidding, ladies, you know I love you
