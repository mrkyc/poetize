Uh, yeah
I got that dough girl cash flavor
Don't play and yet my cold gold fronts taste like lemonade
You better pay up, pay up, pay up, I'm on my way
I'm going way up, way up, way up and I'ma stay
I swerve that rocky road and I hit the gas and I switch lanes while I'm dippin'
Life is sweet like that cup of lean and that candy paint that been drippin'
I'm going way up, way up, way up, I'm on my way
I got my cake up, cake up, cake up, I'm doing great

I'm not as sweet as I might seem
Honey, I'm a cold bitch, cold bitch
So don't fuck with me (Mwah)
Don't think that you can walk all over me
Honey, I'm a cold bitch, cold bitch
Touch me, I scream

Uh, yeah
I won't apologize, I want that bank, bank, bank, bank
I need the dollar sign, I need that change, change, change, change
I need that paper, I want that money in my safe
I need the taste of the bread and I'ma want my cake
And it's all smiley faces and cotton candy long as you stay in your lane
Don't come around if you talking 'bout the wrong thing then stand in my way
You better pay up, I'm out here serving flavors all day
Like Master P, I got ice cream, I got way, way, way

Honey, I'm a cold bitch, cold bitch
So don't fuck with me (Mwah)
Don't think that you can walk all over me
Honey, I'm a cold bitch, cold bitch
Touch me, I scream

Considering I'm physically tiny, I see where you might
Start thinking that I wouldn't reply accordingly if I'm tried
I'm not your average, I'm not a pacifist
I can elaborate if you would like
Basically I could flip it, if you don't have it and you can't keep up then um, you should be nice

La la la la la la la
Yeah, sweet as pie if you don't get in my way
I'm singing la la la la la la la
Yeah, candy stars until you get in my way
I'm not as sweet as I might seem
Honey, I'm a cold bitch, cold bitch
