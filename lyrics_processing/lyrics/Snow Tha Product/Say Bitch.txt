Alright
A-What?
Yo, a girls first instinct be like to talk shit instead of like
What if I just think you're cute?
A-Alright
Pum-Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

Say bitch
Say, say, say, say bitch
I am what you get between a Texas and a Bay bitch
Wait, bitch
Now I'm in L.A., bitch
Catch me out in traffic, I be ridin' in the latest
Made it
Not the fuckin' stereotype, used to fuckin' carry a knife
Hit a lick like every night
Now I'm livin' paradise, gambled like a pair of dice
Bet it all and won it all, my bank accounts is hella right
Left all the negativity behind
Every city I would grind, push the product, push the line
Flip the whop and flip the price
Push the weight like exercise
I was really doing it
Movin' and gettin' my weight up, now it's time
I'ma get that payback since like way back
All of y'all owe me mine, I'ma have to state tax
Yes bitch, say that
Talk ya shit, they mad
Little Mamacita ridin' clean as what? Ajax
Hate that, hate this
Half of y'all hate your life
Hatin' on the 'Gram is easy, I would hate a hater's life
Look bitch, I don't even know what the fuck made you mad
But runnin' your mouth is easy
Use that energy to chase a bag
(Look bitch, I don't even know what the fuck made you mad

I been gettin' money, now they hatin' on a Mexican
It's best you get to know me, I'm Miss Snowy from the West
And it's been my pleasure to get vetted in this getting precedence
Invested and diversified, imagine my appall
When a bitch that wanna try me can't even buy shit at the mall
When I'm the type to help a bitch, and I ain't competing with you broads
And I be complementing hoes, and you bitches be acting hard
I'm tellin' my girl you cute, you thinkin' I'm tryna fight
You doggin' me, actin' rude
Talk shit like am I alright?
Now I'm like, "Bitch is you stupid?"
Man got all up in ya mind
You thinkin' that every bitch that you see compete over guys
Not only am I the type to gas all you bitches up
I know what you goin' through, you competing over a bum
And fighting hoes for a crumb, that got yo ass lookin' dumb
He drivin' your car all month, and he askin' you for some funds
The type to make local strippers do too much for crumpled ones
You out here workin' your ass off for a bad boy you fuckin' love
You leavin' a good guy to go chasin' after a thug
Not knowing his ass ain't even a G, he a fuckin' dub
Not even a dub like W, definitely an L
And so by association, that's makin' you one as well
I don't gotta hate on you, you hate yourself I can tell
I'll never hate on you baby, you're doing that by yourself
Say bitch (You hatin' on me, but contemplating, girl, you should come fuck with me)
Say bitch (You hatin' on me, but contemplating, girl you should come fuck with me)

Say bitch
Yo, imagine what would happen if y'all stopped being intimidated by each other and just started supporting each other
Quit being a dumb bitch
Love each other ladies
