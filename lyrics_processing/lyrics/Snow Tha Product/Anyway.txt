Everybody in my life lackin'
While I been all in
I've been here back and forth in traffic boy I be mobbin'
I've been tryin' to get the bag
I've been all in this job (and)
Bitch if you knew I work this hard then why all the talkin'
I've been chasing all this
Cashing these deposits
Trying to make an option
For me and my partners
So when I look back and I hear bitches with the talking
Why the fuck wouldn't I approach you haters with some caution
I got so much drama can't explain right now
But you wouldn't know it I've been on my wave right now, ayo
