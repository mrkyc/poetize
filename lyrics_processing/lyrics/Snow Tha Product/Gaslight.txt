Look
Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?
Mmm

Oh you a big money spendin'
Man who gets the women
Big bill droppin'
Want it, then you got it
Rollie face wearin'
If she lookin', then she starin'
If she starin', then she carin'
But can't put a finger on it
You a big game talker, every ex's your stalker
You ain't ready for no relationship, but can talk to her
You just want some company
Every bitch you fuck with either crazy or amazing
Then you shady as can fuckin' be
You can't commit and that's your greatest talent
Claim you're breaking hearts like back to back
Deep inside there's somethin' less than average
'Bout the bitches that you claim to bag
Somethin' 'bout the bracket that you at
Maybe all the practice that you have
Wouldn't do you any good where I'm at
Class ain't somethin' you can pay to have

And you could tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies
Tell me I'm trippin'
Tell me why, tell me I'm the one
Then rewind to a gaslight pro (pro)

Oh you a fuckin' Prince Charming out in public
I'm like "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Lead me on, then they leave
Then it's back to never there
Throw the blame out everywhere
"No one can compare" yeah, yeah
You just never wrong, but here's your problem
Now, I don't care
You playin' with my mind, somehow everytime
Pretty lies come right out your mouth, and that ain't right
Gotta fuckin' draw the line
I've been just your type
Prey on any insecurity you fucking find
Got me questionin' my memory
Your narcissist attempts at e-ither startin' off the problems, causin' drama
Then you got me second guessin' me
And I don't give a fuck which house your Moon is
What sign you are or how you grew up
You're a fuckin' adult and you got to get it together
You're a dick and you're manipulative as fuck, ugh
