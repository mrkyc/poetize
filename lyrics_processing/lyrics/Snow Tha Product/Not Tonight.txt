Turn up the bass

Babe, show me what you like
Ay, I put money I can match it for ya
I'm in this bitch and I don't wife it
Looking like a brick and all them zippers on the jacket on ya
He got a thang for a latin chick
He wanna hear a little Spanish
I told him it ain't shit to practice it
I'm 'bout to turn it into a Spanish wedding
Walk up with the clique
And I ain't lookin' like the side in this
I'm the opposite 'cause I'm the main event and
Bossin' in it
As the time been tickin'
I been outchea playin' my position
Now I'm 'bout to get it our way
Now I'm 'bout to block the hate

Some days, some days
Sometimes I find someone, someone
To tell me I'm somewhat, somewhat
Doing alright, doing alright
Somewhere, somewhere
I'ma find me that someone, someone
That somebody that one day, one day
Will be the love of my life, love of my life
But not tonight though

Hey, I'm only here for a minute
Bet you want a girl that keep it hella independent and I
Know you gotta like a girl that's this appealing
Get you caught up in the moment
Then I'll get you in your feelings
Tell your boys that you gon' meet 'em later on
Both of us are drunk, so taxi leave the meter on
First time you're out in Cali
Never tried no weed this strong
So you gon' have some stories to tell
When you take your ass back home
One time, one time
Snowy-owie showed you what it's like
Leave you sleepy like the codeine
Call the umpire
Get you out & get you rollin'
Get your shit, you gotta go
I got a flight up in the mornin'

Some days, some days
Sometimes I find someone, someone
To tell me I'm somewhat, somewhat
Doing alright, doing alright
Somewhere, somewhere
I'ma find me that someone, someone
That somebody that one day, one day
Will be the love of my life, love of my life

He trying to catch me in my feelings
But he don't know that I'm the plug though
Shout out to my bitches
That can get it independent
And ain't lookin' for no love though
He trying to catch me in my feelings
But he don't know that I'm the plug though
He trying to stunt & get me drinks
I got the bottles and the section
And I burn this fuckin' club up
