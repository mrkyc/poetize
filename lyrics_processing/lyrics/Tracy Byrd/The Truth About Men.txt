We don't like to go out shopping
We don't care what's on sale
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
Watchin' the NFL
When you come over at half time
And say, "Does this dress fit too tight?"
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say, "Uh-uh, it looks just right"

Well, thats the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss
And no matter what line we hand you
When we come dragging in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We hate watchin Steel Magnolias
We like Rambo and Die Hard 4
Jump up and down like fools
When we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store
We don't really wanna take you to dinner
At some fancy restaurant
The only reason we do is 'cause
We know it leads too the one thing
That we all want
You might also like
Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Then work on the problems in our lives
And though we might say it to you
Every now and then
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinking
It's nothing to complex
It's just something cold for drinking
And a whole lot of S.E.-yes

That's the truth about men
Yeah, that's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit and a whole lot of other disgusting stuff
And no matter what line we give you
When we come crawling in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen, sure it's gonna happen
You know it's gonna happen again
And that's the truth about men
Yeah, aw-yeah
You know it son
