Isn't she a pretty thing?
I'm the one that put that ring on her left hand
Another fellow can tip his hat
And I'm as gentle as a pussycat
But let it go much further than that and he's a dead man
Cause that's a good way
That's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
The politician on my t.v.,
Says he's only lookin' out for me
He says he knows what the poor man needs in the long run
But every year he gives himself a raise
With a chunk of every buck I make
Now he's talkin like he wants to take my shotgun
That's a good way
That's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
Ain't lookin for no trouble
Don't wanna start no fight
Don't want more than I got commin'
I only wanna do what's right
Just treat me like I treat you
And we'll get along just fine
But mister take one step across that line
You might also likeAnd that's a good way
That's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
I like Van Halen and I like George Jones
Charlie Daniels and the Rolling Stones
Bocephus when he rocks-n-rolls still kills me
There oughta be a law against cowboy rap
And all that boy band crap
A little sissy in a cowboy hat ain't country
No..but that's a good way
That's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
Yea that's a real good way to get on my bad side
That's a good way
That's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
That's a good way
That's a real good way
