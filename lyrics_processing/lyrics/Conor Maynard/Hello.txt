Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm just at a house dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oh, what would you do if you was me I was you
Would you move on go and find someone new
I know it hurts, believe that I'm hurting too
I guess I can't hide it as well as you
Well look, I woke up next to the baddest bitch I've ever seen
But even then all I could think of was you and me
My friends tell me "Anth, homie, just let it be"
Unless they been through it they don't know what the fuck I mean
So please girl tell me what do I do
'Cause I know that nobody's perfect but I'm perfect for you
And girl you're perfect for me, that's something you couldn't see
I tried to show you but what was the point if you won't believe
Now tell me why did you leave? Did you not love me no more?
See I can hide all the pain but what remains is the scars
I was the best I could be, I know that I had my flaws but I gave all that I had
Spent more than I could afford
I spent 5 thousand dollars on a ring to call you my mrs
And you still had the nerve to say I gave no commitment
There was no way that I could save ya three years is what I gave ya
And then you leave me and gon' find a new man three weeks later
My sister thinks you cheated and honestly I don't blame her
'Cause moving on that quick is way too strange of a behaviour
And I bet that he's happy 'cause he sees you posting pictures
But dog I bet my life she thinks about me when your with her
He don't want you like I want you
He don't need you like I need you
He don't see you how I see you
He don't breathe you how I breathe you
When you know it tell me what the fuck you see in him
We both know that you still love me so you shouldn't be with him
You should be with me, right here in my home, right here all alone making love until the morn' You love how I turn you on
And one thing that I love and hate the most is people always change but the memories don't and lately I can't even eat
Lately I been feeling ill when you cannot sleep at night that's when you know shit is real
You don't even need a gun you don't even need a pill
If you ever wanna die fall in love and you'll get killed
