No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a girl that can't get no love from me
Sitting in the passenger side
Of her best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

Baby girl, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasy
Tell me how you feel
I think about you all the time
I see it in my dreams

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)

So rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
No

Well woman the way the time cold
I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature to shelter you from the storm

So please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart

Like controlla, controlla

'Cause all we need is somebody to lean on

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel

She caught me on the counter (it wasn't me!)
Saw me banging on the sofa

'Cause I've been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Who do you love?
And are you sure?

'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

So wake me up, before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I'm in love with the Go-Go

I'm in love with the Go-Go
