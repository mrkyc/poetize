I wish I never took the time to learn the details
What I should pick up for you when you didn't feel well
Like how you'd call when you were driving on your own
Wanted to hear me so you didn't feel alone
Still have the messages from the first day that we talked
I swear that pink-hearted emoji was your trademark
Still have the photos from the first day that we met
You know the ones that I would show to all my friends

But now it feels like all you left
Was useless information in my head
I can't believe the way it went

I'm lying all alone, I can't seem to fall asleep inside my home
'Cause all I see is you and me
Wish I could ignore it, the memories and forfeit
The pain this is causing me now
I try to say I'm fine but there's no room for nothing else inside my mind
I can't forget the way I felt
Wish I could ignore it 'cause it's not important
Please rid me of all of it now 'cause I'm out of storage

Do you still have the note I left inside your suitcase?
Have you forgotten all the stupid little nicknames
The way you'd make me watch you try on your new clothes
I still remember what I'm saved as in your phone
You might also like
So now it feels like all you left
Was useless information in my head
I can't believe the way it went

I'm lying all alone, I can't seem to fall asleep inside my home
'Cause all I see is you and me

I can't forget the way I felt
Wish I could ignore it 'cause it's not important

Yeah, I'm out of storage
I'm out of storage
