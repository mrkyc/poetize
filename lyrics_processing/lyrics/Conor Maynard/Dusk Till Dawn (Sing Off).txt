Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
 (Khalid - Location)
Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
 (Alan Walker - Faded)
You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another start, you fade away
 (French Montana - Unforgettable)
'Cause you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Oeh)
 (Eminem - Love The Way You Lie)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
 (B.o.B - Airplanes)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do

 (Shontelle - Impossible)
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
 (Wiz Khalifa - See You Again)
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
 (Rihanna - Diamonds)
So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
 (Michael Jackson - Human Nature)
Why, why
I tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do that way
 (Sam Smith - Stay With Me)
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
 (Fall Out Boy - Sugar, We're Goin Down)
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it, Yeah
 (Justin Bieber - Sorry)
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm
 (Justin Bieber - Sorry)
Missing more than just your body
 (Coldplay - Magic)
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
No I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you
 (Madison Beer - Dead)
You say you can't live without me
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing?
And you say you can't live without me
 (Cash Cash - All My Love)
How can I sleep when you're out there
With all my love?
 (Linkin Park - Numb)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 (Linkin Park - Numb)
Become so tired, so much more aware
 (ZAYN - Dusk Till Dawn)
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
