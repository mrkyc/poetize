I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Yeah, and nothing stays the same
If you're ready for love be ready for all the pain
Got a taste of fame and look at who I became
A grown-ass man playing immature games
I feel stupid, how the hell could I do this?
I knew that you were clueless and all I did was abuse it
I know that it was foolish, I know that it was ruthless
But if I really knew it, why the hell did I go through it?
I remember when you called I told you that I was sleeping
But other girls I was meeting, I was too busy cheating
And it just kept repeating and repeating like every single evening
To the point I didn't even give a damn if you were leaving
But I do now, and now I know
You din't realize what you have, 'til the day you see it go
And maybe we'll try again, forget what I did before
Forgive me for my mistakes, I guess that we'll never know
It's a story untold

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

And the story goes on, it's the same old song
Flashback to Kat when I was staying at her home
I used to sleep at hers 'cause she'd hate sleeping alone
I go and grab the cover then a text comes through her phone
And it was from a guy who was older than me
He said "Call me when you get this and I'll come when he leaves."
And I just couldn't believe that she was cheating on me
And still had the fucking nerve that she could blame it on me
Like "Anth what did you expect? You ain't never around
It was my birthday last week, you weren't even in town
And yeah, you bought me a gift but baby that wasn't shit
I don't care about the money that you spend on my wrist
I cried so many tears because you never were here
And we talked, and we fought, but you just never appeared
I told you so many times it must have went through your ears
'Cause you don't care about us babe, only your career."
And that's real
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
