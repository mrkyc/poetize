I heard you're sleepin' with somebody new
I hope he leaves you, hope he cheats on you
'Cause I'll be right there to hold you when you cry
I hope you lose your job and every cent
So you ain't got enough to pay your rent
But if you need to, you can stay at mine

'Cause even though you left me broke
Yeah, I still think you're beautiful
And I just keep on runnin' back to you, oh-oh
I hate you more than you could know
But I can't seem to let you go
I still love you no matter what you do, eh

You're the beat in my chest turned to cardiac arrest
I know I'm better off without you, oh
You're the key to my heart and you tore that shit apart
I know I should go find someone new
But I'm not over you

I blocked your number, yeah, I blocked your calls
And all your stupid friends, I blocked them all
But I made a fake page just to follow you (Oh my God, you creep)
And I've been goin' to the bar you like
I meet a different girl like every night
But all we ever talk about is you
You might also like
'Cause even though you left me broke
Yeah, I still think you're beautiful
And I just keep on runnin' back to you, oh-oh
I hate you more than you could know
But I can't seem to let you go
I still love you no matter what you do, eh

You're the beat in my chest turned to cardiac arrest
I know I'm better off without you, oh
You're the key to my heart and you tore that shit apart
I know I should go find someone new

No matter what I do or where I go I can't let you go
I hate the fact you know you're irreplaceable
And all I ever hear about is you replacin' me, oh
No matter what I do or where I go I can't let you go
I swear to god, your love is inescapable
And all I ever hear about is how you're over me, eh

You're the beat in my chest (My chest)
Turned to cardiac arrest (Cardiac arrest)
I know I'm better off without you (I'm better off without you, girl)
You're the key to my heart (My heart)
And you tore that shit apart (You tore that shit apart)
I know I should go find someone new (Someone new)
But I'm not over you (But I'm not over you)
No, I'm not over you
