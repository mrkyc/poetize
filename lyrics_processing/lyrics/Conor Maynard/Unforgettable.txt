It's not good enough for me
Not being here with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for me
Nobody can equal you, I know

I'm gonna sip on this drink till I'm fucked up
Though I know that won't help me
I'm tryin' to think about
If you were here with me what would you tell me?
And even though I know you're gone
I'm not alone
Last night I saw you in my dreams
And every single night can't wait to fall asleep, eyy

'Cause you are unforgettable
Why did you have to go?
You never did wrong, never hurt nobody
Could be why God took you in a hurry
But can we just talk 'cause I need somebody?
Where are you now? I'd tell nobody
No, no, I would tell nobody
No, you can't buy time with money
But I wouldn't care how much I'd lose
Just for one more day with you

You, you; 6:42
Why the hell my sister calling me at 6:42?
She barely calls, maybe she just got me confused
But something told me I should pick it up to see if she's cool
"Hello?
What's wrong what happened?
Stop crying what you saying I can't understand it?"
So much pain in her voice I started to panic
What the hell is going on i can only imagine
You said:
You were dropping off the kids in your car
Only a couple blocks away it wasn't even that far
But then a truck came out of nowhere driving right through the stop
I didn't need to hear the rest just need to know where you are
You said that you and all the kids were doing fine
Couple cuts and bruises you and the kids'll be alright
But our sister Fresia needs you there right by her side
They flew her to the hospital they didn't tell me why
So I picked up my father I'm doing 90 on a 50
When a cop pulled me over but chose to put away the ticket
When I told him what happened and said I gotta get there quickly
Then he followed us there when he didn't have to but he did it
And I can't even lie, I can't even lie
Haven't even got inside when I start to cry
Walk up to the front desk, ask if you're alright
I can tell that something's wrong, see it in her eyes
My dad beside me and she took us down the hall
I can't wait to see you and to tell you 'bout it all
You'll probably think I'm stupid ask me what I'm crying for
Felt like it was hours before we finally reached the door
The room that we were led inside, you weren't even there
Just an empty room filled with a couple of chairs
My heart is fuckin beating all this pain in the air
And my stomach fucking turning all I'm feeling is fear
The doctor walked in, right behind were three nurses
Said they did all that they could but nothing that they did was working
And I hate to have to tell you and I know you don't deserve it
But your sister didn't make it and my heart just hit the surface like
I turn round to my father try to break him the news
But I ain't even have to 'cause he already knew
He don't really speak much English but what's that gotta do
When he was seeing, feeling every broken heart in the room
Shit, how the fuck am I gon' tell my brother
Fuck that, how the fuck am I gon' tell my mother
How the fuck my nephew gon' grow up without a mother
He's only 2 with a father who wish he wore a rubber
It's crazy how you never know, crazy how it go
Why the ones you love the most are the first to go
You were always taking care of me when I was broke
So I just want you to know
I look at Jeremiah and I see you every time
And I know he ain't my son but I'll treat him like he's mine
You ain't ever gotta worry Fresh I swear that he'll be fine
Give him everything I have every dollar every dime
'Til you lose somebody you won't know how it feels
But I pray you never do because I swear that it kills
Death leaves a pain that nobody can heal
But the love leaves a memory nobody can steal
'Cause you are unforgettable
Why did you have to go?
You never did wrong, never hurt nobody
Could be why God took you in a hurry
But can we just talk 'cause I need somebody?
Where are you now? I'd tell nobody
No, no, I would tell nobody
No, you can't buy time with money
But I wouldn't care how much I'd lose
