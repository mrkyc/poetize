Turn around, open your eyes
Look at me now
Turn around, girl, I've got you
We won't fall down, yeah
We can see, forever from up here, here
So long as we're together
Have no fear, no fear

So turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Listen, baby, turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around

Ooh, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah
Turn around
Ooh, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah

Music up, I wanna feel it all, yeah
And baby, we'll stay up
'Cause there's no way for us to fall, to fall, oh

So turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Listen, baby, turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around

Ooh, baby, we're so high now, oh
Tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Oh-oh, ay, ay
Our home is the sky now
Oh, yeah, say that we're never coming down, down, down
Oh woah
