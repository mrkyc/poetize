Looking for a girl that was here but now she's gone
Felt so good even though she did me wrong
She knows what I want but she's bad for me
She gets what she wants when she's touching me
I should've known better but she took my self-control

You can take my heart like a criminal
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal

I know I'm getting close from the trail of broken hearts
Hope she's coming back to finish what she started
I never see the claws until she's touching me
She's holding me so tight it's getting hard to breathe
I'll never win the game but it feels too good to care, oh

You can take my heart like a criminal
(Like a criminal, like a criminal)
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
(I'm the only one, I'm the only one)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal
You might also like
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go
I like it when you treat me like an animal
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go
(Don't you ever let go)
I like it when you treat me like an animal
(Don't you ever let go, oh)
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go
I like it when you treat me like an animal
(Treat me like an animal)
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go
I like it when you treat me like an animal

(You can take my heart like a criminal)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
