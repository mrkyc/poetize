Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweater
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Missed around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
I'm always tired but never of you
If I treated you lucky, you wouldn't like that
Held up my hand for you, you didn't touch that
I wrote a text, but then I deleted that
I got these feelings, but you didn't realise that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you just say so
If I were you, I would never let me go
You might also like
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

So forget that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say forget that new girl that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
And I'm just sayin' you could do better
