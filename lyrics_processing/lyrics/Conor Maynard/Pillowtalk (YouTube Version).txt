Climb on board
We'll go slow in high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and so raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking in, fighting on
It's a paradise and it's a war zone
It's a paradise
You might also like
The bed's a funny place, you know
You could be lying right next to someone
And either feel like it's the closest you ever been to a person
Or they could feel a million miles away
As we lay wide awake
Different day, same mistakes
Full of thoughts, full of words
That we ain't brave enough to just say
Tell me why the ones you fill with your love
Are the same ones that fill you with hate
Why is it the easiest things you can feel
Seem to be the hardest things you can say
It started with a "You could stay around if you want to
Or I can call a cab if that ain't cool"
See I got no plans, well I do
But the plans ain't plans if I'm doin' them without you
She said she wanna stay over
Before I knew it we were kissing all over
Scratching on my neck on my back on my shoulder
Took it to the bed now you know it's game over
But there's always the other side
Makeup on the pillow when I made you cry
Broken glass on the side from the other fight
Sleepin' back to back every other night
I should probably wake you
And take back what I said 'cause it ain't true
But instead we just fall asleep
And dream about a love that never came true
We'll piss off the neighbors, baby
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and so raw
In the bed all day, bed all day
Fucking in, fighting on
It's a paradise and it's a war zone
It's a paradise and it's a war zone

Half the time we know we're fuckin'
I don't ask her for nothing
She leaves me in the morning
I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone
I hate sleeping alone
