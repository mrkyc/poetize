I crashed my car the other day
Too busy thinking 'bout your face
Even though I just saw you yesterday
Yeah, it's a hazard to my health
I don't do nothing for myself
You made me turn up late for work again

Ooh, yeah
I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout, talking 'bout, talking 'bout you, yeah
To all of my, all of my, all of my friends at the room, yeah
They won't go back

Oh, I hate how much I love you
And I hate how much I care
I spend all of my money and all my time
'Cause I hate our love, I do
I hate how much I love you
Yeah, I hate how much I love you
I hate how much I love you

I emptied out my bank account
Just so that I could take you out
To somewhere that you've never been before
And I told my friends a thousand lies
So I could be with you tonight
They don't believe a word I say no more
You might also like
Ooh, yeah
I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout, talking 'bout, talking 'bout you, yeah
I told myself I wouldn't fall but I broke my own rule, yeah
I can't come back

Oh, I hate how much I love you
And I hate how much I care
I spend all of my money and all my time
'Cause I hate our love, I do
I hate how much I love you
Yeah, I hate how much I love you
I hate how much I love you, yeah

When you're not around me, I swear, I got nothing to do, yeah
It's making me wonder what I did before I had you, yeah
I can't go back

Oh, I hate how much I love you
And I hate how much I care
I spend all of my money and all my time
'Cause I hate our love, I do
I hate how much I love you
Yeah, I hate how much I love you
I hate how much I love you
I hate how much I love you
