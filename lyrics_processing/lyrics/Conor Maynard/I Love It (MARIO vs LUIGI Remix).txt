It's-a me, Mario

You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (Oh, oh)
You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (Oh yeah)
Your boyfriend is a door, McLovin

You're such a fuckin' woo, Vamanos, ain't got all day
Check your playlist, I don't play games
Fuck a line, bitch, no I don't wait
Bank account say the boy doin' great
Don't know who I am, baby where the hell you been
If he call again, maybe you should let her in
He ain't got no money, I can get you anything
I'm a millionaire, baby, you can phone a friend

Don't even ask, bitch, you know my name
If money talks, I got lots to say
My foreign bitch wanna fornicate
Fuck a condom, check my pullout game
Got a woosah baby in my new Mercedes
Got some puta naked, yeah she drive me crazy

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding
So you never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
When it's five o'clock in the morning
And all my bitches are calling
And you're the one that I'm wanting
I'm wanting, I'm wanting, I'm wanting

Got DM's in my IG, ooh I think she like me
She wanna be wifey - no, yeah, all the clubs invite me
But I got a high fee, they cannot afford me - no
I'm in my zone, they hate it, text on my phone, my main chick
I should go home, I'm faded, I'm faded, I'm faded

Call me when you're alone
Let's see how loud you can moan
Bitch, I'm a boss, Al Capone
So make yourself right at home
Up in my bed, in my bed
In my bed, in my bed

One, two, three, four
Too many bitches walk through my door
Too many bitches' clothes on my floor
Too many groupies fuck me on tour
Give me head like a concussion
I fuck her then fuck her cousin
She keep on calling me baby
I ain't your Benjamin Button
As soon as we finish fuckin'
The Uber's already coming
Like a, *gasp*
You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (oh, oh)
You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fucking hoe, I love it (oh yeah)
