I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
Oh, I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own, ooh
You might also like
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches, oh no

From a look to a touch
From a touch to a crush
From a crush into lust
Lust into love then love into us
Yeah that's real shit
But love is a gun you can kill with
Her time is the best way to deal with
Had time to me why do I still feel shit
But that's life when you're really in love
So I guess that I'm really in love
Hit the club when I'm livin' it up
But one night stands just isn't enough
And I gave my time, and I gave my trust
And I gave my heart, and I gave my love
And I gave my years, and I gave my months
I guess all I gave just was not enough
Now Anth just calm down, Anth just breath
Take a break and get some sleep
But tell me how can I sleep when you're the woman of my dreams
And even though we do not speak
And even though we fell apart
You may not be in my life but you'll always be in my heart
'Cause it's too late now to say sorry, baby
Thought I'm missing more than just your body, woah
But it's too late now to say sorry, baby
