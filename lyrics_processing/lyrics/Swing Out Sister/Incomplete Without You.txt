But words got in the way
Can't express what I had to say
Tried to find you
To make you realize
But explanations won't change your mind
How can the moments pass
How can a day seem not forever
How can a lifetime last so long?
Suddenly you're all alone
Wondering where all the years have gone
It's been so long, so long, so long
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
Some remember
Some live to forget
I can't erase what I don't regret
Time goes by
My heart won't let me hide
Thoughts I've tried so hard to disguise

Happen a day seem like forever
How can a lifetime last so long?
Suddenly you're all alone
Wondering where all the years have gone
It's been so long, so long, so long
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
Can't stop thinkin' about you baby
It's been so long
Can't go livin' without you baby
Since you've been gone
Can't stop thinkin' about you baby
It's been so long
Can't go livin' without you baby
Since you've been gone
How can the moments
Happen a day seem like forever
How can a lifetime last so long?
Suddenly you're all alone
Wondering where all the years have gone
It's been so long, so long, so long
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
A sun without a sky
Hello without goodbye
A night without a day
Now there's nothing left to say
A sun without a sky
Hello without goodbye
A dog without a bone
A house with someone home
