Before the chance was asked to take
We had to hide behind the vows we couldn't break
More than just friends
But to others we were innocent
We pretend we didn't stop what had to end
Could have been you
But you came around to late
Could have been some good times
We couldn't change the course of fate
Got no remedy
Got no cure
Stop these memories
Cause I can't take no more
We realized too late
That's the way it goes
A love that couldn't wait
That's the way it goes
My loss and your mistake
That's the way it goes
This final twist of fate
That's the way it goes
Missin' you more than ever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Memories last forever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
You might also likeDoubts through my mind
Question everything I do
Not satisfied 'til all I think about is you
Though strapped in tight
But would give solely to me
Not mine until you're here to set them free
Could have been you
But you came around to late
Could have been some good times
We couldn't change the course of fate
Got no remedy
Got no cure
Stop these memories
Cause I can't take no more
I realized too late
That's the way it goes
A love that couldn't wait
That's the way it goes
My loss and your mistake
That's the way it goes
This final twist of fate
That's the way it goes
Missin' you more than ever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Memories last forever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
We realized too late
That's the way it goes
A love that couldn't wait
That's the way it goes
My loss and your mistake
That's the way it goes
This final twist of fate
That's the way it goes
Missin' you more than ever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Memories last forever
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
