And look me over (look me over)
Am I the same girl you used to know?
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over (think it over)
Am I the same girl who knew her soul?
I'm the one you want (the one you want)
And I'm the one you need (the one you need)
I'm the one you love (the one you love)
I'm the one you used to meet
Around the corner, everyday
We would meet, and slip away
But we were much too young (too young) to
Love each other this way
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over (look me over)
Am I the same girl you used to know?
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over (think it over)
Am I the same girl who knew her soul?
You might also likeI'm the one you hurt (the one you hurt)
And I'm the one you need (the one you need)
I'm the one who cried (the one who cried)
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending you don't care
But the fire is still there
Now we are no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
Am I the same girl?
Yes I am, yes I am
You ever feel the need for something more
With every week comes scratching at your door
You ever stopped and wonder what it is you're searching for
Push your luck too far with me
But if you push it any further
You won't have any, yeah
Am I the same girl...
Am I the same girl...
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl..
