Girl we gotta jump it, rock the model, choose it
They be in the club looking for the love
Look what money does, hit you for the trust
I ain't tryna judge, I'm just tryna fuck
Yeah we got this shit going, aw man
I don't need the drama, I don't need the drama
All I'm thinking 'bout is fucking up some commas
You can keep your problems, you can keep your problems
I ain't nothing, nigga I ain't tryna solve 'em, no
Can't you see I got it going? (Can't you see I got it going?)
Aw man

On Sunday at my table, go back to back and turn up
Don't see who's gon' for mine
We throwing money, we don't know (we don't know 'bout it)
That don't mean shit, I need more
I need more, I need more, more
I need more of these bottles
I need more, I need more, more

Turn that ass around, money on the ground
How many bottles? I done lost the damn count
Probably drop the drop, 'bout to take shots
I will never stop, what a time to be alive
I'm turning up cause I see the haters around
I know they watching

I need more, I need more, more

I ain't playing around, she gon' take it down
How many models? I done lost the damn count
I will never stop until I hit the drop
They can't keep me up, not as long as I'm alive
I'd rather die before giving these haters my crown
I know they watching
