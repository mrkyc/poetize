Damn...all I could do, all I could say
Is that I'm sorry
Listen to me, I know I really messed up this time
Just hear me out

Ohhh, you should of shown me a little more love
(But still there ain't no reason)
For me to walk out on this thing called "us"
(But you keep giving me the feeling)
That I should throw the towel in
(Cause we can't keep each other no way)
Cussing me out in front of my friends not giving a damn on how I feel

I don't even want
(I don't want to be the guy that tricks around you)
And you don't even know
(How many times I asked your momma what I should do)
And it's my fault
(And it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through)
I got bad news that I gotta break to you
I know you gonna act a fool but I gotta let her know

I had a girlfriend pinned up (Aye)
In between that week we split up (She need to know)
It was looking so good I couldn't say no
(I think it's time you know)
Every time that I see you with her (Ooh)
I was thinking how I was picking them legs up (Leg up)
It's a shame when a man just can't say no
Ohh yeah

See what is done is done, and I realize now ain't no taking it back
I committed the worst crime I could ever do to my girl
Damn she ain't never gonna forgive me
Every time that you through a fit
My two-way she hits saying "im on the way"
Putting it down in out, up and down, anyway I'd say
But baby girl I really didn't wanna!

(I don't want to be the guy that tricks around you) woah oh
You don't even know, hey!
(How many times I asked your momma what I should do)
She didn't even know
(And it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through)
I got some real bad news to tell you
And I know you gon' act a fool
She really needs to know!

I had a girlfriend pinned up (Ooh yeah)
In between that week we split up
It was looking so good I couldn't say no
(It's gonna be bad but I gotta let her know)
Every time that I see you with her

It's a shame when a man just can't say no (When I couldn't say no, couldn't say no)
Yeah it's bad (I done messed up)
Gave up all I had with you
Just for a fast (Piece of pleasure)
That can never replace you
One more chance (He said never)
Girl you made mistakes too
Uh, baby, oh, girl!

It's a shame when a man just can't say no (It's a shame oh, it's a shame oh)
