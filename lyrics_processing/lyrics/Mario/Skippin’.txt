Right about now

As soon as you came in, I offered you a drink
Better yet there's a bar at my crib, shawty, what ya think?
You know I ain't a stranger, so girl, let me take ya
To places that you don't even know
Oh, I've wanted girls before, but never like this
And I know I can't have it all, but I'll settle for a kiss
I'm playing less ya let me, 'cause damn, ya so sexy
And if feels like I'm losing control

Now I'm not falling in love with you
But I think that you are hot, shawty
See all I wanna do is let you know

From the moment I saw you
I knew that you were all that I wanted in a woman
From your stop to your walk to your fragrance
Baby girl, you got my heart ski-ski-skippin'
Just like boom, boom
Ski-ski-skippin'
Ba-ba boom, ba-ba boom, ba-ba boom, boom
Ski-ski-skippin'
(Ski-ski-skippin')
Ba-ba boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Ski-ski-skippin'
Boom, boom
Baby girl, you got my heart ski-ski-skippin' just like
You might also like
You got me in amazement, and I can't believe
I've never seen nothing like you ever step on the scene
Maybe you're just born with it, maybe it's Maybelline
But there's no way for me to surely know
Ain't trying to be forward, girl, I wanna take you home
So from now moving forward, girl, you know what I want
I wanna get you in closer, I love to hear when you whisper
All the things that you wanna hear

Now I'm not falling in love with you
You see I think that you are bad, shawty
See all I wanna do is let you know

From the moment I saw you
I knew that you were all that I wanted in a woman
From your stop to your walk to your fragrance
Baby girl, you got my heart ski-ski-skippin'
(Just like boom, boom)
Damn, baby
(Just like boom, boom)
You don't know what you do to me
(Just like boom, boom)
I know it's kinda crazy, but
(Just like boom, boom)
Girl, you got my heart
(Ski-ski-skippin')
From the moment I saw you
I knew that you were all that I wanted in a woman
From your stop to your walk to your fragrance
Baby girl, you got my heart ski-ski-skippin'
From the moment I saw you
I knew that you were all that I wanted in a woman
From your stop to your walk to your fragrance
