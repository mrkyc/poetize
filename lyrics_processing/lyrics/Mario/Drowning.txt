I never thought I'd be in between her legs
While I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm in too deep to pull out now
She's suffering while I feel good

When I said we should stop
You didn't wanna save me
Now my feet can't touch the ground
I'm going down

The closer I get to you, baby
Your waters are rising
While her tears are falling
But I'm so close to you, baby
Either way I'm thinking
I'm sinking, I'm not swimming

In your waters I'm drowning, drowning, drowning
My head's underwater, her tears overflowing
Please stop me from drowning, drowning, drowning
Her tears won't stop falling, and your body keeps calling
I'll drown in it out for now
You might also like
Tell you the truth, I could get used to this
But I don't wanna suffocate you
'Cause even with two queens in my hands
If I'm playing games, I could still lose

When I said we should stop
You didn't wanna save me
Now my feet can't touch the ground
I'm going down

The closer I get to you, baby
Your waters are rising
While her tears are falling
But I'm so close to you, baby
Either way I'm thinking
I'm sinking, I'm not swimming

In your waters I'm drowning, drowning, drowning
My head's underwater, her tears overflowing
Please stop me from drowning, drowning, drowning
Her tears won't stop falling, and your body keeps calling
I'll drown it out for now
I'ma drown it out for now, oh
I'll drown it out for now, oh, woah (Drown)
The closer I get to you, baby
Your waters are rising
While her tears are falling
But I'm so close to you, baby
Either way I'm thinking
I'm sinking, I'm not swimming

In your waters I'm drowning, drowning, drowning (Yeah)
My head's underwater, her tears overflowing
Can't stop me from drowning, drowning, drowning (Oh, woah)
Her tears won't stop falling, and your body keeps calling
I'll drown it out for now

Drown, drown, drown (Oh, woah)
Drown, drown, drown
