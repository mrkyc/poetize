We've had such a great time in these past two months
I never laughed so much in my life
It's been all about us
Since that time we had that intimate talk
Suddenly, you're actin' strange, plus
Your conversation just up and changed
Is it because you're afraid that what you feelin' for me
Is the beginning of a new heartbreak?
Hear me when I say

You ain't gotta give me your love (oh, no)
You ain't gotta say I'm your one (you ain't gotta, no, no)
You ain't gotta tell me where you be (oh, no)
'Cause you ain't obligated to me
I'm not sayin' that you should just
Rush and give me your heart
I'm just askin' that you like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You know just like I know
We've been broken by love and we both need time to heal
That's why in this short amount of time
We've grown so close 'cause you relate to everything I feel
So let's not complicate things by
Placing titles on you and I
But what we can do before we make the next move
We gotta find the perfect reason why
So believe me when I say
You might also like
You ain't gotta give me your love (whoa, no, no, no, no)
You ain't gotta say I'm your one
You ain't gotta tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't obligated to me (whoa, oh, oh)
I'm not sayin' that you should just
Rush and give me your heart
I'm just askin' that you like me real hard (my baby, babe)
Just like me real hard (woo!)

You ain't ready to fall in love
And I ain't ready to care so much
We ain't ready for commitment right now
But together we can work something out
And we'll know when the time is right
Because we'll feel it in our hearts
It will be written in the stars
But for now, just like me real hard

You ain't gotta give me your love (baby, yeah)
You ain't gotta say I'm your one
You ain't gotta tell me where you be (oh, no)
'Cause you ain't obligated to me
I'm not sayin' that you should just
Rush and give me your heart
I'm just askin' that you like me real hard
Just like me real hard (Yeah! Would you do it, baby?)
You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say I'm your one (And I ain't gotta be the one)
You ain't gotta tell me where you be (Baby...)
'Cause you ain't obligated to me
I'm not sayin' that you should just
Rush and give me your heart
I'm just askin' that you like me real hard (Be a friend to me)
Just like me real hard (Baby, baby, baby, baby, please)
I just wanna be your baby
Just want you to be my friend, girl
Oh, yeah
I'm not sayin', sayin', oh, no, no, no
I'm just asking you that you like me real hard
