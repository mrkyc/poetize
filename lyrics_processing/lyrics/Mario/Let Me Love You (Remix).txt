(You should let me love you, let me love you, let me love you)
This is the remix!
(Baby you should let me love you)

Just relieve your stress (relax)
Chill your ring finger and freeze ya chest
Cop you the new Beemer, the beads is next
And even though it's a want I need the sex
I hope it's just insecurity
'Cause I know she feelin' me
Diggin' the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck, cause honey keep keepin' her guards up
So I'm just tryna even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her
When she know that I been on her
Since back in the days in Manhattan after the matinee
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her, I'ma grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Ooh, baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me

Baby, I just don't get it, do you enjoy bein' hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the makeup on his shirt
You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was your man, baby, you'd never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be comin' home, back to you, every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman who deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just wanna show you you are

Baby, you should let me love you, let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you

Don't you wanna cruise avenues in a ride with a pair of shoes?
Shinin' like a diamond sittin' high with raised latitude
Heh, listen, baby, I could change your attitude
You're chillin' with the king you ain't dealin' with them rapper dudes
Hey keep it real, kick it with me, is what you'd rather do
I was poppin' before you, gonna be the same after you
I ain't gon' chase you, I'd rather replace you
In case you wondered, I'm stuntin' and way major
If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex'll amaze you
Look you don't wanna past the chance (hey!)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of france
Don't be alarmed, I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you, I'm tryin' to rebirth you
I wanna love you, I ain't just have to nail you
You already know I can show you
Better than I can tell you
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby you should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you
You should let me love you, let me love you
Baby you should let me love you

Hey, Scott Storch you crazy for this one!
