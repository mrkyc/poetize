It's kinda crazy babe, how I remember things
Like where you came from and how you had nothin'
I went and made you fly, put extras on your ride
Didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine
You made it clear to me (You wasn't down for me)
Love made me blind, baby (But now I see)
You had things up your sleeve (Ho) don't even lie to me
I even heard it from your family

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

You must be out your mind, you got a lot of nerve
To think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard
I damn near carried you, I could've married you
Good thing I found out 'fore I bought that seven-karat for you
I know you're sick about (The way I found you out)
Go head and pack it out (I hope he's got room in his house)
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me, baby

Girl, I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it, and I ain't gon' trip
Girl, I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think, that another man's
Gonna get the one I made for me

(How could you, how could you give him everything?)
How could you girl? How could you?
(How could you, how could you call him names like that?) Ooh
