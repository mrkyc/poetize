Girl, you wanna know what's up
I can truly say that I love you
And we know that love is not puffed up
So there are some things in love that you'll never do

I would never jump off a building and survive
And if that building were burning up, I'll never
Leave you inside. I would probably never live to
See hundred years old. And no matters who's around
I'd never treat you cold

(I will never) lie to you, baby boo
(I will never) treat you untrue, no
(They say never) say what you wouldn't do
(I can say i'll never) I would never hurt you

So you wanna be made secure, never give
Your heart unless you were sure
Just wanna know where I'm at
Me leaving you girl, never that
I could never fight a hundred men and win
And I'll never know the beauty of a girl and a friend
They say never say what you wouldn't do
But they never been in love with a girl like you
You might also like
(I will never) lie to you, baby boo
(I will never) treat you untrue, no, no, no, no, no, no
(They say never) they say never
(I can say i'll never) You can trust me when I say I'll never, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Ohohohohoh, how would you know)
What you would and would not do
(Here is what i say) here is what I say
(Until my dying day)
(I will never) stop loving you, baby

(I will never) lie to you, baby boo
(I will never) treat you uncool, no, no
(They say never) they say never, I say never
(I can say i'll never) I would never hurt you, no
(I will never) I will never lie to you
(I will never) I will never, I will never, I will never, I will never, oh
(They say never) girl, are you listening to when I say never
