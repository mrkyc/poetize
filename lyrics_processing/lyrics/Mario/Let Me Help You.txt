Girl, I know you got weight on your shoulders
And I can tell that it's pushing you lower
You got me sitting right here
But you'd rather struggle so your conscious remains clear

'Cause you don't wanna owe nobody, nobody
But girl, I want some of your body, your body
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm different
And whatever I give to you, don't come with no conditions

Girl, let me help you
I know you can do it on your own
But let me help you
Give me a try, girl, you'll never know
Let me help you
Help you, help you
You don't have to love on your own
Let me help you

Let me know when you want me to come over, mmm
I can tell you need someone there to hold ya
I don't wanna hear the truth so I'm gonna wait 'til you ask me
But baby, soon as you do, I'ma be over there to set your body free

Eating things up like a fire
Baby, use all I require
No hidden agendas, no way
Baby, I'm in the open
