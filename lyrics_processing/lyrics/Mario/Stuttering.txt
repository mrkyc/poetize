I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I can't believe it babe, you got me disarrayed
I stand up, end up, it's like I'm stuck in place
I go to speak my mind, forgetting what to say
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
So at the most, baby we might play the silent game
Catch each other's eye again
But that's where it ends
Until you ask me my name and I feel like a kid again
It's that feeling, I need again
But I'm so gone
I don't even know if I can even be me
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling
But I can't say so, my lips just tremble
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
What's happening to me, I keep stuttering
I wanna conversate, tell you how I see your face
It's so me, it's lovely, that's exactly what I'd say
But I'm running out of time cause my words are fumbling
There's no way I could turn and walk away
So at the most, baby we might play the silent game
Catch each other's eye again
But that's where it ends
Until you ask me my name and I feel like a kid again
It's that feeling, I need again
But I'm so gone
You might also likeI don't even know if I can even be me
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling
But I can't say so, my lips just tremble
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. (Don't you hear me stuttering)
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
What's happening to me, I keep stuttering
And I know what I need is to say what I need
And possibly this could be one of my dreams (Yeah yeah baby)
(x2)
I don't even know if I can even be me
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling
But I can't say so, my lips just tremble
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh
