Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was yo man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'll be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fist full of diamonds (handful of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, yeah...
Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows from your head to your toes
Out of control baby you know
If I was yo man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'll be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fist full of diamonds (handful of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me...
You deserve better girl (you know you deserve better)
We should be together girl (baby)
With me and you it's whatever girl
So can we make this thing ours?
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
(That) Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Let me love you...
