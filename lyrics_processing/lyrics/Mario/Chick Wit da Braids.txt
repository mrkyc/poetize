Girls so bad, you'd be like how
Finer than my ex, and the girl I've got now
5 foot frame, shorty keeps it tight
And if you wit your girl, best be lookin for a fight
Cuz a brotha gonna stop and stare
Reprecautions man you won't care
And one look is never enough
She be walkin and be talkin with so much love
Man im tellin you
If you think she's bad then look at her crew
Tell me whats a brotha to do
Sophisticated and she gangsta too

That chick with da braids (chick with da braids)
In the escalade (escalade)
Oh hunnie lookin warm with the chocolate skin
But I heard she was trifflin (she be lookin warm)
Her girls got the braids (Girls got the braids), sportin DK shades (DK shades)
Oh hunnie lookin warm with the caramel skin
But I heard they were trifflin

Her man's locked down
So brotha's got room
Said he ain't comin home no time soon
I checked her hand, I didn't see no ring
I asked about her, and I heard some thangs
I can't let her get away
Hunnies around my way
Never nothin good to say
Hate the attention all the fellas pay

She's the banginest chick I've ever known (Bangin, yes bangin, yes)
How could someone so beautiful (Be so trifflin')
Must be rumors, and they must be lies (Just, blowin my mind)
(Somethin' 'bout the way, somethin' 'bout the wa-ay, yeah)
Must be lies, 'cause all the girls can't stand her but they can't say why
Why, why, why, why, why
