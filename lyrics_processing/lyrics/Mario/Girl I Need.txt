Or if things get dim she'll put on her timbs and role with the crew

I need a girl if I need a pint of blood she'll donate a quart
I need a lady who will trust me when im out at night
One who when its my darkest hour shes my ray of light

She dont want my money she just wants me only and I when I need loving she quick to put it on
Me mami's a soldier and a roller and thats just the girl I need..
