How does pleasure turn to pain? (Pain)
Real love into shame (Shame)
How I call out your name? (Name)
Aww, it ain't been the same, baby, nah
Girl, I need you back with me active, yeah
I want your back with the arch in it
'Cause these hoes tryna be choosy
But I know you thinking 'bout me
The way I'm thinking 'bout you
And what it's gon' be when I pull up on you right now
If I don't know you by now
We gon' fuck or you gon' kick me out, baby (Oh, yeah)
You say I'm toxic lately
But you the one that be riding and driving me crazy
Baby, where is the lie?

Girl, don't get used to your bed
If I'm not there with you
Girl, don't get used to me begging
But I'm fucking you tonight
'Cause we ain't really got a lot to say
Girl, I know what to do to drive you crazy (Yeah)
So baby, come and get a hit of your thang (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
You can take advantage of me (Dolla $ign)

Uh, take advantage of me, baby, I can manage it
I'm only ten percent in, can you handle it?
We got Rio on the playlist and the candles lit (Ah, yeah)
I'm fucking you tonight
Back and forth, forth and back, switch positions
Work the middle, you the center of attention
Say my name, say my name, Dolla $ign
Whose pussy is it? Baby, tell me that it's mine (Ooh)
And you know I came to fuck it up (Fuck it up)
Can't get used to this shit, I'm always somewhere else
In my city, in your city, girl, I'm gon' pull up, everytime (Baby)
You know who gon' show you love
I just want to be the one (Ooh, yeah)
Don't give that pussy to no one (Oh-oh)
