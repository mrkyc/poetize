I love you, but I don't think I can love you anymore

When I kiss you so good (Mario!)
Why would you wanna break up? (Gucci, Gucci!)
When this loving is so good
Why would you wanna break up? (Sean Garrett the Pen)
If I hit that so good
Why would you wanna break up? (Gucci!)
If the feeling is so good
Why would you wanna break up? (We goin' in!, oh!)

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Now baby girl done dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I been fired
On to the next one, more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses: miss one, next fifteen, one comin' (Huh)
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin' (Burr!)
Swag so stupid but the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smoking doja
Baby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soldier

(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci?
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louie?
(Don't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze?
(Don't) Don't when I dive, I dive deep?
I know I be (Gone) I know I be (Gone)
I know I be (Flirting with them girls)
I know I be (Said I be right back but take too long)
I know I be (Saying I be faithful but I don't)
I know I be making you them promises
Then breaking your heart again
Telling you she wasn't who she was then we arguing
But baby, I love you (Oh!)

You might be from the hood but to me (You're a model)
Everything that I had ever seen (In a model)
If you leavin' baby, don't leave me ('Til tomorrow)
Tonight we gon' get a little tipsy (With a bottle)
You gon' get me up, I'm gon' take 'em down
I'ma change my ways, we gon' work it out
Girl, I wouldn't be the same if you were with somebody else
Girl, it wouldn't be the same if I were with somebody else
I know I made mistakes before
Promise you won't get hurt no more
I got what you like and you know
Once you lay down, it's on

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you

Yep, the Barbie p-p-pushing her Ferrari
You was wilding like safaris now you s-s-sorry
But I'm not listening, not listening, not listenin-ing
Cause I b-b-ball, I got gentlemen whistling
I got the referee making all kind of calls
Cause they be sweating me like NBA player balls
Now you crying, nose all stuffy
I told you, you was lucky, now I'm the bride of Chucky
Nicki!
