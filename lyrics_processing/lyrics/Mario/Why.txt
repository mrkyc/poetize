What is going on?
Every time I try to talk
You screaming, baby
Running your mouth
Telling all our business, I got witnesses
I can't be wrong
'Cause I gave you my heart
And you played me
Accusing me of doing things that I would never do to you

You say I see other girls
I say you tripping
'Cause I wouldn't be the one to be found out
Because I'm not that kinda guy
If I wanted somebody else
Then I'd say goodbye
Been trying to work it out
Girl, tell me

Why?
(Why?)
Why do you keep putting me through it, baby?
You tell me you don't wanna go through it, baby
You're believing all the lies that you heard about me
I can't take it, no
You thinking that I'm doing you dirty, baby
You better understand
I'll do all I can
But if I'm no good for you
Then baby, I'm no good for you
So tell me why are you still here?
You might also like
Every night that I come home
And you're laying in bed
(All I wanna do is make love to you)
But now I got reservations
Because you're acting strange
You been going through my Sidekick, Blackberry and my iPhone
All that shit ain't cool
You say you got my number (number)
And I've been caught, admit it (admit it)
Say I'm playing dumb, but (dumb, but)
But you think you know, forget it (and baby, you)
I maybe young but I ain't stupid, baby (stupid, baby)
I'm not gonna play the fool (play the fool)
And you should know by now (now)
That I was all for you

Why?
(Why?)
Why do you keep putting me through it, baby?
You tell me you don't wanna go through it, baby
You're believing all the lies that you heard about me
I can't take it, no
You thinking that I'm doing you dirty, baby
You better understand
I'll do all I can
But if I'm no good for you
Then baby, I'm no good for you
So tell me why are you still here?
You got so used to the fast life
All of the things I could do for you
Kept you coming back to me
Always running back to me
Said, I can't do
Do this no more
Thought you knew better, girl
Not like the rest of them girls
Why can't you prove me wrong?

Why?
(Why?)
Why do you keep putting me through it, baby?
You tell me you don't wanna go through it, baby
You're believing all the lies that you heard about me
I can't take it, no
You thinking that I'm doing you dirty, baby
You better understand
I'll do all I can
But if I'm no good for you
Then baby, I'm no good for you
So tell me why are you still here?

Woah
