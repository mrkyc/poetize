Spit bars 'til my throat snap
Charred is the goat from the start
It's a cult rap
Zan out in the garden, a party in the forest
But I left the door, darn
I'm a ghost now
When I had a fro, had different color button-ups
Got dreads, you see I'm wearing all-black coats now
Chosen
Almost missed my flight, had to buy a suitcase
Rocked the Dickies and the Adi-Eases with the bootlace
Fresher than some toothpaste, heaven sent
The fung shui decadent, and mechanisms flew
What a blue day, right?
Did you say night's in the distance? Fuck it
Kill 'em on sight, no forgiveness
Chester Watson, ruler of the night and the wicked
Focused on Medusa, got my eyes hella vintage
Fuck a feature, I don't got a price for you niggas
Call me Caesar, feeding off the light
But I'm leaning off the Sprite
Rockin' bees, don't rock no ice
Where I'm from, that shit will get you killed or stopped by the police
And that's the shit I don't got time to deal with
Clock it to the streets, walk around with twenty bucks
To hold it, I deposit cheese
My ruler, that's what you believe in
Socrates, ancient leader
Don't say it cause it rhyme
Say it cause you want to be considered nigga of that
Prime minister, menacing chimes, sickening villainous (???)
Twitching, it's brittle and grimy
See, my kindness is diminishing
Five bitches and middleman processed to belittle them
Time ticking, the penalty's life
Chase the Henny like a bounty's on its head
But drink it on the rocks if I'm surrounded by the dead
Wish I am

Mmm, folded this shit
Locks into Loch Ness and and closer to (???)
Chakra apocalypse, who said it's obvious
That my los manos lose control in the wind
Hold Hennessy when I'm holding my zen
Mmm, soulless as shit
Boy, I need rollie on wrist
Drunk as fuck and I'm scrolling this spliff like
Damn, this is pearl
Laughing, I (???) on and I'm jamming the curls
Panicking, pressing sweet dances with witches and phantoms and me
Holograms walking with (???) sanctity
Metaphysical as insanity, there
It's a cold one
