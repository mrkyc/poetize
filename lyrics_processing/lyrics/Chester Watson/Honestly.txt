Do you want to know the greatest and also the worst device that humans ever invented? It's television!
Television controls people by bombarding them with information until they lose their sense of reality
Now, television itself has become a new religion


Yo yo yo yo yo yo! Get that nigga!
Get that nigga! Get that nigga! Yo
Word word word word word. Check
Yeah I'm a muthafuckin' beast
No category just an enigma with wings
Honestly, I never learnt the birds
And the bees from my mums -
They were just some other words
In the streets all along right?
And this was a long night, coming from a long flight
Suited like the  high, only cause my arms tired
Crew is chewin on some orange rice - the
Homie said that suicide wasn't appropriate
So instead I engulf on acid and opiates
Shit. My mind's a supernova rover clip - and
I ain't tryina be tough witchu - but
It ain't nothin I ain't seen you blooded nigga
I  in fights self-inflicted - know it wasn't you
The world has made me unforgivin'

Honestly , I get my ways from the east
Reclusive in my gaze and my speech as in ancient
Words contort so I don't say shit
As a result I don't pray, I don't preach -
Consequences really be, but I teach when I can
No I over think, in a blink, see the lamp switch shades
Get the lamp killed - gotta love the black steel blades
With the slant hooks, Saturn and the 6 got onyx
On the arrow so it shatter when it hit, Indian tactics in the mix
If I'm on my ass, I'm on my , I don't sit but
If I need it boy - I'm Magic with the wrist
I can see that I'm a drug, I fiend some addicts for this shit
17 like I ain't even reached a pattern when I spit
Staying innovative  seeming glad to
Swish my enemies and  who aren't here
Just floatin' to the chasm as a crypt
Honestly, I'm a muthafuckin' beast
