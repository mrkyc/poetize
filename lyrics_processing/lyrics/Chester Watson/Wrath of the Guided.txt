Astro-projecting the astroplanes
Ain't acceptin' to me
I'm just too hectic, or it's wavy
Tames the rest of the sea, shh!
It's a bit early
I wasn't scheduled to meet that 'til next week
But I should of guessed it
Meeting cancer, too busy dancing with the stars
An' Xanax is in bars
Beat soundin' like I'm landin' ships on Mars
Blurred in the narrow aesthetic
Curves an' Medusa
They relieve
Rollin' up spliffs with my main an' my clique
I don't owe you a thing, you ain't payin' me shit
Wearin' HUF Ramondettas ain't famous as shit
But I'm better off now than you been in a minute
My nigga, you slippin', you sleep
Shit, I should be in the Genius at least for my wig
And/or all of the hits I released when my niggas knew
No, this is not just a figure of speech
You might also likeFlow is more languid than rivers an' streams
Vanquish the language an' head on the keys
Like anguish is aimless, don't sit on that, please
Yeah, like anguish is aimless, don't sit on that, please
Yeah, yeah
The name of the sinner is me
But I don't pray for forgiveness
Just fix what was wrong
And let time take it's course for the free
Bathe in the silence and cradle the beat
Like a bong on a roadtrip across the country
Pre-sent the message with Veteran ease
Excellent trees
Matches the textures of my  collection
With some extra leaves
Supposed to believe that I don't give a fuck
'Cause I don't
Nigga saw me in school with some new shoes
Like I ain't skate thinkin' that I won't
I was chillin' though
How? With some mad 
Floatin' through the , he just kinda knew
But never condoned it, uh
Rogue on that beat
Throw up if I smoke a stoge on the beat
Roll up, let's go to the store for some eats
And the  I see poses they roamin' the streets
And they posted on posters, it's hopeless to 
That just goes for my main an' my team
No, this is not just a figure of speech
Flow is more languid than rivers an' streams
Desolete lands in the pits of the sea
Don't see it with analyst, see it with 
(That just goes for my main an' my team)
