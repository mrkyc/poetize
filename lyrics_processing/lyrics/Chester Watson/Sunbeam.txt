Yo
Sunbeams create rainbows in the smoke
I was up early, outside, it was cold
And these last few days been rainy with a cloak of clouds
When overhead, make the city seem remote
Gold in the flesh, so I'm so picturesque
Ballerina, it control pirouettes
Feel the dosage effects, see my soul silhouette in the distance
See my soul silhouette
If you listen, then you just might grow and progress
I just do it, asked Nike can they cut the cheque
'Cause cuz' fluent, feel the sunbeams on my chest
Either that, or it's just steam from the fresh pre-roll
That I tucked somewhere in the vest
MM...FOOD, I feel like I eat beats for breakfast
Move smart, a negative plus a negative's negative
Can't be reckless, we all know the streets is treacherous
People gon' switch up, that's to be expected
Yeah, that's to be expected
I don't need the friendships just to be respected
Yeah, disrespect is out of the question
Always take precautions, no second guessin'
I Love Ugly garms are to guard the chains on my neck with
Lose for wisdom, I cannot make exception
Vibin' under sunbeams and reflection
Wavy when your wife is your best friend
Visualize, like, that's the life I could mesh with
And remember to always tell her she's gorgeous
Once uttered words can run faster than horses
Yeah, so you can't be indifferent
Two Balancias is good as he is wicked
Smokin' spliffs on the edge of existence
Watch the smoke spin in the air like a kickflip
People look at my hair, it's addictive
Then they say I don't belong there, I'm a misfit
Brown skin is just a characteristic
A racist's heart blacker than me and all of my kin mixed
Some friends stayed, some friends went
Some things changed, some things didn't
Still get compared to The Weeknd
Felt like a Starboy when that sunbeam hit
