(Damn) damn the walls moving
Slower than before but now I'm talkin' to 'em

Mind fucked, the whole life got a lag
Think I got a little stuck in the past, what a drag
Kinda dig it but I feel I'm living life pretty fast like
I was killing shit at half the age of all my competition
Never fuckin' wit 'em brought 'em to the land of the dead with the plans to behead and put brass on my mantel
Plaques on my mantel
You was most whack at the standstill
I was in the back, all black with my hands sealed ready for the reaper
Prolly going steady with my demons in a place called Paris
Wig fucked and my face, all hairy, a mad man, racist, a terrorist
Favoritist,  cleric, a sage might embarrass you nigga
And ancient so you can take fair out comparisons
Pharaoh inherited soul
Perilous hero, your marrow went cold from that heroin picture that scribbled in gold
Or etched on a scroll, moral ethics get old to me
Replica Casanova
I'm losing my heading so pack the bowl up
Hit the bookstore, later crack a cola
See them past as sober got my doja lit
And I'm fuckin' trippin' I can't hold it in
You might also like
Walls movin'
Though they're slower than before but now I'm talkin' to 'em (Yeah)
Damn the walls movin'
Slower than before but now I'm talkin' to 'em
(Acid residue)

Mastered the wave, tap-danced with my shadow in the back of the spaces
Trapped and away from the madness today
Trapped in my madness, my only escape, you a crony a fake, so felonious
Sniff the ammonia vapour
Or hold your breath and just wait, I'm just tryna see the Mori
Got a letter from the gods read "Koi Die"
A Pisces I knew that the loom was in two
Psyche went icy but dude what a view, from this hotel
I feel like this life is a room in a maze in a new simulations from aliens, basically time ain't a thing just a basis
Say if the moon was destroyed
Waves would just follow the sun, 'till seasons were meaningless
Nothing is seemingly new
Told me I seem pretty blue

Nah I'm just zooted and the walls moving
Little faster than before I stopped talkin' to 'em
Acid
