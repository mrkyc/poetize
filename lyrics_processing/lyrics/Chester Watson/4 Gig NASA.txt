Stare into the black hole
Images of castles
Vivid like a fractal
I make my demands and I don't do it like an asshole
Pivot like an axle
Looser than your bitch
Been giving hickeys, sixin' black folk
Listening to Chester, that's like secondhand crack smoke

Bacon, eggs, and , wardrobe only natural colors
White on white or black clothes
Headed for the astral for a minute, hit it back though
Alchemist and astrologist are my comrades, so
Know that I ain't fucking with these niggas from the get-go
Not even pissed, I don't trust those not in my clique, yo
So actually, I'm just relaxing
Skate to the bodega, get a Faygo and a Magnum just in case
Cause you never know what could happen
With that black abracadabra, pull a rabbit out a hat

Cloak black holes
Images of castles
Vivid like a fractal
I make my demands and I don't do it like an asshole
Pivot like an axle
Looser than your bitch
Been giving hickeys, sixin' black folk
Listening to Chester, that's like secondhand crack smoke

Hey check it, listening to Chester, that's like secondhand crack smoke
Studying the vectors in this sector of the black, oh wait
I skated the Raymond , got faded, famous, and better
I'm watching the  study Fellini, I missed the weather
But not too much for a day, texts from the inside
Begin morphing into a sage, the organism behemoth
Exorbitant in his range, no questioning
And if you get close enough, you can tell he got leather skin
 the devilish

Stare into a black hole
Images of castles
Vivid like a fractal
I make my demands and I don't do it like an asshole
Pivot like an axle
Looser than your bitch
Been giving hickeys, sixin' black folk
Listening to Chester, that's like secondhand crack smoke

Stare into a black hole
Images of castles
Vivid like a fractal
I make my demands and I don't do it like an asshole
Pivot like an axle
Looser than your bitch
Been giving hickeys, sixin' black folk
