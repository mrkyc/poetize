Yeah, lately there a lot of things going on in my life
That keep my head from meeting the pillow on lonely nights
Only tempted to slit my wrists if I'm near a golden knife
And I got so high that I forgot my fear of open nights
Now I'm on a cliff, barrel full of beer, couple sprites, cup of OJ
Got these chicks kissing like they was nice, doubt it
Now we're buying the city, I'd rather buy a mountain
Buy some TNT, blow that shit up and build a cave
I'm in tune with my youth like I found the fountain
And I barely tie my shoes so fuck what you say
And my whole damn crew some type of monsters
Whenever we together, Japanese parade
Jun-Ji and Moon-Ji got me like I copped the sponsor
Told my girl I really talk to groupies at the concerts
Told them they can go show they boobies to my entourage
And their energy is getting to me make my mind up

Every time I go on stage I got to turn the lights down
Sometimes I cop anxiety please turn the lights down
I said that every time I go on stage I got to turn the lights down
Sometimes I cop anxiety please turn the lights down

I can show you how to make a couple with just one
3-0-5 I'm chilling high up 8th floor like a don
I can never trust you like I never trust your drugs
She like how I taste, and I like how she work her tongue
Roll it up, stack it up, all these blues, I'm in love
Pull it up, switching lanes, high as fuck boy I might go buy a plane
Took you to the water but I can not make you drink it
I got money murder music that gon' pay me off a 'Cedes
Every time I be inside her she hit notes like she a singer
I can never be a groupie give a fuck about the fame
I remember all the times you told me I would never be shit
I was ridin', busin' plays and if you need it I got eight
Pussy boy filled with hate, blowing smoke all in they face
Fuck around going super Sayian I might get married at the bank
Young boss getting what he earned, if you kill me my reapers purgin'
Thirty-five bitches on my line bout to cut my phone service
I done come up off of none, looked back and I lost it all
