Even though you don't want me, I will wait for you
And I know this is your world your gonna do what you wanna do
Just becuase the things I did. I'm always put to shame
So if you let me in your world, I promise I will Change
*: There's no doubt no question, on what you been doing for years
Corrupt both of our worlds, now you livin in tears
You cried you my only one, look me dead in the eye
What a fool to believe, girl for you I would die
Thought I found my one and only girl
To share my life, and share my World
Second guessing on myself, never cross the line
Never once doubt in you, try to play my mind
The best things always come in twos
But after this one time, I couldn't stick around, cuz of the wicked way you choose
Though you were my baby boo
The time came around to represent on what a man had to do
Swirvin, weaving, hid beneath this section
Fuck all the drama never should I have to mention
But just incase you wanna really take a swirl
Don't trust nobody when it comes to my world
~Chorus~
*: For just once I got a hold of my world
There's no more drama
No more sad or slow songs and drama about no girl
I shifted out a foo and hit the breaks quick
And thinking "Damn i coulda been there with this chick"
(It's crazy) girlfirend don't care care if vatos think she's stuck
She was getting down with Anthony and Chuck
(and for this chick?) life was nothing but an all day party she was livin
And I couldn't get up in it, and if I did (guess what?)
Then id be like the next man found fighting
When I found that they're pounding on your back
And its still the same, but you claim things change
Tryna blame me for your games. (Please)
It's all cool baby it's nobodys fault but mine
For goin on a ride on cloud nine
I coulda gave you my whole world then
But I'd probably be sharing it with them
You might also like~Chorus~
2x: Nobody's gonna shape my world &
Nobody's gonna make my world &
Nobody's gonna break my world &
Nobody's gonna take my world
*Verse3: The truth lies in the soul not to save the lease
There's noone to blame cuz the pain is in the beast
You know right from wrong
So stop holding on
Look on the brightside
You're fortunate to be in my song
There's no exception, don't question what I believe
It's all good, till you tangled up the way I believe
With our heart and soul, and a mind of gold
There will never be another like you in my world
You still lookin at me sideways (why?) cuz I just sang my sad song
And you still can't believe I'm gone
But you know I really understand, it's hard to swallow what I said
When I think about the lies you fed
And it ain't all bad, it's actually all good
Knowing that I did what I could (for real)
You shouldn't let it get you down and blue
Think I'm dedicating this song to you (You feel me?)
