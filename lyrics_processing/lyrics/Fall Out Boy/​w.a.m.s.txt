I'm a young one stuck in the thoughts
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirrin' awake
I'm tryin' to trick myself to fall asleep again, whoa

My head's in Heaven, my soles are in Hell
Well, let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well

Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh, freckle, freckle, what makes you so special?
Oh, what makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
Oh, I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone, oh, oh

Guild me, build me, it's your club, so
Let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming it is inside
Your skin

Mmmmm
Mama, if we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days, we won't sleep for days
And Mama, if we pray to the Lord, oh
Does he sing on a stage? Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
Uh, I want to get stuck, I want to get stuck
