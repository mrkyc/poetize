I don't even have my own attention
You say, "Please don't ever change"
But you don't like me the way I am
The sign says "Don't you tap the glass"
But I read it in reverse
"eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT"
The world tried to burn all the mercy outta me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way, I can't forget it
Drivin' down the coast again
The pills are kickin' in, the pills are kickin' in
She said, "I love you 'til I don't"
I am just playin' house, no idea what I'm doin' now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's gettin' to me, it's time to throw in the towel

'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancin' all alone in the mornin' light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feelin' alright
The sunshine

Call me Oluwaburna, I fell in love, but I didn't fall down
Them say me nah normal, drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan
Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain, passing through my fuckin' mind
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shinin' through, got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...

Sunshine riptide
Dancin' all alone in the mornin' light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feelin' al- (-right)

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I-I'm stuck in...)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun

You are my truest feelin' yet
I love you so much, it's just like oxygen
And it's goin' to my head
A public meltdown, petulant, but irreverent
Take all your possibilities, then take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kickin' in, the pills are kickin' in

'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancin' all alone in the mornin' light
The sunshine riptide (The sunshine)
You came back like a wave when I was feelin' al- (-right)
I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancin' all alone in the mornin' light
The sunshine riptide (The sunshine)
You came back like a wave when I was feelin' al- (-right)

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I-I'm stuck in...)
Sun, sun, sun
