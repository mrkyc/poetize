(Hands, put your hands, hands, put your hands in the air)
(Hands, put your hands, hands, put your hands in the air)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Hands, put your hands, hands, hands in the air (Left, left, left, right, left)
Hands, put your hands, hands, hands in the air (Left, left, left, right, left)

My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)

So light 'em up, up, up

Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
