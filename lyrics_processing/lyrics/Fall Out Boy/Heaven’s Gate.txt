One look from you and I'm on that faded love
Out of my body and flying above
If there were any more left of me, I'd give it to you
And I'll tell you that I am fine, but I'm a missile that's guided to you

Go out in the world to start over again and again
As many times as ya can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Would you give me, give me, give me

Give me a boost, a boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate

I got dreams of my own, but I want to make yours come true
So please come through, honey please, please come through

Oh, go out in the world, start over again and again
As many times as you can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?

You're the one habit I just can't kick
