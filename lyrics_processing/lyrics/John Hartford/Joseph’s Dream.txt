He dreamt his older brothers would someday be his subjects
He told this to his father and his brothers they got mad and tried to kill him
His father just took note, but his brothers, they got mad and tried to kill him
Joseph was a young man with 11 older brothers
He was given by his parents a coat of many colors
And this made his brothers angry
So they sold him into slavery down in Egypt
They tried but couldn't kill him
So they sold him to the service of the Wazir
Now, the Wazir's wife, when Joseph was a slave to her
Was heavily attracted she bragged to all her ladies
That she'd have this gorgeous slave to be her lover
She tried but then she failed
She had it all set up but Joseph, he refused to go along with it
Her husband he was wise to her when she had Joseph busted
So he did not have him put to death the way it was expected
He just threw him in the dungeon for 2 years
With a butler and a baker
Who were having crazy dreams that Joseph had the knowledge to interpret
When the dreams came true, the Pharaoh was advised of this
Had Joseph sent to him to hear the dream of seven cows
And Joseph gave such good advice, the Pharaoh released him from his slavery
And not only that, he also made Joseph the new Wazir

Down to Egypt to buy corn, but they were thrown in jail as spies
In three days he had released them to return and come again and bring their father
Who forgave them, as they gathered 'round just to live regular old lives right there with Joseph
