All the kids in the gutter runnin' really bare
How much money do I have to get
To get me set where the jet set gets
Up on the hill where they do the boogie
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do the boogie)
I wonder what they're doin' when they do-do the boogie
And I wonder what I'm doin' here
Down in the city if a-you ain't dead
You better watch that man, he gonna bust your head
Throw you over and leave you alone
He's a-twenty minutes late, He's gotta be back home
Up on the hill where they do the boogie
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do the boogie)
I wonder what they're doin' when they do-do the boogie
And I wonder what I'm doin' here
The rat's in the alley and a roach on the floor
A businessman huntin' for a two-bit whore
I thought I heard some housewife say
I gotta go up the hill for the PTA
Up on the hill where they do the boogie
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do the boogie)
I wonder what they're doin' when they do-do the boogie
And I wonder what I'm doin' here
You might also likeA-Some folks say that a hippie won't steal
But I caught three in my corn field
One had a flag and the other had a bomb
And the third ol' boy was a-gettin' on home
Up on the hill where they do the boogie
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do the boogie)
I wonder what they're doin' when they do-do the boogie
And I wonder what I'm doin' here
Now all I know about is a-what I read
A-see it comin' at me on the TV screen
Every time they boogie well it gives me a thrill
But they always seem to do it way up on the hill
Up on the hill where they do the boogie
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do the boogie)
I wonder what they're doin' when they do-do the boogie
And I wonder what I'm doin' here
