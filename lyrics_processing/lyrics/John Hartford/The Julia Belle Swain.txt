Oh, the Julia Belle Swain is a mighty fine boat, got a mighty fine captain, too
Got a big red wheel that goes around and around and a bunch of old hippies for a crew
Well, I can't stay here; well, I gotta get away; I'm Chattanooga Tennessee bound
Gonna get my banjo and put it on my back when the Julia Belle comes down
When the Julia Belle comes down

When the Julia Belle comes to Peoria, you know that summer's here
And up on the Illinois River, that's the very best time of the year
Those steam boat days in August like a hazy, lazy dream
I want to be at the foot of Main Street when the Julia Belle raises steam
When the Julia Belle raises steam

Well Dennis and Moon and Bob Burnett, and Doc and Murray too
Are one big steamboat family and the Julia Belle steamboat crew
Me, I tell you, I gotta getta away; I'm Chattanooga Tennessee bound
Gonna get my banjo and put it on my back when the Julia Belle comes down
When the Julia Belle comes down

Now the Julia Belle Swain is a women's lib boat, the first I ever knew
Got girls in the pilothouse and girls on deck and a lady in the engine room
Now Donna's got her license; Cindy's learning to steer
Little Julie keeps Moon outa trouble by wandering off everywhere
By wandering off everywhere

When the Julia Belle gets in a steamboat race, she's a mighty hard boat to beat
She raced the Belle of Louisville; she beat the Delta Queen
She don't need no help to get her turned around; she'll come right around on a dime
And after the race she heads up the river 'cause the Julia Belle's still got time
'Cause the Julia Belle's still got time

Well, I sure do love the Tennessee River, the Ohio and the Illinois
And I love the old Mississippi River; it's a good old place for a boy
Just to step on board the steamboat, ride all the way to the sea
Where else but a muddy old river would a person want to be
Would a person want to be?

Well, I come up the river the other night, darker than the inside of a cow
Ain't nothin' like a crooked old river, straighten my head right out
Now I love my love; she's pretty as could be, and I love to take her down
Those pretty ladies really like to ride when the Julia Belle comes down
