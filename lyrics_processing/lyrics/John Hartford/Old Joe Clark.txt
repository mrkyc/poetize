He preached all over the plain
The highest text he ever took
Was a-High Low Jack in the Game
Well, he came down to my house
And showed me all of his cards
He whispered low in his gambler's voice
It's really not too hard
Said he never had no trouble
Just a-walk around wearing a sheet
Buncha people waving them palm leaves
To keep Joe Clark from the heat
Joe Clark, now, got nothing to do
Got a little ol' rubber cross
Picking up pennies from the folks that's rich
And a-give a little smile when the lost

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
You might also likeWake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
If you got the bread, you can change your head
You can be down there when the Glory rolls
Well, Old Joe Clark's got 2 little girls
To wash his feet and sing
"Old Joe Clark," I heard one say
"We'll give you anything."
Let's go down to the church-house
There's a lotta good things goin' down
The crowd turns over at 9 o'clock
With the cream of the underground

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
Wake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
If you got the bread, you can change your head
You can be down there when the Glory rolls
Well, I got this Environment record
And we play it in every room
And we got us plenty of light bulbs
To keep us out of the gloom
And everyone says, "Right On! Far Out!"
Then stands around and laughs
I guess I'd better say it, too
Or Joe might kick my ass

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
Wake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
If you got the bread, you can change your head
You can be down there when the Glory rolls
I used to want to be hip so bad
And be with the folks that know
But I had me some tie-died underwear
And a little bit of snow to blow
I'm really mad that I'm so sad
So mad that I don't feel well
I'd trade my key to Heaven
If I could safely go to Hell

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
Wake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
If you got the bread, you can change your head
You can be down there when the Glory rolls
Well I need an old Orpheum 5-string
With a 12 inch open back pot
So the next time you go to the attic
Look and see what you've got
Or a 12 inch Farland open-back
28 three-eighths inch scale
I wish you'd write and let me know
If you got one for sale

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
Wake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
If you got the bread, you can change your head
You can be down there when the Glory rolls
Now, I asked old Joe to manage me
So that I could go and sing
He said hurry up, I could wait on him
And he'd help me to do my thing
Now he calls me every hour
When I'm trying to be alone
Just wants to keep me posted
That there's nothin' goin' on

Singing, get on down to Canaan, Brother
There's a lotta good things goin' down
With a little bit of luck and a couple of bucks
You can be down there where the Glory Rolls
Wake up, Brother, there's a new day a-comin'
And it hasn't got time to stop
He's a high-flying daddy with his hat and coat ready
