And poor old Howard Hughes
Locked up there in his hotel suite
Tryin' to find his shoes
Well he's got so much to lose
How 'bout Howard Hughes and all his blues
His nurses and his chauffeurs
All stand around and sigh
Watch the door and wait on him
Whatever's on his mind
That's a hell of a lot to do
To guard old Howard Hughes and all his blues
If he didn't have a nickel
If he didn't have a dime
He could do whatever he damn well please
He could do it all the time
But success is just a mess of overdues
For old Howard Hughes and all of his blues
Well he's always in the papers
He's always on the news
No one knows who's usin' who
Or even what's the truth
Now who's getting' screwed
Is if it's them or you know who
And all his blues
You might also likeAnd way down younder on the Vegas strip
Where the regular people pass
Someone said he's not too well
Heard he's sinkin' fast
But that's unofficial sources to the news
About poor old Howard Hughes and all of his blues
If he didn't have a nickel
If he didn't have a dime
He could do whatever he damn well please
He could do it all the time
Success is just a mess of overdues
For poor old Howard Hughes and all of his blues
Now everybody's writin' their books about him
Some of them are awful long
Didn't really have all that much time
So I thought I'd just write this song
Gotta get me in a few licks too
About poor old Howard Hughes and all his blues
If he didn't have a nickel
If he didn't have a dime
He could do whatever he damn well please
He could do it all the time
Success is just a mess of overdues
