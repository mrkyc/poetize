Bear witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
Keep heaters on us, with red lasers
Now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
It's the life we chose, to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas try and break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you pricks try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the dough man
I off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like Cuban Links
Breaking down cash money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
'Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadie do (Same song)
Grown man nigga, baby who?
I send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No names don't claim ya shoes
You might also like
Once again it's on nigga

Sigel hard like corn liqour
I'll take you out this world like you was born nigga
Butt naked covered in blood, gasping for air
Clinging for dear life, nigga you dead right

Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinkling the world with baby powder
So Fresh And So Clean
Been an outcast since I was a teen
But I outlast cause I out blast anybody you bring, Young
You got it the prophet, I told ya'll niggas
Then I showed ya'll niggas, you can't knock it
Don't get carried away, you a mule nigga (Mule nigga)
Where was you nigga?
I was doing this here like Mary J like everyday, was true nigga
They can't question what we do Jigga

Once again it's on ( them niggas)

Young run through you niggas (Through them niggas)
Like a glitch in the computer nigga (Computer niggas)
I'm the shit, I'm a sewer nigga (Uh)
This is Jay everyday (Day)
No days off, Ferris Bueller nigga
Ha
B-Sig' Fred Krueger niggas
Nightmare your medulla nigga
You scared 'cause I glue with Jigga
He said "Sig' you that nigga," couldn't see his vision
But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch
See Sig' stay honest, I deposit you a check
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us (We all we got)
True indeed, yes
More better, yes
More cheddar, S.P. chain, jeans and sweaters
Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like Tetris or
Get off the block, run south with M. Betha
From my block to your block, shout out to M Extra
Who the fuck (fuck) want (want) what (what)
None of you niggas is B-Sig, prick I'm done with you niggas

Once again it's on

Uck it we ain't through wit niggas
Twin towers here to ruin niggas
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich or Osama bombin' shit
We slay niggas wit K's, we the drama men
Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy)
You rather slide down a razor blade slidin' board
I'm a live wire, hula hoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You can't mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fast-forward's on
You dress cute when the war's off
What you doing dawg, you playing wit it
You make your bed right, you laying in it
You keep your shed tight, you stayin' in it
You bringing niggas where your kids sleep
I sing to niggas while they kids sleep
Rock-a-bye muthafucka
I hope you high muthafucka
Ready to die muthafucka
Who shot ya? Separate the weak from State Prop' the
Kids who squash beef and rep those streets
Once again it's on nigga

Bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya mama "bye bye" get ready to mourn sister, it's a
See what you got here's a full blown twister, you nuttin' but hot air
It's not fair
The reason why we lead the pack, this is a marathon
You start off fast then you wheezing in the back
So even if I slack, I got enough lee-way
To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway and I'm back
Without leaving I'm here, but you can't see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you can't be him
So matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that it's only one Hov
Young Vito, voice of the young people
If my life is a movie then Sig gon' be the sequel
We bring it to your door with Bleek peeking through your peek hole
And don't get scared nigga, alert ya people
