Yeah, uh it's all good now
It's all good now
We out the hood now
It's all good now
We out the hood now
We out the hood now
It's all good now
We out the hood now
It's all good now, NU

Who thought we'd see the day when we'd kick our feet up?
Lay back, exhale, put the heat up
No stress, no scale, no jail could keep us
Only case we catching now'd be a misthemeanor
Remember we used to hustle, thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled, life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us, where life gon' lead us?
Knowing if we getting married, our wives gon' need us
If for one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights, ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy
Only ones that's moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies
Who live in all that was crazy
You keep it in the dark
I'ma speak it from the heart

Remember them days, livin' all days in doubt?
Remember them days, thinking there's no way out?
Remember them days, not knowing which way to route?
It's all good now
We out the hood now
Remember them days, all of us under the covers?
Remember them days, heating up the house with the oven?
Remember them days, thinking that life ain't love us? (Come on)
It's all good now
We out the hood now

Remember kids would run the block, you never thought they would get harmed
Only time the block got wet is when the sprinklers was on
Think about that time, dog, that wasn't long
Now that we got kids, think when we was born
Coming up in my hood was hard
Every day my mom cooked with lard
Fucked up, I couldn't feed myself
Living life, no means of wealth
Eating shit I can't believe myself (That's not a joke)
Man I was dealt these cards and I played 'em out
Yeah, the road was rough, but I made a route
Now picture running extension cord from your neighbor's house
To get lights, fuck nights on the latest routes
Used to close my eyes, try to fade it out
Dumb niggas in the hood think I made it out
Man, that showed me just where they mental at
And tell me half of these cats ain't been through jack
Remember them days, livin' all days in doubt?
Remember them days, thinking there's no way out?
Remember them days, not knowing which way to route?
It's all good now
We out the hood now
Remember them days, all of us under the covers?
Remember them days, heating up the house with the oven?
Remember them days, thinking that life ain't love us? (Come on)
It's all good now
We out the hood now

Yo, every day I thank Deke and Rola
From introducing me to Dame and Hovah
Ever since that day I met Jay, man, I knew my pain was over
They let me in this game, it's over
Mom, I know I put you through hell, but now I'm gonna order you heaven
No more temporary layoffs like Florida Evans
Ain't no good times about that there
Your boy rhyme now, it's fine now, we out that there
Fuck that Access card
I'ma work extra hard
To turn that to a platinum express car
You can have sweet dreams at night
Your boy ain't out there with them toys and them fiends at night
All them cracks and the gats, left that life alone
It's the tracks and the raps and the microphone
Wish y'all would fuck that up now
Shit, it's all good now
We out the hood now
Remember them days, livin' all days in doubt?
Remember them days, thinking there's no way out?
Remember them days, not knowing which way to route?
It's all good now
We out the hood now
Remember them days, all of us under the covers?
Remember them days, heating up the house with the oven?
Remember them days, thinking that life ain't love us? (Come on)
It's all good now
