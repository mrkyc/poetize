Ah, just a child of the ghetto, yeah
Change gon' come
Uh, yeah, uh-uh
Uh
Uh
Uh-uh, yeah

They say a change gon' come, well, it's a long time comin'
My legs tired, hundred million miles runnin'
On life treadmill runnin' in place but still I'm one with the race
I think back on my wonder years
Food stamps  wonder bread
Young, wild, loose, learned the ledge
I got my truths from the older heads
You went to church and took a different route
You got your truth from out the bishop mouth
I drunk the juice that turned Bishop out
Them double deuces turned my system out
And the xannies and the weed too
Fuck it, I'm still here

Though it's hard in this ghetto
Dont you let go 'cause a change gonna come
Yeah, said a change gon' come
And though you're tired of the waitin'
Hold your patience 'cause a change gonna come
Yeah, I know it is, I know it is
You might also like
What a life (What a life)
The big house, two cars, a dog
Picket fence and you his wife (And I'm his wife)
But let's depict his life
You know them feds got them pictures, right? (Yeah)
I know you stressed baby girl, feel what you going through
'Cause if they kick in that door, you know you goin' too (Goin' too)
'Cause everything in your name
From the phone bill to the deed on the house
You tryna find a way to ease out (I'm tryna find a way to ease out)
But you can't, you feel trapped (Trapped)
You think back (Back), "Was it really worth it?" (Whoa)
This lifestyle could you really afford it?
You done lost four lives
Yours and the three you aborted (But it's so)

But it's hard when you're settled with no income
(Oh, change gon' come)
But income steady comin' in, yeah
I need a change to come
I know I'm tired of the waitin'
Ain't got no patience 'cause I don't think a change is gonna come
(Oh, change gon' come)
Please tell me when, oh
Damn, got you livin' good, you eatin' good, you dressin' good
Why you stressin' 'cause I'm still hood?
I know you want a lil' cutie spend dough
But you know I'm OT, I'm scoopin' that rent though
I put myself in your shoes, at night
You huggin' a pillow, I'm huggin' a corner
You pillow is soft, my corner is hard
But you won't see that
Uh-uh, I bet your selfish ass don't see that, instead
You think I'm up in the hood, up to no good
Gotta come home to you 
When it hurt so bad why it feel so good (When it hurts so bad)
But you love me like you should (When it really hurts so bad)
You know I'd change if I could, if I could, if I could

See, I know that I gotta shake it
But sometimes I just can't take it, waitin' for a change to come, oh
Waitin' on a change to come
And girl, I know it gets hard in the struggle
So I gotta stay on top of my hustle, yeah
And I'm waitin' on the same change
Well, I been waitin' a long time for a change to come (I know)
That change ain't came yet so now I'm gone, baby
