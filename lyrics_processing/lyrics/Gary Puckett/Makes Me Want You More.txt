You'd turn away say
The moments has come
To walk away
Just do what you want to do
Don't look back on your decision
You're needing me no more
It's nice feeling the soft
Light of your eyes
Think twice as I see
It's no surprise
You're further away from me
I'm wasting time if I hold on
No one know but you
Toss and turn the night through
You can't believe what's happened
In your life
Time to realise
What's gone wrong is over
It's just a question of time
Because I can't stay...
Deeper i love with just a memory
Sometimes I feel that I don't know you
Sometimes it makes me want you more
You might also likeI through our love would go down
In history
And not run aground
In stormy seas
The weather is clearing now
And I know that what I'm leaving
Is all that I wanted
I see time passing by
With you once more
I don't understand
Why or what for
It's taking so very long
I lose my mind if I hold on
No one know but you
Toss and turn the night through
You can't believe what's happened
In your life
Time to realise
What's gone wrong is over
It's just a question of time
Because I can't stay...
Deeper in love with just a memory
Sometimes I feel that I don't know you
Sometimes it makes me want you more

So tell me why
That you and I don't let it go
There's no need to fool ourselves again
I can't remain like this
Deeper in love with just a memory
Sometimes I feel that I don't know you
Sometimes it makes me want you more
Deeper in love with just a memory
Sometimes I feel that I don't know you
