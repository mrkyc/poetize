So this is what it comes to
This is what it looks like when it's gone
The circle that I run through
I'm faded in the light, the fadin' lights

So tell me, baby, you feel that?
'Cause I've been sendin' signals out
And this is what it comes to
Yeah, this is what it comes to

Is the me you want the one you need tonight?
If you're leavin' me, just go, I'll be alright
I don't wanna be with nobody like you

(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be with nobody like you
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)

So this is what it comes to
So this is how I know that you were wrong
You wish that you could undo
Faded in the light, the fadin' lights

So tell me, baby, you feel that?

And this is what it comes to
Yeah, this is what it comes to
