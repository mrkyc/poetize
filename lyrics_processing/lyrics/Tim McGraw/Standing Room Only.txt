I get so mad at things that don't matter way too much
I let the way back whens and my old friends scatter like they were dust
I get to chasin' that rainbow pot of gold right into the pourin' rain
With nothin' to show for it, standin' there soakin' wet
Lookin' up, shakin' my fist as the thunder rolls
Now and then on nights like this, I catch a thunderbolt

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only

I wanna take my grudges and my old regrets, and let 'em go
I wanna learn how to say a lot more yes and a lot less no
Girl, I wanna dance and shout and love out loud, and come alive
Don't wanna be the guy too cool to laugh and too scared to cry

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only

Stop judging my life by my possessions
Start thinking 'bout how many headlights will be in my procession

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only

Standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only
