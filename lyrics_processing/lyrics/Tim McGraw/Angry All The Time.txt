Here we are
What is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids who have a way
Of gettin' on with their lives
And I'm not old
But I'm gettin' a whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy
I've got to get away

The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time

Our boys are strong now
The spittin' image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past
What you have become
And I remember
Every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with
Is memories of the way you used to be

Twenty years have came and went
Since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back
To the one I was before
And, God, it hurts me to think of you
'Fore the light in your eyes was gone
And sometimes I don't know why
This old world can't leave well enough alone

The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
