Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I miss back when
