I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
Well, she picked me up in that red ragtop
We were free of the folks and hidin' from the cops
On a summer night, runnin' all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please, don't stop"

Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother to be
For two weeks (Ooh)
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild (Ooh)
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please, don't stop
Loving me"

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end (In the end)
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time, drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me
