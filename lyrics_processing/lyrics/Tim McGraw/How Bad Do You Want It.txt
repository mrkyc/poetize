Robert Johnson went to the crossroads, so the legend goes
He left with his guitar and the devil took his soul, the devil took his soul

Been out here on this highway
Breathing diesel smoke
Driving hard for hours
Trying to make that Memphis show
People always ask me
"Son what does it take
To reach out and touch your dreams?"
To them I always say

Are you hungry
Are you thirsty
Is it a fire that burns you up inside
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Because if you want it all
You have got to lay it all out on the line

I get to make my living
Doing what I love
Every night I give my heart and soul
Sometimes that is not enough
But brother, if you are like me
Looking down that road
Be careful of that wild wind, son
Sometimes it do not let go

Can you feel it
Can you taste it
Can you hear it knocking at your door
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Because if you want it all
You have got to lay it all out on the line

There is always a price you pay no matter what you do
If you are going to climb that mountain to the top
It always comes down to
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Because if you want it all
You have got to lay it all out on the line
