Tour bus, studio, and the fans
What's it all forrrrr?
Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims
What's it all forrrrr?
To feed my family and my friends
What's it all forrrrr?
To change your world the best I can

From N.Y.C
Born in Brooklyn, but live in Budget Queens
The natives call it Beijing
Jabroods(?) get they back on dollar codeine
I've been burnin it down
On them benches in Carlisle
That's where I'll be
If you wanna come and battle to the beat

What's it all forrrrr?
Tour bus, studio, and the fans
What's it all forrrrr?
Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims
What's it all forrrrr?
To feed my family and my friends
What's it all forrrrr?

I spit razor, I come hard
Timbs and hoodies, I rip bars
I'm a rock star, from the boulevard
Where it be fat with awesome cars
I can stand the pain the rain cause (?)
But I'm calloused, bruised, and scarred, livin in the barn
With the snake, the cat, the rat and the dog
Stay strapped with the mac, the gat, and the log
What's it all forrrrr?

(Mother-uhh-fuckers!) One breath away from havin a asthma attack

This is Bazaar Royale
Bloodline, Def Jam (what?) From the "Cradle 2 the Grave"

You know my motto, let's get violent!
Let's get violent!
