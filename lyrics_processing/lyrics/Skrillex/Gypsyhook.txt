Just another gypsy-hook
Tripping on that dick you rode
In the stinking piss in which I abode
Where I slit the mores of my mothers throat
(Rotten to me, rotten to me)
Oh no
Most of us, the mulch in the black of the sea
The lust you dug into my back straight jacked me clean
The bird "hurt" that perched atop out heads
In the slumming muck I call my bed
(The slumming muck I call my bed)
(Rotten to me)

Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Oh woah
Rotten to me, rotten to me
Rotten to...

Just another gypsy-hook
Choking on that dick you throat
In a kiddies world, parked in the back
Smoke on the broke-back we rode
Plunder and pillage our village
Burn it to the ground
You bitch-hound, my mirror moan
(Rotten to me, rotten to me)
Oh no
Songs we sway froze our souls
Reminisce mock-bliss bottles thrown
You lush, posh pig, the nails you dig
Straight jack-tax my back holes
Behind your willowing waltz, I wait in your wake
For the sake of our hearts that wither and shake
The paceless race, the rot between your legs
Our faces that we cloak

Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Rotten to me! Rotten to me! (Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na)
Woah
Rotten to me, rotten to me, yeah
Rotten to me, rotten to me, oh
Rotten to me, rotten to me, woah
Rotten to me, rotten to me
