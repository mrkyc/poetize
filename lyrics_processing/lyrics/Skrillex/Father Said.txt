Find me on Broadway
Find me on Broadway

Back in the cut, break-back
Cement 40 oz, so minimal in our heads
Drown drone beggars, where are you, glory
Under the bitter sky we play?
Back in the past, we were born to suck so diligently
Be the concrete floor or this cougar whore
You can't trust the dust that's been given

Bring me close to love
Would you give me a reason to believe?
Trapped by the world
Would you give a reason to believe?

Father said
"You can find me on Broadway, find me on Broadway"
Father told me
"You can find me on Broadway, find me on Broadway"

So many ways to flip our heads upside down
It's a fellow eclipse of a bit fist
We cry wolf under the hemorrhaging crown
Back in the past, we were born to suck so diligently
Our lips are not to be closed under the shade of your sniveling
Taking in all the wind of your jump-cliff and whisper ever so

Bring me close to love
Would you give me a reason to believe?
Trapped by the world
Would you give a reason to believe?

"You can find me on Broadway, find me on Broadway"
Father told me
"You can find me on Broadway, find me on Broadway"

Oh, I crave that over-the-hill we pave
Here I am, will you shun me now? No
The love you you've claimed was just a whisper
Here I am, now shun me
Oh, I crave that over-the-hill we pave
Here I am, will you shun me now? No
The love you you've claimed was just a whisper
Here I am, now shun me
