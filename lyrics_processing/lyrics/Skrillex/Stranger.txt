Here in the dark I can see who you are
I see it so clearly
The beat of my heart just stops and starts
Whenever you're near me
I just gotta thank you, all the love I gave ya
Came and you took it all away
And now there's no pain
There's everything to gain here
Now that I'm lost I think I'll stay

In hell
There's comfort in these flames and, I don't feel a thing
In hell
I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger
(Become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger)
(Become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger)
Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger
(Become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger, become a stranger)
Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger
Stran--
(I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger)
(You'll become a stranger)
I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger
(You'll become a stranger)
