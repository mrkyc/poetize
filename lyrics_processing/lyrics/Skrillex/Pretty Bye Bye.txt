I know you are trouble
But I can't seem to get away
All the pleasure, all the pain
Palm trees swaying in the rain
All those times we stayed in
The way the smoke would fill the room
And we'd be dancing in the clouds
Like we had nothing to lose

I haven't heard from you, it's been a long time
Know that I hurt you, it stays on my mind
Let me make it right
We never said goodbye
What you been thinking 'bout?
Know that we're worth the fight
So let me make it right
I might have had my doubts
Said some things I regret
If I could take it back
I wouldn't hesitate
We never said goodbye
Never said goodbye, baby
What you been thinking 'bout
You've been thinking 'bout lately?
Know we're worth the fight
Know we're worth the fight
So let me make it right
It's been a long time
