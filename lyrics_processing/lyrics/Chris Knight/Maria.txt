Right here is where I get off
It's been a little while since I seen her but I don't think love is lost
Thank you for the whiskey mister ain't had none in so long
Thank you for the ride, thank you for the whiskey
Thank you for the song
Maria you hear me coming up the road
Maria your new man's on his way home
I need a chance to fix the things I've torn apart
Where I left off's the only place to start
So take those doubting chains off of your lonely heart
For this thankful man comin' in out of the dark
I believe I'm a stronger man for the suffering and hard time
They put those steel bars around me but they never got her off my mind
Fought my way through the walls of hell just to see her again
Lord thank you for the stars, thank you for the moonlight
Thank you for the beer
Maria hear me coming up the road
Maria your new man's on his way home
I need a chance to fix the things I've torn apart
Where I left off's the only place to start
So take those doubting chains off of your lonely heart
For this thankful man comin' in out of the dark
You might also likeWell I never got lost till the day I left your side
And I've paid the cost of bein on a long dark ride
Ah Maria your fires leading me home tonight
Thank you for the love, thank you for the laughter
Thank you for the light
Maria you hear me coming up the road
Maria your new man's on his way home
I need a chance to fix the things I've torn apart
Where I left off's the only place to start
So take those doubting chains off of your lonely heart
For this thankful man comin' in out of the dark
