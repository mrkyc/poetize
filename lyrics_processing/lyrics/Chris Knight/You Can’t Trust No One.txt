People in the valley hate the people on the hill
And I've been hearin' some shootin', so far nobody been killed
People don't seem to wanna get along, wonder if they ever will
People, won't you come together, we've all got to live as one
I ain't right sure what that means but don't you reckon it sounds like fun
Everybody pack your picnic lunch and everybody pack your gun
'Cause you can't trust no one
Well, I never kept my doors locked up, let my stock run free
I was roundin' up my hogs last week and I was missin' two or three
It kinda hurt my feelings that somebody would steal from me
They'd just come and ask me, well, I'd give 'em one for free
People, won't you come together, we've all got to live as one
I ain't right sure what that means but I reckon it sounds like fun
Everybody pack your picnic lunch and everybody pack your gun
'Cause you can't trust no one
Came home from the town hall meetin', hate to say it didn't go so well
Finally told 'em all I was goin' home and they could all go to hell
I took my children in my arms, gonna keep 'em close to me
The world just keeps on changin', I don't like what I see
Now the city's burnt to ashes, the fields are still on fire
The valley's dark and lonesome, the hills are cold and bare
A lot of folks are givin' in, a lot of folks are gone
Other folks are diggin' in, tryin' to carry on

I ain't right sure what that means but I reckon it sounds like fun
Everybody pack your picnic lunch and everybody pack your gun
'Cause you can't trust no one
