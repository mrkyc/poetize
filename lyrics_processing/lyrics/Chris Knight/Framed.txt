The news was out on the radio
That a shot was fired the night before
And a local man lay dead on the floor
And the dust was flying in the lumberyard
Lights were flashing on two black cars
I said, sheriff I ain't done nothing wrong
He just knocked me down and put the handcuffs on
I was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say
Now don't be running down my name
I was framed
Barbara Jo cried through the glass
At the murder trial I seen her last
I loved that woman but now she's free
She turned away when they sentenced me
And the guilty man ain't never told
Ten years later they put me on the road
And I'll always say that I got screwed
I'm a brand new man with the same attitude
You might also likeI was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say
Now don't be running down my name
I was framed
Now the guilty man paid long ago
He's the same man who got laid low
When he took my wife he was hell bound
Even if I did gun him down
I was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say
Now don't be running down my name
I was framed
