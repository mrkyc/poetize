Well, I'ma gat-totin', pistol-holdin' nigga on yo damn street
Stompin', jumpin', bumpin', and we crunk off in this damn thing
Throwin' them 'bows up at these hoes, they screamin', they bleedin' from they nose
But when we start to swing, we make them niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thing, we be deep off in yo party
Crime Mob niggas get it started, Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
So, if a nigga come and run they mouth just like a ho
Punch them dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'

Yeah, we knuckin' and buckin' and ready to fight
I betcha I'ma throw them things, so haters best to think twice
See, me, I ain't nothing nice, and Crime Mob, it ain't no stopping
It be like Saddam Hussein, Hitler, and Osama bin Laden
Now they steady gum poppin' and I am acting a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this Crime Mob crew

Knuck if you buck, boy
Jumpin' off from on the stage, throwin' bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas throwing rocks, knocking down the barricade
Ellenwood, we be too deep, and M.O.B. is too elite
Flawless niggas, lawless, you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets bustin' constantly, ravaging yo city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered across the concrete
Knuckin' if you buckin', you'll be duckin' if you get too close
In my eyes, you wasn't wise, I think it's time I knuck you, ho

I come in the club, shakin' my dreads
Throwing these bows and bustin' these heads
Bitch irrelevant, step to my residence
Best to back up 'for I send you a lick
I been in drama and committin' a crime
Not leaving a trace, not leaving a line
We knuckin' and bucking 'cause I got a nine
I'll blow you away cause you wasting my time
Stupid ass niggas, I know what to do
I waste yo ass, you fuck with my crew
I'm through with you haters, so watch what you do
You talking 'bout me, then I'm talkin' to you
You buckin' on us and we leave you in plastic
You bustin' on me and that shit gon' get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing out here
I target your city, but you cannot tell
Knuck if you buck, boy, but you betta come equipped
I got some shit off in my trunk that's gonna make yo body flip
Hollow tips, bustin' out the rib soon as I hit the do'
Anybody make a false move, dead bodies on the flo'
Fuckin' with no hoes, ain't never been no lame
Ain't never been no pussy, niggas scared to throw them things, mane
Crime Mob niggas up in this bitch, Break Bread Records I represent
Fuckin' with them HP niggas, you 'bout to get yo wig split

Knuck if you buck, boy
Knuck if you buck, boy
Knuck if you buck, boy
