LIL JAY:
I got ma sign in the air
But these niggas unaware
That we never gave a f**k we gives a damn if you don't care
I'm with my niggas shakin hair shakin dreads in this bitch
Them otha niggas in the club dat be scared talkin shit
Hiding right behind they homies hesitated to throw up signs
Ima put it in his face and slap that boy f**kn blind
I'm a player on da grind
Ella' Jay don't give a shit
See me crunk off in the club
Throw ma sign up like this
PRINCESS:
A Throw yo sign in the air
Let them niggas know what set yo claim

And where the best is known to hang
In the club crunk

Quick to buck up on a hoe
Cuz East side bitches be the baddest

You know the deal
And talkin shit is wastin time
So let it be known
That I'm about mine
And I am not scared to throw up dat sign bitch

And flip a middle finger for a hater up in ma face

So when you reppin yo sets
Yo city, Hood, and Yo trap
Just keep you mouth close
And dem eyes open and watch yo back
