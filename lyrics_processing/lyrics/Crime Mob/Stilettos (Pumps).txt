Stiletto pumps in the club
Stiletto pumps in the club, get crunk
(Princess)
Homegurl bow down when you see me because I'm comin up fresh
Ride wit' the realist ya feel me? So you should call me the best
I can look jazzy, act nasty wit' my stilleto hills on
But if a ho say somethin, try me then her hair will get thrown
I'm turnin' heads left and right soon as he see one foot
Step out the car, strollin' through the club
Then I make my way right by the bar, yeah yo nigga eyein' me
I take 'em from ya so watch out, I'm lookin' jazzy actin' classy
But I got a sexy mouth, hair is done and nails are too
And I match from head to toe, then to top it off
I'm rockin' 6-inch black stilettos ho
Different color everyday that's just to match the mood I'm in
Silver, red, grey, and black lookin' this good should be a sin
(Chorus)
Stiletto pumps in the club
Whoeva thought that these girls will get crunk?(x2)
We rockin stilettos ho(x8)
(Diamond)
Stilettos on my feet, I'm sexy wit' a mug
I'm buckin' on yall hatas just to see if yall crunk
We swangin' throwin' bows, cuz' yall boys thought we soft
I'm knockin' heads off, I'm the baddest of 'em all
Makin' niggas fall, mane they fightin' and tusslin'
Club owner scared that the gurls might start bussin'
We crunk and we thuggin', we takin' it public
This is for the gurls in the trap steady hustlin'
You might also like(Chorus)

I know you want a second look, but pictures isn't necessary
Diamond be my name and by the looks gurl you ain't even ready
Wit' my dickies two piece and my hair cocked to the other side
Pink and white interior inside my drop top Chevy ride
Killin' all these hatas cuz' they know I got stilettos on
Yo nigga tried to holla, but the pimpin' here is way too strong
I'm known for breakin' pockets, I can walk it like I talk it
Got some Prada in my closet, can't no hatin' heffa stop it
I'mma put this shit up on the map, cuz' ATL is where I be
I got my gurl Aisha and the Princess on a shoppin' spree
I get 'em for they goodies, and get richer ain't no pitty
I'm the reason why they hurtin', I'm the baddest in the city
Yeah ho..
(Chorus)
