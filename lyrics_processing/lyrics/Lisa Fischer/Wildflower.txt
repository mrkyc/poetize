Let the rain fall down upon her (Listen)
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
People used to laugh at me when I was a little girl
I guess they didn't understand
But when you're young and all alone
You make up things for the things that are missing
Ooh, how I used to love to dress up in my mother's clothes
It made me feel like somebody
I'd pretend I was the prettiest girl at the dance
And all the boys loved me
And I was gonna be a big success, hmm
But of course I never got that dress for my very own
I didn't do half the things I thought I'd do
But I guess the good part of my life is that I did find you
And you know
Now when I look into a little girl's eyes, it's like a mirror
And I remember, I remember

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her little shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in, in her ears
You might also like
Let her cry, she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
Growing wild, hoo

Be careful how you touch her for she will wake up
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you see life through her eyes
You won't believe the way she's always paying
For a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, it's all she knows
(That she knows, she knows, she knows)

Let her cry, oh my, 'cause she's a lady
Let her sing, sing 'cause she is a child (She's a child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a sweet and gentle flower growing wild

And if by chance you get to hold her
Hold her for a time
And with your new possession, what would you do?
I would pick her up from the garden to be mine

Each time her little shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in her ears
(Bong, bong; bong, bong, bong, bong)

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her sing for she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a sweet and gentle flower growing wild

And I feel the same
Just a sweet and gentle flower growing wild
But no one's to blame
