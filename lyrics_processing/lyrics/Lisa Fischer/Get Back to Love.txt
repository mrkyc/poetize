Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Hear me, boy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's a love, yeah

I wanna get close tonight
The way that we used to be
I want you to stop on by (Come by)
I need you here next to me, me

Tonight is a cool clear night
And oh how I love talking with you, baby
Tonight has gotta be the night
That all this talking ends and we love again

Get back to love (Get back, get back)
I can't wait to get started
I fell apart when we parted
Let's get back to love (Get back, get back)
All I wanna do is to see you

I used to be scared of love, yeah
Afraid that it would not stay
I wouldn't know what to do (I don't know)
If ever you went away, hey
You might also like
Breaking up is a sad, sad thing
And I cry so hard thinkin' 'bout you, baby
I do try to do the best I can
'Cause I know I'm ready for the second chance, ooh

Get back to love (Get back, get back)
I can't wait to get started
I fell apart when we parted
Let's get back to love (Get back, get back)
All I wanna do is to see you


Baby, just one embrace, ooh
I want your love, sugar, sweetie, honey
So I pray a little bit each day
All I got to do is to be with you, ooh

Get back to love (Get back, get back)
I can't wait to get started
I fell apart when we parted
Let's get back to love, get back (Get back, get back)
All I wanna do is to see you, yeah
Get back to love (Get back, get back)
I can't wait to get started
I fell apart when we parted
Back to love (Get back, get back)
Get back (Get back) to love, yeah
