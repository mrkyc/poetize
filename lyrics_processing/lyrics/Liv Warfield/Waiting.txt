To have you in my arms again
No matter what the test or trial
I'll be there, to give you my warm embrace

See what I see is you, sharing your life with me
And all the things that come along with having a family
There's no question that I, I saw you in my dreams
Longing to be the one your soul might need cause

I, I'll be waiting for someone, one like you
To, love me baby and to see
See me through

Through all the ups and downs of life
This journey will sure 'nough bring
There's no question that I, saw you in my dreams
Longing to be the one your soul might need cause
