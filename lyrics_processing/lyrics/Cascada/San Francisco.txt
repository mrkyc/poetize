Yeah
Are you goin' to San Francisco?

I'll take you back to 1969
Let's hit the city of freedom like old times
It's gettin' dirty underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me countin' the butterflies
One, two, three, let's bring it on
Keep on dancin' in the streets of love
French kissin' on JFK Drive
Till we crash at the beach where we watch the sun rise

Tell me what you're waiting for
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby, take me back to the city of love (Right)
To the place that I've been dreamin' of (San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Everybody go ho-oh, oh-oh)
See Cascada LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
It's 10 PM, gettin' ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's gettin' high
Cruisin' down Broadway, you on my side
Pullin' over my pink Rover at the Hungry I
One, two, three, let's bring it on
DJ, play my favourite beats all night long
Poppin' some bottles, Champagne, red wine
And we both giddyup on the rooftop and watch the city lights

Tell me what you're waiting for
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby, take me back to the city of love (Right)
To the place that I've been dreamin' of (San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Everybody go ho-oh, oh-oh)

(Whoa)
(Yeah)
(Woo)
(Woo)
(Are you goin' to San Francisco?)
We're playing songs of life like it's '69
We sing and dance under the neon lights (San Francisco)
Stars shine so bright over the city tonight
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby, take me back to the city of love (Right)
To the place that I've been dreamin' of (San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Everybody go ho-oh, oh-oh)

Come on, take me back to the city of love
To the place, the place that I've, I've been dreaming of (San Francisco)
So wake me up in San Francisco
