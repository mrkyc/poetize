I see you comb your hair, and gimme that grin
It's making me spin now, spinnin' within
Before I melt like snow, I say "Hello, how do you do!"
(How do you do!)
I love the way you undress now, baby, begin
Do your caress? Honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue-eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines through
How do you do! (How do you do!)

How do you do (Do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you to say, "Bye, bye bye?"
How do you do (Do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you to say, "Bye, bye bye?"

How do you do! How do you do!
How do you do! How do you do!
How do you do! How do you do!

I see you in that chair with the perfect skin
Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know, did you say, "Hello, how do you do!"
(How do you do!)

Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal
When I get old, I will wait outside your house
'Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal

How do you do (Do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you to say, "Bye, bye bye?"
Oh, how do you do (Do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you to say, "Bye, bye bye?"

How do you do (Do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
