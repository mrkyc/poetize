(Oh) Turn up the music, let's get out on the floor
I like to move it, come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control (Ah-ah)
There's people watching me (Ah-ah), I never miss a beat

Steal the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose, like an overdose)

Oh, oh, evacuate the dance floor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dance floor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

(Oh) My body's aching, system overload (Overload)
Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me, I'm intoxicated, take in the show (Ah-ah)
It's got me hypnotized (Ah-ah), everybody step aside
