I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply, do
I will be strong, I will be faithful

'Cause I'm counting on a new beginning, a reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven, then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of...

The highest power
In lonely hours, the tears devour you
