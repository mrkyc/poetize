I-I-I just can't get enough

I am not a beauty queen, driving in a limousine
I'm a girl, but don't call me baby
Who the f**k needs VIP, live a life in luxury
I don't care, so just call me crazy (Can you give it out?)

Don't stop, just take it to the limit
Watch me, boy, it's spinning around this time
Hush, hush, running to the night
Feel alive!

I just can't get enough, when I'm with you
'Cause your fever makes me feel so good
Turn it up, boy, you make your move
See, I'm burning, but it feels so good
Can't get enough, when I'm with you
You got fever, but it feels so good
Turn it up, baby, make your move
Keep me burning 'cause it feels so good

I don't need no superman, tryna tell me who I am
Know it all's a driving me crazy (Crazy)
Nothing ever is for sure, I can't take this anymore
All I want is yes or no, baby (Can you give it out?)
