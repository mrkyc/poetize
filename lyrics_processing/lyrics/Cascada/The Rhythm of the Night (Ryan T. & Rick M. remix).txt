This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
You could put some joy upon my face
Oh sunshine in an empty place
Take me to turn to and babe I'll make you stay
Oh i can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go, each time i hear you say
This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
Won't you teach me how to love and learn
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me and burn and let me hold your hand
I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me
No reason to repent
