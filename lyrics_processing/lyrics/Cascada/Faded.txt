Faded, hated, hated
Faded, hated, hated
Faded, hated, hated
Faded, hated, hated

You never take, take the time to really look
Look at the one, the one I really am
You try to fit, to fit me in a perfect box
You let me slip between the cracks

Now I've faded into someone else
Made me someone I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Yeah, I'm faded
My true color's gone, like a picture nobody sees

I'll bet you don't, don't even know my favorite song
You tell me how, how I should wear my hair
You wanna change everything I ever was
Try to erase me, 'til I'm not there ('Til I'm not there)

Now I've faded into someone else
Made me someone I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Yeah, I'm faded
My true color's gone, like a picture nobody sees
Now I've faded like I never was
'Til I don't even know myself (Know myself)
Yeah, I'm faded into what you want
But I'm not takin' it too well

I don't wanna be your little picture perfect pretty girl
Who's got nothing to say (To say)
I'm not gonna wait around
Let you run my whole life down, so you can watch me fade away
(Faded, hated)
You try to fit, fit me in a perfect box
(Faded, hated)
You try to fit, fit me in a perfect box
You try to fit, fit me in a perfect box (Perfect box)
(Faded, hated)
You let me slip (Let me slip, let me slip)
Between the cracks (Between the cracks)

Now I've faded into someone else
Made me someone I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Yeah, I'm faded
My true color's gone, like a picture nobody sees
Yeah, I've faded like I never was
'Til I don't even know myself (Know myself)
Now I'm faded into what you want
But I'm not takin' it too well
