Everytime I hear your name
Everytime I hear your name

When you walked away from me
And said your last goodbye
I never thought that six months on
You'd still be in my life
I have tried to forget
Get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run, I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby, with a single word
I can see your face again
'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Everytime I hear your name
Everytime I hear your name
Everytime I hear your name

Now I'm sure you've found a girl
To fill my empty space (This empty space)
But I'm stuck with the love that we shared
That time just can't erase

I have tried to forget, get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run, I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away (Pain won't go away)

'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby, with a single word
I can see your face again
'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
And I'm taken back to what we had
Everytime I hear your name
I can run, I can hide from this feeling inside
Everytime I hear your name
I can run, I can hide from this feeling inside

'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
Baby, with a single word
I can see your face again
'Cause everytime I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
