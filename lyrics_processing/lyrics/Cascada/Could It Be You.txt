Close my eyes
I try to hide
I'm listening to my voice inside
Why don't you tell me right or wrong?
I need to know where I belong
For all the days I ran away
I never dare to ask me who could I be
Who can bring back the love that's inside me? (Inside me)

Could it be you, or do I lose my way?
I'm here, but colorblind
Could It be you, or do I break away?
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight, stop the first fight
And see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you?
Somebody tell me if it's true, I don't have a clue
Could it be you?

Too many things said and done
Sure if you could be the one
To dry the tears I left behind
To chase these demons off my mind
I see your face, touch your skin
Is this a fight we both can't win?
Sometimes the truth is miles apart
But it's hard to break your heart

Baby, I don't wanna waste your love
Though it's hard to just walk on
Well, will this search be never ending?
Where do I belong, -ong?

Could it be you, or do I lose my way?
I'm here, but colorblind
Could It be you, or do I break away?

Somebody tell me if it's true, I don't have a clue
Could it be you?
Maybe it is me
Blind to see
