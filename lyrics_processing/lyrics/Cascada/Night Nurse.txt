It's critical
'Cause your body's gonna rock just like a chemical
Makes you bouncing around the block just like an outlaw
We're gonna take it to the top, twelve o'clock (That's it)
Guess who's on the night shift?

'Cause tonight, I'm working over time
Oh, are you ready to cross the line?
I'll treat you until the break of dawn
You're not alone

But I could be your remedy, oh-oh
I don't wanna be your lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
