I've got a feeling you've been in and out of dreaming
Sleeping off the whiskey and pills
Time you've been stealing, all the nights that you've been
Seemingly mistaking for mysterious thrills

They say there's no wrong way
With every move we make tonight
They say there's no wrong way
Who knows if we'll get it right?

So I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not tryna figure it out, just let it be
I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause imperfect love like this makes perfect sense to me

Maybe there's a reason for the feelings I'm receiving
That I can't comprehend at all
It's our mess and yes I guess we don't need to address
That complicated love never folds

They say there's no wrong way
With every move we make tonight
They say there's no wrong way
Who knows if we'll get it right?

I'm not tryna figure it out, just let it be
I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause imperfect love like this makes perfect sense to me

I don't want anything to change
(Who would I be without you? Who would I be without you?)
Hearts like ours only beat one way
(Who would I be without you? Who would I be without you?)
I don't want anything to change
(Who would I be without you? Who would I be without you?)
Hearts like ours only beat one way, oh
(Who would I be without you? Who would I be without you?)

So I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not tryna figure it out, just let it be
I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause imperfect love like this...
I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not tryna figure it out, just let it be
I'm not tryna figure it out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause imperfect love like this makes perfect sense to me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Who would I be without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Who would I be without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
