You had a burden, I couldn't cure
I wasn't certain, I wasn't sure
I didn't know what I should do
To help you feel better about you

You were the whisper in my heart
The breath they took away
The answer to my prayer
I prayed for every day
You were the understanding
Life's hard and it is rough
The falling and the landing
In this miracle of love
And I wish you could've seen you
The way that I do
The way that I do

But you never could escape it
Those demons that you have
That smile, you couldn't fake it
At least, no way that I could tell
And it's so hard to crawl out from under
A rock as heavy as it was
But I hope you know I loved you
I hope you understood because
You might also like
You were the whisper in my heart
The breath they took away
The answer to my prayer
The one I prayed for every day
You were the understanding
Life's hard and it is rough
You're the falling and the landing
In this miracle of love
And I wish you could've seen you
The way that I do

Oh, and you were always
My beautiful one, hey yeah
Oh, and you were always
My beautiful one
Go gently from me now
Gently from me now
Beautiful one

If there is any consolation
If there is any good in this at all
It is an honour to have known you
To be the one that you could call
You were the whisper in my heart
The breath they took away
The answer to my prayer
The one I prayed for every day
You were the understanding
Life's hard and it is rough
You were the falling and the landing
In this miracle of love

You were the last thing that I thought of
Before I fell asleep
The one thing I could hold on to
I guess I couldn't keep
You were the understanding
Life's hard and it is rough
You were the falling and the landing
In this miracle of love

You were a miracle of love
You were a miracle of love
You were a miracle of love
You were a miracle of love
You were, and I wish you could've seen you
The way that I do
