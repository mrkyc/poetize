Sometimes the days escape me
Sometimes I lose control
Too many contradictions
Between my heart and soul
Sometimes the devil scolds me
Shoots me down in flames
Through the dark, you find me
You take me home again

Safe with you
Safe with you

They can throw me to the lions
I'll be Jack against the giants
'Cause honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you
The earth can shake beneath me
Anxiety won't beat me
Honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you

These 3 AM sensations
This fear and these unknowns
Cold-hearted complications
City streets alone
And this platform edge, new roses
Some trains never arrive
Love is a phone vibration
Love is your voice to mine
You might also like
Safe with you

They can throw me to the lions (Oh)
I'll be Jack against the giants
'Cause honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)
The earth can shake beneath me (Oh)
Anxiety won't beat me
Honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And through the dark, you find me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And you take me home again
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Love is a phone vibration
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Love is your voice to mine

They can throw me to the lions
I'll be Jack against the giants
Honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)
The earth can shake beneath me (Oh)
Anxiety won't beat me
Honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)
They can throw me to the lions (Oh)
I'll be Jack against the giants
'Cause honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)
The earth can shake beneath me (Oh)
Anxiety won't beat me
Honey, I'm safe with you, safe with you (Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
They can throw me to the lions
I'll be Jack against the giants
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I'm safer with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The earth can shake beneath me
Anxiety won't beat me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
