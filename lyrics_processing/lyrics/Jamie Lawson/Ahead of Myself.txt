Don't wanna get ahead of myself
But isn't this grand?
Don't wanna make a fool of myself
Is it already planned?
There you go making promises you're never gonna keep
Don't wanna make a fool of myself
I'm already in too deep

Don't wanna get ahead of myself
But isn't this swell?
Don't wanna make a fool of myself
Like a clown, I just fell
There you go making promises you really shouldn't say
Don't wanna get ahead of myself
I think I just found a way

If you dig a little deeper
Way down to your soul
You may find a way to sweep her off her feet
Let the evening come and go

Don't wanna get ahead of myself
But isn't she fine?
I don't wanna make a fool of myself
Like she's already mine
There you go making promises you never should've thought
Don't wanna get ahead of myself
I think that I've just been caught
You might also like
Oh, if you dig a little deeper
Way, way, way down into your soul
You may find a way to sweep her off her feet
Oh, let the evening come and go

Didn't wanna get ahead of myself, I think I just did
I didn't wanna make a fool of myself
Like a love-struck idiot kid
There I go making promises I never could've kept
I didn't wanna get ahead of myself
And then I look

If you dig a little deeper
Way, way, way, way down to your soul
Oh, you may find a way to sweep her off her feet
Oh, let the evening, let the evening come and go
If you dig a little deeper
Way, way, way, way down to your soul
You may find a way to sweep her off her feet
Oh, let the evening, let the evening come and go

I get ahead of myself
I get ahead of myself
