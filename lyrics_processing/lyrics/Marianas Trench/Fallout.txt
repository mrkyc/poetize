An empty room, I'm empty too
Everything reminds me of you
So many things I shouldn't have missed
The more that I push and the more you resist
It's easy to say it's for the best
When you want more while you leave me with less
I know you're fine but what do I do?
I know you're fine but what do I do?

I'm awake and trying
While you're sleeping like a babe beside him
I'm on the ledge while you're so
Goddamn polite and composed
And I know you see me
And you're making it look so easy
What comes and goes I'd go without

I know you're fine but what if I

Well now there's him, and now there's me
The secrets you give and the secrets you keep
And nevertheless it's never your let
It's more that I give and the less that I get
Don't tell me to fight, to fight for you
After this long, I shouldn't have to
I know you're fine, but what do I do?
I know you're fine but what do I do?

I'm awake, and trying
While you're sleeping like a babe beside him
I'm on the ledge while you're so
Goddamn polite and composed
I know you see me
And you're making it look so easy
What comes and goes I'd go without

I know you're fine but what if I
