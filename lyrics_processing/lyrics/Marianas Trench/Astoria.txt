Not ready yet, not for you
Don't want to know my darkest lows
My blackest pitch, murder of crows
Feels far from home close to the veil
Goodbye mother's fairy tale
Never after will suffice
When star-crossed lovers take their life
Now we begin, a harlequin
Kaleidoscope in spite of when
Top of the world to lowest worth
From blackest pearl to slow rebirth
Don't remind me what the price is
When left to my own devices
'Cause I'll find out in all due time
What happens to never say die
Yeah, I'll see
Whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
But it's gonna be a long year
Till the hospital can find hope in me
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria?
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria?
Do you know everything happens
It happens in threes

Through names obscured
And speeches slurred
What's another bridge burned?
I'm on my own
You came alone
All dressed up in bad news
I know you've been hurt too
This would be the wrong move
And maybe we should leave soon
You can lay with me while you think of him
Drown our sorrows deep in each other's skin
I touch your face while I think of her
I won't raise my lips to the way we were
Bite my neck while you say his name
I will scratch your back to forget her face
Our regret tastes sweet through a soft liqueur
We can raise our lips to the way we were
On a good day I'm the bad news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
On a good day I'm the bad news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
Hey, ever just say fuck it? (Good day I'm the bad news for the wrong girl with the right wounds)
Maybe I'll drink this all away in buckets (Good day I'm the bad news for the wrong girl with the right wounds)
Oh, hey, might as well say fuck it (Good day I'm the bad news for the wrong girl with the right wounds)
I want to hurt myself until I love it (Good day I'm the bad news for the wrong girl with the right wounds)
I shoulda known you're not alone
When you take somebody home
And the little deaths are a little less
Even if just for a moment
Hey, let's all say fuck it (Good day I'm the bad news for the wrong girl with the right wounds)
I'm gonna make my mother so proud of it
Hope fades away in Astoria
I'll see
Whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
But it's going to be a long year (A long year)
Till the hospital might find hope in me
Astoria
Astoria
Astoria
Let the melody save me Astoria
Let the melody save me Astoria
The quid pro quos that we'll compose
