You say, "Sometimes it's like I hardly know you"
And maybe there's some things I never showed you
Sometimes you're certain but just can't get it working at all
You say to yourself somebody better
Will understand you more than I ever
I'll shake his hand and smile and say I understand, while I do
That don't mean I don't think about you

I know we said it's just as well
That I won't keep, keep you for myself
But I don't wanna see you happier with somebody else

Oh, why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?

I know you need someone too
This just feels so soon

I know some things should just stay broken
I'm well aware this should remain unspoken
But I've been working on the things that I was learning all wrong, oh
I know sometimes I only twist you
And maybe I'm too proud to say I missed you
But what if here and now I tell you that I'm all figured out?
Or maybe I just like how that sounds

I know we said it's just as well
That I won't keep, keep you for myself
But I don't wanna see you happier
With somebody else

Oh, can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?

I know you need someone too
This just feels so
And I know it seems beneath me
But sometimes it's not so easy
To wish you well and let you go

And I said it's just as well
That I just can't keep you for myself
I don't wanna see you happier
With somebody else

Oh, lo-lonely, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?
Why can't you just be
Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-
This just feels so, this just feels so
Feels so soon
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)
Why can't you be
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)
Why can't you be
(Lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, lo-lonely?)

This just feels so, this just feels so
This just feels so soon
