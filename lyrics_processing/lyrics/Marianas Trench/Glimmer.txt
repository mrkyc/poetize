I saw you in black and white
Bathed in the city light
Got lost in the glare
I couldn't see you there, I couldn't see you there and I
Got a torch I've been carrying
Hangs heavy on a thin
A thin line that we're made of
Something we're afraid of, something we're afraid to try

Can we forgive and forget?
Can we forgive and forget?
Can we forgive and forget?
And can we lay it to rest
Can we catch our breath?
Can we catch our breath?

I throw my head back, heart under attack
Straight through the chest like a thunderclap
You can burn too bright, you can burn too bright to see
With all the lights out, shadow of a doubt
It's funny what you find when you go without
So keep the lights down low, keep the lights down low to see

Oh, I see a glimmer, glimmer
I can see a glimmer, glimmer
I can see a glimmer, glimmer
I can see a glimmer of, glimmer of, glimmer of us

Thirst got the best of us
Hurt took the rest of us
But tell me what does it mean
If we could never leave it? We can never leave it now
You've changed but it's not enough
And doubt is insidious
Creeps up on you softly
I can't get it off me, I can't get it off me now

Can we forgive and forget?
Can we forgive and forget?
Can we forgive and forget?
And can we lay it to rest
Can we catch our breath?
Can we catch our breath?

Glimmer, glimmer
I can see a glimmer, glimmer, glimmer
I can see a glimmer, yeah
