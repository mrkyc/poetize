I wake up tonight
Feeling paper thin and I'm paper white
You say, "Just come back to bed"
Voice sounds strange, but I soon forget
And your sad blue eyes like mine
Full of pity now, but I don't know why
The light dims without regret
Till now you're nothing more than a silhouette
But just hold quick you're fading right
In a cold trick of the light
I'm just so sick, I thought you might be here
But you di-disappear

Now I wake up and I forget that you were gone
A phantom limb is all that I am hanging on
So don't stop, no stopping it yet
What if the one true love's the only one that you get?
And you've been wishing but you don't know how to stay
And I've been broken but I'm better every day
So don't stop, no stopping it yet
What if the one true love's the only one that you get?

One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get

Lost and gone so fast
You get me every time but I live with that
I might do this to myself
Only made it worse but I just can't help
You know I get so attached
Listen every day till the dark is back
Now I pine for phantom pain
It's the only time that I see your face
So just hold quick you're fading right
In a cold trick of the light
I'm just so sick, I thought you'd might be here
But you di-disappear

Now I wake up and I forget that you were gone
A phantom limb is all that I am hanging on
So don't stop, no stopping it yet
What if the one true love's the only one that you get?
And you've been wishing but you don't know how to stay
And I've been broken but I'm better every day
So don't stop, no stopping it yet
What if the one true love's the only one that you get?

One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get
One love, one love, one love you get
What if you still feel me too still?
What if there was still a way of taking care of this?
What if I wake up tonight and you were real?
What if we could find a way to try to heal?
What if there's no stopping us yet?
What if the one true love's the only one that you get?
What if there was still a reason not to go?
What if there was still a little bit of hope?
So don't stop, no stopping it yet
What if the one true love's the only one that you get? (Love you get)

One love, one love you get
One love, one love you get
One love, (One love) one love you get (One love)
One love, (One love) one love you get
One love, one love you get
One love, one love you get
One love, (One love) one love you get (One love)
