I roam these halls, search the night
In hopes that I may see
A remnant trace, a glimpse of you
I stare into the deep
Saying, "I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know my love can be"
The deep stares back, speaks to me
"I know my love can be the killing kind"

What if I was wrong by never moving on?
I didn't realize who's gone
The ghost in me was true but you were haunted too just
Didn't see it all along
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
You should never be here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know my love can be the killing kind

Here and now, if this is it
Can't get out from under it
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
My love is the killing kind
There and then, I should have known
It was me all along
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
My love is the killing kind
My love is the killing kind
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here

Try and try to let you go
And I'll just disappear
Go down below where children go
And we all float down here
Singing, "I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know my love can be"
It gazes back and sings to me
"I know my love can be the killing kind"

What if I was wrong by never moving on?
I didn't realize who's gone
The ghost in me was true but you've been haunted too just
Didn't see it all along
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
You should never be here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know my love can be the killing kind

Here and now, if this is it
Can't get out from under it
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
My love is the killing kind
There and then, I should have known
It was me all along
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
My love is the killing kind
Oh
My love is the killing kind
Nevermore to leave here, nevermore to leave here
He-y!
Yeah!
Stirs of whispers trail and linger
You still haunt the corner of my heart
Stirs of whispers trail and linger
You still haunt the corners of my heart
Sing it for me baby, singing me to sleep
Singing, "Don't love the bottle but the bottle loves me"
One for the memory, two for the pain
Singing, "Don't love the bottle" with the deeper disdain
Sing it for me baby, singing me to sleep
Singing, "Don't love the bottle but the bottle loves me"
One for the memory, two for the pain
Singing, "Don't love the bottle" with the deeper disdain
Sing it for me baby, singing me to sleep
Singing, "Don't love the bottle but the bottle loves me"
One for the memory, two for the pain
Singing, "Don't love the bottle" with the deeper disdain
Sing it for me baby, singing me to sleep
Singing, "Don't love the bottle but the bottle loves me"
One for the memory, and hear the melody
I think of you
I dream of you
Evermore (Evermore)
Hey, do you hear me, do you hear me now?
On a midnight dreary
Stay, stay near me
Stay near me now
Oh yeah (Do you hear me?)
Don't you hear me?
Don't you hear me? (Do you hear me now?)
If madness overtakes us both
Then nobody would be alone
The ghost of us can linger here
Forever not to disappear
Stay
Stay near
Oh, stay
We could be together here
Forever we're
Together bound in madness
I, oh
Here and now
If this is it
Why don't we just savor it?
Just hush
