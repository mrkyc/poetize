You got me freaking out
I guess we're even now
Baby, why you leaving now?
You should see me now
Been knocking on the wood
And lately I've been looking good
Baby, I just wish you could
Come by the neighborhood

B-b-b-back in time have you heard the news?
Love like mine met with mixed reviews
Don't you want to kiss me someday too?
Should be a party let's dance

Last words famous, I got to say this
Right here now, tomorrow's a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow
This will be yesterday
Last words famous, I got to say this
Right here now, tomorrow's a day away
Don't let go tonight, by tomorrow
This will be yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday
It's just a day away
It's just a day away

And now it's making sense
So yeah, my timing sucks
I'm just so good at fucking up
But I'm fixing to change my luck
Turns out enough's enough
