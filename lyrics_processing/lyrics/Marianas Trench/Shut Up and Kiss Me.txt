You can say I kinda borrowed this
But if you're young, it's new, I guess
And I don't want you leaving me now
You can say that I don't know romance
I can sing but I can't dance
And I don't want you leaving me now

Oh well you say I'm a mess
You say everything but a yes
You say you'll never date me
Say your mom'll hate me

Or you could just shut up (Shut up)
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up (Shut up)
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up and kiss me
And you can say you won't
And you can tell me no
And you can let me go
Or maybe if you don't, then just
Shut up (Shut up)
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Oh, shut up and kiss me

You say everything but a yes
You say you'll never date me
Say your mom'll hate me
