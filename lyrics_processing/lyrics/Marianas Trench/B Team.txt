You could want this
See if it fits for a bit and if you don't like it
Then you can go, like you have been
And I'll never tell, never tell how I fell for it
I never fell before

Three, two, one
You get right up and I'm the one done
You never say yes, not quite no
Say just enough to make me not go
You choose your words, careful voice
In the end I'm not the first choice
You say you want someone just like me
So then why am I your plan, why am I your plan
Why am I your plan B?

You know, you know you love the way I linger and
You keep me wrapped right 'round your finger and
But you say, you say just wait a little longer and
And in time I could be the right one
Please, I'm the B team

I never fell before
