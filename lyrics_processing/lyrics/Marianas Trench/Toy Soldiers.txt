Who'll be my Montague now
To this broken Capulet
How, how, how if not for you?
And you'll be my local hero
Be my role model
And don't, don't, don't fail me now

(My love)
Don't you wanna love? Don't you wanna love?
I'm your biggest fan, it's so good to finally meet ya
I deserve a little more, wouldn't you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
(My love)
Don't you want love? Don't you want to?
Don't you think I deserve better after all that we've been through? (Love)
Don't you wanna love? (Love) Now what you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

Don't you wanna love? Don't you want this?
Don't you look so shocked, it's not the way I planned it
I deserve a little more, wouldn't you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
(My love)
Don't you want love? Don't you fight back, no
This will hurt less if you just submit so (Love)
How 'bout a little gratitude for what I say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
