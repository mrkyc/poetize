So nice to see you here
Impolite would only be beneath us
It's been what? Half a year?
Like nothing ever happened in-between us
Fill me in on how you've been
And I will tell you anything
You'd like to hear now

And we can laugh some, reminisce some
From the same old stories to the new ones
When the night's done, I will just see you around

But that's not what I came here for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick, brace for it
I'd rather be a riot than indifferent
Oh
Oh, this means war, yeah
This means, this means
This means, this means war

I'm calm, I'm sure of it
I don't shake because I've never even rattled
It's a good school, I've heard of it
You want to move away; surrender from the battle
I just wish you'd open fire on me
So I can see you still worry
If I care

But that's not what I came here for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick, brace for it
I'd rather be a riot than indifferent
Oh
Oh, this means war (Fire in the, fire in the)

Take cover, baby (Fire in the, fire in the hole)
Take cover (Fire in the hole, fire in the hole)
Oh yeah (Fire in the hole, fire in the hole)
Take cover, take cover, baby (Fire in the hole, fire in the hole)
Take cover (Fire in the hole, fire in the hole)
Came for, my amour
I hate to admit it but I miss the war
Oh
Gotta get you under fire quick, brace for it
I'd rather be a riot than be indifferent
Oh
Of course you know this means war

Fire in the hole, fire in the hole (Yeah)
Fire in the hole, fire in the hole
Fire in the hole, fire in the hole (This means, this means...)
