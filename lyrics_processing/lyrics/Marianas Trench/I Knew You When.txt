I've been somewhere like this before
To a place where we don't make sense together anymore
And if you're saying this is the end
Honey, I knew, I knew, I knew you when
The first night in our first place
We ate on the floor while summer twilight ricocheted
And it was easier back then
Honey, I knew, I knew, I knew you when

I've been loving, loving you too long
To just sudden, suddenly move on from this
(I knew you when)
(I, I, I knew you when)
We shedded, shedded way too much
To just let it, let it make a mess of us
(I knew you when)
I knew, I knew you when

You, you, you
I knew, I knew, I knew you when
(You) I knew you when
(You) I knew you when
(You) I knew, I knew you when

Cabin on a rainy coast
Where you said, "Forever's not enough" while we were close
Been many years to now since then
But honey you knew me, knew me, knew me when

I've been loving, loving you too long
To just sudden, suddenly move on from this
(I knew you when)
(I, I, I knew you when)
And we shedded, shedded way too much
To just let it, let it make a mess of us
(I knew you when)
I knew, I knew you when

You, you, you
I knew, I knew, I knew you when
(You) I knew you when
(You) I knew you when
(You) Yeah I knew, I knew you when

I thought time was supposed to heal it
Don't do shit but keep you feelin'
Older, older
I thought time was supposed to heal it
Don't do shit but keep you feelin'

I'm sure you're wondering
Is this a new beginning or the start of another end?
But if you wanna try again
Honey, I'll know, I'll know, I'll know you then
Honey, I'll know, I'll know, I'll know you then

You, yeah, you, you
