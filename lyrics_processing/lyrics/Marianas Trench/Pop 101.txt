Pop music 101
Some simple instructions
For a good first impression
Now let's start with verse one
A minor chord, tensions grow
Fade in the bass like so
Now, with momentum, go, stop
And bring the beat back
It's called "four-on-the-floor"
A beat you can't ignore
I'll bring sexy back once more (Yeah)
They'll love that (Yeah) fo' sho!
The chords are 1-4-6-4
Now I'm talkin' familiar
Harmony in thirds, not fourths
Will take you into the pre-chorus

Real quick now, don't you bore us
Hurry up and get to the chorus
Dumb down, they won't ignore us

Get to the floor
And here's some words you should know
Like, "DJ, never let me go"
"Pour shots and then I'll lose control"
Or, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"
How about one more last word like
"Hey, girl, we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"

Guitar and strings like these
To sound like Black Eyed Peas
This one's a filter sweep
This one's Imogen Heap
Hipster music on cassette
But you probably don't know them yet
808s, hey, ho, hell yeah!
Heartfelt pub anthems
From Mumford and his Sons
Gang vocals, here we come
Thinking, "I will always wait"
Wobble bass

Real quick now, don't you bore us
Hurry up and get to the chorus
Dumb down, they won't ignore us
Tape slow down
Take 'em to the chorus

Whoa!
And here's some words you should know
Like, "DJ, never let me go"
"Pour shots and then we'll lose control"
Or, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"
How about one more last word like
"Hey, girl, we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"
I can pitch shift my voice if I want
I can pitch shift my voice if I want
I can pitch shift my voice if I want
I can make my voice low

The bridge is the part when
You bring in a rapper friend ('sup?)
You simplify and slow the beat
Abbreviate "feature" to "feat."
Quick now, fill in the gaps (Okay!)
Water it down, eliminate that which you really would rap
And give 'em a classic, like-

Get-Get-Get-Get to the floor (Cash money)
And here's some words you should know
Like, "DJ, never let me go"
"Pour shots and then we'll lose control"
"(Ad-lib)"
Or, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"
How about one more last word like
"Hey girl, we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"
"Higher," "desire," and "fire"
Oh, yeah, dance
Boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots
