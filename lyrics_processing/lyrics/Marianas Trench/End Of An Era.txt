To final adieu
Hearts will break for future's sake
But mine just won't take
Can't love if you don't
I can't try if you won't
Oh I know, please just let me go
My dear, 'cause I'd stay near
And lose my self here
Astoria, I'm warning ya
I'm coming for, coming for ya
It's do or die for you and I
And I'll never be taken alive
Here's everything that led me here
But our future still remains unclear
High time I face you, Astoria
So get up and face me, Astoria
Come and face the music, Astoria (Face the music when it's dire)
It's about fucking time now, Astoria
I'm wasting away here, Astoria (Face the music when it's dire)
Goodbye, Astoria
I'm so afraid of trying something new
'Cause every start begins with saying goodbye to you
Our heart divides an unrequited view
But my heart is overdue

Wish this was easy
I want you to know
This never was the man I hoped to be by now
(How did we survive?)
We went through hell in Astoria
(How did we survive?)
We lost ourselves in Astoria
(How did we survive?)
I gave in to sickness
Can you find forgiveness
For a dear old friend
So Astoria can end
Release me, Astoria
It's time now, Astoria
I'm in over my head
(End of the line now, Astoria)
(Hope's fading into Astoria)
This is our goodbye
(Never say die in Astoria)
This is our goodbye
(Never say die in)
Oh, Astoria, Astoria
(Never say die in Astoria)
Astoria, Astoria
(Never say die) In Astoria
If we shadows have offended
I hope your heart can still be mended
I hope you know that I don't blame you my dear friend
Always will
Love you still
