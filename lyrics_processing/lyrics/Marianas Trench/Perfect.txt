Please sing to me
I can see you open up to breathe
Fast words make it easier on me
If the point's to never disappoint you
Somebody's got to tell me what to do
Just wish you could've seen me
When it used to come so easy
I'd like to say that it's easy to stay
But it's not for me, 'cause I'm barely here at all

Slow down now, the secret's out
And I swear now everything is perfect

What you want, what you need has been killing me
Try to be everything that you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress, I've done more for less
And I will change everything till it's perfect again

Coming down, coming around, giving a frown
To the sound when I hit ground
I hate the way that I say I should stay
When I know that I don't give a fuck about it anyway
Shake hands, and shoot smiles all around
As I sell my body by the pound
Sign my name on the dotted line
For would be fate, do not resuscitate

Slow down now, the secret's out
And I swear now I'll still make this perfect

What you want, what you need has been killing me
Try to be everything that you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress, I've done more for less
And I will change everything till it's perfect again

I think it's better this way
This is good in a bad way
It's better this way
I'll make this perfect again
I'll make this perfect again

What you want, what you need has been killing me
And I will change everything that you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress, I've done more for less
And I will change everything, whoa, yeah
(What you want, what you need has been killing me
Try to be everything that you want me to be) I'll make this perfect again
(I'll say yes, I'll undress, I've done more for less
And I will change everything)
