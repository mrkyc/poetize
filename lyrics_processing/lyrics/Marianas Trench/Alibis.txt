From the scrapes and bruises
To the familiar abuses
I'll kick and scream
But it never changes anything

I could spill my guts out
Wearing my best little girl pout
And I almost missed it
But nobody said that this was gonna be easy

This is not the man I hoped to be
And I'm just trying to stop the bleeding
I don't know how to word it
I just started to deserve it
And all my
All my faces are alibis
And me
I'm half the man I wanted to be

Most times it all comes out wrong
I don't know the words but I'll hum along
There's nothing familiar here anymore
To anyone or anything enough to feel alive

And I still taste that sickness
And it makes me crazy without it at best
But I'm in the same place I used to be
But I'm trying harder not to be

This is not the man I hoped to be
And I'm just trying to stop the bleeding
I don't know how to word it
I just started to deserve it
And all my
All my faces are alibis
And me
I'm half the man I wanted to be

So what am I?
What am I?
So what am I?

And all my
All my faces are alibis
This is not the man I hoped to be
And I'm just trying to stop the bleeding
I don't know how the words go
I just started not to say no
Don't want it, don't get it (All my)
I know you won't regret it
Don't surface, don't surface (All my)
And I feel so damned worthless (All my faces are)
Another day is gone (All my)
And all my faces are alibis
All my faces are alibis
And me
