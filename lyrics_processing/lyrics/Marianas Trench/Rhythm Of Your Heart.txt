Back to ones
From the top, ready or not
Here it comes
For you and me
But that was easier said than done
In the light of day, things can change from slim to none
I succumb, but loving you is a loaded gun

(I, I) I don't wanna be this
(No, oh) 'body need to see this
(I, I) try to resist
But the light's getting low to a glow 'till you're touching my lips
Wanna go but I wouldn't
I wanna stay when I shouldn't
I wanna say no when I couldn't

So meet me in the dark
Kiss me in the shadows of every spark
I know we shouldn't start (Ah)
But baby, I'm a slave to the rhythm
Slave to the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your...)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your...)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your...

Meant to be
(Ha) maybe just a dangerous fantasy
But before the fall, you were always real to me
And after me, comes to you so easily (Easy)
But loving you just sticks to me

(I, I) I don't wanna be this
(No, oh) 'body need to see this
(I, I) try to resist
But the light's getting low to a glow 'till you're touching my lips
Wanna go but I wouldn't
