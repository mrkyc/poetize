Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely
Yeaaah
Remind me that I'm lonelyyy
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out and snore from rolling around in my bed

Someone, anyone to listen
I feel like I'm missing the real thing
Tell me where I go
Girl I got a few
I can always call when I'm ready
But I feel like I'm wasting my time
Yeah

Cause my heart beats are empty
So once in awhile...

Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely
Yeaaah
Remind me that I'm lonely
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knocked out and snore
I'm rolling around in my bed
You might also like
I don't wanna think, I just wanna drink
Cause I'm overcome by this notion
Don't you know I'm real, baby can't you tell
But you got a hole in your heart
I probably would dismiss it
The truth that I miss you for real
Hook up something new?
Till I see a girl like you

Cause my heart beats are empty
So once in awhile...
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely
Yeaaah
Remind me that I'm lonely
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out and snore from rolling around in my bed

Beautiful girls
Intelligent girls
Creative girls
I hate ya
(Yeah I hate ya)
But the truth is I want ya
And I need ya
What's the very best way to reach ya ?
I beseech ya
Cause I'm looking for something real

Cause my heart beats are empty
So once in awhile...
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely
Yeaaah
Remind me that I'm lonely
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
