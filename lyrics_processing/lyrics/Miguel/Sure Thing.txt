Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh (You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh (You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) Yeah

If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom!
Painter, baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard, you can be the talk
And I can be the walk, yeah-eah

Even when the sky comes fallin'
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We could do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing, yeah
You might also like
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) Oh yeah, yeah
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)

You could be the lover, I'd be the fighter, babe
If I'm the blunt (Uh), you could be the lighter, babe, fire it up!
Writer, baby, you could be the quote, yeah (Uh)
If I'm the lyric, baby, you could be the note (Uh), record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner
And it's you, what did I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one 'cause you are a ten
Real and not pretend

Even when the sky comes fallin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) Even when we're down to the wire, babe
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) Even when it's do or die
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) We could do it, baby, simple and plain
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that) 'Cause this love is a sure thing, yeah
Uh, now rock with me, babe
And let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah-yeah
Uh, now rock with me, babe
And let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah-yeah
This love between you and I is simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, it's such a sure thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (It's such a sure thing)
