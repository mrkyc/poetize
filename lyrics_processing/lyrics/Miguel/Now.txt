CEO of the free world now
Build your walls up high and wide
Make it rain to keep them out
That won't change what we are inside

Pick the fruit of your labor
Cultivate, plant your seeds now and watch them grow
Man, I'll holla at you later
Let you find out what you're made of
Just saying...

Is that the look of freedom, now?
Is that the sound of freedom, now?
'Cause it's plain to see a man's integrity
By the way he treats those he does not need
And it's time we talk about it
Let's not waste our common ground
We will fall for standing and watching, all in silence
Dear Lord, are we numb? Where we going right now?

No, not later, la, la, la, la, later
Oh, right now, oh, right now
No, not later, no, not later
La, la, la, la, later
This can't wait, no

Should we teach our children hatred?
Chase the innocent, and shoot them down
It's like we're still running races
I'm just saying...

Is that the look of freedom, now?
Is that the sound of freedom, now?
'Cause it's plain to see a man's integrity
By the way he treats those when he don't need them
And it's time we talk about it
Let's not waste our common ground
We will fall for standing and watching, all this silence
Dear Lord, are we numb? Where we going right now?

No, not later, la, la, la, la, later (La later)
No, right now, No, right now
No, not later, no, not later
La, la, la, la, later
Oh right now, oh right...

Now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now or never, we can work together
Now, now, now
Now, now, now
We only suffer what we allow
Now, now, now
For all the people
In Puerto Rico
Way down in Houston
For Flint, Michigan
For Standing Rock, oh!
Way down in New Orleans
For all of the dreamers
The black lives that we've lost right now
Now, now
This can't wait, no
Oh, right now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now
We are the look of freedom, oh
We are the sound of freedom
We are the look of freedom
