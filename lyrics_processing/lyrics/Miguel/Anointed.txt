Yeah... yeah...

Lay your face on the pillow
Push the covers where they belong
I can't take my eyes off you
We both know what we came here for
To weigh the truth and the lie
Should you lead, I will follow
Only truth is allowed
Hallowed fate knows no doubt
'Cause your body's ready for war
And my body's built to endure

You, make me feel like a god
Make me feel like I've been anointed
Come to me, I'm your rod
Death and resurrection (yeah, yeah)
Death and resurrection (yeah, yeah)
You make me feel like I'm a god
Make me proud like I've been anointed
Make me proud like I've been anointed
Yeah... yeah... yeah
You might also like
Every time is a blessing
Would you baptize me in your love?
(Baptize me in your love)
You have no problem confessing
(You've no problem with confession)
Just as long as we speak in tongue
I lay my worship on you now
Just kneel and say what you want
Only truth is allowed
As we sing our praises out loud
Your body's begging for more
And my body's built to endure

You, (you!) make me feel like a god
Make me feel like I've been anointed
Come to me, I'm your rod (yeah, yeah)
Death and resurrection (yeah, yeah)
