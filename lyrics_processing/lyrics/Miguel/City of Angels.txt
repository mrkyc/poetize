Fighter jets over my city, uh
Cool contrails in the sky, yeah
It's breaking news all over TV
We were hit by surprise
Alright
I was at Townhouse down in Venice Beach, oh no
Stealing moments with you know who
We won the war but not a day goes by
That I don't think I shoulda been with you

When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was busy letting you down, woman
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was nowhere to be found
Alright

A vast shadow cast over my city
Some kinda, unknown ships sittin' in the sky (Yeah, ooh)
I guess they came here looking for trouble
No time for goodbyes

Oh, When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was busy letting you down, woman
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
And I was nowhere to be found
No, no, nowhere to be found
Nowhere, honey, oh no

Drinking my favorite tequila (alright)
You know I, saved your last message to my phone, woman
I didn't text you back that night, did I?
It just says, "Baby, when do you think you'll be home?" no, oh no
I stayed behind when everyone left fled for Nevada
You know I, I stayed behind to search for your smile, oh no
Hoping to find you in the rubble
Hoping, that I could just hold you for a while

'Cause when the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was busy letting you down, woman
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was nowhere to be found
