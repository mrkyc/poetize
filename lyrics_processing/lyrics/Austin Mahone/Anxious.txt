What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?
Usually I'm cool enough, but
Usually I don't see someone
That look like they could be the one, one

Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna create an awkward moment
But you got me frozen
Can't get my feet to do what I told 'em

Baby, your body make me wanna cut loose
But when I try, I analyze a little too much
Baby, 'cause your body makes me wanna tell the truth
So, by the way

I can't help it, I want you more with every innocent touch
The more I say we're just friends, the more I wanna explode
Every time we're alone, I try to speak, but I choke
Can't say it when it's just us
'Cause you make me so anxious

Can't wait, can't wait, I'm
Can't wait, can't wait

Now my mind's already rollin'
Takin' off your clothing, yeah
Did I say that out loud? Say that out loud, I'm sorry

Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna create an awkward moment
But you got me frozen
Can't get my feet to do what I told 'em

Baby, your body makes me wanna tell the truth (Damn)
So, by the way

I can't help it, I want you more with every innocent touch
The more I say we're just friends, the more I wanna explode
Every time we're alone, I try to speak, but I choke
Can't say it when it's just us
'Cause you make me so anxious

Can't wait, can't wait, I'm
Can't wait, can't wait, no patience
Can't wait, can't wait, I'm
Can't wait, can't wait, no patience
Can't help it, I want you more with every innocent touch
The more I say we're just friends, the more I wanna explode
Every time we're alone, I try to speak, but I choke
Can't say it when it's just us 'cause you make me so anxious

Can't wait, can't wait, I'm
Can't wait, can't wait, no patience
Can't wait, can't wait, I'm
