You, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend

Hey, hey, baby, you been on my mind
I knew you for a long time
But I've been thinking that maybe you should know
Hey, hey, baby, can we compromise?
I really want you to be mine
I got a million places that we could go, yeah

I wanna be your everything (Hey)
I wanna be the one you need (Hey, hey)
So tell me, where you been all my life?
Can I make you mine tonight?

Hey, baby, you, you got what I need

But you say you're just a friend

Hey, hey, baby, we been on the phone
Spending time together alone (Oh)
But every time we talk, the words don't come out right, yeah
Hey, hey, baby, when I look in your eyes
I can tell you are holding something aside
I'll be thinking 'bout you
Are you thinking 'bout me?

I wanna be your everything (Hey)
I wanna be the one you need (Hey, hey)
So tell me, where you been all my life?
Can I make you mine tonight?

Yeah, you say you're just a friend

And Carol City spent most of my nights
Trying make the world whistle, it's a hell of a life
How to make them get low, bring it back right round
Let the good times roll, feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90
Came to me like the song I wrote
Cuttin' class, chasin' you, 'cause you all I want
Like you, you got what I need
And if not, I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend, I'm playing though
But maybe that is a little true sprinkle in 'em
We be catchin' eyes, and I can see them twinkle in 'em
Thought we be together 'til I seen the wrinkle in 'em
But I guess not
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
