I haven't seen you in two weeks
Look at what your love can do to me
It's like we're stuck inside a movie
Perfect for you, you drama queen
I call you crazy and you hate that
You're kinda crazy, but it turn me on
Up all Sundays, where I stay at
Recovering from the night before

I know you got your ways and you know that I got mine
A peace of mind, adjust your time and then it's all fine
I know you're waitin' for that day when you turn 21
But you only turn 20 once

Why you hate being so young?
It's only right now for so long
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways
You might also like
Oh, love you anyway, oh

Why you talkin' reckless?
You tell me the stories that I should know
And if you look past it
Then there's no more worries, and then we can grow

I know you got your ways and you know that I got mine
A peace of mind, adjust your time and then it's all fine
I know you're waitin' for that day when you turn 21
But you only turn 20 once

Why you hate being so young?
It's only right now for so long
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways

It's late at night, around 1
I don't got plans to sleep tight, if you come
If you come
Yeah, you used to pick me up in your new whip your daddy bought you
I don't know what would happen if your old man ever caught you
And in my hand I have a CD with some songs about you
We'd freestyle, but you ain't know how until I taught you
But back then, then it all seemed so easy
We bumpin' that old Weezy, singin', I wouldn't care
If you was a prostitute and you hit on every man
That you probably ever knew cause you probably did that too
Okay!
Why you hate being so young?
It's only right now for so long
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
I'm gonna love you anyways
Even if you don't know where you're goin'
I'm gonna love you anyways

Said I'm gon', I'm gon'
Said I'm gon', I'm gon'
