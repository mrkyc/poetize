Flashback to the summer
It was you and me
I just wanna know, babe
Why you switched up on me
We would spend the whole day
Walking on the beach
I thought we were ok
Now you're just my old thing

Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about

It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new
You might also like
Riding through your city
Riding through your town
Wonder if you're still around
Wonder if you're here now
Maybe if I call you
We can talk it out
Baby, we can't play these games
No

Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about

It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new
Brand new
Brand new
B-b-b-brand new
Brand new
B-b-brand new
No, no, no
B-b-b-brand new
B-b-brand new

It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Say, why you acting brand new?
Girl, why you acting brand new?
Tell me why you're acting brand new
