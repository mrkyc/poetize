Landed, I landed a new girl, I claimed it
You're mine and I'm not sharing you
We've been up, we've been down but we come back around
I'm not leaving until you say so

I knew way from the jump
You and me were meant to be
Finally find the love that came to me so easily
Now now I see, girl
Let's go, don't ask me no questions
I got you, you got me and it's just like ooh
You felt frustrated, don't worry, we'll make it
'Cause lately I'm feeling like

We should double up
Girl, it's kinda tough
Live the life without you
It just ain't enough
Yeah ooh, trust me it's worth it
You know I put work in
And lately I'm feeling like, oh
Lately I'm feeling like, oh
Lately I'm feeling like
You might also like
There ain't no doubt, what I'm feeling
You got my head in the clouds
No coming down, I don't wanna come down
High off you, so I can't touch the ground
Now it's love that I see
And always so real to me
So let's go, go where we
Want to go babe, don't you worry

I knew way from the jump
You and me were meant to be
Finally find the love that came to me so easily
Now now I see, girl
Let's go, don't ask me no questions
I got you, you got me and it's just like ooh
You felt frustrated, don't worry, we'll make it
'Cause lately I'm feeling like

We should double up
Girl, it's kinda tough
Live the life without you
It just ain't enough
Yeah ooh, trust me it's worth it
You know I put work in
And lately I'm feeling like, (We should, we should, double up)
Lately I'm feeling like, (We should, we should, double up)
Lately I'm feeling like
We should double up
Girl, it's kinda tough
Live the life without you
It just ain't enough
Yeah ooh, trust me it's worth it
You know I put work in
And lately I'm feeling like, (We should, we should, double up)
Lately I'm feeling like, (We should, we should, double up)
