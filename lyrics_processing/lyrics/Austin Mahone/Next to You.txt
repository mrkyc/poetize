Clap your hand
Let the bass kick

Hey girl, just look at you
So beautiful and drop dead hot
Tell me, what's the thing?
What you do with a guy like him?
Hey girl, you're one of a kind
You're the best one can be
Tell me, what's the thing?
Are you taking this love for real?

I see him tryin' to break your smile, I get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He don't really care about you
Like I will, I will, I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to leave
You'll never be alone, believe me
I will, I will, I will be next to you
Baby, I will, I will, I will be next to you
Let the bass kick

There's something 'bout the look in your eyes, baby
What is wrong?
Just tell me what is going on (Tell me what is going on)
Why you wasting your time?
Saying everything's alright, baby
What you have
Is nothing but a bad romance (A bad romance)

I see him tryin' to break your smile, I get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He don't really care about you
Like I will, I will, I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to leave
You'll never be alone, believe me
I will, I will, I will be next to you
Baby, I will, I will, I will be next to you
Let the bass kick

You'll never be alone, believe me
I will, I will, I will be next to you (I'll be right next to you)
