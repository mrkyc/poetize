There's beauty in flaws, beauty in flaws
Even the ones you don't like
They're beautiful
You're pretty inside, pretty inside
I see it all there in your hazel eyes

'Cause you make it magic
You make it classic
You take the good, the bad
And wrap it all in who you are
And it would be tragic
If we never happen
We could be wild and free and
Dance until we're gone

See you walking down the street
She's the kind out of my dreams
What can I do for her attention?
Get the girl to talk to me
When the wind blows through her hair
Should I tell her she's a ten
Or should I think of something clever
There's no way to keep it in

I'm feeling you hard
Feeling your vibe
You're downfalls and all
I'm ready to dive
I'm outta the plane
I'm out in the sky
Just give me your love
And I'll be alright

'Cause you make it magic
You make it classic
You take the good, the bad
And wrap it all in who you are
And it would be tragic
If we never happen
We could be wild and free and
Dance until we're gone

Yeah!
Girl, you're so perfect
Swear you're makin' me so nervous
Tokyo in the Benzo
Let your friends know
What came in the end zone
But the end's low
'Cause I been at the Dolce & Gabana
'Cause I only feel cosy in designer
Ain't no one suit designed ya
Call me, leave your exes behind ya
I'll remind ya
See you walking down the street
She's the kind out of my dreams
What can I do for her attention?
