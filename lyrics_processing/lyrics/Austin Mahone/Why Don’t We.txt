Here's a situation that's been weighing on my brain
I know you've been looking for something brand new
Oh, now please forgive me for what I'm about to say
Tell me, baby, can you...

Baby, can you give me one good reason why you don't give this a try?
Girl, there's no point in feeling guilty
Oh, I'm asking can you keep a, can you keep an open mind?
No, we got nothing to hide, so girl, why don't we?

Spend a little time in the middle
Middle, out on the floor
Never done it like this before (C'mon)
Girl, why don't we?
Love right now just a little
'Cause you deserve so much more
Never done it like this before (C'mon)
Girl, why don't we?

Let's not waste another moment, baby, take a chance (Take a chance now)
I know that you feel this, 'cause I feel it too
But you be sitting like you forgot how to dance (Dance)
Think of what we can do
