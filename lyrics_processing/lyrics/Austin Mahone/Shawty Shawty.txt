But this could be what ought to be, inwardly and outwardly
I know them other guys try to string you along
Tie you up with nice lines, but lemme sing you a song
You say it's hard to open up when your heart's been mistreated
But I got just what you need and I'm hoping you'll receive it
And we could do it big (all over the world)
Diamonds and pearls (all over my girl)
And I ain't really into favoritism
But if I was you'd be my favorite
Send you this text, I hope you save it, yo
