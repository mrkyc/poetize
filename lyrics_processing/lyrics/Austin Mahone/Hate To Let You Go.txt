Ever had a doubt about us?
I can't lie it's crossed my mind
But I avoid it every time
And now I'm thinking that we found love
But I got to tell you now
I've had this feeling for a while

Caught up in the moment
I don't know how to feel
Do you want this love of mine?
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But this is how I feel
Girl I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
You might also like
I'd hate to ruin something so good
But can't help it, how I feel
I can't let it be concealed
And I thought about staying quiet
But you deserve to know the truth
It's the least that I can do

Caught up in the moment
I don't know how to feel
Do you want this love of mine?
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But this is how I feel
Girl I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
And I realize what I put on the line
It's so hard to say goodbye
And how many times I tried to clear up my mind
It's so hard to say goodbye

Caught up in the moment
I don't know how to feel
Do you want this love of mine?
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But this is how I feel
But I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside, baby
Hate to let you go
Hate to let you go
It's killing me inside, baby
I don't wanna let you go, no, no, no, no, no
Hate to let you go
