You're mine
And I want you to know it every second, minute, hour of the day
Can't lie, I could picture being with you
'Till you take my last breath away

I'll be there when you wake in the morning
Late in the evening
I'll be right there
When you say you really need me, yeah
I'm laced up for the long run, yeah

So give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody, I'd do anything
To keep around me, a while now
Keep around me, a while
'Till I found you
Ooh (Yeah)
'Till I found you
Been losing my mind
Doubting now if I found one
Then I found you
You might also like
So fine
I swear I'd do some time
If it meant just why we'd never fade away
And all night I could look into your eyes
While the moonlight complements your face

I'll be there when you wake in the morning
Late in the evening
I'll be right there
When you say you really need me, yeah
I'm laced up for the long run, yeah

So give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody, I'd do anything
To keep around me, a while now
Keep around me, a while
'Till I found you
Ooh (Yeah)
'Till I found you
Been losing my mind
Doubting now if I found one
Then I found you
Found you, found you
Found you (Found you)
Found you, found you
Found you (Found you)
So give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody, I'd do anything
To keep around me, a while now
Keep around me, a while

And even for a second
If you think my mind will change
You're crazy, there's no way that I will let you slip away
I'll keep you 'round me, a while now
Keep you 'round me, a while

'Cause I found you
Ooh (Yeah)
'Cause I found you
I'm losing my mind, down, then I found one
