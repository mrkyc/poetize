Shawty so perfect (so perfect)
Do it right, do it right
Yeah you know how to do it right
I can see your body working, body working
Do it right, do it right
Yeah your body telling no lie
You been keeping heads turning, in a circle
All night, all night
You been turning heads all night
Girl you know what you be doing, you're a killer
Alright, alright
Girl you know how to do it right

Pull up to the spot, it's heating up
Seen you walk by, I can't get enough
I ain't gonna leave this party 'til you right by my side
And I don't really mean to seem in a rush
But I'mma start it off with a little touch
And we know what we really wanted, showing up here tonight

Now you, I thought you always knew what you wanted
Now you, got it all and it seems like it's nothing
For you, got me out here waiting for something
Like you, without a doubt, without a doubt
You might also like
Shawty so perfect, so perfect
Do it right, do it right
Yeah you know how to do it right
I can see your body working, body working
Do it right, do it right
Yeah your body telling no lie
You been keeping heads turning, in a circle
All night, all night
You been turning heads all night
Girl you know what you be doing, you're a killer
Alright, alright
Girl you know how to do it right

Ain't too much popping but me and you
And when they all talk it's 'bout me and you
I could show you off to everybody
I wanna love you girl, right now
And ain't too much of us that they ever see
It's not like we were keeping things low key
I ain't gonna leave this party until I have you by my side

Now you, I thought you always knew what you wanted
Now you, got it all and it seems like it's nothing
For you, got me out here waiting for something
Like you, without a doubt, without a doubt
Shawty so perfect, so perfect
Do it right, do it right
Yeah you know how to do it right
I can see your body working, body working
Do it right, do it right
Yeah your body telling no lie
You been keeping heads turning, in a circle
All night, all night
You been turning heads all night
Girl you know what you be doing, you're a killer
Alright, alright
Girl you know how to do it right

Yeah, girl no doubt you're a ten
Walking like an angel, had me thinking of a sin
Lord forgive me, but if you saw the body even, you'd be looking with me
I could be the Bobby, she could be the Whitney
Having you hit notes, just like she did
Next day, telling all your friends what we did
Til you find out that her man is the quarter back
And he wants to meet up after school, you can't run from that
Now you gonna get your little ass kicked
All cause you wanna mess around with his chick
And truth be told, I'd probably do it again
Cause what she gave me, dog, was a blessing to a man
And I wanna love you right here in the middle of this party
I wanna show you off girl, in front of everybody
Shawty so perfect, so perfect
Do it right, do it right
Yeah you know how to do it right
I can see your body working, body working
Do it right, do it right
Yeah your body telling no lie
You been keeping heads turning, in a circle
All night, all night
You been turning heads all night
Girl you know what you be doing, you're a killer
Alright, alright
Girl you know how to do it right

Do it right
Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it right, do it right
