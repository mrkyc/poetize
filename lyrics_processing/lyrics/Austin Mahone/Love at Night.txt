Girl, you had me from the start
Had me on Mars
Had me seeing stars
That's why I gave you all my heart
Spending all my night seen the day's up
I hope we never, ever break up
Have so much fun around you
I can get used to the straight up
Girl, you blow my mind
Even when you wasn't mine
That's why I gave you all my time
Something about you feels right
You told me to be patient
You got my heartbeat racing
Telling all my boys I ain't going nowhere
'Cause I've been waiting to make love to you

Girl, you know I love you so
When we make love at night
I will never let you go
When we make love at night
Cross my heart and hope to die
When we make love at night

Everything about her is just so chill
It's just so real all and I love the way her body feels
So come a little closer
Never want this love to be over
So much fun when I'm around you
I just wanna kiss and hold you
Girl, you blow my mind
Anything you want is fine
I just want you around
I just wanna love your body down
Every time we get together
It's like California weather
The best thing you've ever felt
In the whole well, there ain't nothing better than our love
When we make love at night
