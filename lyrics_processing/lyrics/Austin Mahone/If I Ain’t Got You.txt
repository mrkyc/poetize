You know that lately I've been blind to
Anything that's not you
And I know that this love must be something
Cause without you I'm nothing

So tell me what you wanna do
I could run away with you, nice to spend my days with you
It's every little thing you do
Your love I could never lose, I don't know what I would do

If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
If I ain't got you
If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

You know that I can't live without you
There's something special 'bout you, baby
When you go, these empty walls in my place
Keep echoing your name, baby
You might also like
So tell me what you wanna do
I could run away with you, nice to spend my days with you
It's every little thing you do
Your love I could never lose, I don't know what I would do

If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
If I ain't got you
If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

I've been thinking
Maybe we shouldn't stray
Cause I need you around me
Nothing else has been sounding
Good to me, you're good for me
Ain't enough for me if you up and leave
It wouldn't be no sweat (whoo!)
Making love to you all day
I've really been thinking
(Thinking) Baby (baby) baby (baby)
Don't let me go, baby (baby)
Make me (crazy) crazy (baby)
Your love is sewed up
Your love is no lie
And no way I'll let you go
I just had to let you know
If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
If I ain't got you
If it ain't you, babe
If I ain't got you, baby
Everything means nothing
