It's too damn late to be thinking 'bout
These old mistakes, it's crazy how we're
Up and down, up and down
I need to know if you're in or out, in or out

Can we both agree, ain't the same?
Time will tell, things have changed
I need you to tell me, baby
Tell me, baby, tell me, babe
Tell me how to see, I gotta know
Either way

'Cause I can't wait around for you, you, you
'Cause I got too many things to prove, ooh
I think it's time that you choose
What this really means to you
I wish I could read your mind
Just to predict your next move
Yeah 'cause I can't wait around for you, you, you

'Cause the good ones will go
If you wait too long
I learned that from my
Favourite song
We're up and down, up and down
I need to know if you're in or out, in or out
You might also like
Can we both agree, ain't the same?
Time will tell, things have changed
I need you to tell me, baby
Tell me, baby, tell me, babe
Tell me how to see, I gotta know
Either way

'Cause I can't wait around for you, you, you
'Cause I got too many things to prove, ooh
I think it's time that you choose
What this really means to you
I wish I could read your mind
Just to predict your next move
Yeah 'cause I can't wait around for you, you, you

Baby, I'm still home holding on for all of my patience
Baby, I'm still holding on,  holding on to you

'Cause I can't wait around for you, you, you
'Cause I got too many things to prove, ooh
I think it's time that you choose
What this really means to you
I wish I could read your mind
Just to predict your next move
