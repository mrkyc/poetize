I like the way, oh
That you talk to me, yeah
I like the way, oh
That you scream my name, baby

I don't know how, but I know you're the one
I'm standing my ground now when I used to run
It feels like a dream, but I know that I'm up
I'm up all night, all night with you

I don't feel like dancing with nobody else
It don't feel romantic with nobody else
Can't you see that, baby
I don't want nobody else but you
I don't feel like dancing with nobody else
It don't feel romantic with nobody else
Can't you see that, baby
I don't want nobody else but you

I like the way you breathe
When you're close to me, ooh, oh yeah
I like the way your hair falls across your face
Mmm, yeah
You might also like
I don't know how, but I know you're the one
I'm standing my ground now when I used to run
It feels like a dream, but I know that I'm up
I'm up all night, all night with you

I don't feel like dancing with nobody else
It don't feel romantic with nobody else (No, no, no, no)
Can't you see that, baby
I don't want nobody else but you
I don't feel like dancing with nobody else
It don't feel romantic with nobody else
Can't you see that, baby
I don't want nobody else but you

No, I can't help it, I want some more
Somehow I know that you won't let go
I don't know better, I lose control
I think I might love you
I like the way, oh, that you talk to me girl
Ooh, I like the way you keep me up
I'm up all night, all night with you (Oh)

I don't feel like dancing with nobody else (I don't feel like)
It don't feel romantic with nobody else (No, no, no, no)
Can't you see that, baby
I don't want nobody else but you
(I don't want nobody else, baby, you)
I don't feel like dancing with nobody else (I don't feel like)
It don't feel romantic with nobody else
(It don't feel romantic, baby, no, no, no, no)
Can't you see that, baby
