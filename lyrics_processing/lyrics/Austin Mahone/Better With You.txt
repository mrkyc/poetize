It's Saturday
I finally got you to myself on your off day, oh yeah
I know a place
Where we can shut the whole world out and hide away, away

See, the cold drinks have a sweeter taste
Whenever you're around and whenever you're around
And the bedsheets feel a different way
And it feels good, somewhere downtown
Whenever you're around me
Whenever you're around
And it should be, come as no surprise

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things, oh yeah
So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay at dawn
I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You might also like
A city night
Is so enticing, but I'd rather stay inside with you
So lay beside
Me and you do all the things we wanna try, oh yeah

See the cold drinks have a sweeter taste
Whenever you're around, whenever you're around
And the bedsheets feel a different way
And it feels good, somewhere downtown
Whenever you're around me
Whenever you're around
And it should be, come as no surprise

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things, oh yeah
So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay at dawn
I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
Traffic ain't bad when you're here with me
I even love the rain when you're here with me
I don't really care what we do, long as I'm there with you, baby
Traffic ain't bad when you're here with me
I even love the rain when you're here with me
I don't really care what we do
Nah...

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things, oh yeah
So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay at dawn
I like it better with you
