Up close and personal
Study your body
I wanna stay right here
With your arms around me

Hold you like I do
Show me all of you, oh
I'll show you me too

Give it to you like you never been kissed
Like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never done this
Like you've never been touched
Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never been
Give it to you like you never been, oh
Give it to you like you never been, oh
Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never been
Give it to me like you never been
You might also like
Deeper than physical
I got you open
Know how to take you there
Put you in motion

Hold you like I do
Show me all of you, oh
I'll show you me too

Give it to you like you never been kissed
Like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never done this
Like you've never been touched
Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never been
Give it to me like you never been

There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
Give it to you like you never been kissed
Like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never done this
Like you've never been touched
Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never been
Give it to you like you never been, oh
Give it to you like you never been, oh
Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like you never been loved
Give it to you like you never been
