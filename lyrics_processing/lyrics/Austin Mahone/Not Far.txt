You know it's just like
It's just harder for us 'cause she was a big part of our lives for so long and we understand that
There's not a connection
There's not a bond
With you, we can already accept and feel the difference
But for us, it's something so different
To see you fulfil your dreams and to become successful
And just, the person you've become all around to know that
She like for that
It's almost like she died for you to be that person

Only if you could see me now
I hope that you'd be proud of me
You told me to keep my feet right on the ground
Even when my head was in the clouds, you loved me

Cause every time I fall, you pick me up and I feel better
And all the things you taught me that I'll hold with me forever, you're smiling down on me, I know it
And any time I needed you, you'd be right there whenever
I'll always hold the memories and times we had together, I pray at night that you still steer me
If I could spend another day with you
With you, with you, with you
Then I would tell you everything you already know
Ready know, ready know, ready know
You might also like
I have so many things to say
But for sure that you already know that I miss you
Oh, that's why I never worry about a thing
Cause even though you're not here with me
I know that you're not far
You're not far, not far

You picked me up every day right after school
I knew that I could always turn to you for anything
You told me that I can always count on you
And even though I would act a fool, you loved me

Cause every time I fall, you pick me up and I feel better
And all the things you taught me that I'll hold with me forever, you're smiling down on me, I know it
And any time I needed you, you'd be right there whenever
I'll always hold the memories and times we had together, I pray at night that you still steer me
If I could spend another day with you
With you, with you, with you
Then I would tell you everything you already know
Ready know, ready know, ready know

I have so many things to say
But for sure that you already know that I miss you
Oh, that's why I never worry about a thing
Cause even though you're not here with me
I know that you're not far
Whenever I was in the dark, you were my light to guide a way
And now it seems we're far apart, and my heart ain't the same
So times like this when I need you, you always knew just what to say
And I know that you can't hear me but I really miss you, oh, oh, yeah

I have so many things to say
But for sure that you already know that I miss you
Oh, that's why I never worry about a thing
Cause even though you're not here with me
