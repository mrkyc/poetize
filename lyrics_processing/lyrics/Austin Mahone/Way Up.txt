She think she way up
Cause she steady chasin' the fame
She said they'll remember her name
She'll do anything for the camera
She way up
She just want the lights
She's living for the lights
She snappin' all the time
She think she

She a bad girl, she slim in the waist
She get what she want cause she pretty in the face
Takin' out her phone and she posin' for the picture
Filter out the things she ain't feelin' in the mirror
She got attitude when she ain't in the mood
Petty, she petty, she the drama in her crew
Steady, she steady tryna come up on a dude
Life of the party and she comin' after you

Lately been lookin' for somebody special
Scroll through my timeline, I just see the same
This got me thinkin', I'd rather be alone
Don't wanna deal with these basics, they're fake

Where the real ones who be lookin' for a come up?
Who be chillin', need someone to feel 'em, let me know 'em
Waiting for a lady, I can vibe out with her
Yes she got her own, she don't need no one to give her
Anything least that wanna give me that feelin'
Need a queen, when we on the scene we can kill 'em
We a team, feelin' like a king and a winner
I'm a beast, since she come around me I'ma get her
