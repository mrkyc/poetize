Oh, I'm sittin' on a sofa, feeling wasted
And without you here I am suffocating
Ooh, somethin' 'bout your body got me racing
I'll be alright
I'll be alright, yeah

The air is thin tell you're on me
Every breath that feels on me
Tell we're numb in our bodies
And I don't feel a thing

Only you save me
I wanna breathe you in
I need your oxygen, oh baby (oh baby)
The way your lips taste it
You gotta let me in
'Cause I need your oxygen, oh baby
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
'Cause you're my oxygen
You might also like
I can smell your perfume on my T-shirt
Oh, skin to skin and underneath ya
So-oh, stay like this, don't move an inch, I need ya
I'll be alright
I'll be alright, yeah
I said that I'll be alright

The air is thin tell you're on me
Every breath that feels on me
Tell we're numb in our bodies
And I don't feel a thing

Only you save me
I wanna breathe you in
I need you, oxygen, oh baby (oh baby)
The way your lips taste it
You gotta let me in
'Cause I need your oxygen, oh baby
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
'Cause you're my oxygen
You know I need you, baby
I can feel you, baby
You know that I breathe you in
You know I need you, baby
I can feel you, baby
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh

Only you save me
I wanna breathe you in
I need your oxygen, oh baby (oh baby)
The way your lips taste it
You gotta let me in
'Cause I need your oxygen, oh baby
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start up again
I'll breathe you out, I'll breathe you in
Until we start back up again
