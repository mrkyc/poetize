And now everybody to the dance floor

Rolling my sleeves up to here
To make you smile ear to ear
Girl, I've been hitting that, hitting that graveyard shift
You won't find another one built for this
Dirty work, ooh, dirty work
Baby, I don't need no help
I'd do it all by myself
Girl, I've been putting in, putting in overtime
You ain't gotta tell me what's on your mind
Dirty work, ooh, dirty work

'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Each night I do it for you

It's the dirty work, somebody's gotta do it
Dirty work, so we're getting into it
Dirty work, go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're goin' sundown to sunrise
You might also like
Dirty work
Dirty work

I'm filthy down to the core
Leave all your stress at the door
You know you need to stop scrubbing with Mr. Clean
Bring it right here and come next to me
Dirty work, ooh, dirty work

'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Each night I do it for you

It's the dirty work, somebody's gotta do it
Dirty work, so we're getting into it
Dirty work, go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise

Dirty work
Dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Everytime I do it for you

It's the dirty work, somebody's gotta do it
Dirty work, so we're getting into it
Dirty work, go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise

Dirty work
