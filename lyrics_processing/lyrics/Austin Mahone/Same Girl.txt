I'm messing with the same girl
But she wasn't my baby

It's crazy, let me tell you about my baby
She's so amazing, yeah, I met her out in LA
You wouldn't know what the fuss is all about
I just hope that she ain't creeping around

She's coming over tonight, so you can see for your own eyes
I think I finally found the one for me, yeah, I'm not gonna lie

There's something about the way you're talking about her, reminds me of my baby
But I don't know why she would want to share her heart, I don't know
Cause all of this time I thought that she was mine, but now you're telling me
That it's the same girl, we're with the same girl

You said you met her on the west side, but she ain't even from there
She loves them Miami nights, you should see her when she's down here
Now I can be the only one that's showing love to her
But I didn't know that she was showing it too

She never told you (told you told you told you)
You were supposed to know, know

Wow
So you was trying to see what's up, you were feeling the vibe
Little thing on the east coast, 305
It's obvious she probably in the gym most of the time
Cute face, lil' waist, and she just your type, right?
Ain't that crazy how it goes?
Thought she was the one, but she really one of those
But don't trip, man, it's a big world
And I know what I'd say if I find a loyal girl
I'd be like, "Tu sabes que yo te quiero"
If you coming with me, you know I'm taking care of you
I'mma pull out a ring and say "I wanna marry you"
But you know I ain't sharing you, nope
