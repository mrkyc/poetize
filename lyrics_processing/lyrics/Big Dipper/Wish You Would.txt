Hey, how you doin?
Come over here, lemme talk to you for a second
You know, I like what I see
Haha!

You know what it is when I'm in the mood
Cutie playing goofy with a sexy attitude
Baby, it's yours, meet me on the floor
'Cause my jaw 'drizzop' when you hit the door
I need what you gave me, few times more
Sweet lovin', baby, 'cause it's so softcore
Whispering, wet, singin' I'm your prize
I see your intent through your piercing eyes

Let's get , put me in the Buick
Back loveseat lovin', jigged up on Cupid
I know what we doin', gave my consent
Turn me out, babe, fuck me till I'm spent!

The feelings that I feel get me so damn twisted
Imma need what you got, or imma get sadistic
Let me get implicit about the logistic
Hit this good good, or imma blow, blow ballistic
I'm insistent, don't play resistant
Bend to my will, boo, 'cause imma go the distance
You got that spark when we in the dark
Make my muscles quiver, sensational spark

Devour my lust and trust my body
Ignite, combust, a combination body
Lean back, let you in; round two, go again
Baby, turn me out like a champion!
