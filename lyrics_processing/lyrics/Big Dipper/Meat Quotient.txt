This joint right here is a special song. Dedicated to all those guys out there who nourish my soul... And give me what I need. Hahahaha...

Ooooohhh!

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I got a hankerin'
Need to fill my plate
I'm sick of being vegetarian
I need something rough
And thick and wet and juicy
A five course meal
To make my ass so loosey-goosey
I'm feelin' extra
Carnivorous
My belly bloat nice and full
Once I get my fix
Some special sauce
That you can mix with this
My cravin' for crotch meat
Is growin' vigorous
I like my meat rare
A little bloody to boot
The best way to serve it up
Is in your birthday suit
You might also like(My-my-my) My ham hock thick
My tenderloin fresh
No expiration date
On this hairy butt-sex
Rough necks, use their cleavers
To keep my dick in check
I-I-I, I like my meat tender
Warm and wet, served on my chest
I'm butcherin' this shit
In first place I'm the best
Cut you open and skin you raw
Like I did all the rest

I need to meet my meat quotient
It's that kinda night
Need to meet my meat quotient
'Til I'm feelin' alright
Need to meet my meat quotient
Get my proteins up!
Need to meet my meat quotient
Yo, I'm tryin' to fuck!
I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm-I'm, I'm tryin' to fuck!
Yeah, I said it
I'm tryin' to get bucked
Got a load to deliver
Back up on this meat truck
When you see the meat I'm packin'
You shut the fuck up!
Filet Mignon?
More like show me that dong
Let me jerky your beef
And marinade on your shlong
I wanna lick on your brisket
Daddy, don't get it twisted
When we fuck wrap it up
'Cos Big Dipper don't risk it
Come inside my math class
Promise it'll be fun
Grab your meatball-sack
And I'll carry the one
Long division with precision
'Cos I'm a genius
If you just ask me nicely
I'll show you my penius...
You can grill it, fry it, bake it
Shake it, bring it to a boil
The meal is man meat
And the lube is olive oil
Touch my primal cuts
My shank and my tail
Fuck me like a prison bitch
Bet I'll never post bail
I need to meet my meat quotient
It's that kinda night
Need to meet my meat quotient
'Til I'm feelin' alright
Need to meet my meat quotient
Get my proteins up!
Need to meet my meat quotient
Yo, I'm tryin' to fuck!

Bang the beat
Beat ya meat
Grab yo' ankles
And take the heat
Bang the beat (I'm gaining weight tonight)
Beat ya meat (You'll get a taste tonight)
Grab yo' ankles (Put you through the meat grinder)
And take the heat (Fuck yo' face tonight)
I'm gaining weight tonight (I'm greasy, greasy)
You'll get a taste tonight (You wanna eat me, eat me)
Put you through the meat grinder (I'm greasy, greasy)
Fuck yo' face tonight (You wanna eat me, eat me)
Fuck-fuck yo' face tonight (Eat-eat me)
Fuck-fuck yo' face tonight (Eat-eat, eat me)
Fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck (Eat-eat-eat-eat me)
Fuck yo' face tonight (Eat me)

I-I-I-I, I grab this mic
Like I grab your attention
You'll get motivated
Like, this an intervention
Did I mention I'm a pig?
Need a spit and a roast
So when it comes to circumcision
You know I keeps it Kosher!
I'm hamburger helper
And you're my sloppy joe
Don't give me no fraction
'Cos I'm looking for that whole
Your butt is farm fresh
Your butt is what I'm after
Treat your butt like bovine
And I'll fuck you in the pasture
Fuck a salad
Imma toss your beef
Get to munchin' that ass
Give your dick some relief
I wanna be elbow deep
Up in your rump roast
Eat your tongue, round your junk
Strap you to the bedpost
(My-my-my) My meat is Grade Gay
You could eat the whole buffet
Put you on that slow cook
Like a gourmet bolognese
It's summertime dude
Get to stuffin' your face
And dessert is comin' quick
Leave room for green space!
