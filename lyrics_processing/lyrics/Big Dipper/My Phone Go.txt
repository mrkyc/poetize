Finally, don't get... okay I'm ready
Big Dipper in this bitch

Nasty is the way you really outta be
Classy is the show I give for ya'll to see
Rachet, so frontidly
Steady Tumblrin' comments bumblin'
My phone go ring-a-ding-a-ling-a-long-dong
Send me a ding-a-ling I'll sing my Dong Song
I'm looking for cock
And if you got an ass to fuck I'll stay hard as a rock
Come on and put a ring on it me
Then watch me deep throat and put a stank on it
Stanky leg, stanky eye, stanky ass smell it
Ripe in the pits, yeah that's my stanky guy
I'm Liberace on the mic
Trollin' for dick on the New Jersey turn pike
You got somethin' to say?
Hit me on MySpace but I don't swing that way

My phone go ring-a-ding-a-ling-a-long-dong
Ding-a-ling-a-long
Ding-ding-a-ling-a-long-dong

I'm a force to be reckoned with
Smellin' like bacon you wanna get a second whiff
Let's play the Hunger Games
'Cept I just wanna feed and eat some chocolate cake
I'm inspired by everyday occurrences
Breakfast, lunch and dinner
And the restaurant services
But for real though, all jokes aside
I want the number 5 meal
And make it super-sized
Thick Life, keeps in juicy
Big Dipper and you know I got that booty
Yeah you could try to sue me
Only thing I got for you is this juicy juicy
Ridin' clean, actin' dirty
The look is cute, fresh, fun and flirty
I'm a natural, so attractable
My sick flow is spreadin' quick, contractable
