Fat necks I'm cheesin'
My summer, that's my season
Flagrants need a reason
Keep puttin' all they keys in
It's locked, you tried
Stay out, I'm fired up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I'll take you to pound town
This that hit the ground sound
Dipper got that crown now
Start struttin' in my gown, ow
Don't fight, you tried
Just might, get fired up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I do it more
Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I do it more

Fuck this rap game, I'm up on this nap game
Tryna sleep on ya'll, you can dream on me
Sneak attack, Fag Gang
My swish is scandalous
And Sisqo can't even handle this
I been told that I'm so blasphemous
Let's do it again
Dip on the track, ride it gently
This beat put me in a frenzy
Don't tempt me, bubble butt
I wanna get that double entry
Stay pressed on my man though
He's mine, not yours, we can share though
This threesome is uneven
My secretion made to feed you
You might also like
Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I do it more
Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I

I dip, I slip, I slide, I ride
Pussy, so slippery
Shakin' my ass, I'm a super freak
Hoes up, this my song
I'm tryna fuck Ms. Milian
And I'm about to get these millions
Lotta bitches in the club
But I'm the baddest one
She workin' all that ass
That shit crazy
I dreamed about it for like two days
Dip It Low, and she go, both ways
I'mma take her home
And make her my sex slave
TT and Big Dipper 'bout to serve you
My pussy so good like perfume
You late, it's past your curfew
Pull them titties out
I'm about to nurse you
Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I do it more
Dip-dip-dip it low to floor
Like Christina Milian did
But I do it more
