Haha!
Yes homo
It's Big Dipper

They ain't ready, ah
They ain't ready
They ain't ready, ah
They ain't ready

They ain't ready for this goofy-ass dick
They ain't ready for my dirty side spit
They ain't ready for the way I get y'all lit
Best believe, they ready
They ain't ready for Big Dipper in the game
Switching gender pronouns, I like to fuck the same
To you, it's Mr. Big
Yeah, I know I'm bad
'Bout to pull the switch
When I meet ya dad
Get this ass pregnant
We could make a gay baby
It'll be imaginary
But we'll do it on the daily
Don't mince words
Let's be honest
When you look at me you see
A big, hairy, adonis!

They ain't ready, ah
They ain't ready
They ain't ready, ah-haha!
They ain't ready

Lookin' for religion
Prayin' to the skies
The truth's in you
Proselytize, on those thighs
Boy, you make me
Feel oh, so special
You make my dick stand up
Above my testicles
Dipper's back
Diggin' the crack
You skip, I'll hop
Flip you like a flapjack
I'm a workaholic, alcoholic
Sexoholic addict
Start to fiend a little
With my shit, we layin' static
On that new-new
Change up my hairdo
I wanna feel your dick hard
When I spoon you
Fuck a raven
I don't give a Poe
"That's so Dipper!"
Give me a Disney show
They ain't ready
They ain't ready
They ain't ready
They ain't ready

They ill equipped
They unprepared
They gettin' mad
They gettin' scared!

Oh shit!
Did you see me on the internet?
Oh boy!
Did I make you get your panties wet?
Oh Dad!
Did you just start to break a sweat?
Oh snap!
They ain't even ready yet

Haha!
There's no way they're ready!
They don't even know what ready is!
These motherfuckers is late!
