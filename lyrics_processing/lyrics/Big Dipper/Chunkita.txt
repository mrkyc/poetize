Oh, ya shakin' in ya boots
Jaw gappin' don't know what to do
Bitch yes I'm fine and yes I know it
And yes I grabbed your dick
Where you think you're goin?
I see you fall in lust after all  of me
Shape of my guts, feet wide 13s
My weight a plus, plus size a must
Trust I'll make you bust
With my robust thrust
46-38-50, it goes thicker, thick, thickest
I'm big you can't miss me
Every inch... beautiful
My flute fully tootable
Plump like a pastry, dough boy, tasty
You really wanna date me?
We do it ass to facey
Fall in line, laws of attraction
And boy bye if you ain't about that booty action

Excuse me dude, I don't mean to be rude
But yo you're just my type
So I'mma need you to move
Sittin' in the wrong spot boy I bet you forgot
That butt belongs on my face
Dinner time say Grace (Grace, grace, grace)
I'm on the prowl
Boo you know I'm nasty
Inquisitive askin' where that ass be?
Ahhh, I'm a Chunkita
You thick in the butt, you know I def wanna meet ya
Then eat ya seat, when I beat ya meat
Don't cheat the fleet, want your flavor sweet
Oh you triggered, tweet about it
Full figured, did you ever doubt it?
Sugar on my tits, grease my sweat
I'm what you dream about and we haven't yet met
Are you listening to the song that I sung?
I need one thing, your hole on my tongue
You know who I am, Chunkita

Bend at the waist, put that ass in my face
