Intimate (Ha) let's get into it
This my night, feelin' really lusty
Been waitin' on a grown man to touch me
See you out, got me thinking
Suavemente got me winkin'
No sweat, starts with a kiss
Moustache tickle your lips
Your big pecs drive me wild
My back hair make you smile
So special, the stars aligned
It's a sign how them shorts fit tight up on your thighs
Wide set eyes, beefy body
Drink drink a nut and tell everybody
Intimate, let's get into it (Ha ha)
Intimate, let's get into it (Let's get into it)
Intimate (Come on baby)
Intimate (Let's do it)
Intimate (Ha) let's get into it (Let's get)

Playing games, cat and mouse
This round is full contact
'Cause your tongue never leave my mouth
Lappin' me up, dehydrated
Lickin' my fade, intoxicated
All about that B-F-E
Boy Friend Experience, drive you crazy
The way you grunt and moan
Make me never wanna cum alone
Let's get intimate
Skimmy skimmy share
Ride 'em cowboy, City Slickin' it, Billy Crystal
