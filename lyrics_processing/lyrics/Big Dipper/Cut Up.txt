Cut up, we gon' cut up
Act stupid in the spot, cause a ruckus
Cut up, we gon' cut up
Scream your butt off, throw you gut up, stand the fuck up
Cut up, we gon' cut up
Act stupid in the spot, cause a da-da-da-da

Yeah, there's a dick on my shirt
Yes, this a fishnet skirt
Wear stripper clothes out in the club
Or in line at the bakery getting dessert
We here, we queer, get used to it
Oozing it, no excusing it
Engrained in the DNA
Y'all change your ways
Red states just ruined it
Get loud, get mad, get goofy
Not Jack Black and this ain't no movie
Been working for minute on my dumb reputation
Now it's finally time to get choosey
Don't fool with me, not cute to me
It's all fucked up so beautifully
Every time my dick slide up in a booty
I'm showing out for the community

Da-da-da-da
Cut up (Uh) we gon' cut up (Yeah)
Act stupid in the spot, cause a ruckus (Brrr)
Cut up, we gon' cut up (What love?)
Scream your butt off, throw you gut up, stand the fuck up
Cut up, we gon' cut up (Brr, brr)
Act stupid in the spot, cause a da-da-da-da (Brrr)

Just ran this red light kissing girls in the night
Yeah they might be straight but they really want this dyke
I make 'em black out, I make 'em scream and shout
Then we all act a fool, ding dong, schools out
We all wildin' out, brain cells knocked out
Then we stealin' daddies beer like the fridge had a drought
Skip church to smoke weed, I still got her on her knees
At the mall, bitch please, I stole my mommy's keys
I dress like a boy, so respect me
I kiss my girl in public, you ain't know she ain't my bestie
I might change, 'cause yeah this shit is fluid
So if you got a problem suck my dick and then chew it

Cut up, we gon' cut up
Act stupid in the spot, cause a da-da-da-da
Oh shit, won't stop this commotion
Fight back just like that, faggots in motion
We didn't just appear
Ignorance is fueled by fear
I will be loud, I will be proud
I will expose my derriere
When they attack, gotta strike back
Out here suckin' dick as a political act
Far from obscene, being seen as a queen
I find beauty in unity, with my hands in your boo-t-t-ty

Ah, booty, booty
My booty
Booty, booty, booty, booty
My booty
Booty, booty, booty, booty
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(I-I-I-I-I'm so plump)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(What you want?)
Like what you want, ow
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(I-I-I-I-I'm so plump)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(What you want?)
Like what you want
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(I-I-I-I-I'm so plump)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(What you want?)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(I-I-I-I-I'm so plump)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(What you want?)
I know what you want, you want this ass so plump
Booty, booty, booty, booty
(I-I-I-I-I'm so plump)
Booty, booty, booty, booty
