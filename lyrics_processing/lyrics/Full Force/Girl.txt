You know, girl
I'm dedicating this song to you because I love you
And I'm so sorry that I treated you wrong
You see, well
Well, what I'm really tryna say is
I know it's my fault that you decided to leave
But I hope it's only temporary
A-a-and I've realized that you never know how much you love a person until you lose them
Oh, girl

Girl, I called you up to say
That I'm havin' trouble sleepin' ever since you went away
Girl, I know you need a little time
To get your head together, baby, I can't stop cryin', yeah

Girl, why'd you go away?
What can I say to make you stay?
Girl, I was a fool, don't know what to do
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Still in love, so in love
I-I, I'm in love
Yeah
I'm missing you baby
You might also like
Girl, I guess I was a fool to try to tie you down
And make you play by rules
Girl, I guess I now realize
Keepin' you close to me would keep me alive

Girl, why'd you go away?
What can I say to make you stay?
Now now, girl, I was a fool, don't know what to do
Still in love with you, don't know what I'm gonna do, no, no, no

Girl, I was a fool
Don't know what to do
Still in love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
No, no, no, no-no, no, no-no, no
Girl, oh, no (Girl, what can I say?)
What can I say, baby? (To make you stay)
Oh, oh, please, baby, stay, baby
Stay here, stay here (Girl)
Because I'm still in love
Still in love, still in love
Ooh, baby, I just need you by my side
I just need you, need you, need you, need you, need you
No-no, need, no-no, need you
When times get rough, huh (Girl)
I need your good stuff, your good stuff
It's good
G-g-good, g-g-good
Down on my knees, baby
I'll be down on my knees
Oh, your stuff is so good I can write my name in it
I wanna grab you right there, grab you over here
I wanna put your body right there and pull your hair
Ooh, baby
Oh, ooh-oh, baby
Oh, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no, oh, baby
Still in love with you
Called you up to say, baby, still I love you
Still in love, love, love, love (Still in love, still in love)
