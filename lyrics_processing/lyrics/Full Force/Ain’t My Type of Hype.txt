Full Force get hype
Yeah, this is ECROF
And Full Force wanted me to come
Down and help them blow something up
So if ya' with that
Let's kick that

Yeah, ya' look good
But can ya' cook good?
Can ya' read or is your brain like wood?
Do ya' have sex?
Or do ya' make love?
How do ya' live?
Do ya' give or do ya' take love
Girl, you so fine
Could you be?
Or do I slack in the back of a
W-wic-wic-wack line
Yeah, the fruit looks right but that...
Ain't my type of hype
Yea right

Act your age
Not the size of those pants your wear
So tight
(You look ripe - yeah)
But getting everywhere you walk around
With your head on up in the sky
Oh why ya wanna mess around with so many guys

We used to have fun
Thought you'd be the one
To be by my side
But o-o-o-h I was wrong
I thought your love was strong
But it was so weak that I could not compete
Girl you're such a freak h-ho ho oh

You look so good
(You look so good. I wish could but that just)
Ain't my type of hype
(Me and you was crazy cool)
Your love's so fine (You blow my mind but that)
Ain't my type of hype baby
Ain't my type of hype
Go Go
Go Go
Two Times
Go Go
Go Go
(Too Fast)

Don't play (don't play)
With the sucker you think I am
A girl like you just has to have
More than one man
This I know
But I can't hang
Girl, the type of hype
That ya' giving
Ain't the way I'm livin baby

We use to be tight
Everything was right
Used to make love
Each and every night
(Baby ya know)
We were so good to go
(So good to go)
But understand this ain't no fashion show
Ya' acting like a ho-oh-oh-oh

You look so good
(You look so good, I wish I could but that just)
Ain't my type of hype
(Me and you was crazy cool)
Oh, You love's so fine. (You blow my mind but that ain't)
Ain't my type of hype baby
Ain't my type of hype
Go Go
Hype
Full Force get hype (we're correct this time)
Hype

(Hype)
You're just a type of propaganda
In the land of supply and demand'a
Girl without a mind, ain't human
You gotta be more than a butt just booming
Assuming there's room in
My life for a lover
Undercover
Not the one that'll hover over me like a bird
Full Force says...
(Word)
Uh-uh
I ain't with that
Yes girl, ya better kick that

We used to have fun
Thought you'd be the one to be by be by my side
Forever (ooooh)

Ya wasting my time baby when all along
You're so freak-y (oooooh)
