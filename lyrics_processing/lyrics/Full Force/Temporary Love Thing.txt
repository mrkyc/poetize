Oooh! Yeah! Yeah!
Once upon a time I was happy and so satisfied
I never thought about loving another
But i'm only human and oh I get so lonely
Passion starts to unfold so...
If you can't be
With the one you love
They say
You got to love the one your with
Or l am I moving to fast
Just the same baby what's your name
I think I want to know you
Cause darlin I just can't wait no more
Nooo
Ain't nothing wrong with a temporary love thing
In one night
I can love you forever
Ooh
Nothing's wrong with a temporary love thing
Can't you see I want you
Just for me
You might also likeI'm so tired of giving up all my precious time
To a rhythm that's got no rhyme
Seeking everlasting love
In all the wrong places
Much to my surprise
Living in my eyes
Was you
And never before has passion taken over me
And I don't really know you
Just the same baby; what's your name
And please give me your number
Cause on the lonely nights, I'll give you a ring
Oooohhh!
Ain't nothing wrong with a temporary love thing
(You know)
In one night i can love you forever
(No no no no no, no no no no no!)
Nothings wrong with a temporary love thing
Can't you see i want you
Just for me
Come on babe
Oooh!
If you can be with the one, you love
You got to love the one your with
L am moving too fast
Just the same my baby; what's your name
Please give me your number
On the lonely nights, I'll give you a ring
Oooh
Ain't nothing wrong with a temporary love thing
(Ooh, babe)
In one night
I can love you forever
(Oh girl, you know)
Nothing's wrong with a temporary love thing
Can't you see I want you
Just for me (for me)
Mother mother
Temporary love thing
There's no other
If needing you is wrong
I don't want to be right
Temporary love thing
More than one night with you...
So hard so hard to be without you
Temporary Love
This time this time
Can't you see I'm in love?
Can't you see I'm in love ( I can't live without you)
I want you just for me
Ain't nobody
Temporary Love
Yes, I love you
I love you, I love you
Ooh girl
