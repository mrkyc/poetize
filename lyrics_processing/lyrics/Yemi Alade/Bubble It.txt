Sweet like sugar, sweet like sugar
Sweet like, sweet like, sweet sugar
Sweet like sugar, sweet like sugar
Sweet like, sweet like, sweet sugar

Take your waist to the ground and your hands on your back
Wiggle it around, give a man a heart attack
Bring it up slow, bend down low
Kack it, kack it up some more, wiggle, wiggle on the floor
When we link up, link up, it's a stick up, stick up
'Bout to get my freak on, lemme get my liquor
Anabella, get on your feet and shake your bum-bum-bum
That your waistline, break it like a tom-tom-tom
Usain Bolt on beat, me a instrumental beast
Running through your speakers like I'm looking for a feast
With a ice like wow, bad to the bone
It's a stampede when me pull up on the scene
'Cause me sweet like sugar, sweet like sugar
Sweet like, sweet like, sweet sugar
Sweet like sugar, sweet like sugar
Me tasty, me sweet, me (Sweet like sugar)
