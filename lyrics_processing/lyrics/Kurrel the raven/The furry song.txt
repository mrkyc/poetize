This is the sound of the rhythm, it's what ya're been driven
Now listen up!
I want to tell you all about my tribe as misrepresentened by Entourage, 4chan and CSI!
Ya wanna know about furries, well I'll tell ya now
Ya come to the right bird to know what being furry is about
And ya better listen good
Or ya won't understand what must be understood
To make sense of all the references
Coming up in the songs I'll be presenting
So pay attention to this information
Here's the short version for the impatient
Furries are an Internet subculture
Who are fans of anthropomorphic animal characters
And they bring them to life in any way they can
In costumes, illustration, roleplay and animation
Anthropomorphic means like human
But not entirely quite human
So animal mascots or animal cartoons
Are the kind of characters I mean to refer to
And every furry has a character like this
A character that they identify with
And that's their furry identity
Yes that's who they are to the furry community
La la la la la la la
We're furry
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
We're furry
La la la la la la la
Listen up!
The spaces we express and share our furriness
Are on the Internet, that's where so many furries get
Together in thousands in online communities
Like Second Life, FurryMUCK or Fur Affinity
Virtual international space
And it's hard to discriminate
Nobody knows your gender or race
When you're a talking animal instead of a human face
And we have real world conventions
Like Anthrocon or Further Confusion
In the Furry Autonomous Zone
Alongside your own kind, ya know that you're not alone
When it comes to the details, we may disagree
We're as diff'rent from each other as we can be
In our interests, in our sexuality,
You may have heard the myth but this is the reality:
There's all kinds of furries,
no matter what you've heard,
We all find our own place
In the furry universe,
For some furries their space
Is kinky or perverse
But it's not always that way
'Coz furries are diverse
We are people playing pretend
That's all it is in the end
Every furry's got their own motivation
For participation in the furry congregation
La la la la la la la
We're furry
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
We're furry
