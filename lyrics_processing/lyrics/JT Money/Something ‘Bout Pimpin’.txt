That's right
We pimpin' on wax, bitch (Believe that)
$hort Dog in the house
Chillin' with my nigga JT Money (For sure)
What's up, Money? (What's up, Dog?)
All these hoes know what's goin' on (You know it)
They recognize
Tell 'em what's on your mind, mayne (Yo)

I got a problem with this punk-ass bitch I know
Old no good scandalous switch out ho
An untrustworthy bitch like Delilah
Only thing she good for is puttin' dick inside her
Motherfuckin' face, bitch got some good neck
But the little trick need to learn some respect
She made me beat her ass, take a nigga out his game
See, I don't beat my hoes 'cause all my hoes is tame
But this one act like she don't understand
You is the bitch, me, I'm the man
Remember that shit, then learn to submit
And that's when you stop gettin' your funky ass kicked
Little hard headed trick, see, a nigga know 'bout ya
And I know a dollar bill'll bring the ho out ya
Then you got the nerve to claim you better than the rest of my hoes
When you ain't even in the rankin' of the best of my hoes

That makes me love this game (Feel me now)
Somethin' about pimpin' (Hoes need to learn some respect)

Somethin' about pimpin'
'Cause this player's gotta keep a fat knot for sure (Why is $hort short?)

I'm like JD Walker
Pimp hat to the right, smooth talker
Bitches workin' all night like a stalker
Gettin' every last nickel, dime and quarter
Pimpin' ain't hardly nothin' new to me
Used to be a little kid watchin' movies
I knew what I wanted in life
'Bout nine or ten hoes, I ain't want no wife
I used to walk real cool like my leg was broke
And I still do, now I get paid from hoes, bitch
If I say so
You better get up, get out and go get my dough
'Cause this east side nigga don't care
Since I was nine years old, I been a player
And now I got a lot of women
It's never endin', it's just somethin' 'bout this pimpin'
Somethin' about pimpin' (Bitch)
That makes me love this game (You like yourself)
Somethin' about pimpin' (You'll live longer, trust me)
These hoes be off the chain (Haha)
Somethin' about pimpin'

'Cause this player's gotta keep a fat knot for sure

Now, one time for you H-Os
Who wanna try a real player 'bout his pesos, hey hoes
I know you in this game tryin' to come up, pick a come up
Got these niggas 'bout to nut up for some cut ups
So what up? All I wanna do is get this money with ya
I'm dead serious, I ain't tryin' to be funny with ya
I teach the game, but It ain't for free
When I see you have some change, you just bring it to me
See we can come up in this game and you can get hurt ho
When you in public, just remember who you work for
Because all them type of other cats gonna come try to holler
So-called ballers flashin' they dollars
Hatin' J, baby, you just play it crazy
Let him spend his loot on them boots so you can pay me
All I want is the bread, he want the pussy and head
Don't be misled, just remember everything I said, bitch
