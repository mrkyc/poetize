You change your mind a thousand times
I'm still around, I don't know why
I've lost my mind
But here we go again, again, ah

Talk and talk
Your brain is off, our loss, loss
Up and down, I need you now
You're gone, gone

I've got a boyfriend
He's got a ADD love
Can't keep his focus on me love
I wish I could set him free of ADD love
He's looking left, right
Every night, he can't see love
He better pay attention to me 'cause
I'm the cure he's in need of, ADD love

All I want is you to see
You need a double dose of me
A little love psychology
It's true, you do, ow!
