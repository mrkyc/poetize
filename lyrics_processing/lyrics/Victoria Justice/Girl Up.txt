Looking out of a dirty window
It's not much, but it's all I've known
Close my eyes and I see a rainbow
But I can't reach the pot of gold
All the things that we take for granted
All the things we don't really need
Those are the things they've always wanted
Loved girl will replant the seed
The more I think about it
They are just like me

We all need love
We all need hope
We all have dreams

And now I'm lyring sleepless
Just trying to figure it out
If you think about it
It doesn't take much
To help a girl up
Just a little bit of heart and soul
We gotta let them know
It's enough about us
Yeah we can help a girl up
We can help a girl up
Help a girl, help a girl up
Help a girl, help a girl up

Don't you know?
If a man can move a mountain
We can start an avalanche
Throw a penny in the fountain
One wish
One helping hand
The more I think about it
They are just like me

We all need love
We all need hope
We all have dreams

And now I'm lying sleepless
Just trying to figure it out
If you think about it
It doesn't take much to help a girl up
Just a little bit of heart and soul
We gotta let them know
It's enough about us
Yeah we can help a girl up

All the girls in the world stand up
When one of us hurts speak up
Let your voice be heard, don't give up
'Cause together we can help a girl up!
'Cause together we can help a girl up!
And now I'm lying sleepless
Just trying to figure it out
If you think about it
It doesn't take much
To help a girl up
Just a little bit of heart and soul
We gotta let them know
It's enough about us
Yeah we can help a girl up
We can help a girl up

All the girls in the world stand up
When one of us hurts speak up
Let your voice be heard, don't give up
'Cause together we can help a girl up!
