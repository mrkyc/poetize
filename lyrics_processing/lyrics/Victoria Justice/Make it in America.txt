Got a one-way ticket down a two-way street
Got the wind in my hair and there's dust on my feet
I'm just tryin' to make it in America
Only thing to my name is an old t-shirt
Faded 1985 from a Stones' concert
And I'm dyin' to make it in America

And I'm singin' the words to my favorite song
With the rag top down and my glasses on
And I'm drivin' straight through America

I wanna taste the sun
'Cause, baby, I'm born to run
I got a feelin' that I'm not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin
Yeah, baby, I need the ocean
But you can't stop me now I've got my heart in motion
And I want to make it in America
Make it in America

I can see my star sunset and vine
Gonna carve my name in the Hollywood sign
Yeah, I gotta, gotta make it in America
See me wearin' a smile, even if I'm broke
I'll be singin' the words from a song I wrote
And I called it "Make It In America"

I wanna taste the sun
'Cause, baby, I'm born to run
I got a feelin' that I'm not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin
Yeah, baby, I need the ocean
But you can't stop me now I've got my heart in motion
And I wanna make it in America
Yeah, make it in America

I can feel the sweat drippin' down my face
I can hear my heart as it starts to race
And sometimes this world's such a lonely place
If I just push on, I know that

I wanna taste the sun
'Cause, baby, I'm born to run
I got a feelin' that I'm not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin (Show some skin)
Yeah, baby I need the ocean
But you can't stop me now I've got my heart in motion
And I wanna make it in America (Make it in America)
