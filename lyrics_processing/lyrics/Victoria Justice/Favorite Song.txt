Stuck here looking at the clock
Going crazy cause I'm waiting for the bell to ring
Should be happy but I'm not
Sometimes I just get sick and tired of everything

I need a new scene
I need a new sound
Get me to the party
And everything will be alright

I got all my friends with me tonight
And the vibe in here is out of sight
So c'mon DJ make it right
Just play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
Play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song

What a nice daydream
But I'm still stuck here in reality
Cause time doesn't fly
Especially when you got a better place to be
You might also like
I need a new scene
I need a new sound
Get me to the party
And everything will be alright

I got all my friends with me tonight
And the vibe in here is out of sight
So c'mon DJ make it right
Just play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
Play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song

What can you do when the world gets to you
Turn it up
What do you say when things don't go your way
Turn it up
So what we gonna tell the DJ?
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

I got all my friends with me tonight
And the vibe in here is out of sight
So c'mon DJ make it right
Just play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
Play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
Play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
Play my favorite song
DJ, DJ play my favorite song
Nothing can go wrong when you play my, play my favorite song
What can you do when the world gets to you
Turn it up
What do you say when things don't go your way
Turn it up
So what we gonna tell the DJ?
