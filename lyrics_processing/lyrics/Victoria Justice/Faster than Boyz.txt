"Can I have a map? I'm gettin' lost in your eyes"
That's the first thing you said
And when I looked up, yeah, it was no surprise
So much hair-gel was applied to your head

"I'm a V.I.P.," that's what you told me
But I only see a visitor's pass
Here's a tip for free since you don't know me
And even though you didn't ask

'Cause I'm movin' faster, faster, faster, faster than boys (Boys)
You're basically a disaster, 'saster
You leave me no choice (No choice)
You leave me no
No, no, no, no, oh, woah
Yeah, you, you've got to go
Faster, faster, faster, faster than boys (Faster than boys)

I don't have the time to be waitin' around
For someone with a fake I.D
Seriously, you need to get out of town
This picture's just a little creepy

I love Hall and Oates, you like Spaghetti O's
Somethin' tells me we don't fit
Here's a tip for free since you don't know me
I think you're gonna catch on quick (Ow)

'Cause I'm movin' faster, faster, faster, faster than boys (Boys)
You're basically a disaster, 'saster
You leave me no choice (No choice)
You leave me no
No no, no, no, oh, woah
Yeah, you, you've got to go
Faster, faster, faster, faster than boys (Faster than boys)

It's not me, it's you
Why you gotta look so sad?
I can't lie, it's true
Your pick-up line was just that bad
So get on with it, 'cause I'm just a waste of your time (Time)
Penny for my thoughts, when I should have charged a dime
Oh

'Cause I'm movin' faster, faster, faster, faster than boys (Boys)
You're basically a disaster, 'saster
You leave me no choice (No choice)
You leave me no
No, no, no, no, oh, woah
Yeah, you, you've got to go
