Sneak through my door when my parents are home
I couldn't wait for this moment alone with you
Again, again, again
A quick kiss goodbye. it's all over too fast
It's stupid, it's crazy, they don't understand
It's true, the way I feel for you

Everyday I wait at three
In a coffee shop on a crowded street

Cause you know that you got my heart, I don't want it to show
You're holding my hand now but nobody knows, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret
That look in your eyes now is all that we need
Hide it away so that nobody sees, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret

Running in circles this game that we play
Our hide and seek, I could do it all day with you
Again, again, again
The moment they spot us our cover is blown
It's useless, it's pointless, just leave us alone, okay
I can't live that way
You might also like
Everyday I wait at three
At a coffee shop on a crowded street

Cause you know that you got my heart, I don't want it to show
You're holding my hand now but nobody knows, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret
That look in your eyes now is all that we need
Hide it away so that nobody sees, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret

I wanna run away with you tonight
It's just you and me tonight
I wanna laugh till I cry, jump till I fly
And do it all again
I wanna run away with you tonight

Cause you know that you got my heart, I don't want it to show
You're holding my hand now but nobody knows, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret
That look in your eyes now is all that we need
Hide it away so that nobody sees, uh-oh, uh-oh
Our little secret
Cause you know how I'm feeling
And I know you won't give it away, uh-oh
Our little secret
Cause you know how I'm feeling
And I know you won't give it away, uh-oh
