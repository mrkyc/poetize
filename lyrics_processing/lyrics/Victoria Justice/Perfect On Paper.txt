Can you hear me?
'Cause I'm screamin'
And it's bleedin' from the top of my lungs
Do I even know who you are?
Would you catch me if I'm fallin'?
'Cause I think I'm about to jump
How did we get this far?

I thought we could fix it later
'Cause it looks so good, perfect on paper
There was always somethin' missin' from the start, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I thought life did us a favor
'Cause it looks so good, perfect on paper
But it wasn't on your mind or on your heart
It wasn't on your heart

Are you happy in the silence?
Can you see me in the dark?
I don't even know where you are
Have we lost it? Is it broken?
Tired of waitin' for the spark
How did it get so hard?

I thought we could fix it later
'Cause it looks so good, perfect on paper
There was always somethin' missin' from the start, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I thought life did us a favor
'Cause it looks so good, perfect on paper
But it wasn't on your mind or on your heart

I don't wanna try to fix this later
I don't really wanna work this out
I don't wanna try to fix this later
I just know I can't be with you now
Now, now
I thought we could fix it later
'Cause it looks so good, looks so good, oh

I thought we could fix it later
'Cause it looks so good, perfect on paper
There was always somethin' missin' (Somethin' missin') from the start, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
I thought life did us a favor
'Cause it looks so good (Looks so good, yeah), perfect on paper
But it wasn't on your mind or on your heart
It wasn't on your heart
(Ah, ah, ah, oh-oh) I don't really wanna work this out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh) I just know I can't be with you now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't wanna try to fix this later (Ah, ah, ah, oh-oh)
I don't really wanna work this out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
