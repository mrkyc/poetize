Huh, ohhh whoa
Let me tell you now, ooooh
Ooooh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me?
(Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms

(I want you back)
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me?
(Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, oh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh (I want you back)
Forget what happened then (I want you back)
Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now, since I see you in his arms (I want you back)
Spare me of this 'cause (I want you back)
Give me back what I lost

Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell you that I love you
Now baby, oh, baby, oh, baby
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
