Uh, lately everybody's so self-conscious
People talk about each other so heartless
But I don't want to hear those conversations
I just want to feel the good vibrations
Whatever happened to the simple pleasures?
It's hard to live when there's so much pressure
But I don't want to think about the ending
'Cause every moment is a new beginning

Oh, oh
You know life's too short to be complicated
Oh, oh
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes you gotta

Shake, shake what your mama gave you
Pull out your Michael J. moves
And dance with the record on
Sometimes you gotta get down, down at the supermarket
Even if there's people watchin'
Just because you like the song

Sometimes, you gotta just
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Sometimes, you gotta just
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
You might also like
Yeah, do we really even know what matters
When we're stuck inside the same old patterns?
You know it's easy to forget that feelin'
When the kid in your heart stops screamin'
Doesn't matter if you're six or sixty
It doesn't matter if you're rich or thrifty
If the moment feels right, just do it
Who cares if you're lookin' foolish?

Oh, oh
You know life's too short to be complicated
Oh, oh
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes you gotta

Shake, shake what your mama gave you
Pull out your Michael J. moves
And dance with the record on
Sometimes you gotta get down, down at the supermarket
Even if there's people watchin'
Just because you like the song

Sometimes, you gotta just
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Sometimes, you gotta just
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Oh, oh
Tell me, is it wrong if it makes you feel right?
You'll never know if you don't even try
Let it go, you might find that you like to

Shake, shake what your mama gave you
Pull out your Michael J. moves
And dance with the record on
Sometimes you gotta get down, down at the supermarket
Even if there's people watchin'
Just because you like the song
Sometimes you gotta just
Shake, shake what your mama gave you
Pull out your Michael J. moves
And dance with the record on
Sometimes you gotta get down, down at the supermarket
Even if there's people watchin' (Hey)
Just because you like the song (Just because you like the song)

Sometimes you gotta just shake, shake a little, shake a little now
Shake, shake a little, shake a little now
(Sometimes you gotta shake)
Shake, shake a little, shake a little now
Whoa
Shake, shake a little, shake a little now
