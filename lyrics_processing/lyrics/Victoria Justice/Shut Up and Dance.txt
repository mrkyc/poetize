It's nine on the dot and we just talk and we talk
And I just want it to stop
Cause aren't we here for the music
And if you dare
Just get up out of your chair
Cause this ain't goin' nowhere
We've gotta move or you lose it

All I wanna know (know)
Is when we're letting go
So we can get this record to break (break)
Why we wasting time (time)
We never can rewind (wind)
All I'm really trying to say is

Shut up and dance show me whatcha got
Shut up and dance are you in or not?
You're moving your mouth, baby, don't speak
Well, shut up and dance if you're into me
Cause I can't wait no more
To get on the floor
Don't stop now's our chance!
Shut up and dance, dance, dance
You might also like
We're here for the night
And we can do what we like
So don't you put up a fight
Cuz I'll be drivin you crazy
What would you do
When I get up next to you
You like the way that I move
I'm not your girl but I could be

All I wanna know (know)
Is when we're letting go
So we can get this record to break (break)
Why we wasting time (time)
We never can rewind (wind)
All I'm really trying to say is

Shut up and dance show me whatcha got
Shut up and dance are you in or not?
You're moving your mouth, baby, don't speak
Well, shut up and dance if you're into me
Cause I can't wait no more
To get on the floor
Don't stop now's our chance!
Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yeah
Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yeah
Shut up and dance...
'Til we drop cause I'm sick of the space in between
You and me, light it up, till we're making a scene
Quit the talk
Let it rock
If you know what I mean

Shut up and dance show me whatcha got
Shut up and dance are you in or not?
You're moving your mouth, baby, don't speak
Well, shut up and dance if you're into me
Cause I can't wait no more
To get on the floor
Don't stop now's our chance!

Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yeah
Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yeah
Put up your hands, hands, hands, yeah
Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yeah
