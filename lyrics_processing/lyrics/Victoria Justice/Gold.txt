I've been trying to let it go
But these butterflies I can't ignore
'Cause every time that I look at you
Know we're in a catch 22
We've been friends for so long but I
Need to tell you what's on my mind
I'm sick and tired of playing games
'Cause I know that you feel the same

I know you inside out, so I'm asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, what you gon' do?
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm gold, gold
You, me, good as can be, wanna be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm gold, gold

Do I really need to spell it out?
My heart skips when you're around
I got everything that you need
So come on baby get close to me
So confused that I'm not surprised
From greater bells, and you rolled the dice
Know all your moves, don't know why I fall
Should put me out, but I want it all
You might also like
I know you inside out, so I'm asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, what you gon' do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm gold, gold
You, me, good as can be, wanna be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm gold, gold

La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
I'm gold, gold
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
I'm gold, gold

Been too cool just to tell you straight out
But by now I wish you figured it out
I wish you figured it out, I wish you figured it out
I wish ya
You're not a fool, you see what I'm about, so by now I think you figured it out
I think you figured it out, I think you figured it out
I think ya, Yeah!
Hey, boy, what you gon' do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm gold, gold
You, me, good as can be, wanna be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm gold, gold

La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
I'm gold, gold
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-da-da-doo
La-ra-da-la-ra-da-da-doo
