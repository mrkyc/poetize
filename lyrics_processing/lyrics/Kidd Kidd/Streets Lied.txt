This for my young niggas
Young and wild, running wild

The streets lied to you dog
Shit it lied to us all
You see the money and the cars
Not the guns and jail balls
No loyalty or love in it
But its a lot of pain and drugs in it
Taking two to the head, is like taking two to the head
If them niggas, don't catch up to you
And kill you, it's going to be the mayors
I'm dead serious, he ain't take me serious
Now he dead
Nigga hit him eight times, he ain't move
Fast enough on the zants
He died with his gun in his hand
They put crying emojis under his
Last pic on the gram

Nigga should have went to school
Or something, got his gun and start
Posting like that's cool or something
Young niggas stressing for nothing
Talking about how shit real
You ain't even getting no money
Your mom and daddy still pay the bills
You might also like
The streets lied to you nigga
We're influenced by death
I could tell you what you going to do
I've been through it myself
But I can't tell you what to do
If I ain't do it myself, shit hurts
Can't practice what I'm preaching
When I barely even go to church
Hoping drugs take the pain away
But it only made it worse
Putting fentanyl on everything
Better stay away from them percs
Trying to slide on the opps
Bumping YB n' Lil Durk
None of them rappers going to be
At your funeral when you going in that dirt
You see that shit, Young Thug going through
In that courtroom, all that gang shit is old news
Don't be fooled

The streets lied to you dog
Screaming that gang shit, ya heard me
Your gang ain't going to be there
When it's time to really be there
For real, ya heard me, them niggas snitching
The streets lied to you dog
Shit they lied to us all
You see the money and the cars
But not the guns and jail balls
Ain't no loyalty or love in it
But its a lot of pain and drugs in it
Streets lied to you dog
Shit they lied to us all
Lied to us all, ya heard me

Ain't no loyalty in this shit no more
If your partner know you getting more
Money than him, guess what
He looking like you like a lick
For real, all you lil young niggas man
Come on man, you ain't even old
Enough to have responsibilities yet
You know i'm what saying
Y'all niggas don't know what pain is
You all don't even know what struggle is nigga
You know what I'm saying
For real you heard me
Stop trying to be down, man
Stop listening to all this bullshit
These niggas feeding y'all man
You heard me, there's a lot of ways
To get some bread out here

Especially if you from a good household
Nigga you got your mamma and your daddy
The fuck you doing out here wilding
