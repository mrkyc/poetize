The kid back at it, the mack rat-tat it
Like when yo phone drop, i'mma get it crackin'
Clip long as a movie for yall niggas who actin
Catch em late nght, like Jimmy Fallon
Fuck boy faggot no disrespect to match it
The red light flashin', will stop you like traffic
Niggas know whats happenin, police dont know what happened
I ain't a DJ but i'll start drama with this cannon
Stuntin like my daddy, fuckin on a baddie
Rollin up a fatty, yall woke up a savage
Nigga gotta get it cause I ain't never had it
Run up in yo house, put two up in yo attic

You want all the smoke I ain't talkin bout weed
I don't fear no nigga cause they bleed like me
Takin headshots like its for ya ID
Had a block taped off like a V.I.P
Tired of playin with this niggas lets go handle this shit
Got them drums on me like a band in this bitch
I'm bout to go dumb, go ham with them sticks
You stuntin' with the gun nigga pass me the shit

My temper can't control it, i'm not bendin or foldin
Walk, rental we rollin, hot pistols they stole it
Catch a body than throw it, hope nobody don't know it
I don't tote it to show it
I don't aim it to hold it
Let that mothafucka, blucka blucka blucka
Make a nigga bounce, like TT Tucker
N.O shit, i'm still on it
Its a couple of niggas I still wanna get
Off my list, I won't miss
Jam the clip in the Rouger the bitch won't fit
Now don't get split over no bitch
She just want the wood, you can get the stick
You might also like
You want all the smoke I ain't talkin bout weed
I don't fear no nigga cause they bleed like me
Takin headshots like its for ya ID
Had a block taped off like a V.I.P
Tired of playin with this niggas lets go handle this shit
Got them drums on me like a band in this bitch
I'm bout to go dumb, go ham with them sticks
