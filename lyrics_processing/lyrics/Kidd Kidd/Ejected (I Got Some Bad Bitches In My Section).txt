Tell all my haters this is payback
And I ain't talkin' givin' change back
I left the streets and then I came back
Hundred percent, you couldn't change that

I got some bad bitches in my section
A dozen bottles comin' my direction
Smoke presidential like I got elected
Young nigga ball so hard I got ejected
I got some bad bitches in my section
A dozen bottles comin' my direction
Smoke presidential like I got elected
Young nigga ball so hard I got ejected

I say all of my niggas trigger happy
We poppin' bottles like we shootin' at you
Since '95 I had a smokin' habit
That soft white, we call it Roger Rabbit
I know that work be lookin' good in traffic
You run up on me, I'ma let you have it
Ain't got no girlfriend, they too dramatic
And broke niggas causin' too much static

I'm stressin' out cause all my bitches love me, but it's lovely
Get that cheese, don't trust Chuck E., bitch don't touch nothin'
Come on pussy nigga, try your luck, better be lucky
Shut up, let the money talk, don't interrupt me
Eat that pussy like the last supper, we pour it up
My fruit punch got on brass knuckles, you heard me?
And if I make it through the night I pray I wake up
To a bad bitch with no makeup
And I'm geekin' like an A plus

A dozen bottles comin' my direction
Smoke presidential like I got elected

Won't a real nigga come on, 
Tell them bitches that I say that
They tried to say that I was worthless
And that my life, it had no purpose
They want indict me with the RICO
They say they caught me talkin' kilos
Me and my people off the east coast'll
Beat the game like a cheat code
Money never on vacation, my corner never vacant
Got what it takes to make it, I don't make it I'ma take it
I was local, I was nation, I went global, they start hatin'
I come from the end of somethin' so I spend

I got some bad bitches in my section
A dozen bottles comin' my direction
Smoke presidential like I got elected
Young nigga ball so hard I got ejected
I got some bad bitches in my section
A dozen bottles comin' my direction
Smoke presidential like I got elected
Young nigga ball so hard I got ejected

I got some bad bitches in my section
They say I ball so hard I got ejected
