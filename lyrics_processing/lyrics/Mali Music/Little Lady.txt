All you can count on is yourself little girl, little lady
I see the sparkle in your eyes
I can't wait to see you fly little lady
Life is but a dream right now (Little lady)
And then the years go by
10 turns to 15 and before you know you're 25
Your heart's been broken and you're terrified (Little Lady)
Gently down the stream (Miss Sadie)
Merrily, merrily, merrily (Little lady)
Life is but a dream (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Just a little girl (Miss Sadie) grown up in a cold, cold world (Little lady)
Where nothing is what it seems (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Lies, deception, and false truths are the substitutes of what used to be your lullabies
Can't distinguish the laughter from the cries
Bags under your eyes, so you use make-up to cover up what you cannot hide
Then you have daughters, and then they have sons, Who have daughters, and those are the ones,
Who have the opportunity to break the curses that make the mothers by purses with letters on them to show that they're not worth less
We did it
We drop the ball like a million times, ladies, I admit it
The blame's on man, no need to split the difference
But God's raising up men who really get it
We got the same haircuts, the same clothes, but trust me baby girl something's different
It's accepting that we are not in control
Giving our lives to the one who is
He wipes our noses and subdue our fears
Honestly that's all it really is
In our youth we had hopes too,
But some heroes never ever appear
Gently down the stream (Miss Sadie)
Merrily, merrily, merrily (Little lady)
Life is but a dream (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Just a little girl (Miss Sadie) grown up in a cold, cold world (Little lady)
Where nothing is what it seems
(Miss Sadie-Sit down and count the snowdrops falling on you
All you can count on is yourself little girl, little lady)
Gently down the stream (Miss Sadie)
Merrily, merrily, merrily (Little lady)
Life is but a dream (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Just a little girl (Miss Sadie) grown up in a cold, cold world (Little lady)
Well nothing is what it seems (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
(Sit down and count the snowdrops falling on you, little girl, you knew)
(All you can count on is yourself, little girl, little lady)
Gently down the stream (Miss Sadie)
Merrily, merrily, merrily (Little lady)
Life is but a dream (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Just a little girl (Miss Sadie) grown up in a cold, cold world (Little lady)
Where nothing is what it seems (Miss Sadie, Little lady)
Little lady (Miss Sadie) Miss Sadie (Little lady)
