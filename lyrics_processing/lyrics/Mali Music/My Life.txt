You know we spend a whole lot time
Thinking we living when we dead inside
We telling people what we seen
Telling people what he heard
But they're just lies
Because we are all deaf
And we so so blind

So in honor of the truth I'll tell it
Tell the people, tell 'em Imma get it
No one wants to hear it but I guess it's
Best that we go near it
It's seeming to be very very necessary
I mean it
And I'm on one
So come a lil' closer
Yes I'm on son
Holding with all my might
And I promise I ain't letting go
Til' I get what I ain't got no more
When need a peace of mind
Yeah I lost and now I'm looking for it
You might also like
Sometimes I feel like, I got no where to go
My days get dark and my nights get cold
That's when I need you
I know I'm running low
So if you got the peace, if you got the love
Say I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone

See we use a whole lot of energy trying to hold it all together
When the truth is busting out the seams
We call ourselves doing it
We call ourselves chasing dreams
It's crazy cause we all know in our hearts
It's never really what it seems

So instead of fronting more
Let's go back
Start from the beginning
Let's be honest
And tell what's happening
See we ain't on that
It's sad cause we've been fronting so long
Now we don't even know how to start on being real
But I got you
My head hurt and my back do to
And sometimes I don't know what I'm going to do
I worry, you worry
It's natural to worry
Cause life gets ugly, it ain't always pearly

Sometimes I feel like, I got no where to go
My days get dark and my nights get cold
That's when I need you
I know I'm running long
So if you got the peace, if you got the love
Say I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone

Ooh what's really happening (What's really happening)
Tell us what's going on (Won't you tell us what's going on)
I see you came and I'm glad you did
Cause I need you in my life
I need it in my life

Sometimes I feel like, I got no where to go
My days get dark and my nights get cold
That's when I need you
I know I'm running long
So if you got the peace, if you got the love
Say I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone
I need it in my life, my life, my life, alone

You know we spend a whole lot time
