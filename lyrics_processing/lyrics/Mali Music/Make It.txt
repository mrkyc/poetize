Jumping out of the frying pan into the fire
Always screaming out the devil is a liar
Truth is we've all lost touch
And I don't think the devil talkin' that much
People picturing their tits in K-Dash like clothes
To adorn your Lord's flesh
Million dollar homes,big checks
Nice whips,cash,sex
It's all you hearing 'bout on the radio
(Fifty million views,youtube)
Pop culture got the future lookin' scary, yo
(But hey, really yo what can you do?)
A lot! I don't know about you
But man, I put my whole heart
Into stopping this monotonous life
And with the work of no tending to sin
I'm tryna make it into heaven

Cause er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Anybody wanna go (yeah yeah)
Everybody tryna make it into heaven
Into heaven, nah (yeah yeah)
Into heaven, nah (Have mercy Lord)
You might also like
In this circle so much, I'm nauseous
I'm so sick of materialistic nonsense
So I made a whole disc of this, Mali is
Making the dead rise live, consciousness
Don't blink, keep watchin' this
He's always been there,yo my God in this
Turning skeptics in an optimistic class
Turning all the haters into boxing bags
Behold, I do a new thing
And the great-I-am is the true thing
Blood of Christ Red, it's the new Black
And Good is the New Bad
Well, in that case, you Bad
And man that boy stupad
And he's puttin' in work I'm tellin
Everyone's tryna make it into heaven, yeah?

Cause er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Anybody wanna go (yeah yeah)
Everybody tryna make it into heaven
Into heaven, nah (yeah yeah)
Into heaven, nah (Have mercy Lord)
This life ain't mine, it's Yours
Please have mercy, Lord
These lives ain't ours, they Yours
Please have mercy, Lord
Sometimes, lookin' at 'em, can't tell
He bought em with his life, seems like a bad cell
But He knows best, I give him mine
Maybe you should...ugh never mind
I gave him mine, that's enough
I rock with him, knuckle up
I'm comin' in, I've been knockin'
But no one answered, so I walked in
S'up! I'm movin' in
I got yo roll bones, throw 'em in
And im about to change a game, I'm tellin'
Cause everybody tryna make it into heaven

Cause er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Anybody wanna go (yeah yeah)
Everybody tryna make it into heaven
Into heaven, nah (yeah yeah)
Into heaven, nah (I miss you, God)
This life ain't mine, it's Yours
Please have mercy, Lord
These lives ain't ours, they Yours
Please have mercy, Lord
Cause er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Er'body wanna go (yeah yeah)
Anybody wanna go (yeah yeah)
Everybody tryna make it into heaven
Into heaven, nah (yeah yeah)
Into heaven, nah (yeah yeah)
