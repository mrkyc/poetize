Can't tell you where I'm going
But I'm walking down this lonely road
But at least the scenery is beautiful
And no matter what I do I can't stop walking no
I know it's the only way to go
And if I keep walking I'mma be ok
It's not always about knowing why
Sometimes it's all about knowing what
And that's enough to keep you walking everyday
Yeah I believe, I believe
But it's a dream that I ain't seen yet
Chasing a dream that I ain't dreamed yet
But I'mma meet it halfway if I keep on walking, walking, walking
If I keep on walking now, yeah i know it when i see it walking, walking when I see it walking on
Always waiting for something good to find you
But if it don't come what are you gone do
And that's why I'm walking, walking
Gotta keep walking on
(Walking shoes, walking shoes)
Hey, I tell you when you've got a made up mind
Even though winter feels like summertime
In the night you see the light of day
Cause I've been blind for way to long
And you can't take my light away
Even though all my times aren't happy times
I get unsure and hope for brighter days
I never let it slow my pace
So knowing failure ain't an option
And I've been promised
And I'm on my way up
Said I believe, I believe
But it's a dream that I ain't seen yet
Chasing a dream that I ain't dreamed yet
But I'mma meet it halfway if I keep on walking, walking, walking
If I keep on walking now, yeah i know it when I see it walking, walking when I see it walking on
Always waiting for something good to find you
But if it don't come what are you gone do
And that's why I'm walking, walking
Gotta keep walking on, walking
(Walking shoes, walking shoes)
Step 2, step 2, step 3
Step 1, step 2, step 3
(Walking shoes, walking shoes)
Thy Word's a light unto my path
A lamp unto my feet
These shoes, these shoes, these shoes my shoes
(Walking shoes, walking shoes)
Walking towards the promise
Walking towards much better land
Said I believe, I believe
But it's a dream that I ain't seen yet
Chasing a dream that I ain't dreamed yet
But I'mma meet it halfway if I keep on walking, walking, walking
If I keep on walking now, yeah I know it when I see it walking, walking when I see it walking on
Walking shoes, walking shoes
Walking shoes, walking shoes
