(Everywhere I go)
Man it's crazy
(Everybody like whoa)
There go Mali Music and I'm like (whoa)
'Cause I don't even know I made it yet for folks to act like that ya'll
(Favor) I'm so glad that song blessed ya
Thank you and God bless ya
But, I'm really wondering what you see
When you lay eyes on me (Oh)
Do you see my shoes? (Oh)
The clothes on my back? (Oh)
Do you see my swagger?
Then you looking at flesh
But I walk in the Spirit
I live for the King
It's in Him I move and have my very being

Steadily wondering why you can't see me
Tryna figure out what it is about me
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
Stop tryin to figure me out, It ain't me y'all
It's all about God, and The Light don't clap off
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
BLING!

Don't need an introduction
Don't want an introduction
Because with an introduction...
You have the tendency to get sucked in
To what you're about to hear
To what you're about see
What I'm about to do
But it ain't about me
When I sing or when I speak people don't listen to
Me please just hear what God is trying to reveal to you
Through my lyrics, through my melody
Rhythms and beats, my harmonies

Steadily wondering why you can't see me
Tryna figure out what it is about me
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
Stop tryin to figure me out, It ain't me y'all
It's all about God, and The Light don't clap off
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
BLING!

Thank God
I got that thing
I got the light ya'll
I got the light
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Steadily wondering why you can't see me
Tryna figure out what it is about me
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
Stop tryin to figure me out, It ain't me y'all
It's all about God, and The Light don't clap off
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
BLING!
Walk in The Light
Beautiful Light
So glad that I, I got The Light
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Steadily wondering why you can't see me
Tryna figure out what it is about me
I got The Light, I got The Light
I got The Light, I got The Light
Stop tryin to figure me out, It ain't me y'all
It's all about God, and The Light don't clap off
I got The Light, I got The Light
