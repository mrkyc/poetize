Heartache, heartbreak, pain
That's the only song we sing
That's the only thing life seems to bring, yeah
But tonight, we going to a place few speak of
Great Grandmamma and Granddaddy love, yeah

Too many broken homes I know, it gets hard y'all
And that's why we gotta take it to God y'all

You need a dose of that heavy love

You can't move it, you can't shake it
You can't beat it, you can't take it

So much power, so much patience
It's a love, so amazing
It ain't moving, heavy love
It ain't breaking, heavy love

I wanna live in a world where
Mothers and daughters, fathers and sons
Are coming up together as one, yeah
In a place where two people who know that they knew one another
Not only fall in love yeah, but stay in love yeah
Hey now, at times when you're hurtin' the worst
That's when love feels the best, yeah
