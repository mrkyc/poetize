Yea, I'm grateful
So grateful for all the Lord has done in my life
For seeing me faithful
For changing my heart and making everything right
His mercy and power
His name is worthy of my praise
Knowing this, I still can't understand why I still go astray

Maybe I'm not in my Word enough
Maybe I just need to pray
Preaching and teaching I've heard enough
Just need to change my ways
Lord it's not that I don't hurt enough
'Cause Lord God it breaks me down
(And all that I have) left to offer up are the tears streaming down

And a broken spirit (broken spirit)
Contrite heart (contrite heart)
Broken spirit (broken spirit)
Broken and a contrite heart (contrite heart)
Broken spirit (broken spirit)
Contrite heart (contrite heart)
Broken spirit (broken spirit)
Broken and a contrite heart (contrite heart)

Can I ask a question
Is this how it's supposed to be
My makeup and nature automatically separates You from me
I refuse to go a single day without You in my life
I promise I mean it
But I still feel full of everything that ain't right and

Maybe I'm not in my (word enough)
Maybe I just need to pray
Preaching and teaching I've heard enough
Just need to change my ways
(Lord it's not that I don't hurt enough)
Oh 'cause Lord God it breaks me down
(All that I have left to offer up) are the tears streaming down

And a broken spirit (broken spirit)
And the contrite heart (contrite heart)
Broken spirit (broken spirit)
Broken and a contrite heart, yea (contrite heart)
Broken spirit (broken spirit)
Contrite heart (contrite heart)
Oh, broken spirit (broken spirit)

There is a war going on in my members
I was baptized in the fire, was delivered
Lord do it again (Lord do it again)
Baptize me again (Baptize me again)
Oh Lord touch it again (Lord touch it again)
Because I know what you can do with a broken spirit

(broken spirit)
And a contrite heart (contrite heart)

Contrite heart (contrite heart)
Lord I'm so sorry (broken spirit)
Sorry for the way I am (contrite heart)
It breaks my spirit (broken spirit)
Breaks my heart (contrite heart)
But You can fix me (broken spirit)
You can make me better (contrite heart)
You can take me (broken spirit) and make me know
(contrite contrite heart)
Broken Spirit (broken spirit)

Broken Spirit (broken spirit)
Contrite Heart (broken and a contrite)
