Alright, take me off the talkback?
Take some of that, can you just mute the autotune on my lead, right now?
Yeah

If it was a need you had
If it wasn't me you had
You got all you need in that mind
If somebody broke your heart
Grabbed your keys and stole your car
You got all you need, you'll be fine

Just stop cryin', cryin'
Don't cry, cry no more
Just stop cryin'
Run through the door, whoa
Just stop cryin', cryin'
Don't cry, cry no more
Ways that made you
Can make it for sure

So dry your eyes
Dry your weeping eyes
Yeah, yeah
Don't let the light fade out
Don't let your life gonna pass you by
You gotta try, no, you gotta try
Try, yeah
Don't let the light fade out
Don't let your life gonna pass you by
You got it
Whoa

Oh yeah, you got it
Here today because you able
No, you got it
Got it, gotta get your own
And ain't no handouts or no favors
Take your throne
And before you know it you'll be home
So say "I got it"
Let your ears hear your mouth talking
Something brightly, tonight
Take your time and let's decide it
And we all can see that it's night

Just stop cryin', cryin'
Don't cry, cry no more
Just stop cryin'
Run through the door
Just stop cryin', cryin'
Don't cry, cry no more
Ways that made you
Can make it for sure

So dry your eyes
Dry your weeping eyes
(You know you can dry your eyes)
Don't let the light fade out

Don't let the light fade out
Don't let your life gonna pass you by
You got it

I wonder when the Son will come pick us up or take us

And ain't no label for the flip-flop, slipknots, and heaven-sakers
Greater workin'

Say, wait, yeah, but later works
I say it again, I'm talkin' greater works
For them first
