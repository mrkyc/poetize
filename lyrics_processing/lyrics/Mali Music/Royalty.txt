Power to the chosen people
Bible in my hand, word inside my heart
And pain before my eyes
Broken people wanting to believe in something
Looking for a light, trying to find the truth
But we give without saying, we do something we don't
Burdened people saying we do things that we won't ...
Wolf in sheep's clothing with a cross on his chest
Taking people money, promising to be blessed
But power to the chosen people
Who at one point wasn't viewed as an equal
His own chosen people, royal priesthood, yeah
You've been called out of the darkness
Into the marvelous light
Do you know who you are?
Royalty, yeah!
Once we weren't the people
But now we are the people
Do you know who you are?
Royalty, yeah!
Royalty, royalty, yeah
Royal, royal!
Royalty, yeah
Royalty, kings and queens
Royal, royal, hey!
Royalty, yeah!
You might also likeWould you give them everything?
Would you let them call you those things
If you knew you were a queen
And my brother would you be
Out there, risking your life for green paper
If you knew you had it all already
If you knew you were a king
Well the best I can offer is to tell you the truth?
Mercy changed everything for me and you
But they don't really tell us what we do need to know
First Peter 2 & 6 a bless you for sure
So power to the chosen people
Who at one point wasn't viewed as an equal
His own chosen people, royal priesthood, yeah!
You've been called out of the darkness
Into the marvelous light
Do you know who you are?
Royalty, yeah!
Once we weren't the people, mercy made us the people
Now we are the people
Do you know who you are?
Royalty, yeah!

Royal, royal, hey!
Royalty, yeah!
