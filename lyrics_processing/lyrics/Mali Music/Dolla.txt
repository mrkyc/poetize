As I walk
Through the valley of the shadow of fear
I see a lot of people here
How do you make a living?
How do you make income?

"Hustle and now"

(Verse 3)
I met up with a partner
He was swimming in it
Told me he wasn't just spending
Now he was winning with it
Shook me up
I'm like: "I feel that could you fit me in it?"
He told me I had the power
I've been flippin' since
Takin' the dollars I've made
Since I've been stackin' paper
Using the soothe, the sound of the music
My money maker, crazy favor
You'd better know they want that freedom note
I just politely moved to the box
To check no, I let them go
(Go!)
(Bridge)
Oh she want it
You know she movin' like a hoochie mama

Look at his watch he got a Gucci, mama
Ooh girl don't you know, yeah
