Thinking bout the world looking at the nation
Suicide... genocide... homicide
Three words come to mind...
Times are changing...Yeah!
No more rumors they're wars going on
Twisted doctors, scientist making clones
Economy got some backs against the wall
People dying for no reason at all
People of God don't even read their Bibles
There's no faith no trust in the word...
But everybody seems to be quoting scripture...
It's just another word they heard
Pastors leaving pulpits cause they're tired
It's all based on how we feel
Overheard two people speaking the other day
One said that God's not real but...

I'm just one ah them ole people who's got to hold on
Sometimes I can't see but I still believe
He's taking care of me... Oh oh oh
I'm just one ah them ole people God's got a hold on
And I believe, I believe, ... Yeah!
I believe I believe... Yeah!

So I choose to look on the brighter side...
In spite, of all the negativity I'm surrounded by
No it ain't perfect but that's alright
Cause His hand is on me ...
It's keeping me alive
So many disappointments
So much I don't understand
So much I don't have answers for
That's what makes me trust You more
In a world that's always changing...
Everything's rearranging
But no matter what's going on...
Ima be standing... Ima be holding on
Your truth, their truth, my truth
Your god, my God, our view
All I know is one thing nowadays
Is we all need hope we all need faith

I'm just one ah them ole people who's got to hold on
Sometimes I can't see but I still believe
He's taking care of me... Yes He is
I'm just one ah them ole people God's got a hold on
Don't You let go of me... Lord please
I believe, I believe ..yeah
I'm just one ah them ole people who's got to hold on
Sometimes I can't see but I still believe
He's taking care of me... Yes He is oh oh oh
I'm just one ah them ole people God's got a hold on
I believe I believe
I believe I believe
