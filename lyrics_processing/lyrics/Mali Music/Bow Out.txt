Whoever you want me to be
Is out there somewhere
Whoever you're trying to see
You can probably find on Twitter
But I'm yours right now
We're partners, you're my friend
And I could never figure it out
I shouldn't have to figure it out
So I make like a dog and I bow out

Hey
You're such an inspiration
Done a whole lot of really good things in this world
What you lack is patience
Imma stress you to keep the fame
Keep the illusion
No I take the truth
And I needed a friend so bad
Listen
Lemme tell you something
You my motivation
You the reason why a lot of people singing oh yeah
You changed the game
It's like a revelation
Through the years and nothing's changed
I'm the same
Just got a different way
To make it... music
Before that when I came up to the game
We had a thing
Tell me where we lose it
You might also like
Whoever you want me to be
Is out there somewhere
Whoever you're trying to see
You can probably find on Twitter
But I'm yours right now
We partners, you're my friend
And I could never figure it out
I shouldn't have to figure it out
So I make like a dog and I bow out

{Verse 2:]
So where we at now
I was young I was a child
I graduated from the front
I'm in the back now
I'm on way to the top
I thought I'd see all of my people
Where they at now
Remember that could get me down
None of that can make me bow
I'm a king
And I will love 
I won't back down
I had to take a moment
Get me footing back together
I'm on track now
And I was really walking
I got smart
I thought this 
I'm in the light now
Whoever you want me to be
Is out there somewhere
Whoever you're trying to see
You can probably find on Twitter
But I'm yours right now
We partners, you're my friend
And I could never figure it out
I shouldn't have to figure it out
So I make like a dog and I bow out

Bow out...
Bow out...
Bow out...
I make like a dog and now I bow out
Bow out...
Bow out...
Bow out...
I make like a dog and now I bow out

Whoever you want me to be
Is out there somewhere
Whoever you're trying to see
You can probably find on Twitter
But I'm yours right now
We partners, you're my friend
And I could never figure it out
I shouldn't have to figure it out
So I make like a dog and I bow out
It's out there somewhere
Probably find
And I could never figure it out
I shouldn't have to figure it out
So I make like a dog and I bow out
Bow out...
Bow out...
Bow out...
