The enemy comes only to
Steal, kill and destroy
And because we don't know who and who's we are
We let him come and steal our joy
Yes, its true, we all fall short
But, still that gives us no excuse
So when the enemy is fighting you
Just tell him to prepare to lose
'Cause I'm...

More than a conqueror
I'm more than a conqueror
I'm more than a conqueror
I'm, I'm more than a conqueror

'Cause of God's covenant with me
I always have the victory
No matter what you take from me..
God still gets glory from me
The kingdom suffereth violence
And the violent taketh by force
So, today we make a stand
'Cause we're not takin' it no more
