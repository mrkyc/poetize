I don't know if it's just me
But I find it profoundly important
That quickly, we'll see and realize
How we've become insubordinate
Mouths of praise, hands to wave, feet to dance, souls to save
If we can return to a place of worship everything will be okay

And we'll sing songs for the Glory of the Lamb
Let us sing songs for the Glory of the Lamb
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Hallelujah Glory to the Lamb yeah

Contrary to popular belief
We were all conceived and brought forth with purpose
And that's to worship
And the enemy knows if we ever get back
We'll obtain the power to hurt him, hurt him
So I encourage you my brothers and sisters
To get back to the threshing floor
'Cause judgment's coming
And all the brokenness, hurt and pain
No it won't hurt no more, won't hurt no more
