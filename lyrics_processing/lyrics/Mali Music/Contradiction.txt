What's good, boy
(Contradiction)

We meet again good friend
You see the stars come down to meet you
You look like the last time
Let a new day come and greet you
Stuck in your ways, stuck in your mind, stuck all the time
When their out of the room, especially mine, used to be fine
I swear I was confused, used to be blind
That was a moment in time when I thought of you
Now a woman
So say hey to everybody
Yo, tell 'em I love 'em, it's good this side of the globe
Is everything like it should? Man I don't know
But for everyone that think they should go
If you say that it's over
(Oh Lord, oh Lord)

If you say that it's over, I won't die
If you say that it's over, I won't die
I'll just come back for more
We'll meet again for sure
If you say that it's over, I won't die
You might also like
We meet again, old friend
Look how they got you where they want you
No need to play pretend
You try so hard but it still haunts you
All in your face, all of the time
Running from everything
Run out of faith, now you are blind
It's such a shame it's a
Terrible waste, beautiful mind
That was a moment in time when I thought of you, now I am fine
No matter what you say

If you say that it's over, I won't die
(I won't die, I won't die, no, no)
If you say that it's over, I won't die
(I won't die, I won't die)
I'll just come back for more (Aw yeah)
We'll meet again for sure
If you say that it's over, I won't die
(I won't die)

You don't have to say it's over
You don't have to say it's through
You don't have to say it's time
Just goes back to you, yeah, just goes back to you
You don't have to say you lost
You should tell the truth
Everything you do in time
Just goes back to you, yeah, just goes back to you
If you say that it's over, I won't die
If you say that it's over, I won't die
I'll just come back for more
We'll meet again for sure
