All that I want is a girl that bad to the bone
Long black hair, caramel skin tone
Meet her in the club, after that take her home
And give it to her all night long
Now rock your hips from left to right
Love when you move I know you bust the whine
Just know you sleeping in my bed tonight
Girl, if that's alright
Could you whine like this
Would you move like that?
Make me push it all
Cause you fling it back, back, back, back
You a dollar piece, hundred worlds exact
I just wanna touch
Girl because you're perfect

Don't be shy, I know you want the same thing
I want tonight, want tonight
Hold on tight, baby you know you in for a real good ride, so

Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel Irie
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
You might also like
Girl you bad and slim
But your back side round
Take it down to the ground and
Push it back right now, now, now
From time you walk in
Shut the whole place down
Sexiest gyal around
Should be wearing a crown, crown, crown, crown

Don't be shy, I know you want the same thing
I want tonight, want tonight
Hold on tight, baby you know you in for a real good ride, so

Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel Irie
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
You know what this is and what I came to do
Take you with me back to my room
Make you hot, girl you know
Get you up out your clothes
It's not enough time in a day
For me to give you what you need
I hope you hear all what me say cause

Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel Irie
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you, hold, hold ya
Kiss, kiss you, girl, no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
