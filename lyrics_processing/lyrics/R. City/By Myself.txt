First of all y'all don't know me
I only run with couple of my homies
'Cause niggas in this game too phony
So I'm usually by my lonely, chillin' by my
Self, self, self, self, self
I hate fake niggas so I'm usually by my
Self, self, self, self, self
I've got trust issues so I'm usually by my
Self

Tolo, nah my nigga I ain't solo
I love my niggas no homo, but I'm usually on my own though
This game so fake I know so, what you make they take and loads mo'
Can't even spend your own bread, they wanna spend it for yo'
What you mean our chains stop, you can't shop where I shop
I slept on the martyr train, nigga just to get what I got
I ain't the type to show out and no I don't like to go out
I do my show you pay me then I'm going home to my house
Riding in that old school, listening to old school
I know we met the other night but that don't mean I know you
See I'm still the same me, y'all the ones who brand new
I'm still down with the same niggas I've been down with since '02
All you niggas fake as fuck, hating on me 'til I'm walking up
Then you be like, wassup my nigga you know it's all looove
Ahaa, See I'm not stuck up at all
But if you see me in the mall, with my son in my arms
I won't talk 'cause

Made, It was just me and mi bruda, in the gutter
Looking to come up trying to make a better life for my mother
Hoping that we can get, paid
Ain't never been a sucker, or a runner
So whatever this war has to bring it's what I'll be in front of
With my head higher than Wiz Khalifa no entourage with me either
Last person to be standing up when that smoke clears without blowing reefer
Born alone and I'ma die alone that's why I don't depend on no one don't need to
But I'ma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas, 'cause I am my brother's keeper
Y'all better feel this, still talking that real shit
Fuck you to all y'all niggas who wanna ride away but ain't did shit
I'm still down with them same dudes who I came in this game with
If I ain't with them then I'm with my chick or I'm by my motherfucking self bitch
Think I'm selfish, that's impossible 'cause only fishermen sell fish
Ironic how I walk all over haters in my Adidas shell kicks
Sorry but I couldn't help it, haters expect me to fail until the day I die
It'd be me myself and I so ain't nobody else with me, swag


Look, skinny nigga big dreams ho
Uhh, small ass circle big team though
Uhh, could care less 'bout what these niggas doin'
'Cause in the past year I turned my dreams into a movement
Uhh, but the plan still remain the same
Get this profit bring it home and split it with the gang
Uhh, you niggas got it fucked up
This shit was planned man you boys act like we lucked up
Two nine to that uhh, my niggas ride and they bent down
Couple shots I'm turnt up I roll up and I blow it down
Uhh, until my money to the ceiling we gon' keep these fingers twisted
Screaming fuck how niggas feeling all my niggas in the building
If they not I'm not attending
Authentic with this shit, most these rappers been pretending, uhh
So I keep it to myself, we don't need nobody help, swag (yeah)
