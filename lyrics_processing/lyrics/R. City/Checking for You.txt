I been missing you lately
Do you think about me, baby?
No, I can't come home
Yeah, these streets so crazy
I don't wanna be broke
Gotta make it or take it
I gotta get my dough
I gotta feed these babies

So if I ring your cell
Just making sure that everything is bless
Girl, you're always on my mind
Can't you tell no matter where I go
No matter what me do, me always check for you

Cause I'm just calling for you darling
First thing in, in the morning
I'm checking for you
I don't want nothing but I've been hustling
Just in case something happen
I'm checking for you

Out here with the man them, posted up on the counter
Just tryna find ways to get off of the corner
Even through all of that, you're running through my head
Out here doing what I gotta do to make sure you're straight
You might also like
So if I ring your cell
Just making sure that everything is bless
Girl, you're always on my mind
Can't you tell no matter where I go
No matter what me do, me always check for you

Cause I'm just calling for you darling
First thing in, in the morning

I don't want nothing but I've been hustling
Just in case something happen

Every day I'm out here on my grind
On my job going hard like it ain't no tomorrow
It's a whole lot of money out here
All I'm tryna do is get my cut like a barber
And you know that I must make sure you're right
While me a work all through the night
Should've never have to lift a hand, not for anybody
Cause I'mma hold you down for life
And I just wanna know how you're doing
Sometimes I need to know how you're doing
Nice man, nice man??
So make sure you answer the phone
Make sure you answer it, don't let it ring, let it ring
I just need to know that you're good
I would be right with you right now if I could
You don't have to ask cause you know that I would
So tell me what's good
Cause I'm just calling for you darling
First thing in, in the morning
I'm checking for you
I don't want nothing but I've been hustling
Just in case something happen
