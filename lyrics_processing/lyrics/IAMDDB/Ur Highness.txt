Hello, hi (Hello, hi)
Is anybody home? (IAMDDB)
Hello? (Are you there?)
'Cause I'm outside (It's cold)
Feeling all this cold inside
I don't like, nah, I don't like

I've been feeling so damn high all the time
Is that a curse or is it alright?
'Cause I've been up all night
Rolling round with the tie that I didn't even tie
Oh, my

Feeling like it's cloudy
Feeling all these energy surrounding my soul
Dragging me to darkness
Not today, not my sun, please take caution
I don't know if i should stay or go
If i should stand or fall

Not today, don't bother me today
Don't want no pictures or cameras today
Leave me alone, I want to find myself
Today, uh, is that day
The baggage is in the pass, yes, today
We no fight no more 'cah we communicate
But just not today

He didn't think that I was serious, oh my god
I'm looking in the mirror
I don't see what you see in the pictures, no
Take over, I'm gonna catch a body
I promise you I don't know her
I'm trying my best to keep composure
But, I swear, push me and I'll come and murder
You never heard her?
Flow so sweet make you haffi learn-a
You wanna take her around the world, show her the globe
And take her to places she never heard of
Never heard that I should come first
Never felt a wave like this, it's over

Swimming in the ocean pleasing
