As the bottom of a well
And can't get out of the mood
Do something to perk yourself up
And change your attitude
Give a tug to your tie
Put a crease in your pants
But if you really want to feel fine
Give your shoes a shine
When there's a shine on your shoes
There's a melody in your heart
With a singable happy feeling
A wonderful way to start
To face the world every day
With a deedle-dum-dee-dah-dah
A little melody that is making
The worrying world go by
When you walk down the street
With a happy-go-lucky beat
You'll find a lot in what I'm repeating
When there's a shine on your shoes
There's a melody in your heart
What a wonderful way to start the day!

There's a shine that you get in the Pullman car
There's a shine that you get in the pool room
There's a shine that you get in the school room
But it doesn't matter where you get it
It'll do a lot of good if you let it
A little bit of polish will abolish what's bothering you
When there's a shine on your shoes
Melody in your heart
Singable happy feeling
Wonderful!
