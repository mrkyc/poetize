Dangerous rhythm...
It's something daring, The Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra new
It's very subtle, The Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, The Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, The Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song
Two bodies swaying, The Continental
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of
So keep on dancing, The Continental
For it's a song of romance and of love
You kiss while you're dancing
(spoken) That's not a bad idea
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and sentimental
You might also likeYou stroll together arm in arm
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm
You will find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do The Continental all the time
Beautiful music...
Dangerous rhythm...
It's something daring, The Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new
It's very subtle, The Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, The Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song!
Two bodies swaying, The Continental

So keep on dancing, The Continental
For it's a song of romance and of love
You kiss while you're dancing
The Continental, Continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle, so sentimental
You know before this dance is through
That you're in love with she and she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancing
Here's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do The Continental all the time
Dukes and lords of noble station
Love the new sophistication of The Continental
In a Belgian hall room
In a Monte Carlo ballroom, you will see The Continental
In the Paris bistros crowded with Apache
You will see The Continental in the best French fashion
Spain and Italy, Transylvania
Norway, Sweden and Rumania do The Continental
On the dike of Zuider Zee
The wooden shoes have found the key to Continental
It's like a fever
It's like a plague
It's swept all Europe
From Moscow to The Hague
You kiss while you're dancing
The Continental, the rhythm is driving you wild
The Continental, a meter that isn't so mild
You sing while you're dancing
His voice is gentle. It thrills you, the touch of his hand
The Continental, a meter that you understand
You'll know before this dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
