Girl, when you hold me
How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Any way you please
It must be easy for you
The lovely things that you do
But just a pastime for you
I could never be

And I never know, girl
If I should stay or go home (Go away, girl)
'Cause the games ('Cause the games)
That you play (That you play)
Keep driving me away (Driving me away)

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses
Are only minor tests, babe
Of love leads to stresses
Between a woman and a man (between a woman and a man)
So if love everlasting
Isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl
I'm proud to take a stand

I can't continue guessing
Because it's only messing (It's only messing)
With my pride (With my pride)
And my mind (And my mind)
So write (So write) down (Down) this time to time

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
I'm just a little old-fashioned
It takes more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is
Honey, give me love, not a facsimile of

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love (be love, be love)
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
