You were smiling, glowing like an angel
Paid the price but I didn't read the label
It's bad for me but good for you
You like to drink but only from the top shelf
You like to talk but only about yourself
It's bad for me but good for you

I can't breathe when I see those eyes
I can't leave your side
Know that I should

Stay away
Get shivers when you
Scream my name
You've got that devil's touch
It hits me like a drug
I know it's wrong but it feels so right
You take it all in the night
Girl you're criminal

Should've known from the night that I met you
We got drunk and you told me all your issues
It's bad for me but good for you
I saw your text, it was 4 in the mourning
Showing up at my place with no warning
It's bad for me but good for you
You might also like
I can't breathe when I see those eyes
I can't leave your side
Know that I should

Stay away
Get shivers when you
Scream my name
You've got that devil's touch
It hits me like a drug
I know it's wrong but it feels so right
You take it all in the night
Girl you're criminal

All the hope that you left me is broken
Took my heart in the blink of an eye
All the love that you gave me was stolen
All the hope that you left me is broken
Took my heart in the blink of an eye
All the love that you gave me was stolen
That's why I know I should

Stay away
Get shivers when you
Scream my name
You've got that devil's touch
It hits me like a drug
I know it's wrong but it feels so right
You take it all in the night
Girl you're criminal
Oh
Girl you're criminal
Oh
