So I can try to make you see
That I'm in no position for giving
Cos' all I see you do is lie
And I can't help but close my eyes
And wonder 'bout you in my life
I'm drowning in your tears
I'm delirious
Are you serious?
What goes on in your head?
I'm just curious
Cos' I'm hanging here
Got me dangling here
Think your love, oh your love has got off my head
It's unbelievably hard to love you
But I love you anyway
I've been trying too hard not to love you
But I love you anyway
Oh, I should've known
That you'd go and steal my eyes
Oh, I should've known
From then on I'd lose my life
You might also likeI'm delirious
Are you serious?
What goes on in your head?
I'm just curious
Cos' I'm hanging here
Got me dangling here
Think your love, oh your love has got off my head
It's unbelievably hard to love you
But I love you anyway
I've been trying too hard not to love you
But I love you anyway
It's so incredibly hard to love you
But I love you anyway
And every time I try too hard not to love you
I love you anyway
I don't get it, I really don't get it
I try to walk away but my feet won't let me
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I try to walk away but my feet won't let me
You have me baby
You drive me crazy
You have me baby
You drive me crazy
It's unbelievably hard to love you
But I love you anyway
I've been trying too hard not to love you
But I love you anyway
(You have me baby)
It's so incredibly hard to love you
(You drive me crazy)
But I love you anyway
And every time I try to hard not to love you
But I love you anyway
I don't get it, I really don't get it
I try to walk away but my feet won't let me
I don't get it, I just don't get it
