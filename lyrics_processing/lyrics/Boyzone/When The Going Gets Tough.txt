The tough get going, tough, tough, huh, huh, huh
When the going gets tough, the tough gets ready
Yeah, ooooh, du da do da
I got something to tell you
I got something to say
I'm gonna put this dream in motion
Never let nothing stand in my way
When the going gets tough
The tough gets going
I'm gonna get myself 'cross the river
That's the price I'm willing to pay
I'm gonna make you stand and deliver
And give me love in the old-fashioned way
Daaaaaaaaarlin'
I'll climb any mountain
Daaaaaaaaarlin'
I'll do anything
Ooh, can I touch you (can I touch you)
And do the things that lovers do
Ooh, wanna hold you (wanna hold you)
I gotta get it through to you, oooh
