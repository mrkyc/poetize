And I must have been high)
I thought of every reason
Excuses I could give
But all it took was one to break your heart
(And I must have been high)
I thought it would be easy
Assumed you would forgive
But now I gotta beg you girl
Can't stand to be apart
And I must've been high
Girl to let you by
No good reason why
There's no you and I
And I must've been low
Girl to let you go
How was I to know
I would miss you so
(Girl I'd miss you so)
I wanted to move on girl
No time to settle down
Didn't wanna give my love to only you
But since you have been gone girl
I took a look around
And if I've gotta beg you girl
That's what I'm gonna do
You might also likeAnd I must've been high
Girl to let you by
No good reason why
There's no you and I
(And I must have been high now baby)
And I must've been low
Girl to let you go
How was I to know
I would miss you so
(Girl I miss you so)
Oh girl
I'll give you everything I gotta give
Oh girl
And I will make it all up I swear to you
Oh girl
All I'm askin' you please is to forgive me girl
That's what you gotta do
And I must have been...
(So high...
So high...)
And I must have been high
(oooh oh yeah now tell me baby)
(oooh)
And I must've been high
Girl to let you by
No good reason why
There's no you and I
(And I must have been high now baby)
And I must've been low
Girl to let you go
How was I to know
I would miss you so
