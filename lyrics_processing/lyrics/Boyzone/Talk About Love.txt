Yeah it's been a hell of a night
Both of us too scared to face it
We've been taken our time
Both of us don't wanna waste it
Sunglasses in sight
To hide the worry in your eyes

Nobody said it would be easier
No promises but if you need me
Just stay for the night
We could be lonely together for the night, yeah
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
And you could just stay for the night
We could be lonely together for the night, yeah

And you could just stay for the night

Now it's a quarter to three
I know you like to keep me guessing
So if you don't wanna leave
I don't need to ask the question
I can't read your mind
I see the hurting in your eyes
