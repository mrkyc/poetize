You went to the room
Violins start to play
Everything that you do is a rhapsody
It's never too soon
To conduct me your way
All that I want for you
Is to live happily

We can make some history, history
'Cause nobody else really fits with me, fits with me
Mozart and Bach would be proud
It's only you and me now
Come over here girl and start kissing me, kissing me

'Cause you and me composing all the parts
Together we're a symphony of hearts
The music we've been making from the start
Together is a symphony of hearts

Shivers I get when you stand by my side
Like a special effect on electricity
Then you went to the room
Violins start to play
Everything that you do is a rhapsody
You might also like
We can make some history, history
'Cause nobody else really fits with me, fits with me
Mozart and Bach would be proud
It's only you and me now
Come over here girl and start kissing me, kissing me

'Cause you and me composing all the parts
Together we're a symphony of hearts
The music we've been making from the start
Together is a symphony of hearts

We can be a symphony, symphony
Girl you know we can be a symphony, symphony
Girl you know we can be a symphony, symphony
Girl you know we can be a symphony, symphony
Girl you know we can be a symphony, symphony
Girl you know we can be a symphony, symphony
Mozart and Bach will be proud
It's only you and me now
Come over here girl and start kissing me, kissing me

It's you and me composing all the parts
Together we're a symphony of hearts
The music we've been making from the start
Together is a symphony of hearts
