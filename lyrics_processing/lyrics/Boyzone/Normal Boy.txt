How could you think that I'd do that to you?
Don't mention things that I'd never do
I think that you've lost who you're talking to
Asking me to prove

Cause I don't say what I don't need
Cause everything is as it seemed
Girl, you're not that drama queen
Everything is blessed with me

She said give me love, love, love
I can't get enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
Baby don't be so paranoid
She said give me love, love, love
You know I got enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
I'm not like a normal boy

It's like you're trying to find my problems
I can't deny I've had my share of them
And one point that I show you that you need to have a doubt
You know that I'm allowed with you
You might also like
Cause I don't say what I don't need
Cause everything is as it seemed
Girl, you're not that drama queen
Everything is blessed with me

She said give me love, love, love
I can't get enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
Baby don't be so paranoid
She said give me love, love, love
You know I got enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
I'm not like a normal boy
I'm not like a normal boy, no

Ooh, I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh, I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh, I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh

Don't get me mixed up
But something I'm clearly not
Don't get me mixed up
But something I'm clearly not
Don't get me mixed up
With something I'm clearly not
Don't get me mixed up
Don't give me that
Don't give me that
You should know that I'm above that
Love, love, love
You know I got enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
Baby don't be so paranoid
She said give me love, love, love
You know I got enough, nough, nough
Don't you start a war on us
I'm not like a normal boy
I'm not like a normal boy, no

Ooh. I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh, I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh, I'm nothing like a normal boy no
Ooh
