Trying to grow
Making my way down that long winding road
Had no reason, no rhyme
Like a song out of time
And there you were standing in front of my eyes
How could I be such a fool
To let go of love and break all of the rules?
Girl, when you walked down that door
Left a hole in my heart and now I know for sure
You're the air that I breathe
Girl, you're all that I need
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read
You're the light that I see
And your love is all that I need
I was searching in vain, playing a game
Had no-one else but myself left to blame
You came into my world, no diamonds or pearls
Could ever replace whatever you gave to me, girl
You might also likeJust like a castle of sand
Girl, I almost let love slip right out of my hands
And just like a flower needs rain
I will stand by your side through the joy and the pain
You're the air that I breathe
Girl, you're all that I need
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read
You're the light that I see
And your love is all that I need
You're the air that I breathe
Girl, you're all that I need
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read (Words that I read)
You're the light that I see (You're the light that I see)
And your love is all that I need (All that I need)
You're the song that I sing
Girl, you're my everything
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're all that I need, girl
You're the air that I breathe, yeah
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read, girl
You're love is all I need, yeah
And I wanna thank you (And I wanna thank you, lady)
You're all that I need, girl
You're the air that I breathe, yeah
