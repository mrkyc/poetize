Far away from the crazy rush
And while the storm is raging
It's safe and warm inside
Close the door and forget about time
Ease the river runnin' through your mind
Lay your body next to me
Let your secrets all be mine
Take my hand and believe me
That love will guide us through
Anytime that you need me
Girl I'll be there for you
While the world is going crazy
While the sky is falling down
One thing you can depend on
I will always be around
While the rain outside is pouring
I will make the sun shine through
While the world is going crazy
You can count on me
Cause I'll be loving you
Cause I'll be loving you
I turned on the news today
But I don't wanna hear a word they say
Outside the world is breakin' down
But we don't have a clue
Like a scream in an empty room
It's gettin harder just to find the truth
Let's forget it 'till the night is through
It's all about me and you
You might also likeWe can make our own heaven
It's not so hard to find
Cause girl I will protect you
Until the end of time
CHORUS
It doesn't really matter
If you win, lose or draw
I will be your shelter
I will catch you when you fall
All you do is just trust in me
I will keep you satisfied
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
While the world is going crazy
(crazy)
While the sky is falling down
(falling down)
One thing you can depend on
I will always be around
(I'll be right there for ya baby)
While the rain outside is pouring
(pouring down)
I will make the sun shine through
While the world is going crazy
You can count on me
(you can count on me girl)
Cause I'll be loving you
(cause I'll be loving you)
(cause I'll be loving you)
I'll be loving you
All you do is call
