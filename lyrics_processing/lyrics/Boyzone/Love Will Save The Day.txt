To the ones that loved, the ones that held the losing cards
Here's to the sweet unknown
To the tales untold that the night unfold in the stars above
Pass around the bottle and tell me your troubles
And la la la la la la love will save the day
Yeah, pass around the bottle, and I'll share your troubles
And la la la la la la love will save the day
(Ohh,) We're the undecided
We're the ones that try to find our way
(Ohh,) Gonna burn the brightest
Gonna watch the night go up in flames
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share your troubles
Sing la la la la la la love wil save the day
Friends, come and gather 'round
Throw your hands up high to the silent sky where the answer is found
Let laughter fill the air
Forget your worries, carry on without a care
Pass around the bottle, and I'll share your troubles
And la la la la la la love will save the day
(Ohh,) We're the undecided
We're the ones that try to find our way
(Ohh,) Gonna burn the brightest
Gonna watch the night go up in flames
Let me ease your heavy heart and fill it up with gold
Let the stormy seas depart and let me guide you home
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share our troubles
And la la la la la la love will save the day
(Ohh,) We're the undecided
We're the ones that try to find our way
(Ohh,) Gonna burn the brightest
Gonna watch the night go up in flames
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share your troubles
Sing la la la la la la love will save the day
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share our troubles
Sing la la la la la la love will save the day
