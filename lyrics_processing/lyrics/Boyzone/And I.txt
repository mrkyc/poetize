Do you ever think about me and you and
All the things we used to do
The times that we shared
Well I've been looking for love and affection
It's brought me back in your direction
Even though we've been apart
Your part of my soul
Ok I know (I know I was a fool)
A fool (To lose my faith in you)
But girl before you go
I want you to know
That I think of you every day, baby
And I can't seem to get away
From these feelings
And I, I need to tell you some how
That I need your love right now
Looking back I can see things clearly
The mistakes that I paid for dearly
Taking love for granted only leaves you alone
Well if we talked you would understand that
Time has made me a better man and
With your love behind me there's nowhere I can't go
You might also likeSo take a chance (Just take a chance on me)
And you'll see (It's where you need to be)
If your heart it tells you so
You'll know what I know
That I think of you every day, baby
And I can't seem to get away from these feelings
And I, I need to tell you some how
That I need your love right now
Right now is the time for both of us
To put aside our differences and trust
All the words I never used to say
Now I've found a way
(Now I've found a way)
That I think of you every day, baby
(I think of you, I think of you, baby)
And I can't seem to get away from these feelings
(I can't seem to, I can't seem to, get away, get away)
And I, I need to tell you some how
(Some how)
That I need your love (Your love, right now)
(Right now)
That I think of you every day, baby
(baby)
And I can't seem to get away from these feelings
(I can't seem..
From these feelings)
And I, I need to tell you some how
That I need your love right now
