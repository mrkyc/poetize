Rain on the window covers the trace
Of all the tears that I've had to waste
And now I'm missing you so
And I won't let you go away
Stain on the desktop where coffee cups lay
And memories of you forever will stay
And the scent of your perfume
And the smile on your face will remain
And I never gave up hope
When things got me down
But I just bit on my lip
And my face began to frown
'Cause that was just my pride
And I've nothing left to hide
And now the way is clear
And all I wanna say is
All of my life the doors have been closed now
And all of my dreams have been locked up inside
But you came along and captured my heart, girl
You're the key to my life
You might also likeYeaheah
Year after year, was blaming myself (Blaming myself)
For what I'd done, just thought of myself
I know that you'll understand (You'll understand)
That was all my own fault, don't go away
And I never gave up hope
When things got me down
But I just bit on my lip
And my face began to frown
'Cause that was just my pride
And I've nothing left to hide
And now the way is clear
And all I want to say is
All of my life the doors have been closed now
And all of my dreams have been locked up inside
But you came along and captured my heart, girl
You're the key to my life
Girl, you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
You're the one that's gonna stop the pain
Girl, you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
Listen to me, can't you hear what I say?
All of my life the doors have been closed now
And all of my dreams been locked up inside
But you came along and captured my heart, girl
You're the key to my life
