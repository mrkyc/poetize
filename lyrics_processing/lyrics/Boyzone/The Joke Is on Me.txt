I live my life so easy
I like my love straight down the line
High, big or low-key, that's you and me
We faced our fear all in one night

Digging for gold just to make a dream
I would never lie but you lie when I couldn't see
Oh it's like you just pull the love from right under me
Laughing uncontrollably, tell me what to do with myself

Ain't it funny how your look ain't changed
But the joke is on me this time
Ain't it funny how I thought you'd stay
But the joke is on me this time

Someone tell me how to sleep
Someone tell me how to sleep

I won't get equal and in my way
I come back to haunt you or you'll be okay
You've been married and loved though I've been drunk and so messed up
Thinking about us, laughing about us, getting old and grey
You might also like
Digging for gold just to make a dream
I would never lie but you lie when I couldn't see
Oh it's like you just pull the love from right under me
Laughing uncontrollably, tell me what to do with myself

Ain't it funny how your look ain't changed
But the joke is on me this time
Ain't it funny how I thought you'd stay
But the joke is on me this time

Someone tell me how to sleep
Someone tell me how to sleep
Someone tell me how to sleep
But the joke is on me this time

Can't build the house with a heart of stone
I thought I was doing what I do just to buy a home
Oh I'm now shocked, I'm ashamed, don't know where to go
Crying uncontrollably, tell me how you live with yourself

Ain't it funny how your look ain't changed
But the joke is on me this time
Ain't it funny how I thought you'd stay
But the joke is on me this time
Someone tell me how to sleep
Someone tell me how to sleep
Someone tell me how to sleep
