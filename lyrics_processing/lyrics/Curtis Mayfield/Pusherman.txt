I'm your mama, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor when in need
Want some coke? Have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin

I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Hahaha

Ain't I clean? Bad machine
Super cool, super mean
Feelin' good for the man
Super fly, here I stand
Secret stash, heavy bread
Baddest bitches in the bed

I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusher, man
You might also like
Silent life
Of crime
A man of odd circumstance
A victim of ghetto demands
Feed me money for style
And I'll let you trip for a while
Insecure from the past
How long can a good thing last?
Woohoo, oh, no
Got to be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now
Pusherman gettin' mellow, y'all

Heavy mind, heavy sign
Makin' money, all the time
My 'El D' and just me
For all junkies to see
Ghetto prince is my thing
Makin' love's how I swing

I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Huh, ha
"Two bags, please"
For a generous fee
Make your world
What you want it to be
Got a woman
I love desperately
Wanna give her somethin'
Better than me
Been told I can't be nothin' else
Just a hustler in spite of myself
I know I can break it
This life just don't make it
Lord, Lord, yeah
Got to get mellow now
Got to be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now

I'm your mama, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor when in need
Want some coke? Have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Your pusherman

Lord, Lord
