Yo wassup, this the Fugees
To all the young people
Live on sesame street haha (Clap your hands)
Can you tell me how to get? How to get to Sesame Street?
(Big Bird and Snuffy holdin' it down, check it out, here we go!)

Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (A-B-C)
Can't be no one else (No one else!)
Just happy to be me! (Yeah! Yeah!)

Hey yo, the "A" is for achievement
Hey yo, the "B" is for beneficent
And the "C" is for commitment
And the "D" is for diligent
What about the "E", the "F", the "G", the "H", the "I", the "J?"
I'm in my P.J.'s, I'm drinkin' O.J

Yo, the big city, just like I pictured it (What?!)
Millions of people rushing around real quick
Each one's original, one of a kind, unique (That's right!)
So, kick back and listen while L-Boogie speaks
Not trying to be different, just doing they own thing
So come on everybody, clap your hands and sing (Just sing y'all!)

The "W", "X", the "Y", the "Z's" for Zorro! See you tomorrow!

Well it's the Fugees
On Sesame, clap your hands do a dance with L-Jiggy

Now Snuffy and Big Bird are having a good time
They're walking and gawking and trying to talk to a mime (Mime)
Here, in the square where they just seen it all (What?!)
But they ain't never seen a yellow bird seven feet tall!
