Operator, can I help you?

I hope so, baby. Can you put me through to the Fugees bootleg hotline?

Please hold while I connect your call

Now check this out: I say I want joints! Don't be jivin' me!
This is Kool DJ Red Alert
You make 'em, I play dem, das right!

Ready or not, here I come
Clark Kent make the remix real real fun
Hold me down
Don't forget y'all Clark Kent nineteen-nine-whatever for the remix y'all

Ready or not
You can't run away from these styles I got, oh baby
Hey baby, 'cause I got a lot, oh yeah
Anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh baby
Hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh yeah

Yo
Now that I escape selling five million plates
My beeper vibrates like California earthquakes
But I keep a balanced head, 'cause you're hot then not
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose they spot on the jukebox
Still ichiban, wack M.C.'s get da gong
Lyrical tongue, wireless mics from Samsung
Wyclef seduced once by an actress
Angela Basset wanted the head of John the Baptist
Meanwhile, across town, I still owe money to Carlito
Mama always said don't gamble; I'm trapped in Casino
No more money in my bags, nightmares getting closer
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger woke up with a German Luger
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! (Imitating young Michael Jackson)
And you don't stop

Sometimes the Refugees gotta take a stand and break
If any joker come fe' test another life we take
Cause when we gunning all the dance, we are the specialist
So scientists, lyricists, pop your Guinnesses
Sometimes the Refugees gotta take a stand and break
If any joker come fe' test another life we take
Cause when we gunning all the dance, we are the specialist
So scientists, lyricists, pop your Guinnesses
If I could change the times and make rhymes raise the babies
Give all the pigs rabies
Send biting niggas to Haiti's
Clothe young ladies
Chase the rainbow, find the pot
Free the third time offender once he learns to make salaat
Lose the fame
Take the money
Play boys just like the bunny
Find a man with a plan
Slap a chicken if she acts funny
Break the bank, own tanks
Stop niggas from acting stank
Take over, give out free Rovers
Teach a man to find Jehovah
Own the tours, own the stores
Watch the record pimps and whores
Make love, stop the wars
Cop the land like the Moors
Make the last be the first
Make the God respect the Earth
Change the murder rate to the birth
Bust it

Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
No more tours, no more Scores
Por favor senor, I tempt crews like a bull to a matador
Run you for your Range Rover, like that
Leave you in a broken Nova, like that
Buffalo soldier! Dreadlock rasta!
Rather be slaughtered than be captured
Three refugees, one unusual suspect
A snitch at the table, how far will your trust get?
Lust got you busted unlocking my vault
Body executed right on the asphalt
Tell the youth that you shouldn't skylark
Or get marked, like a narc, as The Beast in New York

You can't run away from these styles I got, oh baby
Hey baby, 'cause I got a lot, oh yeah
Anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh baby
Hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh no
