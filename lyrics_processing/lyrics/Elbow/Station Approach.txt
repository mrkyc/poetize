I haven't been myself of late
I haven't slept for several days
But coming home I feel like I
Designed these buildings I walk by
You know you drive me up the wall
I need to see your face that's all
You little sod, I love your eyes

Be everything to me tonight
Be everything to me tonight

I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
I never know what I want but I know when I'm low that I
I need to be in the town where they know what I'm like and don't mind
