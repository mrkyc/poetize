What a hard man fe dead. (Hard man fe dead!)
You pick him up, you lick him down and he bounce right back
What a hard man fe dead. (Hard man fe dead!)
Well they say that a cat got nine lives
But this man got ninety-nine lives
You pick him up, you lick him down and he bounce right back
What a hard man fe dead. (Hard man fe dead!)
Them boil one pot of chocolate tea
Take all the fried fish they caught in the sea
Yes, they also got six quart of rum
Settin' down and waiting for the nine night to come
The last time I heard them say
That this man was dead, (Man was dead!)
They got a block of ice and they laid it all
Upon his head. (Upon his head!)
Now the procession lead to the cemetery
And the old man said, "Don't you bury me!"
Lick him up, you pick him up and he bounce right back
What a hard man fe dead. (Hard man fe dead!)
Come in Sterling

Did it good, musta been frightened enough
They boil one pot of chocolate tea
And all the fried fish they caught in the sea
They also got six quarts of rum
Settin' down and waiting for the nine night to come
The last time I heard them say
That this man was dead, (Man was dead!)
They got a block of ice and they laid it all
Upon his head. (Upon his head!)
Now the procession lead to the cemetery
The man hollered out, "Don't you bury me!"
They drop the box and run, what a whole lot of fun!
