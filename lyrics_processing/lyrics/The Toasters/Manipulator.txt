Every time it happens it ends up the same
She always comes to town and hangs around
Gets everything she wants still wears a frown
All the fellows dig her cause she's funky fresh
Some people call her Doris but her name is Bess
She's always in the bar you know she drinks for free
Why should she have to pay when there are suckers like me
She's a manipulator
What kinda girl is she?
Manipulator
She a rude boy hate-ta

Hanging in the bar a couple weeks ago
She walks right up to me and said "Let's go!"
My boys thought I was crazy but I had to 'fess
She looked so goddamn good in that slinky-ass dress
When we got back to her place it was half past three
She offered me if I wanted a brew I said "I ei!"
About an hour later it was half past four
The brew was gone and so was I she showed me the door

Someday I will get even with that crazy bitch
Or maybe even better she will buy my bitch
If she came here right now I don't know what I'd think
I'd probably go and join the lines and buy her a drink
There's nothing you can do when there's a freak like that
I dig her from my mod days and my pork pie hat
But she'll continue to get over on my whole damn crew
So for now I say "Take you, don't let it brew"
