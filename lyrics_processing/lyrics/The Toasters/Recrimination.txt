That always leads to confrontations getting out of hand
It always ends in recriminations what is it all said
Look here baby for your information coming round the bend
Tuesday is a day I don't like much
Stay out of trouble go down to the pub
Sittin in the bruiser for an hour or two
Sippin my Guinness without you
But down you come with your Nag! Nag! Nag!
Bend my ear put the monkey on my back
I get myself inebriate what more can I do!
Give you my heart
But you just don't care
Stare right through me
Like I'm not even there
Twist my ears and pull my hair
Tell me my ideas are up in the air
Do I like it?
No I don't!
It's just another chicken but I stick it in my throat
Will you stop it?
No I won't!
