In a beat up Ford Cortina on Saturday night
Second Step and Urban Blight
Hear come the Boilers to check out the scene
But that's never too true if you know what I mean
The reception is cool, so turn up the heat
Come on boys do some East Side Beat
Pick up the piece and make your play
I wonder what the old man will say
Caught in the act with a gun in your hand
And a fat old judge doesn't understand
Burning and looting down on the street
Come on boys do some East Side Beat
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oh Oi! Oi!
Out in the jungle on a Saturday night
Trip over a junky and there's two in a fight
Go over to the fellas just chewin the fat
Shark skin apes in pork pie hats
Big ugly skinhead across the street
Come on boys do the East Side Beat
In to this sticka for a rack of pool
There's a girl at the bar that's beginning to drool
One more chaser I'll move right in
She gets much fresher as I feel up my skin
Keep the chasers cold and the whisky neat
Come on boys do the East Side Beat
You might also likeOi! Oi! Oi! Oh Oi! Oi!
So it's up in the morning try to go straight
Out on the turf its a theatre of hate
In a land you can't even call your own
And the big fat coppers won't leave you alone
Push you around do the law with their feet
Come on boys do the East Side Beat
So it's off to jail put and up into the dock
Send you off for a short sharp shock
Tell racist jokes as they put you away
Never even listen what the hell you say
Burning police cars down on the street
Come on boys do the East Side Beat
East Side Beat
East Side Beat
East Side Beat
East Side Beat
Burning police cars down on the street
