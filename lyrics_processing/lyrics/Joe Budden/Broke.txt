We broke, like skeletons (It's been a while)
Lovin' to the bone (We ain't seen each other)
Our heart, so delicate
From hangin' on too long (Maybe that's how it's s'posed to be)
Nothin' left to hide (Maybe this is fate)
Nothin' left to show
We broke, like skeletons (Maybe we'll never know)
Lovin' to the bone

I mean, we started with love, the beginnin' was magical
Then it ended abrupt, how's it us that this happened to?
Was it all just a lie? How was none of it factual?
Even in our demise, it seems I'm always attached to you
They said: "If you let it go, if it's real, it comes back to you."
She just called me a thief; I took and never gave back to you
After all that I done, figured you'd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off, we can't even be casual
Guess we both had times we were bein' irrational
We both out of our minds, how are we not compatible?
Say I pushed you out the door, and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wadn't impacted too (Like I wadn't impacted too)
Should be a movie star, ma, you so good at actin' new
You like us as strangers, me, I think it's impractical
You might also like
But she said that she deserves much better for as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought, we'll never know, come on

We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on!)
Our heart, so delicate
From hangin' on too long (Ayy)
Nothin' left to hide (Ayy)
Nothin' left to show
We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh (Come on, come on, come on, come on, uh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Come on, come on)
Oh, oh (Come on, come on, come on)

I mean, we started with love, then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business, clearly nothin' was sacred
I know you down to your core 'less for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws, see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad, all them bitches is basic
And even if they ain't, it ain't hard to mistake it
I think you runnin' from love, with me, you gotta face it
Or are you guardin' your heart from a nigga that always breaks it?
Now you live in the club, maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me e'ry birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who I'm wit', "Did anybody come after?"
But still talk like you the one, you say that none of them matter
I guess it is what it is, what about what it could be?
Do we try this again, just to confirm what it should be?
But she said that she deserves much better for as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought, we'll never know, come on

We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on!)
Our heart, so delicate
From hangin' on too long (Ayy)
Nothin' left to hide (Ayy)
Nothin' left to show
We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh (Come on, come on, come on, come on, uh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Come on, come on)
Oh, oh (Come on, come on, come on)

I'm the one you hide
The one you can't forget
And you're the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
'Til there was nothin' left
Under my
Skin, gave what I had to give
We hit the
End...
We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on!)
Our heart, so delicate
From hangin' on too long (Ayy)
Nothin' left to hide (Ayy)
Nothin' left to show
We broke, like skeletons
Lovin' to the bone (Come on)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh (Come on, come on, come on, come on, uh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Come on, come on)
