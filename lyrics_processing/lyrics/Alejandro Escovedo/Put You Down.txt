And all the shadows fall across your face
Because the world's a strange and evil place
Then others say because the sun shines every day
That we should live life come what may
Because the sun shines every day
But I gotta say
That I just can't put you down
And all the girls think I'm insane
You know I can't put you down
And my dad can't recall my name
But I just can't put you down
And my friends won't call back at all
But I just can't put you down
Some people say
If you feed a dog a bloody bone
He's your best friend for your life
If you feed a dog a bloody bone
Patch up your dreams
With all the gold that falls at your feet
Stick your finger in a dike
All the gold falls at your feet
And I want to say
You know I just can't put you down
And all the women think that I'm insane
You know I just can't put you down
And my Mom won't call back at all
You know I just can't put you down
I rub my wounds with alcohol
You know I just can't put you down
I just can't put you down
There ain't a pill that'll cure that pain
But I just can't put you down
You might also likeSome people say
That money can buy anything
All the drugs to cure the pain
Money can buy anything
Then some people want
All the sin and pleasure in this world
They don't care about the price
They pay for all the sin and pleasure in this world
But I've gotta say
You know I just can't put you down
I don't care how far I fall
You know I just can't put you down
And I don't care if they call back at all
I just can't put you down
All the women can forget my name
You know I just can't put you down
You know I just can't put you down
You know I just can't put you down
