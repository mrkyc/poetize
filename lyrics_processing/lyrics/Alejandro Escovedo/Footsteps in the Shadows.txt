Don't take it lightly
Those footsteps in the darkness
Don't take it lightly
There's a shadow making ground
So just sleep lightly
The hounds will find the man
Shadows shaking

They're closing in
Closing in

Don't take it lightly
Shadows dance across the treeline
Don't take it lightly
I need you more than ever
With one eye open, thunder's rolling in

They're closing in
They're closing in
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
You might also like
Hey, hey, come on, I need you more than ever
Hey, hey, come on, we're running for our lives
Hey, hey, come on, there's refuge in your heartbeat
They're closing in
They're closing in

As darkness falls, I can hear them telling stories
The scent of cigarettes
There's danger in the air
I close my eyes for a moment
You are with me
I'm glad you're safe far away from here
These men who hunt us
Know nothing of our lives
So please step lightly
There's menace in the heavens
Dark and threatening there's a shadow in the air

They're closing in
They're closing in
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, come on, I need you more than ever
Hey hey, come on, we're running for our lives
Hey, hey, come on, there's refuge in your heartbeat
They're closing in
They're closing in

Don't take it lightly
There's footsteps in the shadows
Don't take it lightly
I can feel it on my skin
One eye open, there's an evil man a-coming
They're closing in
They're closing in

Hey, hey, come on, I need you more than ever
Hey hey, come on, we're running for our lives
Hey, hey, come on, there's refuge in your heartbeat
They're closing in
They're closing in

Hey, hey, come on, there's refuge in your heartbeat
Hey hey, come on, we're running for our lives
Hey, hey, come on, I need you more than ever
They're closing in
They're closing in
Hey, hey, come on, I need you more than ever
Hey hey, come on, we're running for our lives
Hey, hey, come on, there's refuge in your heartbeat
They're closing in
They're closing in
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
