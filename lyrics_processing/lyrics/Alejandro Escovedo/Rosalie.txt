An ocean of powder and dust
Somehow I was blind
But now I can see
As you walk through this world Rosalie
Every step is one closer to me
As love we will find
What the others can't see
Your letters in mind
I love you Rosalie
Let the world spin you closer to me
Take a chance on us Rosalie
As love we begun
To find a world that is free
I want to dance with you Rosalie
I want to dance with you Rosalie
To the new years' just time
To bring you closer to me
The whispers are mine
Te amro Rosalie

Dear Rosie
The happiest Sunday of my life Rosalie:
Spending a nice, quiet day with you at home alone

Dear Joe
My darling
I'm so in love with you
I guess you know you left me speechless when you broke the news
Everything went round and round
How I wish days like those 12 would last forever
Ma and Pa aren't too happy about it
But it's harder on them, for I'll be leaving
I hope that soon, my darling, God will make all our dreams come true
I've started to take a long, hard look at all my surroundings
And at all the people I'm so crazy about
It's going to be harder than I thought leaving all this behind
I love you, can't stand being away from you
I love you
Now remember darling
I've been here all my life
But with my Joe at my side
I won't be able to complain
So never take our love Rosalie
You'll never break this love Rosalie
To the new year's just time
That's brought you closer to me
The whispers are mine
Te amro Rosalie
Your letters are mine
I love you Rosalie
I love you Rosalie
I love you Rosalie
