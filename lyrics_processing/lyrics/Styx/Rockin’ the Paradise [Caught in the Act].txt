Tonight's the night we'll make history
As sure as dogs can fly
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here to night
So take your seats and don't be late
We need your spirits high
To turn on these theatre lights
And brighten the darkest skies
Here at the paradise
Rockin the Paradise

Whatcha doin' tonight (Whatcha doin', whatcha doin')
Well have you heard that the world's gone crazy
Young Americans listen when I say
There's people puttin' us down
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days

Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun
Quick trick plans, take the money and run
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun

Whatcha doin' tonight  (Whatcha doin', whatcha doin')
I got faith in our generation
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules

Come on and take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools
Big shots, crackpots bending the rules
A fair shot here for me and for you
Knowing that we can't lose
And we'll be

Rockin' in Paradise
Rockin' the Paradise tonight
Rockin' in Paradise
Rockin' the Paradise tonight
Tonight, Tonight

Come on and take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools
Big shots, crackpots bending the rules
A fair shot here for me and for you
Knowing that we can't lose
And we'll be
Rockin' in Paradise
Rockin' the Paradise tonight
Rockin' in Paradise
Rockin' the Paradise tonight

Rockin' in Paradise
Rockin' the Paradise tonight
Rockin' in Paradise
