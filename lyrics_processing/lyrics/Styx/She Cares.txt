I tried to be the perfect soldier
I tried to be what everyone said was expected
Somehow I was selected
Well, my hands were steady, my aim was true
But deep inside of my heart I knew
That I lacked the will
I just couldn't shoot to kill

And still she treats me like a human
She says she'll still be there
I may not be a hero, but I'll be there
'cause I know she cares

I worked hard to be the greatest lover
I wanted to be sure that I was her only one
That's how I thought it was done
But I went too far, assumed too much
The need to feel a younger one's touch
Seemed important then
Oh what a fool I've been

And still she treats me like a human (like a human)
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair
'cause somehow she cares
See Styx LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like
I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes
And nobody knows what compels her
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go (never let go)


Oh yes she treats me like a human (like a human)
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair
'cause somehow she cares

I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes
And nobody knows what compels her
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go

And when the world has turned it's back on me
I won't have to feel alone
'cause I know she cares
Woah oh oh oh, I know she cares, mhm
And that's the way that it goes, woah ooh woah
I said woah woah woah woah woah woah way that it goes
I said woah woah woah woah woah woah way that it goes
