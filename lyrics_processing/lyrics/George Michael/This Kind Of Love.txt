You don't have to do without it
Just have to believe
In this kind of love
You don't have to be so scared
You don't have to hide that you care
You just have to believe
In this kind of love
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times
But you and me, can't you see baby?
Maybe we have better take a little care with this love
Oh I know
Cause I can't be happy without you
Then I'll be the one
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
I don't have to hold you down
I don't need to push you around
I just want you to be
This kind of love
You might also likeAnd if someone hurt you before
Can't you see, all that I wanna give you much more
Just have faith in me
This kind of love
Everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times
For you and me, can't you see baby?
People got to take a little bit of care when they got doubt
Don't let it go, no, never, no
And all I know
I have no reason to doubt you
Don't you think it's time to believe in someone?
So I'm telling you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
I can't let you go
Found you
Nobody's perfect, we all have a past
When you look at me
How can you ask if I love you?
Is it so hard to see?
Now everyone has to get older I know
But this empty house seems to get colder and colder
So, won't you stay here with me?
And all I know is
I have no reason to doubt you
Don't you think it's time to believe in someone?
So I'm telling you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you I can't let you go
