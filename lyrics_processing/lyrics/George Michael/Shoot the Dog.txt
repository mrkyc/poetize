I believe, I believe what the old man said
Though I know that there's no Lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love
And I say
Cherie baby, spliff up
I wanna kick back mama
And watch the World Cup with ya baby
Yeah, that's right!
We're getting freaky tonight
Stay with me tonight
Let's have some fun while Tony's stateside
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
See Tony dancing with Dubya
