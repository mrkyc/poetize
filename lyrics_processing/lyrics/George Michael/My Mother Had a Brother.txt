My mother had a brother
They say that I was born on the day that he died
"Someone to cling to", she said
"When all the noises and the shame came callin'"

My mother had a brother
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew
But she lied
I said, "Show me his face again
Tell me again why he died"
She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen
She said he wasn't strong enough
He never dared to dream a life like mine

My mother had a brother
Over-sensitive and kind
Seems it all became much too much for him
It seems he took his own life
Mum, I can't imagine the joy
And pain in equal measure
Tears in the dirt
And all over your newborn treasure
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me
Guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free
In endless sky

"But Mama, will you tell him from your boy
The times, they changed?"
I guess the world was getting warmer
And we got stronger
"Mother, will you tell him about my joy
I live each day for him"
The sun came out
Yeah, and I'm just breathin' it in
(Yeah)
(Breathin')

My mother had a brother
Same desire, different time
Seems the empty spaces tortured him
Until he took his own life
I don't know why I waited so long for love
I just don't know what I was thinking of
All that wasted time

"But Mama, will you tell him from your boy
The times, they changed?"
I guess the world was getting warmer
While we got stronger
"Mother, will you tell him about my joy?
I live each day with him"
Your son came out (Yeah)
I'm still breathin' it in

And I swear now that freedom is here
I'm gonna taste it all for you, boy
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn
I'm making so much love
So those of us who have nothing to fear
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned
I'm making so much love

I was a prisoner, but he saved me
Broke into my dreams and said, "Who cares?"
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me
I'm glad to be home
