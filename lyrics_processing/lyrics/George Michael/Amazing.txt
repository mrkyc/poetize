I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix, said daddy get you gone
I'm missin' my baby
Still missin' my baby

I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said, "How you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady

I was goin' down for the third time
My heart was broken
I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
You might also like
You tried to save me from myself
Said, "Darlin', kiss as many as you want
My love's still available"
And I know you're insatiable

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was goin' down for the third time
My heart was broken
I thought that lovin' you was out of the question
(Loving you was out of the question)
Then I saw my reflection (Reflection)
Sayin', "Please, don't let this go"

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
Celebrate this life with you baby
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
I think you should celebrate, yeah
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Don't put your love in chains, baby
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Now I walk in the midday sun
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
I never thought I would see love
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
I think it's amazing
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
I think you're amazing
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)

Celebrate!
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Celebrate!
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
As this life gets colder
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
And the devil inside
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Tells you to give up, baby
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Now I walk in the midday sun
