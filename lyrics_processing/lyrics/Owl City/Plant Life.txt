I saw a ghost on the stairs
And sheets on the tables and chairs
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink
Even so, I don't know, what to think

I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

I saw a bear in the den
Readin' my textbooks again
Bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?
You might also like

I've been longing for
(I've been longing for)
Daisies to push through the floor
(I've never really felt like this before)
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet
And give me a ghost of a smile
Show me your teeth 'cause you're a teddy beneath
So just grin and bear it a while
Just grin and bear it a while

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?

(The brook babbles on about nothing at all)
(A new leaf turns over unwilling to fall)
Tonight I'm busting out
Of this old haunted house
Because I'm sick of waiting for
All the spider webs to grow all around me
Because I don't feel dead anymore
And I'm not afraid anymore
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
