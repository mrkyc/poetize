Wake me if you're out there

Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved
So wake me if you're out there."

Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there
Wake me if you're out there

In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see
You might also like
I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
'Cause I'll be picking up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me

Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there

I keep my knees black and blue
'Cause they often hit the hard wood floor
(Wake me if you're out there)
And I believe
So I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved
So wake me if you're out there."
Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts

The indications reveal
(Wake me if you're out there)
That few of us realize life is quite surreal
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity

So if you're dying to see
