Close your tired eyes, relax and then
Count from 1 to 10 and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time

Way up in the air you're finally free
And you can stay up there right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time

When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

Gaze into my eyes when the fire starts
And fan the flame so hot it melts our hearts
Oh, the pouring rain, we'll try to put it out, but not this time
Let your colors burn and brightly burst
Into a million sparks that all disperse
And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down, but not this time
You might also like
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

A thousand heartbeats beat in time
And makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine

When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Brighter than a shooting star
