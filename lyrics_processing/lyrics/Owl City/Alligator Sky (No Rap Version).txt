Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Remember to breathe, because it'll take your breath away
When the engines cough, and you blast off
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash
Remember to live, because you're gonna be thrilled to death
When the stars collide and your eyes grow wide
Take it in with your breath against the glass
Remember to dream because it's going to be a starry night
Over every town, as you look down
So harmonize with the singing satellites
And remember to scream because you're going to be lost for words
When the sparks erupt and they light you up
Dip your toes in the galaxy because it's yours to explore tonight

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Roller coaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
My imagination's taking me away
Reverie whisper in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Roller coaster through the atmosphere
My imagination's taking me away
Let's hear it for the Universe
Where it never hurts
Diving in head-first
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way
And remember to laugh because you're living in a crazy world
Where you'll never guess what could happen next
Give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!
In the Alligator Sky
