I'm digging through the glove box
I thought I had a map in here
The driver's door doesn't lock
I bought the car my junior year
There's candy in my backpack
And you can pick our soundtrack
We're heading for the East Coast tonight
So pack your bags and hold on tight
'Cause we're taking off
We're taking off

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City

Feet up on the dashboard
We're driving with the windows down
Did you forget your phone cord?
We'll buy one in the next small town
Get dinner at an IHOP
A shower at a truck stop
We'll listen to some Johnny Cash
Take my hand and don't look back
'Cause we're moving on
We're moving on
You might also like
Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City

Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me

Stroll the midtown streets
And tell me that you don't feel giddy
Lady Liberty ain't throwing us a wink or is she?
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City
Say, "Hello," to New York City
