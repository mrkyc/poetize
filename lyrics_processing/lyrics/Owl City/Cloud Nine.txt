Pull the moon down with a lasso
Make your ceiling full of stars glow
I can sneak in through the window
And I could say it but we both know
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Meet the one who makes your heart stop
Find a diamond in a gift shop
Live a little, love a whole lot
And you'll be shouting from the rooftop
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine
You might also like
Hey baby are we almost there yet?
And how much cooler could my life get?
Take my hand and take a deep breath
And we'll ride off into the sunset

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine...
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But if your hand is in mine
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
