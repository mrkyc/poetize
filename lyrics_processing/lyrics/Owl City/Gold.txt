Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it's showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we got going
Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now
I guess you'd better be going

You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart, you're here
Go on
It's gotta be time
You're starting to shine
'Cause what you've got is

Go-o-o-o o-o o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know you're gold
You might also like
It won't take you long to get
When you feel like you're soaring
So write it all and don't forget
You gotta tell us your story
Shout out to the friends back home
Shout out to the hearts you've known
You gave 'em nothing but the best, yeah
And you can tell 'em your story

You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart, you're here
Go on
It's gotta be time
You're starting to shine
'Cause what you've got is

Go-o-o-o o-o o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know you're gold
'Cause what you have got is

Go-o-o-o o-o o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know I know
I don't need stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
I know you're gold
O-o-o-o o-o o-oh oh
I know you're gold

You're gold
