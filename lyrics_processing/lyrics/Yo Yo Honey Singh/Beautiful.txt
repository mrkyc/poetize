Assi tere college ch leya daakhla
But tu hun ose college ch padh di nai
Main haan teri pasand ya main teri napasand
Kyun tu ik gal utte kade khad di nai
Jadon di main teri akkhiyan
'Ch kutt peeti mainu angrezi daaru vi chadh di nai
Teri galli vich gede laayiye utton teri mummy kehndi
Saadi kudi kade ghare vadh di nai
Nakhre de naal pabh chaka ke pindh di jado palanga
Munde aakhi masti de vich kukkad dende wahnga
Kukkad dende wahnga
Kukkad dende wahnga
Nakhre de naal pabh chaka ke pindh di jado palanga
Munde aakhi masti de vich kukkad dende wahnga
Tenu tak ke, laale sohniye
Tenu tak ke, laale sauda tolna jaande bhul
