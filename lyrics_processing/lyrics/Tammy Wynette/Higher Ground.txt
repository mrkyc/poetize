(Higher ground)
To a higher ground
Well, I have sat alone at night
And cried myself to sleep
And I have prayed my soul to take
When sorrow seems so deep
But darkness turns so quickly
To the light of day
When someone special came along
And carried me away
Chorus:
You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me
And in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love
Lifts me to a higher ground (higher ground)
To a higher ground
You might also likeTroubled times may bring me down
And drive me to my knees
And I am blinded by despair
And cannot see
But you take a hold
And carry me again
Then I know I'll never break
Though I sometimes bend
You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me
And in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love
Lifts me to a higher ground (higher ground)
To a higher ground

You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me
And in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love
Lifts me to a higher ground
You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me
An' in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love lifts me to a higher ground
