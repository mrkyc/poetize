But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
The first day that I planted, it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and I ran out
To brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt myself
And you laughed till you cried
Yes, you were always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved you so
You surprised me with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And you could sure embarrass me
When you came home from working late 'cause you would know
That I'd been all alone and cryin'
Over some sad and lonely late, late show
And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
I wrecked the car and I was sad
And so afraid that you'd be mad, but what the heck
All afternoon you stormed around
But I knew how to cool you down, I hugged your neck
You might also likeYou came home unexpectedly
And caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing, I went away
And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
One day you were not at home
While I was there and all alone, the angels came
Guess you thought it strange of me
To leave the way I did that day, it was a shame
But now your laughter just begun
And even though you miss me hon, you must go on
And when the snow fly passes overhead
And cries down on my flower bed
You know you're not alone
See the tree how big it's grown
But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
