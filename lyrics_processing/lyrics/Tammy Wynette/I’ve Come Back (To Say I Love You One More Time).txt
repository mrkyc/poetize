I've come back to try to tell you one last time
When I was here
Before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you one more time
The hometown team was losing nine to three
An angry crowd was yelling kill the referee
A stranged dressed man set
Staring at the fans
Got up
And slowly made his way to the announcement stand
The announcer asks
Man, what's on your mind
Do you wear that silly robe and sandals all the time
As a tear rolled down the stranger's cheek
He walked up to the microphone and he began to speak
I've come back to say I love you one more time
I've come back to try to tell you one last time
When I was here before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you one more time
Half way round the world that very day
A young boy was hit by speeding car quickly drove away
As the little boy laid dead there on the street
The bearded man bent over and kissed the small child's cheek
Then the little boy get up and as started back to play
The stranger held him closer
And said I love you
Be good and be on your way

Without asking any questions he laid out and cried
Hey, crazy man
You leave my son alone
In a fightin' rage
Beat the man till his heart was almost gone
Then he call the law and they took the bearded man away
But the next morning
When they unlocked the prison's door
The stranger wasn't there anymore
But on the wall were some words that read
I've come back to say I love you one more time
I've come back to try to tell you one last time
When I was here before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you one more time
