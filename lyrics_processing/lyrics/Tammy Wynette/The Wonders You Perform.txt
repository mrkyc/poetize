And you and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most
No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to

And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to be
For the stable's such a simple thing, no wonder there were few who came
