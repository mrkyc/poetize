I've been so happy since I walked away
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today
'Cause you were nothing but a big mistake
And life is wonderful, now that I'm rid of you

Oh, I must've been crazy to have stayed with you
I can't believe I thought I was in love with you
But now the scales have fallen, I can really see
And I say, "Go to hell," 'cause that's where you took me

Well, I've felt better since I slammed that door
You always cramped my style, I never noticed before
It's been a non-stop party since I flew the coop
I can't believe I fell for such a loser like you

And is it any wonder that I felt so blue
When I was always having to put up with you?
Oh, here we go again, just lay the blame on me
Don't say another word, 'cause sweetheart, you're history

I know that you miss me really
(I bet you're loving every minute of it)
Bet you wish that you still had me
(Sitting in the kitchen eating meagre meals with the curtains closed)
You'll never find someone like me
(Go on, be a bed-sit martyr, babe)
But I've got no regrets at all
(I don't give a damn anyway)
You might also like
'Cause I've met this girl and she's so good to me
She's really beautiful, fantastic company
Oh, when I'm with her I realise what love can be
'Cause she's fifty times the person you will ever be, oh

Good luck, mister, do you think I care?
Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere
I've got a million guys just lining up for me
I've turned a corner, boy, my life is ecstasy

Well, I've been in heaven since I walked away
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today
'Cause you were nothing but a waste of space
