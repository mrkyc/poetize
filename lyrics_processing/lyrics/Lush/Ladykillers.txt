Here we go, I'm hanging out in Camden
Drinking with my girlfriends on a Saturday night
This guy says, "Come and meet my girlfriend"
She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight
So I say hello and I try to be nice
But I see he's feeling itchy
Trying to play us off each other
"Girls, girls, please don't fight"
(You get the picture)

Hey you, the muscles and the long hair
Telling me that women are superior to men
Most guys just don't appreciate this
You just try convincing me you're better than them
So he talks for hours about his sensitive soul
And his favourite subject is sex
I don't even think he really wanted it
But Christ, this guy's too much
(I wanna tell him)

I'm as human as the next girl
I like a bit of flattery
But I don't need your practised lines
Your school of charm mentality
So save your breath for someone else
And credit me with something more
When it comes to men like you
I know the score, I've heard it all before
You might also like
(Here comes the next one)
Blondie was with me for a summer
He flirted like a maniac but I wouldn't bite
I'm weak and he was so persistent
He only had to have me 'cause I put up a fight
Oh God, the boy had such an ego
He liked to talk about himself all day and all night
You think you're such a ladykiller
But you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light
When he's nice to me he's just nice to himself
And he's watching his reflection
I'm a five-foot mirror for adoring himself
Here's seven years' bad luck
(I wanna tell him)

When you say you love me
You're just flattering your vanity
But I don't need your practised lines
Your school of charm mentality
So save your breath for someone else
And credit me with something more
When it comes to men like you
I know the score, I've heard it all before
Ooh, you're such a ladykiller
Always on a winner
Thinking that you're in there
Oh boy, you're such a ladykiller
Super-sexy mister
Call it what you will, oh
You'll think you're such a ladykiller
I just bet you're still there
Posing in the mirror
Hey girls, he's such a ladykiller
But we know where he's coming from
