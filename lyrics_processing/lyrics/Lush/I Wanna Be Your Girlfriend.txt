So far, we're just friends
But I'm wondering whether
I, am I just imagining
You, or do you really have a thing for me
Like I think I see you when I see you smile
And the smile's for me
I gotta tell ya
Hey (hey), you (you), I wanna be your girlfriend
I'm trying to say I wanna be your number one
Hey (hey), you (you), I wanna be your girlfriend
Gonna make you love me 'fore I'm done
Late at night when I, when I can't sleep
Picture in my mind, it's of you and me
I, I'm telling you what I wanna be
You, you're saying you're in love with me
And oh, it feels so good in a dream
That I know in life it's just got to be
I gotta tell ya
Hey (hey), you (you), I wanna be your girlfriend
I'm trying to say I wanna be your number one
Hey (hey), you (you), I wanna be your girlfriend
Gonna make you love me 'fore I'm done

Do you really have a thing for me?
Like I think I see when I see you smile and the smile's for me?
