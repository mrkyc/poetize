Just because they seem to understand the way you feel, it
Just doesn't mean that they'll feel the same way too
Just because they seem to hold a mirror to your life, it
Just doesn't follow that they'll be just like you

Take no heroes, it's no good
They don't stand up to you
Just take the bits you think that you can use

I remember when I was younger
I thought the answers were locked in people
So I admired the ones whose lives were
A source of envy to people like me

But do you really want to meet
The ones who write your dreams?
Believe me, it's a fantasy, you won't like the reality
If you want heroes, keep them safe
They don't stand up to life so
Lock them in your soul and lose the key

(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
When I see you it makes me feel
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
There's someone else out there like me
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
You touch my soul with what you do
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
It all makes sense when I hear you
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
You understand the way I feel
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
I know exactly what you mean
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
It's like I've known you all my life
(I love you, I don't wanna meet you)
I think of you I feel alright
You might also like
But in the flesh how would it be
If you could really see
The weaknesses you never knew
Alive and staring back at you
If you want heroes keep them safe
They don't stand up to life so
Lock them in your soul and lose the key
Lock them in your soul and lose the key
