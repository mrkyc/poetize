I've tried to be strong, I've tried to be tough
But I think that this time I've had more than enough
I've seen too much of your games and your immature stuff
You're a waste of time
All the people I've known throughout all the years
Too many vodkas and too many beers
And I've learned a few lessons from all of the tears
You're way out of line

I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and look at all my friends
They mean more than the stupid fools that
Pass my way

I used to prefer those who weren't good for me
Somehow the attraction beat reality
Now all the rubbish they spill, it means nothing to me
I'm just much more wise
Some people grow up and some only pretend
They're all over the place, these children dressed up as men
They can't imagine how a woman can be only a friend
And they deal in lies
You might also like
I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and I listen to my friends
They say more than the empty words that
Pass my way
And I feel so lucky sometimes
I've got a feeling I've been here before
I can see the world for what it really is

You think that I'm jealous, well, don't be so vain
I can tell in your voice you think I want you again
Well, if I did you know I think I'd be a little insane
You just leave me cold
Ooh, you and her in your sad little world
You can only exist with the help of a girl
Well, I'm glad it's not me, I've got my life to unfurl
You're just way too old

I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and I look at all my friends
They mean more than the stupid fools that
Pass my way
And I feel so lucky sometimes
I've got a feeling I've been here before
Got a feeling I've been here before
Got a feeling I've been here before
Got a feeling I've been here before
I've been here before (I've been here before)
I've been here before (I've been here before)
I've been here before (I've been here before)
