Whoa, whoa

You don't buy me flowers
You don't buy me drinks
You don't drive me anywhere
But totally insane
We used to talk for hours
Until the night was through
But recently, your ego
Is goin' through the roof

Maybe you need a wake up call
'Cause you're too comfortable
You think because you bagged me
You don't have to work at all

It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up, wake up
You better wake up
You might also like
You underestimated
The kinda chick I am
'Cause I don't have a problem
Finding someone else
I'll put my little black dress on
And go out to the club
And you won't know what's goin' 'til tomorrow
When your boys tell you I was dancing with someone

'Cause maybe you need a wake up call
You're way too comfortable
You think because you bagged me
You don't have to work at all

It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up, wake up
You better wake up
You're taking me for granted
Boy, you're really slackin'
If I see somebody I like, I'ma have to grab 'em
Time is runnin' out, but you need do me right so
I'ma get mine back
You better wake up

It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention (To get your attention)
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat, cheat, cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up (Seems like I got it all wrong)
This is your wake up call (Oh)
This is your wake up call (Oh)
So wake up, wake up
