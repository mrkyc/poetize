6AM, radio playing
Stumble out of bed, run out the door
A brand new day
Never thought I'd have this feeling
Never thought I'd get this far
But I'm okay

And I fly
I reach out my hands and touch the sky
That's right in front of me
And I try
Just let go, relax, enjoy the ride
And I feel free
When I fly
When I fly

Thinking back
When there were days
I could barely make it out the door
So much doubt (so much doubt)
Changed my mind, changed my ways
Wasn't gonna do this anymore
I turned around

And I fly
I reach out my hands and touch the sky
That's right in front of me (right in front of me)
And I try
Just let go, relax, enjoy the ride
And I feel free

Like a butterfly who lost his soul
I choose not to hide anymore
Fly, oh
Fly

And I fly
I close my eyes and kiss the sky
That's right in front of me (right in front of me)
And I try
Just lay back, relax, enjoy the ride
And I feel free

And I fly
I reach out my hands and touch the sky
That's right in front of me (right in front of me)
And I try
Just let go, relax, enjoy the ride
And I feel free
When I fly
(La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la)
When I fly
(La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la)
When I fly
(La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la)
When I fly
(La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la)
When I fly
(La, la, la
