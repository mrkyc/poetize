I wasn't even looking for the look in your eyes
Glory Hallelujah
I feel like I've been saved
Washing in the river of your real love waves, yeah
It's something that I never felt
And I can't keep it to myself
You got me yellin' from the rooftop
So everybody knows
I'm falling for you baby
Never letting you go
I'm screaming from the mountain
Gonna sing it everywhere
Yeah, you can call me crazy
Baby I don't care
Can you hear me, hear me
Yellin' from the rooftop
Tellin' the whole world
Momma's little baby's gonna be your girl
You can call me lately lucky
I know I've been blessed
Your kissin' got my heart beatin' out of my chest
It's easy like breathin'
You make me come alive
But it's a whole lot more than just a feeling inside
