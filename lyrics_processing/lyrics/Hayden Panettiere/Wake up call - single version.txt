Whoa whoa whooa
You don't buy me flowers
You don't buy me drinks
You don't drive me anywhere
But totally insane
We used to talk for hours
Until the night was through
But recently your ego
Is going through the roof
Maybe you need a wake up call
Cos' you're too comfortable
You think because you bagged me you
Don't have to work at all
It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
You might also likeThis is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up
Wake up
You better wake up
You're underestimating
The kinda chick I am
Cos' I don't have a problem
Finding someone else
I'll put my little black dress on
And go out to the clubs
And you wonder what's going on
Tomorrow when your boys tell you
I was dancing with someone
Maybe you need a wake up call
You're way too comfortable
You think because you're bad you
Don't have to work at all
It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up
Wake up
You better wake up
You're taking me for granted
Boy you're really slacking
If I see somebody I like I'ma have to grab 'em
Time is running out but
You need to do me right so
I'ma get mine back
You better wake up
It seems like I gotta do wrong
To get your attention
But maybe when I call this man up
You'll finally start to wake up
I think I'm gonna have to cheat
To keep your eyes on me
But maybe if I make you jealous
You'll finally start to wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up (seems like I got it all wrong)
Wake up
You better wake up
This is your wake up call
This is your wake up call
So wake up
Wake up
