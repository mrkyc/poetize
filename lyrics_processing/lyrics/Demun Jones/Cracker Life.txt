Some good old country folks and we livin' the life (we livin' the life)
You can find us coast to coast, we all down to ride (we all down to ride)
On a long dark dusty road, follow them taillights (follow them taillights)
To a place way back in the cut, there's a party tonight (there's a party tonight, party tonight)

It's hard for a cracker with some rhymes and a southern drawl
Rockin' microphones in a straw hat and overalls
Folks kinda laugh 'til they hear you blow flames
And see Demun Jones is kickin' and takin' names
A few Rehab fans sayin' I ain't real
They didn't know I was raised backflippin' off a hay bail
And worked hundred hours in the week to pay bills
I got Rick Jones in my veins so I stay real
And deadbeats don't even know their own kids
But got time to get on Facebook and post comments
They ain't ever felt triple digit degrees
Floatin' the foundation foot and crawlin' on your knees
Please, the only rhyme they wrote was a love note
In middle school and the little girl checked no
They need to take a long walk off a short cliff
Criticizin' music and can't even play a riff

It's lookin' good for a cracker, the crowd's gettin' bigger
When I step on stage they hear Mud DIgger
Is any rednecks in the house and they screamin'
I see thousands of folks, I ain't dreamin'
Man I never had a doubt that I wouldn't pack it out
Rockin' every stage and blowin' the speakers out
Now D. Jones is known to flip breakers
From the Gas Monkey in Dallas to downtown Macon
Ain't had this feelin' since John Mike Montgomery
Sang lines I wrote on ride through the country
Yeah, me and J Brown go way back
8 tracks on vinyl, pitchforks and haystacks
Now it's time I'm takin' it to the next
Bringin' it mainstream and cashin' the big checks
With no effects, just work and sweat
It's as simple as that, don't make it complex

Hey everybody showed up (showed up)
And gather 'round the pile 'bout to get burned up
Bumpin' rap country, bumpin' rap country
It's all turnt up (turnt up)
