Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck it like a, buck it like a Bronco

You got me thinkin' 'bout knockin' them boots off
Hotter than a 12 gauge pump when it shoots off
Some never seen a country girl movin' it like this
I think I saw a girl in a movie just like this
Anything she want man she knows how to get it
And if you look in her eyes no you won't forget it
A little bit of brown mixed with some green
And a camouflage pattern you ain't never seen
Yep, I'm 'bout to try my luck
So I mosey right over and I said what's up
You sure looking lovely tonight, and she smiled
And said, my name's Dixie and I love to get wild

Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco

See you doin' your thing, well baby girl go ahead
Southern belle and I swear she thicker than cornbread
Walking with my chest out hoping that she notice me
Man she's so sweet that she gotta be a Georgia peach
Flip flop pretty feet, shots of the whiskey
Hope I don't overheat because she hotter than fish grease
Says shes got a couple of friends that she can bring along
Now I need a wingman, grab the phone, hit Demun Jones
DJ put the needle on, something we can sing along
Something in the air is telling me that I won't leave alone
Baby, going crazy and I'm faded
Dirty dancing like Patrick Swayze, amazin'
Now we ridin' round bumping outlaw music
100 miles an hour like the outlaws do it
You know we can go anywhere that you wanna roll
And then you saddle up, welcome to the rodeo

Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Here we go, here we go, she dancin' on the bar
Pourin' everybody shots while she drinkin' from a jar
Dukes are so tight, don't know how she fits in
I can't wait get below the Mason Dixon
Shes lookin' for more than a 8 second ride
Buckin' like a Bronco with her hand in the sky
And she could tame a Brahma bull
The way she stays on it is remarkable
You can see the boys' and the girls' jaws drop
The way she move her body might make your heart stop, uh
Pacemakin', shakin' under the lights
She got moves to bring it back to life, when she starts to

Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco

Oh no, she drop it real low
On a tailgate of a Silverado
She must be a pro, I was like, whoa
She threw me the keys and whispered let's go
Buck it like a, buck it like a, buck it like a Bronco

Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Shake what you got, let me see a little more
From the ceilin' to the floor, let me see what you workin' with
Drop it real low then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco

Let me see a little more
Let me see what you're workin' with
And then buck it like a Bronco
Buck it like a, buck, buck, buck it like a Bronco
Let me see a little more
Let me see what your workin' with yeah
And then buck it like a Bronco
