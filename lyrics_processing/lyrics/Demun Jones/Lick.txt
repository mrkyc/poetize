You might love him more than me (Uh huh)
'Cause he's got more money than me (Uh huh)
But you'll always come back to me
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick  (Uh huh, uh huh)
He might take you on the town (Uh huh)
But he ain't known for going down (Uh huh)
So you'll always come back around
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick (Uh huh)

A little time passed since we've been together
Now you playin' tricks thinkin' you're clever whatever
You can take a hike tell your man bite the spike
Next time he kiss you tell him that whats Demun tastes like (Haha)
I don't appreciate you waistin' your breath
Callin' me up out of nowhere sayin' sorry nothing's left
But thanks for the time and energy you committed
You got Percy but personally I think he's scared to hit it
Ain't what your used to I know you won't admit it
You refuse to but deep down you can't forget it
How we got down can't live without or with it
So anytime I expect you to be callin' for a visit
Or sendin' me cards tellin' me how much you miss it
With no names signed but you ain't gotta say who is it
The P.S. can't wait to feel you face, kiss it
Gave me the clue to figure out it was you
You might also like
You might love him more than me (Uh huh)
'Cause he's got more money than me (Uh huh)
But you'll always come back to me
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick  (Uh huh, uh huh)
He might take you on the town (Uh huh)
But he ain't known for going down (Uh huh)
So you'll always come back around
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick (Uh huh)

Now, that feelin' comin' back
You tryna get where I'm at, leavin' notes on my door mat
But you ain't told that to your man had end fact
If your was informed of that he'd stat
If he only knew you dreamed of me gettin' slick in it
He'd look back be glad for not stickin' with it
So I kept my secret used it for my benefit
Let you handle it and not interferred with it
Now you've been with him a year and I can still get it
I just call when he's gone and it's on with it
I'll give direction if you want a place specific
I'll be there when you get there call me when you near it
I'll give you the password knock and let me hear it
I'll unlock the door for sure you're about to pour
I can feel it like waves when they crash onto the shore
And I'm sure you'll be in touch soon if you need some more
You might love him more than me (Uh huh)
'Cause he's got more money than me (Uh huh)
But you'll always come back to me
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick  (Uh huh, uh huh)
He might take you on the town (Uh huh)
But he ain't known for going down (Uh huh)
So you'll always come back around
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick
You might love him more than me (Uh huh)
'Cause he's got more money than me (Uh huh)
But you'll always come back to me
'Cause I lick, 'cause I lick  (Uh huh, uh huh)
