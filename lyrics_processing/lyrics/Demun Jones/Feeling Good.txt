Woo

I'm feelin' good, catch me in the south like
Rollin' in a blacked out, outrunnin' the sunrise
I'm feelin' good, devil on my hip
Angel by my side, man everything is alright
I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)
Man I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)

Demun-Demun Jones-Jones, county in the end
Zoned out because I've been gone with the wind
I've blown a lot of money on these headphones and micro
Nomad, runnin' the roads, rockin' shows, vocal recital
Just keep makin' sure they hear you rattlin' the rear view
Breakin' speakers, flippin' fuses, takin' no L's I refuse
I don't do it for the money just the love
Then my hustle turned a little to a lot, that's enough to buy them things
We always wanted for ourself and I just daydreamed of but
Bring it in the livin' room and set it right there
It's like we livin' in a dream and you wouldn't know if you seen it
Look in the window, wait just let me clean it

I'm feelin' good, catch me in the south like
Rollin' in a blacked out, outrunnin' the sunrise
I'm feelin' good, devil on my hip
Angel by my side, man everything is alright
I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)
Man I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)

Livin' out here you can keep the pace if you just slow it down
To a crawl we creepin' when we drivin' we speedin'
That don't mean we in a rush, we racin' so button your buckle
And flow through these fields, coyotes and honeysuckles
Trouble seems so far when you stay livin' in the present tense
Ain't watchin' no news or reading nothin' 'bout no president
We obey the law as long as everybody's watchin'
Then we stop it, drop it, load it up, dress it and chop it
I ain't gotta do what tookie, puttin' food up on my table
It's feelin' good to be willin' and able, I'm able
To stay on my grizzly, busy and grateful
And I stock a lot of lead for animals and hatefuls

I'm feelin' good, catch me in the south like
Rollin' in a blacked out, outrunnin' the sunrise
I'm feelin' good, devil on my hip
Angel by my side, man everything is alright
I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)
Man I'm feelin' good (Ooh-ooh ooh-ahh good ooh-ooh ooh-ahh)
