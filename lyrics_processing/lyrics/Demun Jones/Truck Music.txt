Hey redneck

I'm no background check at the gun show loaded
Beowulf 50 caliber gettin' toted
And my rifle rack stacked got my buddies in the back
Camouflage and black, and we 'bout to go straight (Redneck)

Get em up, get 'em up, if you're ridin' in your truck
With your windows rolled down, got Jones turnt up
Get em up, get 'em up, if you're ridin' in your truck
With your windows rolled down and you don't give a what
Get em up, get 'em up, if you're ridin' in your truck
With your windows rolled down, got Jones turnt up
Get em up, get 'em up, if you're ridin' in your truck
With your windows rolled down 'bout to go straight up

Aw naw, look who's home, everybody duck, it's Demun Jones
I got buck, I'm gon' get money, ain't nobody gonna stop me buddy
Boy, we balls to the wall, brawl with hogs, hound dogs in he fog, slice logs
Like you ain't seen a chainsaw, Trijicon red dot straight locked on, no we don't chase y'all
Long range, danger, scarin' 'em like a stranger
Georgia bulldogs and Arkansas rollin' up like a (Redneck)
Dropped another banger again, changin' the game
Walked on stage at Arbuckle off road, they chantin' my name
That's a hell of a way from home to be so well known
I straight boot scootin' boogie, get my money, get gone
And I ain't into the labels but I wanted to be clear
I'm straight Jones County country boy, living life like a (Redneck)

Redneck with a flow finna go get the bow, ain't nobody really wanna step on my toes
'Cause I'm backwoods, yeah the woods are back boy
So how y'all been, finna get in to something 'cause I'm rollin'
With Demun, last time me and him go together we went (Rahh)
Thirty-ought-six on my hip with the little ballistic tip bullets
And it's equipped with optics that'll knock a tick off a gnat's ass
But it kicks like a donkey with a pit viper bitin' him
Without any venom in his fangs, so he just keeps strikin' him (Damn, boy)
