Demun Jones from the muddy south
Highway 11 with the creek behind the house
Anywhere you turn hear guns bust loud
Hard work, hard play, yeah, that's what we about
I love them country girls, we call 'em Dixie dimes
And when I'm in the club, yeah they play it every time
And I ain't talkin' cute man I'm talkin' 'bout fine
And you never seen a thing until you've seen mine
And then she gets loud with her hands in the air
When the music turned up like she just don't care
The boys pulled the jar out and passed it around
She turned straight up, drank the whole thing down
Bar closed down, we took it to the pasture
A hundred rednecks, 99 of 'em plastered
And that's how it's done in the 478
Straight from the heart of Georgia, and we're stayin' up late

Got our Deere's big enough to hide guns inside
Don't need a 'frigerator, all the food is alive
Got a ride big enough to haul around the fellas
Got a wardrobe that'll make Uncle Si jealous
Can't call a duck quite as good as Willie
But I got a right hook that'll knock your ass silly
Alpha type male, hillbilly maniac
I've been to jail one time and I ain't goin' back
So we lay back low back in the backwoods
Mindin' our biz and we try to act good
Yeah, 'cause that's the way we was raised
And by the way, yeah we're set in our ways

Cr-crank it up past 11 'til I'm turnt up
All-all the girls get-get done up
