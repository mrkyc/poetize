Pack a bag you can tote or drag you ain't returning no time soon
Not until every corner's swept and you've collected every clue
Find yourself lost in the dark in unfamiliar parts
Stay grateful because you have the light in your mind and within your heart
As the great journey starts stay focused on your steps
'Cause with each one a lesson's learned and it pulls you from the depths
Ignore those little voices, the ones that echo in your head
Those evil tones won't lead you home, they'll haunt you until the next

I never was an overnight success
My dreams outran the darkness when I slept
It's been the long way for me and in the end we'll finally see
Take me home every day I pray I took the long way
I took the long way, oh the long way
Heartaches and pain through my lifetime has shown me
Judgements not my place, you can see it on a sinner's face
And when I finish the race know I took the long way

The Devil came down to Georgia, I spun him and sent him back
'Cause gambling here's illegal, son, and my soul's still intact
The bag is packed for what lies ahead and you don't scare me at all
But nothin' does and that's all because I'm not afraid of the fall
The signs they show me where to turn so I don't need a map
I'm armed with faith in a sinful place as I wander through the traps

Everything I ever needed has fallen in my hands
Food to eat and a bed to sleep in, a roof up over my head
Never took for granted all the seeds I planted and the time it took to grow
It's the long way or the wrong way, we all reap what we sow

I never was an overnight success
My dreams outran the darkness when I slept
It's been the long way for me and in the end we'll finally see
Take me home every day I pray I took the long way
I took the long way, oh the long way
Heartaches and pain through my lifetime has shown me
Judgements not my place, you can see it on a sinner's face
And when I finish the race know I took the long way

Everything I ever needed has fallen in my hands
Fallen in my hands
Everything I ever needed has fallen in my hands
Food to eat, a bed to sleep in, and a roof above my head

Lord, please protect me in this dark place
So I can provide for my family
And keep them safe
Everything I ever needed has fallen in my hands
Everything I ever needed has fallen in my hands
