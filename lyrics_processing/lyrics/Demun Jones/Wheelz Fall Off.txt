The rain movin' in so we movin' on out
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Fast, loud, and low, a tall ladder means
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Yeah we about to get in more mud than you ever seen
We gonna sling it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
We reppin' that flag until the day we die
We gonna fly it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)

Put a ride out here with my other ride
It's so high I need a trampoline to get inside
It take a half of tank of gas to go a quarter mile
And when I crank it up it shakes the whole mud pile
I can't drive it on the road it's way too wide
But it can float across the pond, yeah I wouldn't lie
With Super AG-54 flotation tires
They cost just as much money as the whole ride
And when you see me rollin' in you gonna know why
Just like a tank that's with us a Suzuki Samurai
And jaws drop to the ground when we ride by
They all lookin' up 'cause we sittin' sky high

The rain movin' in so we movin' on out
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Fast, loud, and low, a tall ladder means
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Yeah we about to get in more mud than you ever seen
We gonna sling it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
We reppin' that flag until the day we die
We gonna fly it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)

Tuned up, gassed up, rollin' up on the scene
Sittin' six feet up, loud, tall, and mean
We about to sling more mud than you ever seen
Outside stay dirty, inside stay clean
My crew dressed the same like a football team
Wearin' Muddy Muddy shirts if you know what I mean
Boots of course with some Carhardtt jeans
My straw hats a crown that makes me the king
Squad of cheerleaders you can hear 'em scream
Louder than a bunch of drunks with Jim Beam
They all so fine, it's hard to believe
That they love gettin' dirty, every rednecks dream

The rain movin' in so we movin' on out
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Fast, loud, and low, a tall ladder means
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Yeah we about to get in more mud than you ever seen
We gonna sling it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
We reppin' that flag until the day we die
We gonna fly it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)

We rollin' deep, not as deep as the mud
We gettin' rowdy the music is turned up
Keep 'em comin' I just can't get enough
They must love it 'cause they keep showin' up
These shorts barely cover half of her butt
Dixie dimes, you should see the trucks
Big foot status jacked up
And they all homemade, man it's just nuts
The rain movin' in so we movin' on out
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Fast, loud, and low, a tall ladder means
We gonna ride it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
Yeah we about to get in more mud than you ever seen
We gonna sling it 'til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
We reppin' that flag until the day we die
