America!
You know if you travel around this country
You'll notice that it ain't all this
And it ain't all that (USA!)
But it is a little bit of everything
All kinds of places and all kinds of people together

We're all equal, right now we the people
Now is the time, we do nor see no evil
It's just blue sky, the winds blow and the birds fly
In formation, one nation under God
Whether it's affliction, Louis Vuitton
That pricey true religion or straight up camouflage
From the hood to the city, way out in the sticks
The whole world's only got one country like this

What color are you
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
America, throw your hands up, hands up
The dream is comin' true, let's run it

Say what we like, go anywhere we want
We can love who we wanna and avoid who we don't
We can pray every day, get mad and fight
Raise hell and protest to defend our rights
Vote for the underdog and still be alright
We make news, we still in pursuit, happiness in life
Start from the ground and build it up on your own
Another reason to be proud this land's our own

Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
America, throw your hands up, hands up
The dream is comin' true
Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
Everybody put your flag up, flag up
'Cause this is your land too

Big fields, we eat corn, Kentucky hills
Detroit meals, backyard moonshine stills
People of every shade, they hustle to get the bills paid
Long days workin', family first for certain
But you can have it worse 'cause soldiers get sent first
Then they come home hurt and they're rollin' deep in a hearse
And they did it for you because that's what you're worth
So don't forget to tell 'em thank you for the service, service

Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
America, throw your hands up, hands up
The dream is comin' true
Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
Everybody put your flag up, flag up
'Cause this is your land too
Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
America, throw your hands up, hands up
The dream is comin' true
Welcome our youth
Me, I'm RedWhiteBlue
Everybody put your flag up, flag up
