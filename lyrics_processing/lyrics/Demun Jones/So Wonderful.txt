Yeah
She's my Dixie dime, watch her shine every time she cross my mind
I get lost in her smile, and her love it drives me wild
All day I could stare at the sumlight in her hair
I just wanna make certain that she knows how much I care
Knows I'm dedicated to keep her safe and happy through
Anything that comes and goes I'll be by your side
With your hand in mine every time you need me girl I'm right there
Servin' my purpose protectin' and providin' you care
With this heart full of love and pocket full of money
Big truck full of gas to take you anywhere honey
Yeah we can ride across town or fly overseas
As long as you ridin' shotgun baby it don't matter

Oh girl you know you shine like a Dixie dime
Like the sun on the water like the moon through the pines
Oh where did you get that laugh where did you get that smile
Where did you get your everything 'cause everything about you
Oh you're so wonderful

She's my Dixie dime, one of a kind when she shines I go blind
When she smiles all the clouds they run off and hide
When we walk through everybody stares 'cause she's beautiful
But I'm never stressed I feel blessed standin' next to you
Keep a picture in my wallet so you're never far away
Screensaver on my phone smilin' at you all day
I'm never tired of lookin' I'm never tired of talkin'
I'm never tired of lovin' you tellin' you very often
How you're the most special and gorgeous girl I've met yet
And this love we have will last that I'm willin' to bet
That if you trust in me honey I can show you
The softest place of land is in these hands and I can hold you
You might also like
Oh girl you know you shine like a Dixie dime
Like the sun on the water like the moon through the pines (Through the pines)
Oh where did you get that laugh where did you get that smile (Get that smile)
Where did you get your everything 'cause everything about you
Oh you're so wonderful

There's nothin' more precious, there's no one more important
There's nothin' more enjoyable that keeps me lookin' forward
Like gettin' home from a trip and you meet me in the foyer
And askin' about the concerts and did they clap for ya
Just knowin' that you're proud of me sure means a lot
But knowin' that you're truly happy is what fills up my heart
And when I see you smile my whole life is complete
There's nothin' else in this world that I could ever need

Oh girl you know you shine like a Dixie dime
Like the sun on the water like the moon through the pines (Through the pines)
Oh where did you get that laugh where did you get that smile (Tet that smile)
Where did you get your everything 'cause everything about you
