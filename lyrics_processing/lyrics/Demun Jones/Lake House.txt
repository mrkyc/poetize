Pack up the party let's take it to the lake house
Two wave runners and a Ski Nautique
We can pick up a keg and make some Margaritas
Get barefoot, sunburnt, and barely any sleep

Now everyday is Labor Day or Fourth of July
When it's the cool side of hot and not a cloud in the sky
Ain't got a care in this world, ain't got no plans
I'm just around the house hangin' out with all my friends
And then it crossed my mind: up 1-29
And across three bridges is a hell of a time
Lake Sinclair, Putnam county ain't far
TJ call the women, Dylan grab a couple jars
Tell Brad get the brewskis, Luke bring the liquor
And I'll tune up the Martin so I can pick a little
Cody B. bring that cooler that's long and wide
And 'bout four feet deep and fill it with ice

Pack up the party let's take it to the lake house
Two wave runners and a Ski Nautique
We can pick up a keg and make some Margaritas
Get barefoot, sunburnt, and barely any sleep

We got folks on boats, jetskis and floats
And we jumpin' out of trees and we swingin' off ropes
Got a cooler full of Bud, Jack, Jimmy, and cokes
Pontoon packed with buddies and they all got jokes
I got my nephew fishin' red crawlers on the hook
Threw a hog in the ground, let that big fellow cook
Cannonball contest and some cutoff jeans
I pull my jack-knife out but I don't wanna 'cause a scene
Like them camouflage bikinis, hello kitty
All Jones County girls and they sure are pretty
Belly buttons in the shade if you know what I mean
Cornbread fed shakin' like somethin' you never seen
Every country boy's dream you can keep on dreamin'
'Cause that one right there yeah she belongs to Demun
The highway on the Exit we gettin' turnt up
Honey pour me another drink in my solo cup, come on

Pack up the party let's take it to the lake house

When the night starts fallin' and the tops still poppin'
And the fun just begun let the sun keep a'droppin'
And put your Off on and put your Off on
Now playin' my guitar and feelin' a little silly
Tryin' to break a G-string and sing a little Willie
The sun went down and the moon's all the way up
The moonshine's shinnin' looks like we gonna stay up
So crank that boombox and pour some more shots
It's the white trash Hamptons the dance floor's the dock
We just gettin' started and the party don't stop
The sheriff is my neighbor we ain't worried 'bout the cops so
