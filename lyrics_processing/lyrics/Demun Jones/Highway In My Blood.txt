Yeah

I got the pedal on the floor and my eyes on the road
I ain't stoppin' 'til I get where I'm goin'
I ain't scared of dyin' I'm afraid of not livin'
And I'm headed right through the unknown (Come on)
The Lord know I'm drivin' way too fast
Payin' no mind to a speed limit sign (Naw)
I ain't stoppin' for nothin' but a tank of gas
And I just crossed another state line (Come on)
I've been ridin' for three days straight
But I grew up with my hands on the wheel (That's right)
The only drug I need is black top therapy
If you ride you know how I feel

I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I'm ridin' with the devil, got the highway in my blood
Grindin' gears like an outlaw son
I got my wheels in the chrome hard glued to the pavement
I'm speedin' like a demon on the run

Yeah, Mr. King from the 615, I-65 so much
They oughta give me a road sign
I got a thing for hot chicks, fast rides
I stay high certified half your bloodline
I feel boss up and down this highway
When I say it's in my blood believe every word
Earned stripes, paid dues, got up the long way
Full of road rats scars and burns
I say when Jones calls ain't no money involved
When you believe in the cause real recognize real
We had 10,000 hours, 'bout 10 million miles
Way before the dough and the record deal

I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I'm ridin' with the devil, got the highway in my blood
Grindin' gears like an outlaw son
I got my wheels in the chrome hard glued to the pavement
I'm speedin' like a demon on the run

Little bit of lovin' and some high octane
Makes everything better and it keeps me
No use tryin' 'cause I can't change
I've always gone against the grain (That's right)
Due west tryna chase the sunset
If I don't slow down then I might pass it (Yeah)
It's like I'm riding in some kind of time machine
And I'm swerving in and out of traffic (Yeah)
A speed demon don't know how to act
I'm full throttle blowin' smoke stack
Ridin' like a devil with a rebel soul
And I'm flying with wings on my back

I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I'm ridin' with the devil, got the highway in my blood
Grindin' gears like an outlaw son
I got my wheels in the chrome hard glued to the pavement
I'm speedin' like a demon on the run

Highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I got the highway in my blood
I'm ridin' with the devil, got the highway in my blood
Grindin' gears like an outlaw son
I got my wheels in the chrome hard glued to the pavement
