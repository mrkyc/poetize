I'm not tryin' to complain, I'm so thankful for what I got
I work my fingers to the bone but these bills they never stop
No matter how much overtime I get it ain't quite enough
The mortgage get's late, something breaks and that's when the times get tough
And bad things come in threes but I wish that wasn't true
'Cause I don't think I can take another after this one and two
There's still a roof over our head and plenty of food to eat
Clean clothes for both of the kids, socks and shoes on their feet
And they got no idea I'll never let them see me sweat
I'll do what I got to do to make it right with no regrets
And if my stress gets to high then I will take a step outside
Embrace the sounds the nature makes my backyard lullaby

Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my lawn chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
One more time with the backyard lullaby

Like every other workin' man I go through tryin' times
When responsibilities weight heavy on my mind
And I just need to get away and take a walk outside
I don't need no flashlight, I got stars and moonshine
Than the breeze starts whistlin', the whippoorwill starts singin'
I love listenin' to forget the way that I'm feelin'
'Cause sounds I hear at night I don't notice in the day
All the dogs barkin' loud like they got something to say
Engines in the diesel trucks roaring down the highway
I feel bass beatin' in speakers a mile away
If my tension starts to rise I got to be outside
That's the only place I can hear my backyard lullaby

Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my long chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
One more time with the backyard lullaby
Listen to the crickets sing, the rattle of the dog chain
Listen to the southbound breeze just creepin' through the trees
And the creak of the weather vein
Sittin' in my long chair, sending up a little prayer, I need some answers tonight
Turn my troubles down low, Lord soothe my soul
