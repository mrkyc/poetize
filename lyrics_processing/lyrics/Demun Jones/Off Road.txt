We're going off road, way back off the highway (Uh)
Head out the window with the hat cocked sideways
Chrome stacked blowing black to the skyway
Put on some Hank, let's crank it like it's Friday
Off road, way back off the highway (Uh)
Head out the window with the hat cocked sideways (I got my boys)
Chrome stacked blowing black to the skyway (Uh)

I've got my boys and my beer, they got toys jacked up to here
Got room for a loaded white tail in the rear, get a ladder 'cause you gotta climb up in here
Ain't talking 'bout deer, y'all know it, yeah we going off road for sure
It's time for the boys with the rounds to blow it, where you see the convoy, don't follow it
Let's just roll, roll, way back off the highway where nobody knows
Corn rows and the sun shining bright right through the pine trees, that's where you'll find me
Light breeze, Yeti on freeze, 71 Z's and Betty's on these
Rocking the states, Canadians overseas, refugees, Thai friends and Chinese
Hit the web store for tanks and tees, with the logo on it please and thanks for the cheese
Everything that JC boy needs, like feedin' my chicks red wings and real trees
Ammunition's for R 15's with a bump stock jumpin' like backward jeans
Yeah, that's me, the one choppin' down trees, flippin' through high capacity magazines
