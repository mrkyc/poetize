We all in the back of my pickup
Blue tarp down with a hose runnin' water inside
She was sippin' on apple pie moonshine
That's when I saw that tan leg beauty walk by
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise, yeah, yeah

I woke up late, the sun rose before I laid down
Party was great but now it's onto the next round (Ayy)
Now I'm struttin' 'cause the coffee is stronger
Brushed my teeth, got dressed, time to get gone
My ride's kinda shiny and it's full of gas
My favorite song came on and I made it blast
A cop pulled me over for driving too fast
But it's all good he just wants an autograph
The sun shinin' not a cloud in the sky
And every person I rode by waved to say hi
My phone started shakin' a text came through
She was askin' if it's cool if her friends came too

We all in the back of my pickup
Blue tarp down with a hose runnin' water inside
She was sippin' on apple pie moonshine
That's when I saw that tan leg beauty walk by
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise, yeah, yeah

She was hotter than a sauna
She turned her two piece to a one then a one to nothin' on her
Now she dancin' with the water
Singin' old school hip hop, wanna be a baller
A barbecue, got the Green Egg smoked out
The picnic table loaded look like a steakhouse
Folks pilin' in as the sun starts to fade
But they just get started, we've been at it all day
Living life in the moment, no regrets
Just one of them days that you won't forget
It ain't about them time zones or area codes
It's all the same damn thing everywhere that we go

We all in the back of my pickup
Blue tarp down with a hose runnin' water inside
She was sippin' on apple pie moonshine
That's when I saw that tan leg beauty walk by
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
I was livin' in paradise, yeah, yeah
