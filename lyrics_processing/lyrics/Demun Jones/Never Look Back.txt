Yeah-yeah
We ridin' high but I ain't smokin' nothin'
Yeah

Get a four door, then we jack it up and we go broke
Then it's 'bout the work tryna make more money so we can blow
On some bigger loud speakers and a hardwood floor
I want a plexiglass box ISO with some mirrors
Double up the amps so the whole world hear us
Turn up the Jones that jar and Charlie Far
Try and keep it on the road, don't run over no cars
We got a reputation, we can't outrun
Like they may be drunk they know I'm totin' the guns
So no shootin' tonight, it might wake the neighbors
I live by the law but I'm runnin' out of favors

When we're rollin' off road, I don't ever look back
Don't matter where I go, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Never look back, that's how we do that
When it's time to rock a show, I don't ever look back
When I'm in the studio, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Yeah I never look back, that's how we do that

Blowin' black smoke
Causin' global warmin' with these straight pipes
Everybody hear me comin' at the red light
I rev it and make it roar
With one boot on the break and the other on the floor
Leavin' black lines hundred yards when I peeled out
Off road rooster tail, turnin' the field out
(Who's that?) They all so curious
Lookin' like a stuntman so fast and furious
Don't slow down 'til I hit the hoe down and throw down
The sun's down, it's getting kinda packed about the whole town
My hometown, Jones County that's where we run now
Kickin' up mud, startin' a little trouble now

When we're rollin' off road, I don't ever look back
Don't matter where I go, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Never look back, that's how we do that
When it's time to rock a show, I don't ever look back
When I'm in the studio, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Yeah I never look back, that's how we do that
Where them Georgia boys
Carolina, Mississippi and the 'Bama boys
Illinois, Oklahoma, Indiana boys
Arkansas and Texas, Louisiana boys
Y'all make noise
Where them Georgia girls
Carolina, Florida and all the 'Bama girls
Illinois, California, Indiana girls
All the Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana girls

When we're rollin' off road, I don't ever look back
Don't matter where I go, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Never look back, that's how we do that
When it's time to rock a show, I don't ever look back
When I'm in the studio, I don't ever look back
Not worried 'bout nothin', I don't ever look back
Yeah I never look back, that's how we do that

Look back, I don't ever look back
Look back, I don't ever look back
Look back, I don't ever look back
Never-never look back, that's how we do that
Look back, I don't ever look back
Look back, I don't ever look back
Look back, I don't ever look back
