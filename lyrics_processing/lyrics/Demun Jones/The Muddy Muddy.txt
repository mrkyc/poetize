Mount up if you got a big truck
That's Jones in your speaker boy, better turn it up (up)
You know it ain't a party if the trucks ain't muddy
If the system ain't bumpin' if somebody ain't bloody
The muddy muddy

Give it up, camo, dip, ride, pack of peaches in my four wheel drive
Black, yoda, high, ridin' my hometown I can't hide
Stack vocals, just right, oh you know country folk can sho' rhyme
Lean out to the side and get a swig of real moonshine
Real Tree, camo covered, muddy sneakers ladies love it
Braised hat, other puppies, muddy south ain't for yuppies
Dirt road, riding daily, night time we shinin' maybe
You can ride, don't tell nobody, we ain't tryina get locked up

Mount up if you got a big truck
That's Jones in your speaker boy, better turn it up (Up)
You know it ain't a party if the trucks ain't muddy
If the system ain't bumpin' if somebody ain't bloody
The muddy muddy

We don't need no dance floor to get this thing jumpin'
'Cause the bed of my big black truck keeps em' comin'
Dixie dimes on the back, all 10's you best believe
It's your buddy from the muddy, so don't hate me
Sleep 'til noon, and refill the Igloo
Sodas if you don't brew, if you do bottle of Jager
(Oh dear god mud digger flow goes hard)
Yes ma'am, you heard right, mud tight
Get lit like a ball field all night
Cut off skimpy, shake it like a pom pom
Mud digger beat, come get some

You know it ain't a party if the trucks ain't muddy
If the system ain't bumpin' if somebody ain't bloody
The muddy muddy

Heart of Georgia, Jones county, country boys living rowdy
Rep your woods, raise your right, fly Old Glory on the side
If you proud then salute, aim your guns up and shoot
Rifle rack in the back, 308 and a double deuce
Now I'm back in the muddy, back in the truck
Droppin' it low, we never stuck
Nice ride but mine is better, platinum package saddle leather
Cowgirls come on in, plenty of room, bring your friends
Cab issues we fillin' it up, muddy south we livin' it up

That's Jones in your speaker boy, better turn it up (Up)
You know it ain't a party if the trucks ain't muddy
If the system ain't bumpin' if somebody ain't bloody

You know it ain't a party if the trucks ain't muddy
If the system ain't bumpin' if somebody ain't bloody
The muddy muddy
Now I'm back in the muddy, back in the truck-truck-truck
Back-back in the muddy, back in the truck-truck-truck
Now I'm back in the muddy, back in the truck
Droppin' it low, droppin' it low
