I'm all the way up, sittin' first class
Pedal to the metal, tank full of gas
Can't slow down, I'm movin' too fast
Headed back to the county, ridin' full blast

Pedal to the metal, gas on smash (Woah)
I can't slow down, I'm movin' too fast
Headed back to the county, we gotta roll, dog

Yeah, I'm rollin' up with the big dogs, but I ain't playin'
Got my helmet and shoulder pads, what was you sayin'?
Trouble down in the boondocks
Well, I roll up with a huntin' rifle in and two Glocks (Yeah)
Yeah, you talk a big game, but you can't skin it
