Yeah, yeah

No rules when you come down my way
That's why my field stays packed on Fridays
We huntin' (Huntin'), fishin' (Fishin'), good livin'
Just soakin' up every country second we're given
Yeah, we a long way away from the highway
So go ahead y'all you can get sideways
Smokin', sippin', dip spittin'
Just soakin' up every country second you're given

So once you cash your paycheck and count it, whatcha gonna do now?
Well in my county we hold it down and everybody's allowed
We all know all of y'all, it ain't no thing to draw a crowd
You just follow the sound away from town to the music playin' loud
Leave your stress and politics at home where they belong
And we'll build a memory of a lifetime, it's the kind you hear in a song
We only get this life to live, come on and live it before it's gone
Every second we're given, that's a gift and it won't last long
So lets spend it like it's the last doin' whatever we like
Surrounded by friends and family, tellin' jokes, laughin' all night
Sippin' on whatever you brought to drink, dancin' to the mornin' light
Country fried dive, lakeside waves, come on let's ride

Smokin', sippin', dip spittin'
Just soakin' up every country second you're given

So let that music take you, up and away, enjoy the view
Keep that playlist a pumpin' and the girls'll do what they do
Keep your cash in your pocket 'cause we don't care what you got
Here and now that's the money, hey man and that's a lot
Spendin' time off of your clock, vibin' until it's shocks
The energy here's electric, we're dancin' on every toolbox
Lose the socks, it's a party, we turnt off in the field
And if I said that I was, then you best believe that I will
Make you feel good for real, way more than a pill could
Make every worry melt away in the flame, man I light the wood
I got that bonfire a rollin', the pile is burnin' high
Country fried snappin' pig sideways, come on let's ride

No rules when you come down my way
That's why my field stays packed on Fridays
We huntin' (Huntin'), fishin' (Fishin'), good livin'
Just soakin' up every country second we're given
Yeah, we a long way away from the highway
So go ahead y'all you can get sideways
Smokin', sippin', dip spittin'
