Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Lying on the beach, dog at my feet, my girl by my side, rolling up trees
No matter where we go, we're gonna get sideways
As the sun goes down, in comes the night and I thank my lucky stars in the sky
It sure feels like it's all going my way

Uh, no cares, breathing the fresh air
Sunshine glows, wind blowing her long hair
Nah, I ain't thinking 'bout nowhere
You mark the spot, baby, I wanna go there
Easy up ten, boombox on blast
Playing Three Little Birds, got my lunchbox packed
Not worried 'bout a thing, no, no
'Cause "It's all gonna be alright"
Yeah, gold ain't what I'm after, memories and laugher
Holding your hand is something that I have to have in the bad times
Hit me with the good vibes
Opened up my eyes to what paradise looks like

Lying on the beach, dog at my feet, my girl by my side, rolling up trees
No matter where we go, we're gonna get sideways
As the sun goes down, in comes the night and I thank my lucky stars in the sky
It sure feels like it's all going my way

A message in a bottle washed up on the shore from a long time ago, dated 2004
A lot of X's and O's and P.S. I love you more
Reminds me of a time I knew that you were for sure
I was over the moon as soon as that first kiss
Every single day since has been just like this
I don't wanna miss a thing, tryna take it all in
As the sun sets on the sea, yeah
Cologne from the campfire, smoking out the sand bar
Songs like this is something that I have to have in the bad times
Hit me with the good vibes
Opened up my eyes to what paradise looks like

Lying on the beach, dog at my feet, my girl by my side, rolling up trees
No matter where we go, we're gonna get sideways
As the sun goes down, in comes the night and I thank my lucky stars in the sky
