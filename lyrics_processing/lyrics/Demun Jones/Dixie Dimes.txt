Dixie Dime
Why you put on that outfit that make you look so fine?
Why you got on that Red Bull red lipstick?
You know it blows my mind
Bikini-top and the body that rocks Rowdy Cowboy that never stops
Saddle up, climb on top, get ready to move when the music drop
Now, slid, slide, shake it, shake it
The way you move, girl, I can't take it
Bend it, but please don't break it
Southern belle got the boys all achin'
Stand around in a line, camera phones out to see you shine
Bright as the sun, you're the Dixie Dime
A one-in-the-9-lifetime kinda find, c'mon

Dixie Dime, Dixie Dime
Back it up one time, trot that behind
Dixie Dime, Dixie Dime
This right here's your time to shine
Dixie Dime, Dixie Dime
Don't stop now, girl, press rewind, c'mon
Dixie Dime, Dixie Dime
Get yer high-heel boots, girl, get in line, c'mon

Dixie Dime, you know what time it is
We gon' handle business and rock
This is the part we start the party
Back it up and then stop
Drop (Drop) that thang to the ground and pop
Show the wannabees what you got
Keep it moving, dixie, that's hot
In case you forgot, this is the spot where you
Slide, slide, shake it, shake it
Move that body, girl, I can't take it
Beautiful, so devastating
Guys on the side, lined, just waiting
To see if they got a chance, if they can have the next dance
"You heard what the lady said. Maybe next time, buddy
It's time to go, c'mon"

Dixie Dime, I been all around the world
I ain't never met a girl like you
Drop-dead gorgeous from head to toe
And move to the music like you
Workin', twerkin' hard like you do
Certainly, they lookin' at you
A Dixie Dime is sure to shine through
Even in a dark room when you start to move
To the side, and shake it
And their girlfriends start to hate it
And they don't know what to do so they fall in line
Start following you
And all the Dixie Dimes in your crew
Only a few things left to do
Get you some cutoff pant boots, to learn a new rhyme
Dancing begins in 3...2...
