Alright kids, cover your ears

Bitch, please (Hah)
Bitch, please (Yeah)
Bitch, please
From the bottom, got 'em jumpin' and we ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please

Zero ethanol, you know I'm topping off the tank
No popcorn in my Polaris, we liftin off to space
Crash landed on a planet with a mud-colored surface
And if you ain't never seen it then it might make you nervous
The light bars through the forest rolling rovers on Mars
And as far as the eye can see there ain't no regular cars
Bunch of mud covered Martians marching into the light
Close encounter got 'em dancing with the stars tonight

Bitch, please, at ease let me spread my wings
My people all in this bitch we 'bout to cause a scene
Bitch, please believe I'm swinging out the trees
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and
We ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and we ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please

I got em chanting to these anthems, move your body, throw ya hands up
If you gotta work tomorrow, you might wanna change ya plans up
More watts through the crowd, loud shaking the ground
Without a doubt gettin' down just look at me now
These other rappers throwin' tantrums 'cause their girlie thinks I'm handsome
And I won't share the recipe, I'm holding it for ransom
Shots, shots, shots, damn, son, my aim's on lock
Swoopin' in clear out the hen house and leave 'em in shock

Bitch, please, at ease let me spread my wings
My people all in this bitch we 'bout to cause a scene
Bitch, please believe I'm swinging out the trees
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and
We ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and we ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please

All night, we ain't stoppin', Houston looks like we got problems
Overshot the curfew on re-entry, we just kept it poppin'
Pumpin' out more decibels than the law allows
Violatin' the sound ordinance, it's making me proud
I got to give em what they came for 'long as I'm living and able
I'm a Jedi with the mind tricks I hit 'em from every angle
Bring the heat full-circle, three hundred and sixty degrees
Droppin' bombs down in Georgia that's shaking 'em overseas
Bitch, please, at ease let me spread my wings
My people all in this bitch we 'bout to cause a scene
Bitch, please believe I'm swinging out the trees
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and
We ain't 'bout to leave
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
Bitch, please
From the bottom got 'em jumpin' and we ain't 'bout to leave
