Man have you ever heard a gripped up three quarter ton goin' a hundred?

You ain't gotta be that close to hear me comin'
I'm roarin' down the highway speakers thumpin' to somethin'
It costs a pretty penny to raise up and ride
'Cause they don't come from the factory this high
I got a whole mess of rednecks, real unsteady
Willin' to get down in the dirt, bloody and sweaty
Ain't lookin' for no trouble but we sittin' already
I ain't sayin' you should come but if you do come heavy
Firearms locked, loaded, brass knuckles
Rifles, machetes, boots, and belt buckles
Two boxes on the back both full of lead
Ammo, camo from toe to head
Flashin' lights in the rear view, here they come
I ain't tryna go to jail, fellows we gotta run
When I drop the sledge hammer it sounds so good
I got a whole stable sittin' under the hood
It go

Rahhh
And my pipes go rahhh
My Super Duty go rahhh
Make some noise go rahhh, rahhh, rahhh
County boys go rahhh
My mid grips go rahhh
My thunder header go rahhh
Make some noise go rahhh, rahhh, rahhh, rahhh, rahhh

Well I'm screamin' with the Demon
Jonesin' for nothin'
Wanted to get high, hell I'm high ' cause the truck is
Tail pipes blowin' smoke no chokin'
Never stuck, not a mudhole I won't go in
Speakers bangin' like your chrome four four is
No it ain't a Ford but Lord you better focus
Them tires proper, sit like a helicopter
Redneck rapper if you allergic call a doctor
But there ain't no intravenous drug that can stop ya
Enviousness so your best bet's to quit cold turkey
Search and find your internal soul purpose
To be on this earth like I did
Now I ride, never on the highways doin' 90
On gravel and travelin' and doin' it my way
Saddlin' up the steel horse I feel it in my veins
Me and the rider the same, we goin' insane
We goin'

Rahhh
And my pipes go rahhh
My Super Duty go rahhh
Make some noise go rahhh, rahhh, rahhh
County boys go rahhh
My mid grips go rahhh
My thunder header go rahhh
Make some noise go rahhh, rahhh, rahhh, rahhh, rahhh
Yeah you can hear me comin' bu-bu-bu-bu-bumpin'
Twelves like shot gun shells pu-pu-pu-pu-pumpin'
Hell since twelve I been thu-thu-thu-thu-thumpin'
Rebellious hell, yeah you ain't tellin' me nothin'
But something's tellin' me minus amphetamines and felonies
We still gon' rock 'til we drop
'Cause Charley Farley be out in the country scene
Scenic routes trucks mud shinin' off
It's got to be noisy, fast, and real loud
To make a Jones County boy from the muddy south proud
Disturbin' the peace, citations is a must
So rev your motor and crank your system up 'til it bust
Here come that crew on two and four wheels
Makin' the ground shake just like an earthquake feels
Leavin' black marks on the road everywhere we go
Everybody knows when we comin' 'cause we make it go

Rahhh
And my pipes go rahhh
My Super Duty go rahhh
Make some noise go rahhh, rahhh, rahhh
County boys go rahhh
My mid grips go rahhh
My thunder header go rahhh
