I got a long driveway that ain't never been paved and it's hidden in some tall pine trees (Pine trees)
I got a old healer dog that knows how to bark and he ain't never seen no leash (No leash)
Gr-grown by the land you can tell by my hands and the blood runnin' through these creeks (These creeks)
Yeah, I'm rooted in the earth in the middle Georgia dirt in a place where I won't be seen hidden in the leaves

I got a 50 round drum loaded up kinda scary
Unfold my AR9 flip the settin' to binary
I'm spittin' double double time Trijicon shines bright
The red dot never lies when it says goodnight
You better think before you move 'cause my yard ain't the spot
To show up with somethin' to prove, trespass and get shot
Papa bear don't take chances when it comes to the cubs
If we talkin' kinfolks it ain't nothin' but love
You won't even see them county boys crawlin' up out the leaves
Quietly like the breeze, blendin' in with the trees so please
Don't take this personally, just watch your step
This is a warnin', not a threat

Big brothers ashes flow through the creek (Uh huh)
I was climbin' on them rocks before I could speak
Lookin' up at the field in peace watchin' the stars
No pollution from city lights and cars
So quiet and still you could feel the world move
Through the Milky Way like a whirlpool
Beautiful every day of the year
I never asked to come but glad I was born here (Born here)
It ain't hard to see
Over a lifetime this place became a part of me, yeah
I'm deeply rooted in the dirt
And grateful to have a place and purpose on this earth

A lifelong Jones County representative
Like a grown man ain't trying to get it quick
Don't get excited online I play the long game
Like a brick at a time and build my own name
Like papa Rick said your reputation is profit
Stand it on a strong foundation and they can't knock it
So never change, no matter how far
You are from where you came from remember what you are
I got a long driveway that ain't never been paved and it's hidden in some tall pine trees (Pine trees)
