Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird) Demun Jones!

Yea, yeah, yeah

She got single wide waist, double wide bottom
She ridin' shotgun, got a shotgun on 'er
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
She own the whole place with her farm girl walk
You can tell she ride horseback when she shake it off
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)

How does her body repeat everything in the beat
She playing instruments with her head, hips and her feet
She use her lips to mumble lyrics to the rap song
Nod her head like she listenin' but she ain't heard a word
Locked on to the music with the leisure life focus
Make your whole team lose it cast spells hocus pocus
Naw, she ain't a witch but she wicked, wicked
With it the way that she lit it, don't stop and get it 'til it's got
You might also like
So hot, she's so hot
You see the smoke coming off her when the bass line drop
I said oh God, oh my God
We're all standin' at attention when she ooh-la-la's

She got single wide waist, double wide bottom
She ridin' shotgun, got a shotgun on 'er
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
She own the whole place with her farm girl walk
You can tell she ride horseback when she shake it off
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)

Now everybody sees she's 400 degrees
She's movin' in slow motion but the song is upbeat, uh
Fergalicious, so delicious
Every part of her body looks like desert, I'm 'bout to do the dishes
Please, Mr. Genie grant me these three wishes
And give me that right there, hold up something's missing
How 'bout some bird shot shells and boat to go fishing
Or a ski nautique with a boomin' system
So hot, she's so hot
You see the smoke comin' off her when the bass line drop
I said oh God, oh my God
We're all standin' at attention when she ooh-la-la's

She got single wide waist, double wide bottom
She riding shotgun, got a shotgun on 'er
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
She own the whole place with her farm girl walk
You can tell she ride horseback when she shake it off

Don't be ashamed girl, get what you came for
And do them dances that nobody got a name for
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Shoot a bird (Shoot a bird)
Don't be ashamed girl, get what you came for
