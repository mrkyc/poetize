Is any rednecks in the house, uh

Big bull teeth, Angus meat, pine tar in my veins
Rattlesnake blood, some Georgia mud
And a whole tank of pure octane
Camo pigment, V12 engine, a full grown American mutt
You can test my DNA but that's what I'm made of

I'm a six pack, a get back at 12, a raise hell
A case if you don't get the hell out my face
I'm a bag full of money and a gun full of bullets
I ride for Tolton County boy and I ain't afraid to pull it
I'm a old truck dented up with rust on the grill
The engine runs strong, I love to spin wheels
My home made distillery deep in the woods
My flavor burns so strong but it still tastes good
I'm sunrise to sunset with calloused hands
Lay it down, wake up, and I do it all again
I'm a ring-on-the-left-hand father of two
'Til the death do us part if I said I do
And I do

Big bull teeth, Angus meat, pine tar in my veins
Rattlesnake blood, some Georgia mud
And a whole tank of pure octane
Camo pigment, V12 engine, a full grown American mutt
You can test my DNA but that's what I'm made of

And I'm the deepest mud hole that y'all scared to drive through
That 20-point bug that you just can't shoot
Confederate belt buckle, snakeskin boots
A bible belt preacher just speakin' the truth
I'm a fresh corn star poppin' up in the drought
I'm that old log chain pullin' your truck out
I'm that Drop D riff with that thunder sound
I'm a lightning bolt comin' out of a black cloud
I'm that barbed wire fence rippin' holes in your clothes
I'm George Jones on the mower, headed for more
I'm electric and can turn out the lights
I'm them bloody knuckles right after that fight

Big bull teeth, Angus meat, pine tar in my veins
Rattlesnake blood, some Georgia mud
And a whole tank of pure octane
Camo pigment, V12 engine, a full grown American mutt
You can test my DNA but that's what I'm made of

And I'm a 12-gauge over under loaded with buck shot
The eye on the stove when it's still red hot
The rush of adrenaline when you get on stage
I'm the truth in that book when you turn that page
I'm the damn in the damn right, hell in the hell yeah
Brave over enemy lines and ain't scared
The stars and the stripes and the wind when it flies
21 gun salute when that soldier dies
Whew
Big bull teeth, Angus meat, pine tar in my veins
Rattlesnake blood, some Georgia mud
And a whole tank of pure octane
Camo pigment, V12 engine, a full grown American mutt
