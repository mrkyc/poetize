This one's for the house (Yeah), blasting out of your speaker
Brought y'all a new anthem and I'ma hold it down for my people
My people roll the soul
Crank it up and get loud enough that they hearing us from a mile
Y'all are my people (Uh)

I got tires to rotate and steel to weld
Back the truck up, drill the well
Don't sweat the bills when in God we trust
Can't even feel when my knuckles bust
'Cause I'm on the grind, locked in
Four low hub, C-Ten
All I can see is these mouths to feed
You ain't helping, please miss me then
No stall or stop until we top the wall
Raised to walk when I'ma lay 'em off
I'm candy cane, we build and paint
And when you turn the key, you gotta pay me, dawg
And it's to the next, help me so
Pack the gear up, rock and roll
Sure 'nough, the crew shows up
The foundation's laid and it goes up

This one's for the house (Yeah), blasting out of your speaker
Brought y'all a new anthem and I'ma hold it down for my people
My people roll the soul
Crank it up and get loud enough that they hearing us from a mile
Y'all are my people (Uh)

Calloused hands, badge of honor, I wear with my blue collar
Blood spilt, sweat, tears shed, work overtime for that blue dollar
Cold, windstorm, rain, thunder, hot sun, and heat index a hundred Elbow grease and no sun screen
Just backaches and that caffeine to keep going
And we go 'cause that's the way that we know
Taking pride in every nail we drive, every board, every nut and bolt
My people, my people didn't learn a lot in school
But the job site was our classroom, a belt bag, and a box of tools (Yeah)

This one's for the house (Yeah), blasting out of your speaker
Brought y'all a new anthem and I'ma hold it down for my people
My people roll the soul
Crank it up and get loud enough that they hearing us from a mile
Y'all are my people (Uh)
This one's for the house (Yeah), blasting out of your speaker

This one's for all the mechanics, the carpenters, the brick layers and the farmers
The plumbers, the roofers, the truck drivers, and the movers
The heavy equipment operators, the folks sweeping the parking lot, cutting the grass, the teachers, police, and the military
The cashiers and the bartenders
And everybody else that's busting their ass to make a living
