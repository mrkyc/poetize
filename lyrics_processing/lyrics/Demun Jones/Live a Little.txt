Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Yeah, my truck is covered in rust but it gets me where I need to go (Gets me where I need to go)
And my pops, yeah, he's still working but he's moving kinda slow (But he's moving kinda slow)
The day will come, my kids will be grown, ain't playing in the yard no more
Instead of chasing time, I'll go and let it all go

Oh my, how time it flies and all I know is grind
Dear God, if you hear me, give me a sign
'Cause I'm not really tryna waste another minute chasing a dime
Can't afford to spend attention on the lies
I'm staring at the hourglass as the sand keeps slipping
My kids are growing so fast man, I'm tripping
They went straight from from sippy cup sippin' to sending emails
Collecting barbie dolls and seashells to asking me details (Hell)
I tell the truth, don't know what else to say
I keep praying for balance but there's no time in the day
I been at work half of the life and part of me thinks it's wrong
Only wanted to keep 'em safe and make my family strong, come on

And my pops, yeah, he's still working but he's moving kinda slow (But he's moving kinda slow)

Instead of chasing time, I'll go and let it all go

It's crazy how the time ticks as the present melts into the future 'til it's something else
I see myself in the mirror, I can hear it loud
Voices in my head saying that I should be proud of all I've accomplished
And honestly, I haven't stopped much to enjoy what I got
I'm so busy stacking on top to up it a notch
That I forgot to check the time on the clock
I turned around, another year just popped and it don't stop
I've learned that time is valuable down to the minute
Even more precious than gold if you know how to spend it
Day by day as I get older, I'm approaching the finish
I need to know my family knows why I did it

Yeah, my truck is covered in rust but it gets me where I need to go (Gets me where I need to go)
And my pops, yeah, he's still working but he's moving kinda slow (But he's moving kinda slow)
The day will come, my kids will be grown, ain't playing in the yard no more
Instead of chasing time, I'll go and let it all go

This life is short and sometimes it fees like a rollercoaster
Just sit back, enjoy the ride
Stay blessed and do your best
Dollar bills keep them lights on
