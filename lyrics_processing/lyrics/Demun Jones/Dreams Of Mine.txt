Another tour lies ahead, 30 days on the road
And even though you're gettin' older it's never easy to go
So I'ma take a lot of pictures and video from the stage
And I promise to bring home every dollar that I make
'Cause if y'all don't have it all I've only wasted my time
And I can't sing a single line without you on my mind
Every day a different stage, in the lights I see your face
And I wanna tuck you in but daddy's too far away

I will  out in the county where that southern sun shines
But I travel coast to coast chasin' these old dreams of mine
And I sure do miss my family but I know it's time to go
Load up the bus, hit the road, and rock another show

Make sure you give you mama plenty of hugs and kisses
Feed the puppies and the kitties and help her clean up the kitchen
Facetime me everyday, fill me in on what I'm missin'
And try not to get upset daddy's gotta make a livin'
I'll get home soon as possible, cross my heart
But it's never soon enough until I put it in park
Get to walk through that door and hold y'all real close
I know I'm right where I belong 'cause I love you the most
And there ain't nothin' I enjoy more than the time I get to spend
Now the phone's blowin' up and I gotta go again
I understand if you're mad, I don't want you to hurt
Just know that daddy's never leavin' he's just goin' to work

I will  out in the county where that southern sun shines
But I travel coast to coast chasin' these old dreams of mine
And I sure do miss my family but I know it's time to go
Load up the bus, hit the road, and rock another show

Watchin' time fly by
Watchin' time fly by
Watchin' time fly by and bring me home
Watchin' time fly by
Watchin' time fly by
Watchin' time fly by and bring me home

I will  out in the county where that southern sun shines
But I travel coast to coast chasin' these old dreams of mine
And I sure do miss my family but I know it's time to go
