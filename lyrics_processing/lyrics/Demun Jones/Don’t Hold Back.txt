Stacked up like some firewood, my Lord
Burnin' like 200 proof, my word
Spinnin' on that bar stool, damn girl
You should be up here instead I'll be showin' the whole world
How you movin', how you movin'
Show 'em the way you do it, how you do it
Uh-uh, I bet you could have a blind man droolin'
So I'ma move aside and give you a chance to prove it
You might also like
How you move it that girl she move it sideways
Like she been doin' them squats straight for nine days
Up and down, up and down, nothin' but respect
She's movin' it fast just like she's signin' the check

Then don't hold back

Now we ain't got long, last call, last song
Guzzle up your drinks they turnin' the lights on
Load it up, move it out we takin' it to the house
A dozen in the long bed, 22 south
The pool got a heater in the middle of the field
300 acres can't nobody hear
They done drained the hot tub and filled it up with beer
Didn't I see you earlier girl? Come over show me
How you move it that girl she move it sideways
Like she been doin' them squats straight for nine days
Up and down, up and down, nothin' but respect
She's movin' it fast just like she's signin' the check

Are you feelin' what I'm feelin'?
Then don't hold back

Come on, come on, come on you're rollin' out with me
Are you feelin' what I'm feelin'?
Are you seein' what I'm seein'?
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
