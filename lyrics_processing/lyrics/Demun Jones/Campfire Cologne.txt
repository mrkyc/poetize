When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne

That aroma on my clothes takes me back farther backyard
We'd build ourselves a pile and light up a bonfire
We'd have the best times and never even try
Good friends made good company we'd blast every time
We'd blaze it up and let it burn high
Dance around the flames joke on one another callin' each other names
We never took it personal we was brothers and best friends
Just livin' in the moment felt like it'd never end
We did some good smokin', a good bit of day drinkin'
Stinkin' up lies to tell and hell the river rope swingin'
I lost track of some of y'all but now you're on my mind
And this smell on my shirt makes me think about the good times

When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne
You might also like
Man that smell on my clothes brings back the good times
We were all raisin' hell, I'd sing songs and make rhymes
And no one was listenin', then it was just y'all
On highway 18 in the yard playin' ball
With no flags no tags strictly tackle
Then we'd crank a flame, crack a bottle and laugh like nothin' happened
The smell from the pine tree, needles, and cones, is like a time machine
When it was David Jones
We didn't have to be responsible and pay no bills
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout raisin' babies, negotiatin' deals
And even though I'm grateful now, I'll never forget
The way we grew through the smell of the flames, it makes me reminisce

When the sun goes down you know where I'll be
With a case of good time and some John Deere green
Kickin' sparks to the sky I'm in my zone
Every night sprayin' on that campfire cologne
A campfire cologne
And you know I'm not alone
A campfire cologne

Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
Live your life the way you want to like you'll never die
Just light it up, light it up and let it burn high
