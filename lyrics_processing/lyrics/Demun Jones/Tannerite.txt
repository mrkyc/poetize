Tannerite (Yeah)
T-T-T-T-Tannerite (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
Tannerite
Yeah, we gon' cause some damage tonight
T-T-T-T-Tannerite, yeah (Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
I got plenty of bullets, I brought every gun I own

Shootin' big bucks from muddy trucks way back in the sticks
Head-to-toe Mossy Oak, runnin' with a pack of hicks
S-Silver-r-rado, six inches, lift kit
One million lumen in my spotlight to get lit
Anything fall in my sights damn sure about to get hit
By my Remington ultra mag and my Colt 30.06
Bolt action Springfield one-hundred seventy-fifth
I brought a full rack, so did everybody I'm with
So we sit back with a thirty-pack, buck knife and a crossbow
Not a violent guy, you crossed the line, oh Lord, y'all know
Now it's gonna get ugly, messy to say the least
I'm goin' beast mode when I explode, off the chain, unleashed

County boys on the prowl, don't give a damn tonight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)
I spent the whole day dialin' in my gun sight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)

The moonshine, I love it, city lights, I hate it
I don't got no time for it if it ain't mud related
Everything looks green in my night vision tonight
Got a back seat full of ammunition, you don't want to pick a fight
I'm just mindin' my own business in my new spot
That the Game Warden don't know about, my old one got hot
Now I hear something approachin', I'm seein' it through my goggles
A Sasquatch with a white tail, shoot to kill is my motto
So we ten foot in a deer stand full of beer cans by the food plot
In July, oh my, until they catch me, I won't stop
And I ain't tryna spot if it's a ten-pointer or not
If I got a clear shot, pop, pop

County boys on the prowl, don't give a damn tonight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)
I spent the whole day dialin' in my gun sight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)

Pack it up, back it up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)
County boys on the prowl, don't give a damn tonight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
Breathe in, exhale, squeeze the trigger (Explode)
I spent the whole day dialin' in my gun sight
Yeah, we gon' make it blow like Tannerite (Tannerite)
Pack it up, pack it up, back up, lock and load
