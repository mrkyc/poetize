(Burn County)

I feel the west wind blowing in, I've got a bonfire lit up in a field and all my friends are gathered 'round
We came back again for another weekend, but this time, we brought a bunch of people from the other side of town

Watch out
Throw a little gas on the fire and the sparks start to fly while the windmill's spinnin'
Watch out
Crank the boom sprayer high 'cause the field's bone dry, ain't rained in a minute
Watch out
Do what you're gonna do
You ain't even gotta holler if you're coming through, no
But if you're coming on the real
Then you better know the deal
Might set a cornfield on fire (Ah)
Cornfield on fire
Cornfield on fire (Ah)
Cornfield on fire

I got the four-inch lift on the truck
And I be revving' it up
I want everybody to hate
I put my money in the V8
Pipes sounding' like a freight train
Tryin' to take a dirt road
Shorties in short shorts and shirts rolled up
In a knot what I got is a cup, only thing missing is for you to fill it up with the whiskey
You got out of Grandpa's cabin
If you keep backin' it up on me, then I'm gon' grab it (Ow)
Look like it's litty in the city
The boys are sharp and the girlies are gettin' pretty
'Cause we're hookin' up tonight
When it's no more light
So start a fire if you 'bout that life, right?

You ain't even gotta holler if you're coming through, no
But if you're coming on the real
Then you better know the deal
Might set a cornfield on fire (Ah)
Cornfield on fire
Cornfield on fire (Ah)
Cornfield on fire

We don't need no water, let it burn
Country and surrounding areas about to learn
Run and tell the kids I got Krizz with to kill it and get busy, it's only a party, don't be concerned
We don't need a dance floor to make the farm shake for damn sure
So move it like that's what your body was made for (Woo)
Flames burn so high
Looks like we roasting' marshmallows, that's the clouds in the sky
If you're a pilot, don't try to fly by it
Warn all the neighbors we ain't got' keep quiet
Flexin' on 'em, keep it lit 'til the morning
Fire it up and make the whole field glow
Watch out
Throw a little gas on the fire and the sparks start to fly while the windmill's spinnin'
Watch out
Crank the boom sprayer high 'cause the field's bone dry, ain't rained in a minute
Watch out

You ain't even gotta holler if you're coming through, no
But if you're coming on the real
Then you better know the deal
Might set a cornfield on fire (Ah)
Cornfield on fire
Cornfield on fire (Ah)
