Third son of six, we ain't have no health insurance
Deck stacked against except for love and reassurance
Then Jessica was born and something it wasn't right
I used to cry myself to sleep in bed prayin' at night
She never learned to walk or talk but she could smile
In school they called me to her class to calm her down
And I was never embarrassed, never once ashamed
On the playground I'd come runnin' callin' your name
And I remember right under the tree
Where your wheel chair would sit I'd come and take a knee
And give you big brother kisses when I left
And you responded to my words, you wasn't deaf
I know your voice was sweet, that I never hear you speak
But your eyes spoke the loudest and they said you loved me
And I love you too, 'til this day I'm unsure
If any of us were ever worthy of you

Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There has to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
That you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
So save your David a spot up in the trees
Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There's got to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
I know you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
Save your bubba a spot up in the trees

Spoon feedin' Jessica was a lot on my mama
And a group of ladies had to pat on her body daily to keep her joints from lockin'
I remember her room, light blue
With a table in the middle and a mobile
No one told us what had caused it
As the condition said, Rett syndrome is what they called it
But what is that?
I overheard words mentioned like recessive genes
But I was only nine then and still don't know what it means
All I wanna know is when can we go climb in the trees
And shoot the B.B. guns, and run and jump in the leaves
Chase you outside, I'll seek if you hide
I always knew you wanted to, I heard your eyes
I was mad at God, but now I understand the lessons
It was such a gift to us just to be in your presence

Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There has to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
That you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
So save your David a spot up in the trees
Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There's got to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
I know you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
Save your bubba a spot up in the trees
Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There has to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
That you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
So save your David a spot up in the trees
Heroes come and go, but angels never leave
There has to be a purpose, I can't help but believe
That you're runnin' and you're jumpin' through the leaves
Save your bubba a spot up in the trees
