Everything's got to be chrome
Every piece of metal on your ride that's showin'
The grill to the wheels, the front back bumper
The box under the seat, the speakers that's thumpin' (Thumpin')
Everything's got to be chrome
Every little switch that turns anything on
Antennas, the handles, the plates and the pipes
If it ain't shiny at night it ain't right (That's right)

Horsepower, please, I got it
I got a need for speed, I can't hide it
You can barely see my face when I fly by
Super chip, zero to sixty in three point five
I got a stack of tickets I ain't payin' (Ain't payin')
Truck full of rednecks, we ain't playin'
When we come out the woods we gettin' clean
New camo, no mud is what I mean
Then we wax the paint, polish the chrome
Take little cuz home (Why) 'cause he ain't grown
We 'bout to cruise the town, and cause a scene
Every piece of trim is chrome and it's clean (It's clean)

Everything's got to be chrome
Every piece of metal on your ride that's showin'
The grill to the wheels, the front back bumper
The box under the seat, the speakers that's thumpin' (Thumpin')
Everything's got to be chrome

Everything is chrome plated
You lookin' for a mirror I got you pretty lady
Just look at the wheels or you can stand in the front
Chrome on the bumper so clean but don't touch
I put the high dollar polish on it in three coats
So water beads off you'd think that it was cloaked
But my chrome ain't ever gonna see a rain drop
This will assure me that the plan don't stop
It don't take but one light at night and I'm bright
They call it disco bones and they right
If you see me ridin' 'round on a clear sunny day
Wear some shades 'cause I'm comin' your way
Okay

Chrome covered engine, I got it
Step bars and everything inside it (Yeah)
If it can be dipped then it's shinin'
Street lights make it look like lightnin' strikin'
Now everybody wanna roll with Jones
No more room to ride, drive your own
The cab's full of ladies dressed up
I move my buddies to the bed (That's messed up)
They got a cooler full of bluegills sippin'
If know it's Bud Light if you dip in (They dip it)
We 'bout to cruise the town and cause a scene
Every piece of trim is chrome and it's clean (It's clean)
