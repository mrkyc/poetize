When I grow up, maybe I'll be a veterinarian
I'll take care of little animals
Like ponies and parakeets
And I'll give them food to eat
While the puppies go, "Yip, yip, yip"
And the kittens go, "Meow, meow, meow"
And, "Thank you, veterinarian!"

Maybe I'll be an astronaut and work for NASA
Maybe I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon

There's lots of things that you can be
When you grow up, just wait and see

When I grow up, maybe I'll be a farmer
Grow all kinds of food to eat
Like shiny apples, red or green, or fields of corn for dinnertime
I'll drive my tractor in the sun
While the chickens go, "Bock, bock, bock"
And the cows go, "Moo, moo, moo"
And, "Thank you, farmer!"

Maybe I'll be an astronaut and work for NASA
Maybe I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon

When I grow up, maybe I'll be a carpenter
And build a big, long house for people and their families
And I'll build it out of wood and bricks
With a porch where people can sit
And the hammers go, "Knock, knock, knock"
And the saws go, "Chop, chop, chop"
And, "Thank you, carpenter!"

There's lots of things that you can be
We are free to be you and me

When I grow up, maybe I'll be a singer in a band
And I'll drive all across the land, with my friends all in the van
And I'll sing into a microphone
But when it's over, I'll come home
While the people go, "Clap, clap, clap"
And the drummer goes "Tap, tap, tap"
And, "Thank you, singer!"
Maybe I'll be an astronaut and work for NASA
Maybe I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon
I'll see you on the moon

There's lots of things that you can be
When you grow up just wait and see
There's lots of things that we can be
