Maybe it's all directed
When I text you I feel faded
Because of you, I wanna die
Hurry, it's time to make up again
I'll do it
Where are you? On my way
I'm ready to apologize for things I didn't do
You can't sit with us, oh
I hate you
When I think of you, I'm feeling faded
You can't sit with us, oh
I hate you
Why don't you know my emotions? God damn it
Who do you think you are?
You can't sit with us!
When I think of you, I'm feelin' faded
You can't sit with us, oh
