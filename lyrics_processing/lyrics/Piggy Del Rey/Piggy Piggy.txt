I'm feelin' like a powerful pig
So come with me, let's go
Together we can take on the world
'Cause we're so beyond
Livin' like we're typical pigs
So take my hand and join me
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is mine
Piggy piggy, hi, hello
Did you call to talk to me?
Hajime konnichiwa
I hate you, and you hate me
It's time to say hello to a new day
And have a cup of tea with my very best friend
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Are you ready to get lost?
You will climb up to the lowest peaks
And climb lower underneath the clouds
I can do anything
'Cause you're so far gone
Livin' like the typical pigs
So take my hand and join me
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is mine
