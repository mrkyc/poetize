Bet I penned it
Del Rey, break me off, OHHHH, Piggy soldier
Del Rey, break me off, OHHHH, Piggy soldier
Del Rey, break me off, OHHHH, Piggy soldier
Del Rey, break me off, OHHHH, Piggy soldier
I'm out the door, its automatic
Simple hoe why you wanna do that to me
I'm like an Ice Block
Bottle bustin in your face, why you wanna do that to me
So tired of you being up in my space, what you gonna do with that
How much more can I take
I'm tired of privates drivin, need a general that ain't weak
When I shut the door leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gon wish he knew the type of fun im gettin into
Peek a boo, he good
Doin' things you wish you could
He's not talkin, hes just walkin'
Like them city boys from Pig Town
This time I need a soldier
A really badass soldier
That knows how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier
I'm sick of piggy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just comin' over
You might also likeI don't want no more, piggy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those piggy soldiers
I don't want no more, piggy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those piggy soldiers
I want it more than ever now
Realized that they ain't listenin'
Like a queen supposed to get it
That's why im lusting off my leach
Coming back looking delicious
Yes I know they wanna kiss it
Now I hold em at attention
'Cause new Del Rey's on a mission
When I shut the door leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gon wish he knew the type of fun im gettin into
Peek a boo, he good
Doin' things you wish you could
He's not talkin, hes just walkin'
Like them city boys from Piggy Town
This time I need a soldier
A really badass soldier
That knows how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier
I'm sick of piggy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just comin' over
