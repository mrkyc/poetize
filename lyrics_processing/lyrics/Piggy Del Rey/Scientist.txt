Einstein, well bitch I don't need you
Why do you keep putting your hand on mine
This isn't second grade boy
Pushing and pulling
That's not quite my style
If you're gonna give up in the middle
You'd better stay away from my heart
You think too much, that's your problem
Being stuck in your head will do no good
Quit wasting time with me, trying to find answers
Might as well start a to-do
List
Love ain't a science
Don't need no license
The more you sit there thinking, it's a minus
Don't try to be a genius
'Cause I'm never serious
Plunged a knife in my heart, oh
Let your mind lead you, so what you waiting for?
So what'd you find out
About me so far?
What's the next subject?
So what's the next class, then?
Keep doing it this way and it'll only end in failure
My mind changes every second
You'll never figure it out

'Cause I'm never serious
Plunged a knife in my heart, oh
Let your mind lead you, so what you waiting for?
You gonna get crushed by me!
I live in your head rent-free!
Theory is no good when it comes to love
It's all useless, uh-huh
Rather than Mr. Know-all Genius Einstein
More like a bulldozer Curious Frankenstein
Frankenstein the monster and not Frankenstein the genius
Because your brain is half the size of your penis
It's like you stole a missing answer sheet
Want to come and sweep me off my feet
Know all the answers but your execution isn't even neat
You think you did that, but the truth is that you didn't even fucking eat
Love ain't a science, what! what!
Need no license, what! what!
Learn more About me 'bout me
Already enough You know 'bout me
Love ain't a science, what! what!
Need no license, what! what!
I told ya Wha-wha-what you waiting for?
Love ain't a science
