That I'm feeling and loving it and imagining
There far away Looks like tiny we call it's destiny
Now count one two three, let's gather up
Yes come over
Yeah, get it on nah, get in on nah
Let's bring back to 80's
As I wish
Just how confident I am
Secrets I've been hiding
I want to tell you everything Baby
Funny how all dreams come true
It'll protect me
Even tiny love I've cherished
Funny how I fell for you
It's going to be by your side
And also my dreamy future
You got to be mine, forever and now
You make it feel me good
Do you wanna upside down?
You make it feel me good
Don't you wanna up and down?

When we are looking at the same direction
