Sing along to a shitty pop song that they play on the radio
Time for a pic, 'cause I'm all dressed up
Don't make me look too ugly
'Cause I'm ready for my close-up
I said I'm ready for my close-up
One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's ruin a video, oh-oh
One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's ruin a video, oh-oh
Action, I'm ready
Don't want to miss a frame
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're down
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I feel at home with my microphone turned up in the studio
Always know that it's time to go when we're done fucking around
Time for a pic, 'cause I'm all dressed up
Don't make me look too typical
'Cause I'm ready for my close-up
I said I'm ready for my close-up
