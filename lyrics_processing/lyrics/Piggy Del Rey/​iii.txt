You calm me down and help me meditate all my thoughts away
When the world is ending and society has come to an end
All I want is you right next to me
Small cracks are forming in my heart that used to be black
It bothers me, it annoys me
It makes me dizzy, even if I crush my head every day
You still won't know me
You make my heart burn with emotions
You destroy a perfectly good me
My friends wouldn't believe me if I told them this, it's weird right
Yeah you got me fallin' in
Fallin' in, tippin' and fallin' in love
I can't get my feelings out, iii
When I'm with you I'm just alive
When you walk past I sigh, iii
You stab and shock my heart and leave me on the floor alone
I-, i-, i- i- i-, i-, (I need you need you)
I-, i-, i- i- i-, i-, (I need you)
I blush endlessly as I turn my head away
You're embarrassing, in a funny kinda way that makes me want to exclaim
I run out of energy
I just cannot hide, hide yeah
I just cannot control, oh yeah

What you're doing is you're shaking me up
You make my heart burn with emotions
You destroy a perfectly good me
My friends wouldn't believe me if I told them this, it's weird right
Yeah you got me fallin' in
Fallin' in, tippin' and fallin' in love
I can't get my feelings out, iii
When I'm with you I'm just alive
When you walk past I sigh, iii
You stab and shock my heart and leave me on the floor alone
My emotions for you change like the weather
I hate you, I love you
Even it feels like I'm in the hell, keep me blind
Yeah let me dive into your heart
I can't get my feelings out, iii
When I'm with you I'm just alive
When you walk past I sigh, iii
You stab and shock my heart and leave me on the floor alone
I-, i-, i- i- i-, i-, (I need you need you)
I-, i-, i- i- i-, i-, (I need you)
I-, i-, i- i- i-, i-, (I need you need you)
