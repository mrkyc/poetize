I'm lying in my bed, laughing at my old songs
I love you forever and always
That's how I wanted it to be
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
I hate you
That's how we ended
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I'm always wishing that I was dead
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on
I hope that you're up in heaven
That's why I'm ready to die
You might also likeAnd there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I keep on, keep on, wishing that I was dead
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Ha, Ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Ha, Ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
Tons of comparisons to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
