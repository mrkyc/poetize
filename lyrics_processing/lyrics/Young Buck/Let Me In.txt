Yeah
It's 50 Cent
Young Buck
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!

We get the club jumping from beginning to the end, go shorty
We back up in this bitch again, we party
Harder than you can imagine, you can run wit losers
Or run wit winners and win, ahhhhh!

I feel the tension when I walk in the club (What!)
G-Unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug (Come on!)
Gimme a Henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this for 4 Nickel enough
I came to ball wit y'all, buy up the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, and niggas call ya dogs (I'm here)
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might never come home again nigga, aight?!
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my life's like
Riding in Cashville and running all stop lights (For real!)
Homie is that real, I pray I keep living
My momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison (Damn!)
My daddy's a dope fiend, and I don't really miss him (Fuck him!)
Ain't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still living (Come on)
The same ol two step, we move to a rhythm
50 holla get 'em Buck, you know I'm gonna get 'em, raaah

I know you gon' let me shine and get mine

I know I'm sinning but I'm winning at the same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin' to take mine
I'm back on the block, wit a chopper and a Tech nine
Niggas shooting cops in the hood running stop signs
G-UNIT, The Gang! Bitches doing what the thugs do
GDs, Vice Lords, Crips and the Bloods too
Move let me come through
Ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm riding in the old school listening to some oldies
My gold keep shinin', them hoes keep crying
The handle of my .45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Cashville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin' Yayo watchin' Eminem perform at the Grammys
The reason niggas like Eric Benet, probably can't stand me
Cause I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties, bitch!
Y'all niggas in trouble they should of never let me in-in
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D

Bet ya I can make 'em bounce back
Teach 'em how to stunt, teach em' how to counts stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at, Buck If you want to
We fifty deep up in here what you gon' do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name calling
Don't be mad cause we is and you ain't balling
Getting money is my motto for you broke folks
Can't spend ya whole life paying on a car note
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'mma cold young thug, not a hot boy,
You know I do this for the streets, and my peeps thats behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go and buy them all cars, Young Buck!

I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D
We get the club jumping from beginning to the end, go shorty
We back up in this bitch again, we party
Harder than you can imagine, you can run wit losers
