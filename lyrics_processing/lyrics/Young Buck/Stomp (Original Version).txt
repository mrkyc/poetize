Uh ohhhhh, Young Buck
Dirty South, yeahhh

I hear him talkin', but he 'bout to get that ass stomp
Watch, I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp
We ain't playin' wanna front, you can get that ass stomp
Do it like them dirty South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off

I'm Caddillac'n through the hood, sittin' on 24's
T.V's playin, rim's spinnin', blowin' plenty dro
Don't have to mention, when you pimpin', you get plenty hoes
It's all on you, if you gon' trick, or you gon' get yo' dough
I know I got these haters mad, I can love that
When you got love for the streets, they give ya' love back
Look in my eyes, you can tell I ain't never scared
Poppin' them thangs, I'm rockin' my chain anywhere
If you gon' represent your hood, what you waitin' on?
Security better back up, when they play this song
And we 'bout fifty strong, please don't make us do you wrong
My clique of guerrillas, they got they G-Unit's on
All of that mean muggin' really don't mean nuthing
C'mon take it outside, lemme see sumthin
Wha-wha-wha-what now?
Don't get bu-bu-bu-buck'd down
Stop all this hatin' or this club gon' get shu-shut down
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off

Aye, a 100 karats on the chest, I'm so true to this
Task force got my vest, I got a new bitch
Fans hate and talk shit, but I'm too legit
A million dollars at a time, 'till I'm super rich
Pimp Squad, G-Unit, fuck who you get
Ask your nieces and nephews, I'm the shit
Real niggas see the difference between you and this
Me gettin' beat down?, that's ludicrous
My name rang from the streets, and slang in Mechanicsville
Nigga are you gettin' it Rodney Dangerfield?
No respect, I'ma vet, you can bet that
I caught some cases, but it's just a minor set back
And if I have to do some time, I'll be right back
With some thighs, and some tri's and a six pack
We hit the door, watch all the pussy nigga get back
They know we can do it like the road, but you ain't with that
You know who make that track bump, like to keep it crunk
It's chopper's hit ya ass, you'll with ya got your ass stomp'd
I hear him talkin', but he 'bout to get that ass stomp
Watch, I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp
We ain't playin' wanna front, you can get that ass stomp
Do it like them dirty South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off

Muthafucka, I'm a monster in this game, similar to the loch ness
My rhymes is nappy rooted, sum verses gotta process
The truth in this booth, ain't no doubt when I'm rappin'
If I say it, I've either done it, or it's 'bout to happen
When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26's, people dumb out
If life's a crap game, I'm rollin' 7's on the come out
These rapper's think I'm ig-nant, love sayin' my name
Cause maintaining my fish tank, and they house, cost the same
Ask me, I'd say I made it, and it sure wasn't luck
Cause hustler's relate to me, and some are younger than Buck
You see I'm married to my music, but we got a prenup
So if that bitch don't act right, I'm still gettin' my cut
My deals never get screwed, my contracts practice abstinence
I'm masterin this program, hazin' these undergraduates
So pimpin' Be Easy, quit catchin' feelings
Cause you worth a couple hundred grand, and I'm worth millions,
Nobody's thinkin' about you, plus your beef ain't legit
So please stay off the T.I.P. of my di-ahhhhhh
I hear him talkin', but he 'bout to get that ass stomp
Watch, I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp
We ain't playin' wanna front, you can get that ass stomp
Do it like them dirty South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off
