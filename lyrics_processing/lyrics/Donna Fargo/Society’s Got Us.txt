We've been living way too high
We got champagne taste and a beer pocketbook
And it's all we can do to get by
I keep sayin' I'll never bring it up again
But I just can't keep still
Who ever heard of people poor as us
Drive a Cadillac Coupe DeVille
We wear fancy clothes
That we can't anyway afford than anything else we do
There outta be a law against living this way
When we need little things like food
And I'm gonna have to spend my birthday money
To pay the telephone bill
That's what I get for feeling the kind of hopes
I can't afford to fill
'Cause society's got us by the you-know-what
We've been living way too high
We got champagne taste and a beer pocketbook
And it's all we can do to get by
And we can't afford this kind of rent
But I know you wouldn't move
And who am I kidding
I wouldn't either
You might also likeThis is what you call in a groove
Oh, it's our little way of feeling big
When you can't be big for real
And we do deserve these material things
We just can't pay the bills
We're afflicted with a love and high class dreams
And we can't afford to dream
But knowing all that and doin' something 'bout it
Are two different things
'Cause society's got us by the you-know-what
We've been living way too high
We got champagne taste and a beer pocketbook
And it's all we can do to get by
Yes, society's got us by the you-know-what
We've been living way too high
We got champagne taste and a beer pocketbook
And it's all we can do to get by
Yes, society's got us by the you-know-what
We've been livin' way too high
We got champagne taste and a beer pocketbook
