That discarded the reflection
Of the women she had pictured in her mind
And the make-up almost hid the traces
Of the wear and tear of life on her face
That you could read between the lines
About the unfulfilled dream
That she spoke to me about friendly
As if I were the only friend she had
And as I listened to her quietly talk about her life to me
Not knowing what to say I felt bad
She sang a song with no music and words with no melody
Of all the bitter seasons of life
She was an unloved daughter
An unhappy mother
But was left off an unwanted wife
Between the pills and the red wine
Her metallic conversation left her somewhere
Between now and then
When the cycle of unhappiness was born in her
And reborn like the love that died again and again
Said she hadn't wanted much
Just someone to love and love her
Married too young
And no too much very well

She didn't mean to
Didn't know how to rise and love 'em
'Cause she never had
Never been raised to love much herself
She sang a song with no music and words with no melody
Of all the bitter seasons of life
She was an unloved daughter
An unhappy mother
But was left off an unwanted wife
And Lord, I felt sorry
And I wished I could help her
But she said, she couldn't even help herself
She'd been too long waiting for the circle to be broken
It would just have to break with someone else
Said I have to leave for Boston on an early morning flight
I guess I'd better get myself to bed
I knew I wouldn't sleep away
But I left her sipping on that drink
She reminded me so much of someone else
Who sang a song with no music and words with no melody
Of all the bitter seasons of life
She was an unloved daughter
An unhappy mother
