If your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
There's a little light
In all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
How can you ask for truth
When you do not truthful live
How can you ask forgiveness
When you don't forgive
I don't mean to bring you down
Or speak to you unkind
But you can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
There's a little light
In all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
How can you ask a child
To be honest and true
When he can only judge what's right
By what he sees in you
How can you offer vision
Yet walk around blind
No, you can't see a beacon
If it's light don't shine
You can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
There's a little light
In all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon
If your light don't shine
May God's love surround you
May you find a brighter day
May He grant you the peace
You seek in every way
God's light burns
In each life, yours and mine
And you can be a beacon
If you just let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
There's a little light in
All of us by God's design
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
There's a little light in
All of us by God's design
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
There's a little light in
All of us by God's design
You can be a beacon
If you let it shine
