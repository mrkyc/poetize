Fast on the speed
Kind of lean and lazy
Not much meat on his bones
And a whole lot of lone
And more than a little bit crazy
His old six string was all he had
To keep his belly still
And for each full hour lesson he gave
He got a crisp ten dollar bill
And I'd been married for seven long years
To a concrete castle king
I decided to learn to play the guitar
Just to hear my children sing
So he'd show up about once a week
In his faded tight legged jeans
With a backlog full of hobo stories
And a lap of dated dreams
I said I want to learn a love song
Full of happy things
I said I want to learn a love song, boy
Don't you let me hear you sing?
You might also likeI want to learn a love song
I want to hear you play
I said I want to learn a love song, boy
Before you go away
So he tried to teach me a few easy chords
And a simple melody
But most of the time
I'd rather listen to him
Just play and sing to me
Then he came one night and the house was door
I met him on the door
And we sat on the couch
And we sang and talked
Till ew could not sing no more
I said I want to learn a love song, boy
Full of happy things
I said I want to learn a love song
Won't you let me hear you sing?
I want to learn a love song
I want to hear you play
I'd say I want to learn a love song
Before you go away
I guess you know what happened
Lord, he's been good to me
Sometimes I feel like
I'm working in a Hollywood movie
Or living out a good bad dream
I said I want to learn a love song, boy
Full of happy things
I said I want to learn a love song
Won't you let me hear you sing?
I want to learn a love song
I want to hear you play
I'd say I want to learn a love song
