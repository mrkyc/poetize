This is Ms. Doodles
I thought I'd call you up to say hello
And tell you that I miss you
And I wish that I were with you
But I guess I'm telling you something you already know
Well, how is California?
It's raining here in Nashville
Did you tell your ol' Mom and Dad I said hello
Yes, I've already double-locked the door
And I'm being careful
I just wished you'd hurry up and come on home
'Cause I don't know if I can get myself asleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like life's not touching me
And I'm just passing through
And now I realize how much you are me and I am you
Oh, nothing's really wrong
I just been working on that song so long
I don't know if I'll ever get it right
I drove out to the farm
And the roof is almost on the barn
And I just sat and watched the cows a little while
You might also likeAnd wondered if a farmer and a city dude
Could make it there with me and you
Make that place feel like home
And be glad with it someday
I know we've gotta settle down
And quit our love this running 'round
And if that were you want to live with me
Then I guess it's ok
I'm just having a little trouble going to sleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like lives not touching me
And I'm just passing through
And now I realize how much you are me and I am you
Well it's bedtime, Mr. Doodles
I love you, Mr. Doodles
I guess I better say goodnight
Though I've had a busy day
Yes, I already double-locked the door
And I'm being careful
This old house and I just wishing
But I guess we'll be ok
Will you come home
And I can get myself to sleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like life's not touching me
And I'm just passing through
