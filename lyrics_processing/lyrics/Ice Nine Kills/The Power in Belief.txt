We've crawled a thousand thankless miles
We've paid a million fucking dues
Yet your feeble words can't break us down
It's just kerosene on the fuse
Because this is our bar to raise
Fuck all the "Pay for praise"
We proved you wrong, we're far from through
We'll change this game in spite of you

The only thing we need to scale these walls is to believe

So, we'll let 'em say that we're dead and too far gone
Nothing can stop us now from what we will become
'Cause there's a power in belief
This is the power of belief

So exploit every damn accent
'Til that bullshit trend wears thin
We know our army's will won't ever fade
With an "IX" carved in their skin
Because they know we'd never take for granted anything
They proved you wrong, we're far from through
We'll change this game in spite of you

In spite of you
We're far from through

The only thing we need to scale these walls is to believe

So, we'll let 'em say that we're dead and too far gone
Nothing can stop us now from what we will become
'Cause there's a power in belief
This is the power of belief

We've proved you wrong, we're far from through
We'll change this game in spite of you
We've proved you wrong, we're far from through
We'll change this game in spite of you

We'll tear off the leeches once sickened by our taste
The sweetness of our infancy they thought was bitterness in haste
They'll come out of the woodwork, crawl in from under the doors
Only to find they've been left behind 'cause we don't live there anymore
They'll come out of the woodwork, crawl in from under the doors
Only to find they've been left behind 'cause we don't live there anymore

Let 'em say that we're dead and too far gone
Can't stop us now from what we will become
There's a power in belief
Let 'em say that we're dead and too far gone
Can't stop us now from what we will become
