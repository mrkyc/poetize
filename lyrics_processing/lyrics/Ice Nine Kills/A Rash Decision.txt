It's underneath our skin, no medicine can stop the bleeding
Far from all we know, we're caught without a prayer
It's underneath our flesh, and it won't rest 'til we stop breathing
Far from all we know, there's a fever in the air
This is a fever, now!
This is, this is a fever!

We came here today to get away
But now our perfect plans are all fading quickly
I cannot deny it's do or die, infection grows imminently

Bang, bang, bang is the only shot for me
Bang, bang, bang to contain atrocity
A fever's in the air
Who will be spared?

Time stands still, contamination's calling
(Calling)
And now our skin is crawling
Is it a crime to kill if we're only sinking deeper
And love can't stop the fever?
(Can't stop the fever?)

Face to face with fate, but it's too late
And now my soulmate's soul is fading quickly

Bang, bang, bang is the only shot for me
Bang, bang, bang to contain atrocity
It's underneath our skin, no medicine can stop the bleeding
Far from all we know, we're caught without a prayer (This is a fever!)
Contagion's at our heels but is it real or am I dreaming?
Far from all we know, there's a fever in the air

Time stands still, contamination's calling
(Calling)
And now our skin is crawling
Is it a crime to kill if we're only sinking deeper
And love can't stop the fever?
(Can't stop the fever?)

The killer found the cure but cannot be forgiven
Her blood sheds as it spreads another Rash Decision

I won't be forgiven
For this Rash Decision
Soaked in sin and caught without a prayer
Still there's a fever in the air
Time stands still, contamination's calling
(Calling)
And now our skin is crawling
Is it a crime to kill if we're only sinking deeper
And love can't stop the fever?
(Can't stop the fever?)

The only peace is a place inside my mind
The only peace is the past, rewind
'Cause all was well once upon a time
The only peace is a place inside my mind
The only place where I could never leave her
And we defeat the fever
But the truth hits like a truck
All bottled up
So hard to swallow now that it spreads so quickly

Bang, bang, bang is the only shot for me
