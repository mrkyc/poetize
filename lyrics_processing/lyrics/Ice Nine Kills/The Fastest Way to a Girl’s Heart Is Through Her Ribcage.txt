There's blood here in the water as I'm slowly losing grip
'Cause your insanity, it's killing me
What's inside you is inherently sick
Now that the blood is getting darker
You drown in your true colors and just the truth remains
All you are is a masquerade

You always had a way of creeping in my life
You're always so inclined to tear apart my mind
You know your simple slight seductions spin me out of control
'Cause it's hard to see the evil when you're not wearing your clothes

Just give me one more fucking reason
'Cause homicide is in this season

There's blood here in the water as I'm slowly losing grip
'Cause your insanity, it's killing me
What's inside you is inherently sick
Now that the blood is getting darker
You drown in your true colors and just the truth remains
All you are is a masquerade

You've always had a way of pulling me inside
But did you really think you could fuck your way through life?

Just give me one more fucking reason
'Cause you'd be just as sexy bleeding
Let's start the bleeding

There's blood here in the water as I'm slowly losing grip
'Cause your insanity, it's killing me
What's inside you is inherently sick
Now that the blood is getting darker
You drown in your true colors and just the truth remains
All you are is a masquerade

Is it difficult to breathe with fate wrapped around your throat?
Well since you're sort of "hung up" at the moment, I'll write your goodbye note:

"Dear Mom and Dad
I've got no excuse
These blood-stained hands
They tied the noose"
There's blood here in the water as I'm slowly losing grip
'Cause your insanity, it's killing me
What's inside you is inherently sick
Now that the blood is getting darker
You drown in your true colors and just the truth remains
All you are is a masquerade
