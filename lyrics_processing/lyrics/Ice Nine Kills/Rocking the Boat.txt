Shark!

"Coast Guard, this is the Orca, do you read me?
Four and a half miles due east of Amity Island
This is an official distress call, over"

We all know the place
That appears so sublime
But if you dive a little deeper
You'll hit the real bottom line
The head of the town
Is out there flashing his teeth
A telltale sign about to surface
That there's a monster lurking underneath

They're thrashing around but found
They can't contain the leak
'Cause I've got a fish to fry
That's feeding on the weak
So, cast a line for every life they took
It's time to set the hook

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
Buoyed by the blood of the masses
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
You think we would have learned from the past
That the predator will soon become the prey

We all know a place
Where the calm flees at night
And safe is just a shadow
So, we swim towards the light
If this voyage of valor put us on deck for death
We'll compare scars with each other
Until our very last breath, yeah!

They're thrashing around but found
They can't contain the leak
'Cause I've got a fish to fry
That's feeding on the weak
Reel them in with every trick in the book
It's time to set the hook

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
Buoyed by the blood of the masses
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
You think we would have learned from the past
That the predator will soon become the prey
"Coast Guard, this is the Orca again
We need you out here now
The boat is under attack
It's a great white, over"
"Roger that, ETA: fifteen minutes, over"
"In fifteen minutes, we'll be fucking shark bait!"

Last chance to make amends
So try to stay afloat
With sharks like you among us
We'll need a bigger boat
Sold us down the river
So the rich could stay rich
But now you've been caught
So smile, you son of a bitch

Sinking with the burning embers
Should be any sign of doubt
That this tail will be remembered
And the tide will forever flush them out

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
Buoyed by the blood of the masses
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
You think we would have learned from the past
