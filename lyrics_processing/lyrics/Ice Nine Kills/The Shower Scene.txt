Come on in, the weather's dreadful
We always have a room to spare
Don't mind mother, she is not well
The doctors say she's not all there

She's crazy, I must confess
I'm so sick of cleaning up her mess

I hope saying goodnight
Doesn't mean saying goodbye!
Now under the pressure, we're drowning together
Going down the drain tonight
(The drain tonight!)

Come on back, I'll fix you something
Be careful not to cross the line
Cause she and I are sure of one thing
"We all go a little mad sometimes..."

She's crazy, I must confess
"Listen to mother"
It's always me cleaning up her mess...
(Up her mess!)
