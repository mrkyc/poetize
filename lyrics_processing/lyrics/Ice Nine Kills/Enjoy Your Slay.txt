"Going down, sir?"
"Indeed"
"Here you are"

Plagued by the past 
And down a badly beaten path
Lies a place, one of a kind
Cursed by a blinding light that no one can outshine

A mess of a man, his fate unknown
One drink away from a broken home
He can't give up but can't go on like this
A five-year-old longs to be free
From visions he can't help but see
And a mother who can't understand

That the writing on my walls
Will tell you how it's gonna be
Oh, can't you see that
You're just rats within my walls??
To hell with hospitality
(And we all scream:)

"Welcome to your last resort
Don't Overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind
Don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy
So, say goodbye to sanity
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much, enjoy your slay!"

Facedown in the lap of luxury
Fuck the comforts of reality
Turn the page, disengage and destroy
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm just gonna bash your fucking brains in!
Now the fun has just begun
And one by one, your wife and son
Hang in the web you've spun
As family ties come undone
Redrum!

The writing on my walls
Will tell you how it's gonna be
So follow me
Cross out the words "Do not disturb"
On the doors of depravity
(And we all scream:)
"Welcome to your last resort
Don't Overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind
Don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy
So, say goodbye to sanity
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much, enjoy your slay!"

An identical scream
From 217
Slashes to ashes, dust to dust
Hey, Danny? Come play with us

Come drain or shine
I'll hit your whole bloodline
Shall we tell old Jack what he's won?
A chopping spree around the family tree
Where you can hang once all our work is done

The writing on my walls
Will tell you how it's gonna be
Oh, can't you see
(That we all scream:)
"Welcome to your last resort
Don't Overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind
Don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy
So, say goodbye to sanity
(Say goodbye)
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much
