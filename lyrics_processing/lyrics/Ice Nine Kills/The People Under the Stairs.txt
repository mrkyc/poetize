There was a time, it seemed so long ago
The world was painted gold
Before the hope began to corrode
And all the people awoke to the cold
That they had let the evil grow
And then came the masses
Who questioned the presence of god
Can anyone hear us?
These cries, these screams, will these footsteps be our last?

So they let us die
The hate behind the smiles, it took them by surprise (Took them by surprise)
And the silence left us hanging while we lit up like the 4th of July
If ignorance is peace pretend we didn't say "never again" (Never again)
And let forever belong to the dead

The time is now
This chance could be your soul redemption
Or these tombs will bear your denial, deception, and tragedy
One that you'll help build when you let us burn
Biting off your nails won't heal the scratches on your eyes

So they let us die
The hate behind the smiles, it took them by surprise (Took them by surprise)
And the silence left us hanging while we lit up like the 4th of July
If ignorance is peace pretend we didn't say "never again" (Never again)
And let forever belong to the dead

And there is no excuse
There is no lie big enough to hide behind (Our time is now)
The blinding lights struck the people divided
What were they waiting for? (Our time is now)

So they let us die
The hate behind the smiles, it took them by surprise (Took them by surprise)
And the silence left us hanging while we lit up like the 4th of July
If ignorance is peace pretend we didn't say "never again" (Never again)
And let forever belong to the dead
