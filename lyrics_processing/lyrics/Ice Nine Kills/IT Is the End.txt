Allow me to introduce myself:
They call me the dancing clown (Hi!)
And you must be Georgie (Uh-huh)
Did you hear my circus was in town?
It seems I have your boat here (That's mine!)
The storm blew her off track
Just reach your hands down here and take it
If you really want it back
Oh, Georgie
You can trust me, sweet child
Step right this way
I'm at your service with a smile
Believe me
IT's nothing to fear
When I feast on your flesh
You'll see that we all float down... here!

Pick through the past, you'll see
I'm living history
Come one, come all
'Cause I'm starved for the kill
Prey on the pure at heart
Feed on their body parts
I've got some big fucking shoes to fill
Follow me, and I'll show you the truth
Devastation as the deadlights defuse
Follow me, and I'll show you the truth
Facedown in the fountain of youth

Just like Georgie
IT's all out of hand
So, join me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

Catch me at the big top
Buried underground
Ya know I'm not clownin' around
Even with a smile
Ear to fucking ear
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
A carnival of carnage
That much you assume
But it's more than just a costume and red balloons
IT's coming back around every 27 years
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
So let go

You know what makes me smile?
Devoured juveniles
Their innards tangled in my twisted grin
Chuckled so hard I choked
Call it an inside joke
They say that laughter's the best medicine
Follow me, and I'll show you the truth
Facedown in the fountain of youth
Just like Georgie
IT's all out of hand
So join me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

Catch me at the big top
Buried underground
Ya know I'm not clownin' around
Even with a smile

IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
A carnival of carnage
That much you assume
But it's more than just a costume and red balloons
IT's coming back around every 27 years
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
So let go

IT is the end
IT's come again
(Believe IT or not
You'll all disappear)
IT cannot be fought
We all float down here
