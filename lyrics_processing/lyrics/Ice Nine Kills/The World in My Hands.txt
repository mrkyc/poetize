Lost on my own
In search of something real
How cruel to be exposed
To everything that I can't touch but still feel

How'd I end up here?
So uncomfortable
I'm a stranger in this body
The world's an ugly place
But that's a fact that fate has brought me
I had to disappear
So it would all just go away
Now the end is drawing near
And, God, I wish she would have stayed

It cuts deep 'cause our hearts are still attached
A deadly touch spreads an itch that can't be scratched
Sometimes, I wish it would all just fade to black
I can't go back

Now I'm lost on my own
In search of something real
How cruel to be exposed
To everything that I can't touch but still feel
Lost on my own
They'll never understand
How tragic to suppose
That I almost held the world in my hands

A captive beauty queen
So untouchable
In the town that has disowned me
Nice guys finish last
And that's a fact that she has shown me

He made the cut, but she deserves a better man
I won't rust like the liars and letterman
Hedge my bets 'cause it can't hurt to pretend
Until the end

Now I'm lost on my own
In search of something real
How cruel to be exposed
To everything that I can't touch but still feel
Lost on my own
They'll never understand
How tragic to suppose
That I almost held the world in my hands

So, tell the town below
As death took hold
You watched helplessly
To hell with letting go
'Cause when it snows
It falls to you from me
It falls to you from me
Lost on my own
In search of something real
How cruel to be exposed
To everything that I can't touch but still feel
Lost on my own
(Lost on my own)
They'll never understand
(They'll never understand)
How tragic to suppose
(How tragic to suppose)
That I almost held the world in my hands

To hell with letting go
'Cause when it snows
