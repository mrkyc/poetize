No one's above the saw
Live or die?
Now the choice is yours
Live or die?

Their tightening vices unearthed
To prove what they're worth
Amidst their sins
The game begins
A frightening chance to be saved
With blood on the blade
Morality takes casualties

My blueprint to salvation
Shall breed a worthy generation
That know they are the ones to blame
And never will forget my name
You wanna play a fucking game?
All systems go

I saw through the selfish but saw no soul
They saw through skin, they saw through bone
Out on a limb to save my city
All systems go!
They're all just gears in my machine
I savor every puzzled scream
A piece of them to carry with me
All systems go!

If the choice is to kill or be killed
Let the darker blood spill
'Cause it feeds the drive to stay alive
Unnatural selection engage!
Two rats in a cage
One reborn and one to mourn

My blueprint to salvation
Shall breed a worthy generation
That know they are the ones to blame
And never will forget my name
You wanna play a fucking game?
Then let's play!
All systems go!

I saw through the selfish but saw no soul
They saw through skin, they saw through bone
Out on a limb to save my city
All systems go!
They're all just gears in my machine
I savor every puzzled scream
A piece of them to carry with me
All systems go!
They said they had a purpose
But they're losing their composure
They said that they were grateful
But the jig is up...
Game over!

Will you find integrity
When there's nothing left of me?
All systems go!

I saw through the selfish but saw no soul
They saw through skin, they saw through bone
Out on a limb to save my city
All systems go!
They're all just gears in my machine
I savor every puzzled scream
A piece of them to carry with me
