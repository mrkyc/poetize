This is Hell

All hail your master 'cause this is Hell
All hail your master 'cause this is Hell

Is it pleasure or pain? (Pleasure or pain?)
All hope is hanging from these hooks and chains (Hooks and chains)
But doubt weighs heavy
It's a paradox, think outside the box
To find salvation in lament configuration

Demons become angels to some

All hail the priest of Hell
Master of sin
Bow to the needles and pins
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some
So drag me back to Hell
Master of sin
Where all of our troubles began
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some

Is it virtue or sin?
Don't fear the answers that lie deep within (Deep within)
And don't forget that it's a paradox
(Think outside the box)
Where mutilation is the only revelation

Demons become angels to some
Summoned to punish everyone

All hail the priest of Hell
Master of sin
Bow to the needles and pins
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some
So drag me back to Hell
Master of sin (Master of sin)
Where all of our troubles began
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some
The sadists, the sinners, the absent of heart
On his command
They'll tear your soul apart!

So say farewell
Welcome to Hell
So say farewell
Demons become angels to some

All hail the priest of Hell
Master of sin
Bow to the needles and pins
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some
So drag me back to Hell
Master of sin
Where all of our troubles began
'Cause the puzzle's in pieces again
Demons become angels to some

This is Hell!
