It's been six days since I've had my fix
And now I'm fixed on you
Despite your trembling body
I can tell you want it too
I'm every man you've ever dreamed of
All your fantasies combined
You can tell I'm the best by the blood on your dress
There's no bite as good as mine

Through the darkest of ages and blackest of plagues
I have fed off the blood of the land
Every girl that's in sight knows she's mine for the night
They're all trapped in the palm of my hand
I've crossed oceans of time, caused unspeakable crime
But I would not change a bloody thing
Hunted by all mankind but they're one step behind
"Prince of Darkness?" Fuck that, I'm the king

And I'm slipping through the cracks again
They'll never take me alive because I'm already dead
And forever in your head
So won't you come with me

And taste immortality
You're dripping from the ecstasy of one last crimson kiss
When the blood pours out like rain
Take pleasure in the pain
You're not the only girl to scream my name
But the first I can't resist
So here's one last crimson kiss

In my hungrier years I would prey on their fears
Devoid of all reason or rhyme
I've made every girl melt for the notch on my belt
But I swear that it's different this time
Don't think of this as damnation
Cause we don't need their salvation

And I'm slipping through the cracks again
They'll never take me alive because I'm already dead
And forever in your head
So won't you come with me

And taste immortality
You're dripping from the ecstasy of one last crimson kiss
When the blood pours out like rain
Take pleasure in the pain
You're not the only girl to scream my name
But the first I can't resist
So here's one last crimson kiss
And you know what, baby?
Your neck is up next
You are too late
My blood now flows through her veins
You will live through the centuries to come, as I have lived

And I'm slipping through the cracks again
They'll never take me alive because I'm already dead
And forever in your head
So won't you come with me

And taste immortality
You're dripping from the ecstasy of one last crimson kiss
When the blood pours out like rain
Take pleasure in the pain
You're not the only girl to scream my name
But the first I can't resist
So here's one last crimson kiss

One last crimson kiss
Don't think of this as damnation
