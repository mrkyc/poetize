Said she wanted love, all she wanted was a rush though
And you could fill my cup, baby, I ain't in a rush, no
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more
'Til it rains on the floor
Let it pour, pour, pour

Sipping on anything, we let our mind talk
Every words into actions take control
Next up on the scene, can't catch up with the flow
Intention growing more, just tryna let it go
But I can't just deny
Shawty loves doing everyday things, at night
She's been tripping on boys, but kissing more bottles
I like body smooth, got me pushing on throttle
Walking around with that Gucci bag
But when I'm around you love showing me that poochie back Said she went too far for sure, I ain't going back
Every time we talk, now she's finna let it throw back
She's never stopping

Girl, you're pushing on my mind now
No matter where we are at stop checking on your time now
And you got me overthinking
Sexual tension so wild, baby, can we share this feeling?

Said she wanted love, all she wanted was a rush, though
And you could fill my cup, baby, I ain't in a rush, no
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more
'Til it rains on the floor
Let it pour, pour, pour

Shawty want that red, I gotta get the blue up in my pendant
Wake up in the morning thinking about how much we spending
Shaking ass, I'm throwing boatloads I ain't stretching
Spoil her real good, next day she unrelenting
Heart stay colder, smoother vocals
I'm tryna hitting it global while they thinking local, yeah
Diamonds dancing, dripped in all black Dior and
Left with two, but I ended up with four
Baby, let it pour, keep it at a low
Always rushing, we ain't got nowhere to go
From the night 'til the morning, now she asking for more
Surrounded by bad hoes you know how it goes
