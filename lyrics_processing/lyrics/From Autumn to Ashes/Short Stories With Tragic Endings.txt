Here you stand seething with guilt
Silence only justifies this act of cowardice
The look stapled on your face cries out for forgiveness
The one thing that I cannot give

Did you ever see that one person
And the way they do these things
And it hurts you so much
It's like choking, choking, choking

I can give you freedom from your guilt
With a flick of my wrist onto yours
I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile
I can give you death with the look upon my face

This is your freedom in a life of fallacy
With no last kiss and no regrets
You don't deserve good bye
This is your freedom in a life of fallacy
With no last kiss and no good bye

Here you stand seething with guilt
Silence only justifies this act of cowardice
You might also like

With a short story, the one you add to daily
You are the tragic loss
No story book ending for this fairy tale of you
Just the one composed with blood taken from your pen
That you hold in your lifeless hand

Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end
Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end
Mourn, wish the end
Mourn, wish the end
Mourn, wish the end


Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person
And the subtle way that they do these things
And it hurts so much?
So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze
It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions
And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds
You let this one person come down for the most perfect moment
And it breaks my heart to know
The only reason you are here now
Is a reminder of what I'll never have
I'll never have, I'll never
Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in
Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in
But this table for one has become bearable

I now take comfort in this, and for this, I cherish you
Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person
And the subtle way that they do these things
And it hurts so much?
So much it's like choking down the embers of a great blaze
It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions
And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds
And you let this one person come down, come down

I cherish you, I cherish you
Just say that you would do the same for me
Just say you would do the same for me
Just say you would do the same
Just say you would do the same for me
For as much as I love autumn
