(Drink the cyanide)
This is the hand that will blind your eyes
And split your spine
This is the blade that'll visit your flesh
And release the wine
Play!
You play with toys that have triggers
And you hear the lead moves near
Play!
You play with razors and it hurts, it hurts
As you face your fears
So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye
Now drink the cyanide
The worlds collide
And you know
That it's pure filth
That I hide
You might also likeOn these plains, there's a burning ruin
That must be found
On these plains, there's a demon that sleeps
It must be unbound
Run!
You run for the borders
Where epistles burn in the arms of man
Run!
You run among bodies and they scream
They scream to bite God's hand
So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye
(Now drink the cyanide)
On these plains, there's a burning ruin

(Now drink the cyanide)
(So face the dark)
(And I'll teach you about fire)
(And the blink of an eye)
When the dark does what the dark does best
It's darkness!
Let the dark do what the dark does best
Let there be darkness!
So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye
(Now drink the cyanide)
The worlds collide
