When you hear this song, will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong, will you cry?

Love is pain and pain could be pleasure
If you would have only realized
And now it's your turn to cry
The camel's back broke tonight
It's too late to try

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong, will you cry?

Tears rolled down my cheeks
And you were never around to wipe my eyes
For years you played hide-and-seek with my love
You are just that kind of guy

'Cause you know you're wrong, will you cry?
