Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?

Loving you, somehow I feel cheated
I ask, is this the way to be treated?
You take what you want
Then you stroll out the door contented
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me

Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?

When we first met, I thought we were gonna be
The greatest love of all time
Oh, what a fantasy
I put faith in you and you shattered my dreams completely
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me
