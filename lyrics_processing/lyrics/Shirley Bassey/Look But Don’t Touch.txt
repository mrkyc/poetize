(Don't need your touch)
Hot sun rising out your collar like the mercury
Good fun watching all the ladies cooling down for free
So hot water like a fountain from the hydrant flows
Slow down she isn't yours no matter how much skin she shows

You might see her smiling at ya
Don't get over excited unless you're invited
You can't touch her

Because she's up on the screen
It's never gonna mean that she belongs to you
In the street of the office treat her like a goddess
Or you'll be hurting too
If you can't read the signs you're trying too much
Well here's the headline
Look but don't touch
(Don't need your touch)

Look hon
It isn't rocket science
Darling hear me out
It's no fun trying to keep her cool when she's looking out
Young guns think because she's wearing something short and tight
Down boy, doesn't mean she's looking for your love tonight
You might also like
Just admire her from a distance
Show a little respect
And then try to respect her resistance

Because she's up on the screen
It's never gonna mean that she belongs to you
In the street of the office treat her like a goddess
Or you'll be hurting too
If you can't read the signs you're trying too much
Well here's the headline
Look but don't touch
(Don't need your touch)

You might see her
Smiling at ya
Don't get over excited unless you're invited
You can't touch her

Because she's up on the screen
It's never gonna mean that she belongs to you
In the street of the office treat her like a goddess
Or you'll be hurting too
If you can't read the signs you're trying too much
Well here's the headline
Look but don't touch
(Don't need your touch)
(Don't need your touch)
(Don't need your touch)
