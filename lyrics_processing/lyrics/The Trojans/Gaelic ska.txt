They're scared in case the floor won't be there, when they come back down
So now they've started dancing to this wild and crazy sound
Much heavier than funk and pleasure for your leisure stick around
And share with us your company, and we'll really go to town
And each and every one of you, if you want to have some fun
Let's do the Gaelic Ska and put some trouble on the run
It's a wicked concoction of R'n'Band Irish melody
All whipped up with some Carib folk lo rock you off your feet
And each and every one of you, if you want to have some fun
Let's do the Gaelic Ska and put some trouble on the run
Come on all you gentlemen, now on the count of three
If you're enjoying yourselves, I want you all to stomp your feet
And all you pretty ladies, if you kindly bear with me
We're doing the Gaelic Ska, now come on now one, two, three...
Yee-hi, yee-ip, yee....
There's a lot of people nowadays I notice who they are
Lacking in imagination, think they're camouflaged
Inhibited, too shy, afraid to jump about and shout
In case someone should confuse them as a drunkard or a lout
Now me of wisdom through the ages since the days of old
Have said each dog will have his day, and you reap just what you sow
So don;t trust all you read in print, or hear on the radio
I've seen how fickle fashion is, and trends they'll come and go
Now most pop muzak nodays in tires too hard in vain
To rock my sol and body somentimes to ease the pain
And all this disco music seems to do numb my brain if hear another computer beat, I think I'll go insane
But here's a musical mixture that;s as ancient as the hills
Just like the mountain spring water, designed to cure your ills
So each and every one of you, if you wnat to have some fun
Let's do the Gaelic Ska, now come on let's have some fun...
