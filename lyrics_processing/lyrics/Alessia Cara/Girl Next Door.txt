Never have I ever been someone who's had it all
Like, not at all, yeah
And, on occasion, I can think too much
I get uncomfortable, hide behind my walls
And I talk in circles, but at least I say what I mean
And I rock my heart on the sleeve of my T-shirt

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, everything
And no, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget me, no
No, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget this girl next door
No, no, no, no

Never have I ever met someone who worries like I do
That's nothing new, yeah
And I don't really like to get dressed up
What's it to you? I know what I can do
And I'm not Bowie, Prince or Queen
But at least I do what I dream
And I rock my soul on both sleeves of my T-shirt

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, everything
And no, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget me, no
No, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget this girl next door

And I may not be a genius
I'm just a girl with some reasons to stay Plain Jane
But I won't go 'til you hear me
I'll be sure not to leave 'fore you know my name

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, yeah
No, you won't (You won't)
No, you won't (You won't)
Forget (Forget), forget me no
No, you won't (You won't)
No, you won't (You won't)
