I don't wanna grow old, I don't wanna be square
What if I'm a bad role model, what if I'm scared?
I don't think I could live up to the mother that my mother was
If I always just feel so unprepared

I might be too weak to fall in love
And I might be too much for everyone

All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'
But you'll never know 'em, 'cause I put 'em in a box in the ocean
All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'
But you'll never know 'em, 'cause I put 'em in a box in the ocean
Yeah, I put 'em in a box in the ocean

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Ah)
You might also like
What if they forget about all I've done?
If I built it up just to be no one
I make my own expectations for every single situation
Then break my own heart when it all falls

I might be too weak to fall in love
And I might be too much for everyone

All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'
But you'll never know 'em, 'cause I put 'em in a box in the ocean
All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'
But you'll never know 'em, 'cause I put 'em in a box in the ocean
Yeah, I put 'em in a box in the ocean (Ah)

Things you'll never hear me say
Lock 'em up to keep them safe
Forget 'em, let 'em float away
Things you'll never hear me say
Lock 'em up to keep them safe
Forget 'em, let 'em float away
Let 'em float away
All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'
But you'll never know 'em, 'cause I put 'em in a box in the ocean

Yeah, I put 'em in a box in the ocean
