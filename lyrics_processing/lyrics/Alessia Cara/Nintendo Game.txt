Choose your weapon, and let's go
Who's gonna beat this level?
I speed up, you slow down
Looks like I'm on your tail now
Another round, do we give up?
This is taking longer than Zelda
Hold on, what I meant was
Is it too late to get a 1-up?

Baby, baby, baby, this is getting too crazy
I don't have the training
Baby, baby, baby, this love ain't a game
So we should stop playing

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins

Nobody wins
Nobody, nobody wins
But no-, but the game goes on
You might also like
All the trash talk is getting real old
I'd rather try my hand at Rainbow Road
I'm focused, play my next move
But you're onto me, so it's no use
It's a showdown, a game for two
Pick each other's brains looking for clues
A battle with no objective
Who will be the final one standing?

Baby, baby, baby, this is getting too crazy
I don't have the training
Baby, baby, baby, this love ain't a game
So we should stop playing

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins

Nobody wins
Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck, 'cause right now nobody's safe

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
