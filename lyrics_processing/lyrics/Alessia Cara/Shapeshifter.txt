I can't quite put my finger on you, you shapeshifter
I don't even know if you believe you, you minddrifter
I should've known it wouldn't be you, you big quitter
What a way to go, you didn't need to I'm still bitter

Who was I to think that I could be the one to change your mind
To mean more than some history, to have time on my side?
Who was I to think that I could stop the sun from setting on us
Said you wouldn't break your promise, Mr. Honest

Don't know if I wanna get you back or get you back someday
Don't know if I'm even mad or just sad you couldn't stay, yeah
Go figure, team switcher, it's a shame
Did I get fooled or are you a fool just like me?

Replace your guilt with philosophy, bright idea
I bet you forgot you said you need me, on tequila
Got the two of us, we're dancing in a dream, buzz killer
We were never two, my dear, we were three (Hmm)

And who was I to think that I could be the one to make your choice
To mean more than some history, to cut through all the noise?
Who were you to think that I would be fine being disrespected
I hope someday you regret it, yeah, I said it
You might also like
Don't know if I wanna get you back or get you back someday
Don't know if I'm even mad or just sad you couldn't stay, yeah
Go figure, team switcher, it's a shame
Did I get fooled or are you a fool just like me?

Shape (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shapeshifter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shapeshifter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Don't know if I wanna get you back or get you back someday
Don't know if I'm even mad or just sad you couldn't stay, yeah
Go figure, team switcher, it's a shame
Did I get fooled or are you a fool just like me?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
