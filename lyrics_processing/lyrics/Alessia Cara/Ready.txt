I think it's safe to say that you will always change
New colours day-to-day; my friend, you are a hurricane
The look on your face, all the things you say
Send me to outer space; my friend, you test my patience

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me, yeah
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, ready for me

Why do I care so much about you? Boy, you know I do
I think a million thoughts, but only half get through to you
You start a million fires just to see what they can do
But then you freeze up like winter season in June
I wanna climb into your mind and turn on all the lights
Read all your secrets, see if you wonder about mine
We're just kids tryin' to understand the world
You're still only a boy who's scared of a good girl
You might also like
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me (Oh, no)
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, ready for me

I won't be waiting for you to come around, to come around
I won't be waiting for you, but I'll be around, I'll be around

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
(Ready for me, no, no, no)
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
(Ready for me, no, no, no)
Go steady your (Steady your), your heavy heart (Heavy heart)
Until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
