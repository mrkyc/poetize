Do you recall the days at your old place?
Playing with Troll dolls to scare the kids away
My closet was a time machine, yours a stage
I wish we told those little girls they're gonna be okay
Still picture it all in my mind
Making a campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops 'cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told me that we'd be alright

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget

Do you remember all the cartoons at midnight?
Like the one about the crass-humoured French guy
And what about you, Mr. Poetry?
And what about all that we built in just a couple weeks?
Talkin' 'bout all of our fears through a cracked screen
Picking little fights over falling asleep
I wish you knew I loved you when you knew you loved me
Really wish I knew you sooner than my 20s

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget

I'm a product of the who's, when's, and how's
Those who let go and those who stuck around
I wish somebody would've told me I'd be here now
'Cause this kind of life is one to sing about (Oh yeah)

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of love, you won't ever forget
