I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love (I wish)

Bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
So, I let you go

I loved you, but I couldn't keep you
I was broken, 'til I learned I didn't need you
Feelin' bold, I just might catch a flight to Rio
Put my feet up, cheer up
Tear up on the beach to Viva La Vida like Frida

Bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
So, I let you go

I'll write you a song I'll never send ya
I don't wanna disrespect ya
I miss you, I do, but I wasn't for you
You look happier, I checked, of course (Of course)
I wish you the best, of course (Of course)
I'm hurting less, I'm sure
She'll be what you waited for
You might also like
Bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
So, I let you go

(I wish you) Bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love

Oh, bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
So, I let you go

So, I le-le-let you
So, I let you go, I let you
So, I le-le-let you
So, I let you go, I let you
So, I le-le-let you
So, I let you go, I let you go
I thought you should know
That I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
