You went and turned the red flag white, darling, and you waved it
You've always had a way with words
Why can't you explain it then?
I see your face in everyone, baby, and I hate it
Who would have ever thought I'd have to erase it? Uh

Every little thing is reminding me of you
Yes, I'll set fire to my whole room (Ah, ah, ah)

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?

I double take at every phone that rings out of habit
I can't shake the little things, they're harder to manage, woah
I can't bury the past, but I'll bury the hatchet
Can we just pretend that this never happened? Yeah

Every little thing is reminding me of you
Guess I'll set fire to my whole room (Ah, ah, ah)

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?

So what are you doing tonight?
'Cause I miss you and I, and I can't even lie, I need you
I could get on a flight, I could make up the time
I know I'm out of line, can I see you?

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?
Baby, how do I let you go if I don't want to?
