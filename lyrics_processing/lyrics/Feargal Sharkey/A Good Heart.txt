I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
Highest risk of striking out
The risk of getting hurt
And still, I have so much to learn
I know, 'cause I think about it all the time
I know, that real love has quite a price
And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine
My expectations may be high
I blamed it on my youth
Soon enough, I'll learned the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone
I know, 'cause I learn a little every day
I know, 'cause I listen when the experts say
That a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My ideas of love weren't
As foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find
I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know, it will all be worth it in the end
And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine
And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this, with this heart of mine
A good heart
A good heart
A good heart
A good heart
A good heart
