Broken and lost You found me
Though hurt had been my way
You healed my life
Called as a child and righteous
You broke the power of sin
And freed my heart

You saved me and I will be forever Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours

Emptied of self and rescued
You opened up my heart
To know Your cross
Held by the power of freedom
You broke all lies
And found me in Your truth

You saved me and I will be forever Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours
You saved me and I will be forever Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours
You might also like
And I will love You, God
I will stand and worship
I will give You praise
To You my hands I raise
I release my pride
A living sacrifice
You are my delight
To You I give my life

I will love You, God
I will stand and worship
I will give You praise
To You my hands I raise
I release my pride
A living sacrifice
You are my delight
To You I give my life

You saved me and I will be forever Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours
Yours, God
You saved me and I will be forever Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours
You saved me and I will be forever Yours
We are Yours
You made me free to be forever Yours

C'mon, I will love
I will love You, God
I will stand and worship
I will give You praise
To You my hands I raise
I release my pride
A living sacrifice
You are my delight
To You I give my life

I will love You, God
I will stand and worship
I will give You praise
Give You praise
To You my hands I raise
I release my pride
I'm a living sacrifice
You are my delight
To You I give my life, yes
We belong to You Lord
