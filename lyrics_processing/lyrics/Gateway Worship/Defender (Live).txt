You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
You come back with the head of my enemy
You come back and You call it my victory, oh yeah

You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
Your love becomes my greatest defense
It leads me from the dry wilderness

And all I did was praise
All I did was worship
All I did was bow down
All I did was stay still

Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better Your way

You know before I do
Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
And You restore my faith and hope again
You might also like
And all I did was praise
All I did was worship
All I did was bow down
All I did was stay still, yeah

Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better Your way

Oh, so much better Your way
Oh, my Jesus

When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better Your way
Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better Your way
Oh, You fight for me

When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
You are the defender of my heart

Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Yeah, just sing it out
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better Your way
