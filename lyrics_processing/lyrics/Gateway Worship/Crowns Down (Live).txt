Oh-oh, oh-oh

Enthroned in glory, my Savior King
Your loving kindness has welcomed me
Though I'm unworthy of majesty
You wrap the lowly in royalty

And so I will lay my crowns down at Your feet
You are holy, holy
And I will give my life as an offering
You are worthy, so worthy

Oh-oh

Here at Your altar to seek Your face
Broken and poured out without restraint
In full abandon before my King
Here I surrender my everything

And I will lay my crowns down at Your feet
You are holy, holy
And I will give my life as an offering
You are worthy, so worthy
Oh, I will lay my crowns down at Your feet
You are holy, holy
And I will give my life as an offering
You are worthy, so worthy, God, yeah

Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb upon the throne
We join with all of Heaven in the everlasting song
(One more time)
Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb upon the throne
We join with all of Heaven in the everlasting song

And I will lay my crowns down at Your feet
You are holy, holy
And I will give my life as an offering
You are worthy, so worthy
Oh, I will lay my crowns down at Your feet
You are holy, holy
And I will give my life as an offering
You are worthy, so worthy
