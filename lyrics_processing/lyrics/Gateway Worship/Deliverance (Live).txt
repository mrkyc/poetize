You wouldn't let me stay a captive
You couldn't stand to see my chains
And so You came to be my rescue
To part the waters in my way

Jesus, You are my deliverance
From death to life
From dark to light
Jesus, You show me what freedom is
You call my name
You broke my shame
You are my deliverance

You wouldn't let me stay in judgement
You took the wrath that I deserved
Your outstretched arms became my rescue
Your blood has told me what I'm worth

Jesus, You are my deliverance
From death to life
From dark to light
Jesus, You show me what freedom is
You call my name
You broke my shame
You are my deliverance
You are my deliverance
