This alabaster jar is all I have of worth
I break it at Your feet, Lord
It's less than You deserve
You're far more beautiful
More precious than the oil
The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy

Like You spilled Your blood
I spill my heart
As an offering to my King

Here I am, take me as an offering
Here I am, giving
Every heartbeat for Your glory
Take me
Take me

This time that I have left
Is all I have of worth
I lay it at Your feet, Lord
It's less than You deserve
And though I've little strength
And though my days are few
You gave Your life for me
So I will live my life for you
You might also like
Like You spilled Your blood
I spill my heart
As an offering to my King

Here I am, take me as an offering
Here I am, giving
Every heartbeat for Your glory
Here I am, take me as an offering
Here I am, giving
Every heartbeat for Your glory
Take me
