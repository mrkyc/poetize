In the morning, I will rise up
Shed the darkness and bathe in Your light
I recount all, every blessing
The words You've spoken that bring me new life

I am reminded
From where You have brought me
Where You have placed me for today
I won't forget that
Your hand will hold me
Your love sustains me through the wait
I will wait on You, Lord
I will wait on You, Lord

Oh the burdens that I've carried
They are heavy, oh, too heavy to hold
And there's a river, there's a sunrise
There's a new day and it's bringing new life

I am reminded
From where You have brought me
And where You have placed me for today
I won't forget that
Your hand will hold me
Your love sustains me through the wait
I will wait on You, Lord
I will wait on You, Lord, and oh

'Cause I am reminded
From where You have brought me
And where You have placed me for today
I won't forget that
Your hand will hold me
Your love sustains me through the wait
I will wait on You, Lord

I will wait on You, Jesus
I will wait on You
For You to come
