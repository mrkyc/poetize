Oh, that rugged cross, the selfless pain He bore
He breathed His final breath, that I would be restored
By His body that was broken, precious blood freely shed
The spotless lamb of Heaven has forever conquered death

Jesus is my healer, He's everything I need
He alone has triumphed, over sickness and disease
Fear, where is your power? The cross is your defeat
Jesus is my healer, He has won the victory

Hey!

Oh, how great a love, I'm held by perfect peace
He walks with me through valleys, understands my suffering
Every joy and every sorrow, every triumph, every loss
I know everything is covered, by the shadow of the cross
Oh, everything is covered, by the shadow of the cross

Oh, Jesus is my healer, He's everything I need
He alone has triumphed, over sickness and disease
Fear, where is your power? Oh, the cross is your defeat
Jesus is my healer, He has won the victory
Oh-oh, Jesus is my healer, He has won the victory

Oh, oh, all praise, all praise
To the Lamb that was slain
All praise, all praise, all praise
To the Lamb that was slain

Everything bows at His name
Everything bows at His name
Sickness, darkness, chains
Break at the name of Jesus
Everything bows at His name
Everything bows at His name
Sickness, darkness, chains
Break at the name of Jesus
(Come on, sing it out)
Oh, everything bows at His name
Everything bows at His name
Sickness, darkness, chains
Break at the name of Jesus
(Jesus, Jesus)
Everything bows at His name
Everything bows at His name
Oh, sickness, darkness, chains
Break at the name of Jesus
Oh, Jesus, everything bows at His name
Everything bows at His name
Oh, sickness, darkness, chains
They break at the name of Jesus, oh-oh
Jesus is my healer, oh, He's everything I need
He alone has triumphed, over sickness and disease
Fear, where is your power? Oh, the cross is your defeat
For Jesus is my healer, He has won the victory
Oh-oh, Jesus is my healer, He has won the victory
