When darkness tries to roll over my bones
When sorrow tries to steal the joy I own
When brokenness and pain is all I know
Oh, I won't be shaken, I won't be shaken

'Cause my fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love!

Shame no longer has a place to hide
For I am not a captive to the lies
And I'm not afraid to leave my past behind
No, I won't be shaken, I won't be shaken!

'Cause my fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance
When I stand in Your love!
