I don't want to hurry
No, I don't want to move
You are my sanctuary, my upper room
So I'll linger here with You

Push through the fear of silence
'Til time has been removed
You are my sanctuary, my upper room
So I'll linger here with You

My dwelling place, where I am safe
My refuge from the storm
Open my heart, to hear Your heart
To love You more and more
I won't move
I'll linger here with You

Keep me present in this moment
There's more You want to do
You are my sanctuary, my upper room
So I'll linger here with You
You might also like
My dwelling place, where I am safe
My refuge from the storm
Open my heart, to hear Your heart
To love You more and more
I won't move
I'll linger here with You
I'll linger here with You
I'll linger here with You, Lord

I want to go deeper, I want to go further
I want more of You, Lord
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
Than I've ever been before
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
I want more of You, Lord
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
Than I've ever been before
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
I want more of You, Lord, oh
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
Than I've ever been before
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
I want more of You, Lord, oh
I want to go deeper, I want to go further
Than I've ever been before
My dwelling place, where I am safe
My refuge from the storm
Open my heart, to hear Your heart
To love You more and more
My dwelling place, where I am safe
My refuge from the storm
Open my heart, to hear Your heart
To love You more and more
I won't move, no, I won't move
I'll linger here with You
