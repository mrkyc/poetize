There's a fount I know where blessings overflow
And living water runs free from the mercy seat
There's a joy I know deep inside my bones
A never-ending well where I thirst no more

Rejoice, rejoice my soul
Come on rejoice, rejoice my soul
(Let me hear you)

Singing praise the Lord, Jesus came for me
He set me on my feet and now I'm singing
Praise the Lord by the power of His name
I'm free and unashamed so I'll keep singing
Praise the Lord

There's a love I know, washed me white as snow
Healed this broken heart when He made me whole
There's no power in hell that could separate
I'm forever held by His amazing grace

(Come on)
Rejoice, rejoice my soul
Rejoice, rejoice my soul

There's a Man I know hung upon a tree
Gave His life that day on Calvary
But the grave couldn't hold Him and it can't hold me
