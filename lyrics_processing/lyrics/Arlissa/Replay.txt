I can see where you are, see where you are
And I can hear the record playing
See her in your arms, her in your arms
I hear every word you're saying, the words you're saying
'Cause you said them to me
And I know all the games you're playing, the games you're playing
'Cause you played them with me

Close my eyes
Now it's on replay in my mind
Oh what I left behind
But now it's on replay in my mind
Now it's on replay, now it's on replay, now it's on replay in my mind

Undercover, undercover
Now I'm seeing your true colours
My head's in my hands, head's in my hands
My heart is lying in the gutter, in the gutter
But you don't see me
'Cause I'm looking through a one-way mirror, one-way mirror
And I hate what I see
But curiosity's a killer
You might also like
Close my eyes
Now it's on replay in my mind
Oh what I left behind
But now it's on replay in my mind
Now it's on replay, now it's on replay, now it's on replay in my mind
Now it's on replay, I can't get away, now it's on replay in my mind

Fingers on the keys to a secret door
Cryptic little code that I shouldn't know
Taking me to places that I shouldn't go
Still I find myself coming back for more
Know about you, you don't know about me
Invisible to you but you're crystal clear
Taking me to places that I shouldn't go

Close my eyes
Now it's on replay in my mind
Oh what I left behind
But now it's on replay in my mind
Now it's on replay, now it's on replay, now it's on replay in my mind
Now it's on replay, every night, every day
