Oh, it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh, you took away my sunshine
Now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh, it's hard to let somebody when all I want is
All I want is you

Sitting here alone with someone that looks like you
Echoes of the past that I used to have with you

But my heart only lets me down
Oh, these words are wasted now
We didn't even know we were running out of time

Oh, it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh, you took away my sunshine
Now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh, it's hard to let somebody when all I want is
All I want is you

Take away your love and these streets don't look the same
Now everywhere I go, I hear the wind whisper your name
You might also like
Something pulls us slowly down
Oh, those words are wasted now
Did I ever see the truth when I look into your eyes?

Oh, it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh, you took away my sunshine
Now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh, it's hard to let somebody when all I want is
All I want is you

You you you, you you you
Oh, I keep on running, running circles in my head
And I don't know if I could learn to live without the best I've ever had

Oh, it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh, you took away my sunshine
Now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh, it's hard to let somebody, it's hard to let somebody
When all I want is you, when all I want is you
You you you, you you you, you you you
