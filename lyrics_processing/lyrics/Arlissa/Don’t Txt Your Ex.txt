Real life
One day, you love me
Next day, we need to take time
Take time
It's a fine line
You twist and you turn
My fates undeserved overnight
Real life

Don't get me started
It's not what I wanted
You took part of me
And now I'm a little, little smaller
The words that you said
They mess with my head
Your marks on my body
Don't feel like mine any longer

Oooh and it makes me mad
Makes me a little bit aggressive
Makes me a little bit pensive
Wondering if I've learnt my lesson
Oooh and it makes me sad
Wondering how to forget you
'Fore I do something I regret
Don't text your ex
Don't text your ex
You might also like
It's real life
I don't know why tears were falling from your eyes
Your eyes
It's a paradigm
The ones who hurt you always act like you're the bad guy
Bad guy

Don't get me started
It's not what I wanted
You took part of me
And now I'm a little, little smaller
The words that you said
They mess with my head
Your marks on my body
Don't feel like mine any longer

Oooh and it makes me mad
Makes me a little bit aggressive
Makes me a little bit pensive
Wondering if I've learnt my lesson
Oooh and it makes me sad
Wondering how to forget you
'Fore I do something I regret
Don't text your ex
Don't text your ex
And it makes me mad, m-makes me mad
Me a little bit aggressive, little bit aggressive
Makes me mad, m-makes me mad
Me a little bit aggressive, me a little bit
Oooh and it makes me sad, makes me sad
Me a little bit aggressive, little bit aggressive
Makes me mad, m-m-makes me mad
Me a little bit aggressive, me a little bit aggressive

Oooh and it makes me mad
A little bit aggressive
Makes me a little bit pensive
Wondering if I've learnt my lesson
Oooh and it makes me sad
Wondering how to forget you
'Fore I do something I regret
Don't text your ex
Don't text your ex

And it makes me mad, m-makes me mad
Me a little bit aggressive, little bit aggressive
Makes me mad, m-makes me mad
Me a little bit aggressive, me a little bit
Oooh and it makes me sad, makes me sad
Me a little bit aggressive, little bit aggressive
Makes me mad, m-m-makes me
Don't text your ex
