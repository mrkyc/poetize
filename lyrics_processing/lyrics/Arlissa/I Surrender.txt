Who am I without a name
Oh are you there?
Oh are you there?
If I didn't have this face
Oh, would you care?
Oh, would you care?

Oh I've been waiting for an answer
Did I ever stand a chance?

Why does it rain on me?
Oh why'd you have to go and make it so hard
I surrender
So let it rain on me
I'm tired of trying to find a place I can hide
This is my life

Give me a sign to make it right
Is this how it is are we  for life
Give me a sign to make it right
Is this how it is are we  for life
