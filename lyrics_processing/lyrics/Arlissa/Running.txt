When I close my eyes
You're the center of the world
And we're all alone and I got nothin' on
But everybody's talking bout' the things I said
When it all
When it all
When it all went bad

Said I wouldn't come tonight
'Cause don't know your friends
Couldn't even change my mind
I got no money left
Used every excuse I had
'Cause I don't wanna know
Don't know how to let you go

So I keep running away
But everywhere just brings me back to you
I know you want me to stay
'Cause you said "I dare you, I dare you"

So I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running, running, running

No, I tried my best so I could move on
But I lost my keys so I can't go home
And we're sitting by the fire
And you feel so warm
Why did I have to go
And pick up my phone?

Said I wouldn't come tonight
'Cause I don't know your friends
Couldn't even change my mind
I got no money left
Used every excuse I had
'Cause I don't wanna know
Don't know how to let you go

I keep running away
But everywhere just brings me back to you
I don't know what else to say
It only happens when I have a few
And now we're back at your place
And I forgot how much I wanted you
I know you want me to stay
'Cause you said "I dare you, I dare you"
So I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running, running, running

I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
I keep running, running
I keep running, running away
