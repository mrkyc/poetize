Hello?
You there?
Pick up

I don't know why you treat me this way
The ways you make me feel
Like you knew best for the both of us
Trust, I thought this thing was real
But you don't know the meaning of love
And the feelings you're speaking of
Maybe you think  I don't believe in love

Didn't I give you everything that you wanted?
Had you in your darkest moments?
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone
Session every time you call
Didn't I give you all my love and affection?
But baby, looking back on reflection
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone
And I'm not picking up no more

Ooh, hoo
More, ah
Ooh, hoo
You might also like
And I should have known not to mess with those
Who need saving
Because it costs too much to love someone
Who's only used to escaping
And the funny thing is that I used to miss you
But the problem is you don't know your issues
I was caught between your bedsheets and your tissues
Oh-oh, ooh

Didn't I give you everything that you wanted?
Had you in your darkest moments?
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone
Session every time you call
Didn't I give you all my love and affection?
But baby, looking back on reflection
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone
And I'm not picking up no more

Ooh, hoo
More, ah
Ooh, hoo

Didn't, didn't, I, didn't, didn't I, didn't
You didn't have to, oh
Didn't, didn't, I, didn't, didn't I, didn't
You didn't have to, oh
Didn't, didn't, I, didn't, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I give you everything that you wanted?
Had you in your darkest moments?
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone
Session every time you call
Didn't I give you all my love and affection? (Hello?)
But baby, looking back on reflection (Pick up, hello?)
"Therapist" must have been my name on your phone (Pick up)
And I'm not picking up no more

Ooh, hoo
More, ah
Ooh, hoo

Didn't, didn't, I, didn't, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't, didn't, I, didn't, didn't I, didn't (Pick up, please, pick up)
