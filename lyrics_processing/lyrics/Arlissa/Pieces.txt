Even though my heart's broke
I'll love you with all the pieces (All of the pieces)
I'll be there with the air you breathe in
Lay your head on my pillow, tell me all your secrets
I promise you that I'll keep 'em
(Yo, Eb, you did it again)

Tell me, tell me
Who hasn't been hurt, baby?
Still we can't help putting them first
Knowing it ain't working
Making you feel worthless, babe
It ain't picture perfect underneath the surface, babe

You're dying for something you need more
Come over, oh
I know I've been hurt before

Even though my heart's broke
I'll love you with all the pieces (All of the pieces)
I'll be there with the air you breathe in
Lay your head on my pillow, tell me all your secrets
I promise you that I'll keep 'em
You might also like
Okay, I lay my head on your pillow
Tell you all of my secrets
Just know I'm far from an angel
If I showed you my demons
I'm tryna see a new angle
You give me all of the reasons
You give me so many that I could write a book or a thesis
And I'm rambling on, I might as well just perform
I turn this bed to a stage, I turn this love to a song
I turn this kiss to them drums, I got you humming along
Like mmm-mmm-mmm, all the way to the moon

You're dying for something you need more
Come over, oh
I know I've been hurt before

Even though my heart's broke
I'll love you with all the pieces (All of the pieces)
I'll be there with the air you breathe in
Lay your head on my pillow, tell me all your secrets
I promise you that I'll keep 'em

Even though my heart's broke
I'll love you with all the pieces (All of the pieces)
I'll be there with the air you breathe in
Lay your head on my pillow, tell me all your secrets
