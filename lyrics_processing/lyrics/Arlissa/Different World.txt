I see you still hold your coffee in the same way, and still sort of frown each time you smile
But not for me
Strange that 99% of everything was exactly the same as it had been
Except for one thing

I can't stop you if you have to go, but I don't wanna watch you leave
You were just across the table a second ago, now you're in a different world to me
I can't stop you if you have to go, but you're taking away half of me
We were sitting here together a minute ago, now you're in a different world to me

So easy to pretend that it's always been the same, and that nothing between us ever changed
Until we hurt again
So tell me, what were the chances we would make it?
We felt that the odds don't mean a thing
Never stopped to think

I can't stop you if you have to go, but I don't wanna watch you leave
You were just across the table a second ago, now you're in a different world to me
I can't stop you if you have to go, but you're taking away half of me
We were sitting here together a minute ago, now you're in a different world to me

And I can't figure how the story goes
We got so close, now we're so far from what we know
You might also like
I can't stop you, it's hard to let you go, but you're taking away half of me
You were just across the table a second ago, and now you're just a memory
I can't stop you if you have to go, but you'll always be a part of me
We were sitting here together a minute ago, now you're in a different world to me

I see you drumming your fingers on the table, I know that you've got somewhere to be
