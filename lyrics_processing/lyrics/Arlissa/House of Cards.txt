Take all your plans and break them
They never turn out like you made them
And the stories that we sow only fill us up with hopes
In the end all we do is replace them

I'm all shook up
My cup is tipping over
And all my dreams are overflowing
Upon this wooden floor
I guess I'm tryna tell you
It don't have to be this way
But if you build a house of cards
It's always gonna break

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
If you build a house of cards
Then it's always gonna break
La, la, la, la
The winds are always gonna change
If you build a house of cards
Nothing ever stays the same
You might also like
Forget what your parents told you
Don't have to grow old 'cause you're older
You'll find love, you'll find pain, then you lose and try again
Just don't let your heart grow colder

I'm all shook up (All shook up)
My cup is tipping over (Cup is tipping over)
And all my dreams are overflowing (Overflowing)
Upon this wooden floor (Woo ooh)
I guess I'm tryna tell you
It don't have to be this way
But if you build a house of cards
It's always gonna break

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
If you build a house of cards
Then it's always gonna break
La, la, la, la
The winds are always gonna change
If you build a house of cards
Nothing ever stays the same
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
If you build a house of cards
Then it's always gonna break
La, la, la, la
The winds are always gonna change
If you build a house of cards
Nothing ever stays the same
Be brave (Be brave), hold tight (Hold tight)
Though the world keeps spinning
Don't close (Don't close) your eyes (Your eyes)
Or you just might miss it
Be brave (Be brave), hold tight (Hold tight)
As the world keeps spinning
Don't close (Don't close) your eyes
Or you just might miss it
Be brave (Be brave), hold tight (Hold tight)
And as the world keeps spinning
Don't close (Don't close) your eyes (Your eyes)
Or you just might miss it
Be brave (Be brave), hold tight (Hold tight)
And as the world keeps spinning
Don't close your eyes (Your eyes)

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
If you build a house of cards
Then it's always gonna break
La, la, la, la
The winds are always gonna change
If you build a house of cards
Nothing ever stays the same
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
If you build a house of cards
