Two racing hearts and foolish dreaming
Too young to see that love could take me down, me down
I carry the scars with me now
With barricades and walls of armour
To let you in, I had to let it out, this doubt
Still trying to figure it out

Standing in the dark, holding shards of my history, blinding me
Shining like the sun, on and off, you can set me free
Oh brave heart don't fail me now

This fear that I'm feeling, I'm shaking it out
I built up these walls, now I'm tearing them down
Oh brave heart don't fail me now
Been caught in the shadows, the shadows of doubt
A feeling, it's lifting my feet off the ground
Oh brave heart don't fail me now

Trapped by the fear it might get broken
Too scared to fall when the past won't let me go
I know I just wanna fall so deep
Cannot walk for I break my cover
A leap of faith to find new colours
Dare to dream of all that this could be
You might also like
Standing in the dark with the last of my history, blinding me
Shining like the sun, on and off, will you set me free
Oh brave heart don't fail me now

This fear that I'm feeling, I'm shaking it out
I built up these walls, now I'm tearing them down
Oh brave heart don't fail me now
Been caught in the shadows, the shadows of doubt
A feeling, it's lifting my feet off the ground
Oh brave heart don't fail me now

Brave heart don't fail me
Brave heart please save me

This fear that I'm feeling, I'm shaking it out
I built up these walls, now I'm tearing them down
Oh brave heart don't fail me now
Been caught in the shadows, the shadows of doubt
A feeling, it's lifting my feet off the ground
