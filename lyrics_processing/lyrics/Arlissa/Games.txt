It's all fun and games
Till one of us goes insane
We're dominos out of place
But tell me now, who's to blame?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know why you came
If it's all fun and games, is it all fun and games?

We play with fire
The trouble is, it hurts me so good
You get me higher and hold me down
When I know I should see the signs
Looking in your eyes
It's all fun and games
Till one of us goes insane

I should have known by now
And I should have walked away
All I really wanted
Yeah, all I really wanted was a good time, baby
A good time, baby

It's all fun and games
Till one of us goes insane
We're dominos out of place
But tell me now, who's to blame?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know why you came
If it's all fun and games, is it all fun and games?

We dance on glass
Any moment we could fall through
Keep coming back
Even though I know the truth
In the lies, looking in your eyes
It's all fun and games
Till one of us starts to break

I should have known by now
And I should have walked away
All I really wanted
Yeah, all I really wanted was a good time, baby
A good time, baby

It's all fun and games
Till one of us goes insane
We're dominos out of place
But tell me now, who's to blame?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know why you came
If it's all fun and games, is it all fun and games?
It's all fun and games (Games)
Tell me now, who's to blame? (Games)
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know why you came
