It's not what you said, it's how you said it
And don't you say you love me when you know you'll regret it
It's not what we did, it's what we didn't
We've been losing time and don't know how to admit it

When love don't feel right
We get along, get along on the outside
Head out the door, but our hearts on the inside
Love don't feel right
We get along, get along on the outside
But hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie

We're half of the same
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie
Won't do this again
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie

You were the one, the one that I wanted
But you know people change, we're not the same as we started
We're not running away, we're moving forward
And though we're trying to stay ahead, we're just treading water

When love don't feel right
We get along, get along on the outside
Head out the door, but our hearts on the inside
Love don't feel right
We get along, get along on the outside
But hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie

We're half of the same
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie
Won't do this again
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie
We're half of the same
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
Hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie
Won't do this again
Don't take that the wrong way
You know what I mean
