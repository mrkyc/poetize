Would fellow men (would fellow men)
Take me to their hearts?
If I was (if I was)
A stronger man (a stronger man)
Carrying the weight of popular demand
Tell me, would that alarm her?
I'd never harm her at all

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was (if I was)
A wiser man (a wiser man)
Would other men (would other men)
Reach out and touch me?
If I was (if I was)
A kinder man (a kinder man)
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me, would that appease her?
I want to please her again

I'll never leave you at all
Come here my baby
Oh, they won't touch you
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me, would that appease you?
