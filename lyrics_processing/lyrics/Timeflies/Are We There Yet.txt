Hmm, are we there yet?

Our bodies burning like a bonfire
So close I could taste it (So close I could taste it)
And she was walking like a centerfold
In something high-wasted (Something high-wasted)

I know that it's gonna get loose with whatever we do tonight
I'll go anywhere with you, got it feeling like a movie, right?
So close, no, we can't hold on forever
Oh, it's magic whenever we're together

Somebody tell me, are we there yet?
I can't help but stare at
You pulling your hair back
I'm driving too fast
And I don't even care that
We've been everywhere
Now we're crossing state lines and we'll never turn back
Tell me, are we there yet? (Hey)

Somebody tell me, are we there yet? (Hey)
(Are we there yet?)

Oh, you know I'm down to the share, but I keep it to myself
I take her everywhere, but we do it real stealth (Hey)
You know she wear it well, and she down to show and tell
'Cause if you wanna get to heaven, gotta raise a little hell

I know that it's gonna get loose with whatever we do tonight
I'll go anywhere with you, got it feeling like a movie, right?
So close, no, we can't hold on forever
Oh, it's magic whenever we're together

Somebody tell me, are we there yet?
I can't help but stare at
You pulling your hair back
I'm driving too fast
And I don't even care that (Hey)

Now we're crossing state lines and we'll never turn back
Tell me, are we there yet? (Hey)

Ha, ha
I wanna get in some trouble with you for tonight (Trouble with you for tonight)
I don't care where we're going
You know that I'm down for the ride (Know that I'm down for the ride)
Yeah, I wanna get in some trouble with you for tonight (Trouble with you for tonight)
I don't care where we're going
Ready, set, roll, baby, you know that I'm gon' ride

Somebody tell me, are we there yet?
