I can't do it all by myself
Maybe it's dumb, but it helps
It can't hurt to fall, then I fell
Oh and I fell, I fell hard
Tell me all the sudden you don't trust me
Tell me with no warning you don't love me
So who picks up the pieces
I don't understand the reasons why you leaving
I was like, "Please, look I'm over seas, you ain't gotta leave
Baby breathe, it ain't time to pack your shit and leave the keys"
Now you're saying shit that I just can't believe
What do we do?
Oh, why the fuck could you do this to me, babe?

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

It's me? No, I wanted none of this shit
You see some problems and run from this shit
I wouldn't quit, I never go throwing my hands up
And just say I'm done with this shit
I was getting paper like I'm working out of Scranton
You were spending money like you live in East Hampton
Sorry, let me vent more, money, time spent
But we still be paying rent when I'm living in a mansion
Oh, what do I do with myself?
How can I start up all over again?
How can we go to the very beginning
'Cause look, baby, I just don't want it to end
Oh no, I'm not begging darling, please
But one more time, oh, could you walk down to me?
Where did we go, we go, we go
Where did we go wrong?
So tell me where do we go, we go, we go?
'Cause baby, I'm lost

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

Why is it when we're looking for memories
We always think of the bad ones?
No, I'm not the enemy, you keep forgetting we had love
I wanna remember the good times
But, how can you act like we had none
Like, how come you think it's okay
To just text me like nothing's changed
Stop playing games, you know it won't be the same
And it never will be
Does that hurt you? 'Cause it kills me
Do you feel that? 'Cause it's still me
And I wonder, do you ever feel guilty?

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Where did we go, we go, we go
Where did we go wrong?
So tell me where do we go, we go, we go?
'Cause baby, I'm lost
Where did we go, we go, we go
Where did we go wrong?
Oh, tell me where do we go, we go, we go?
