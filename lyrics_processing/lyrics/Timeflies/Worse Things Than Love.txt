You look good, so fine
Come on, put your body on mine
Whoa, whoa
So bad and you know
You turn heads wherever you go
Whoa, whoa

Whenever we get together it's like (Hell yeah)
I'm feeling fresher than the Fresh Prince of (Bel-Air)
And, girl, if it ain't about you then I (don't care)
No, I don't care
And you know that you should

Take a chance with me tonight
I know you feel it, so do I
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love
Lonely hearts can multiply
A world away from paradise
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love

And all the people say
And everybody say
There's worse things, worse things than love
You might also like
Them jeans, so tight
I wanna peel 'em off of your thighs
Whoa (they got me saying), whoa
She a freak, that's right
And we don't leave the sheets the whole night
Whoa (you got me saying), whoa

Whenever we get together it's like (Hell yeah)
I'm feeling fresher than the Fresh Prince of (Bel-Air)
And, girl, if it ain't about you then I (don't care)
No, I don't care
And you know that you should

Take a chance with me tonight
I know you feel it, so do I
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love
Lonely hearts can multiply
A world away from paradise
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love
Everybody say
And everybody say
There's worse things, worse things than love
Yeah
Yeah, come on (Timeflies)
There's worse things, there's worse things than love (Natalie La Rose)

Better off alone, well, what do we know?
We got a past that follows us wherever we go
If we ever find a way to check our own egos
We sit and talk with a couple bottles of the vino
Maybe say tonight when it's light, cappuccino
Maybe if it's right, I can buy a pair of stilettos
Maybe that'd be shit, we can go and see though
Well all you need is love, boy, just go and ask the Beatles

Take a chance with me tonight
I know you feel it, so do I
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love
Lonely hearts can multiply
A world away from paradise
Girl, you got to know there are worse things
There's worse things than love
You know
You got to know there's worse things
There's worse things than love
You know that people say
You got to know, you got to know there's worse things
