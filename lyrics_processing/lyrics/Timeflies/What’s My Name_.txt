What's, what's my name?

Uh, I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 something, right?
Cause I've been tryna work it out
Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Okay, let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You're just waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
All the things we could do in 20 minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you get the text that I write, it's gonna say

Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
What's my name?

Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But girl, you stay up on it
Oh, you got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge, let's explore your talents, oh

Oh na na, what's my name?

Oh na na, what's my name?

Oh na...

Baby, you got me and ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender to every word you whisper
Every door I enter, won't you let me in

Hey girl, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a boy like me
Hey girl, I really wanna be with you, 'cause you just my type
Oh na na na na
I need a girl to take it over
Looking for a girl to put ya work, oh
