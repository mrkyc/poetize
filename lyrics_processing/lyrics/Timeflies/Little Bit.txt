For a little bit of you tonight
For, for a little bit of you

I'm impulsive
That, that, that, that, that's nothing new
Ever since Nostrand
I, I, I, I've been bullet proof
I think I'm coping
That, that, that, that, that's just my move
Your arms wide open, uh-huh
Just like an ocean, uh-huh
And I keep falling in, oh
Just the way I always do
Could've thrown me a life boat
Got me feeling like deja vu
Oh no, give me one more, good reason
I'll be done for, believe it
Need an encore, I'm dreaming
Damn, you got it, and I need it

I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time
I get a little bit, little bit, little bit too drunk, but I'm fine
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time
Oh I'll be givin' it, givin' it, givin' it all up, for a little bit of you tonight
You might also like
Two days off, that's a weekend
Three days off, oh, I like this
Four days off, I'm off the deep end
Like I forgot about what life is
I'll let the future me figure that out
'Cuz right now, I'm feeling righteous
I get the invite, every night, circle like a satellite
And everything we do is priceless

I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time (every, fucking, time)
I get a little bit, little bit, little too drunk, but I'm fine (but I'm fine)
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time (Oh, this time)
Oh I'll be givin' it, givin' it, givin' it all up, for a little bit of you tonight
[Verse 3}
Put drunk me on the guest list, I'mma come too
So scotched up, and I'm comin' with the crew
Couple road sodas, maybe one or two
Need a charger with a lightning bolt, Pikachu
Double shot? Fuck it, let's triple it
What you got? Gimme a hit of it
In that top? See you nip slippin' it
Baby, just give me a little bit
{Chorus]
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time
I get a little bit, little bit, little bit too drunk, but I'm fine
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time
Oh I'll be givin' it, givin' it, givin' it all up, for a little bit of you tonight
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time (every time)
I get a little bit, little bit, little bit too drunk, but I'm fine (but I'm fine)
I have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time (but this time)
