I was ok on my own then I saw you
You were standing all alone and I watched you
We were both looking for something, someone to talk to
There's something about you, you do whatever you want to

Make up on my pillow case
Wake up with your after taste
Our bodies burning up in flames
But all you do is slip away

So I hold you like fire even though it hurts
So I hold you like fire even though I might get burned
So I hold you like fire
And I pray this time I learn to let you go
But I don't know, I don't know why
(Hold you like, hold you like fire)
(So I hold you like fire)

Got you close and you hide that you like it
When you're all over me my skins ignited
So breathe 'cause it's just me
There's no pressure, let's just be
But every time this feels like there's something
Then it's morning and you leave
You might also like
Make up on my pillow case
Wake up with your after taste
Our bodies burning up in flames
But all you do is slip away

So I hold you like fire even though it hurts
So I hold you like fire even though I might get burned
So I hold you like fire
And I pray this time I learn to let you go
But I don't know, I don't know why
(Hold you like, hold you like fire)
(So I hold you like fire)

Always stays the same
Setting fire to the brain
Hit me like a hurricane
Still I try to grab the flame
And I get burned
Every time you leave it's like I never learn
I just keep playing with fire till I get what I deserve

With your make up on my pillow case
Wake up with your after taste
Our bodies burning up in flames
But all you do is slip away
So I hold you like fire even though it hurts
So I hold you like fire even though I might get burned
So I hold you like fire
And I pray this time I learn to let you go
But I don't know, I don't know why
(Hold you like, hold you like fire)
