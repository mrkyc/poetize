All rise for the honorable
Now please approach the bench
And I apologize for apologizing
Not sure of my offense
I told her "No lie, my phone died
Got stuck up at the club with no ride"
From conversating to interrogating
Now how should we commence?
Cause you're always looking for something wrong with the way that I do everything
And I never think it's reflecting on you
And you know if you heard it, well then, it's probably true
(It's probably true)

I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
I'll admit it, I did it
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
(I said I'm guilty, are you?)
You might also like
Don't matter my story
You got a verdict 'fore you heard it
Ignoring the jury
Say the punishment, I deserve it
Gave me the right to attorney
Well, I don't need your help
I don't need no defendant
Baby, I defend myself

Cause you're always looking for something wrong with the way that I do everything
And I never think it's reflecting on you
And you know if you heard it, well then, it's probably true
(It's probably true)

I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
I'll admit it, I did it
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
(I said I'm guilty)
So if I'm guilty, convict me
For late nights and whisky
Addicted to good life
No Bobby, no Whitney
On Snow White, no Disney
We live like the '60s
It's good times, you feel me
Then all of a sudden

I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
Cause I'm always in trouble with you
I guess I'm guilty no matter what I do
I'll admit it, I did it
I guess I'm guilty, don't matter if it's true
