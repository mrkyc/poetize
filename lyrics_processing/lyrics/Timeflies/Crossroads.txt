I just go through the motions
It's like I'm stuck in a game
Thinking it'll be different
Then it just come up the same
Man how the hell did I get here?
Not like I knew the way
Just take me back to the start again
Just one more time on the stage

'Cause it's all I ever wanted all the good things goin'
It's hard just being honest when the truth's so cold
If I don't know when to call it then I've sold my soul
It don't matter the cost if I have to be lost

Then come and meet me at the crossroads, I'm waiting
Stay here till the lights all faded
Meet me at the crossroads of this ghost town
Meet me here
No were never turning back now

I'm getting closer and closer
Off to where I'm supposed to
It's hard to be catching your breath
When you riding the rails off this rollercoaster
Try not to fall off the tracks now
Hoping to land on your feet
I keep repeating it back
No this couldn't happen to me
You might also like
It's all I ever wanted, all the good things goin'
It's hard just being honest when the truth's so cold
If I don't know when to call it then I've sold my soul
It don't matter the cost if I have to be lost

Then come and meet me at the crossroads, I'm waiting
Stay here till the lights all faded
Meet me at the crossroads of this ghost town
Meet me here
No, were never turning back now

Growing up on Greek mythology
Reading these stories
I live by theology
Then on from middle to high school biology
Dad kept on telling me
'How fun would college be?'
Never to see it
But I know he follows me
Rolling stones like , they collar me
I went from houses to hotels
I'm bored of monopoly
When did this life become fucking apologies?
Man, I forgot to be real
Realer than real talk and as real as it gets
Life doesn't stop just to heal
It's a stairway to heaven
You gotta keep climbing the steps
Playing my heart strings and chasing the frets
Hate and regret like it's something I'm not
I do it over and over again
So if you see alone and I'm lost
Then come and meet me at the crossroads, I'm waiting
Stay here till the lights all faded
Meet me at the crossroads of this ghost town
Meet me here
No, were never turning back now
(Meet me at the crossroads)
Meet me at the crossroads of this ghost town
