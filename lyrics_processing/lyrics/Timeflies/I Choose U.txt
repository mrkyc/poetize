Crosstown to the west and I'm wasting my time
Down south, back roads, dust clouds the air
Chevrolet in the back seat but it wasn't there
Missed the flight at Heathrow
Got stuck up in a one room flat
Cause she's so fit, trying to hold me down
While I was just trying to get back
Malibu, beach blonde, crashing on these shores
Smile shining like gold
But that smile wasn't yours
And I know, I know, I know
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
And I choose you
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
And I choose you
And I choose you
And I choose you

Nails down my back but I never knew her name
Bright eyes, sundress, Daddy's little girl
She changed my life, but you changed my world
And I know, I know, I know
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
And I choose you
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
And I choose you
And I choose you
You're every place that I've been
Baby you're every face that I've seen
You're everywhere and I'm going crazy
Your body's rocking my dreams
You're always up in my mind
You're everywhere that I go
You're everything in this town
So girl I'm letting you know
That I'm rolling up in a fly whip
Come ride this and just close your eyes
Showing up with my sidekick
My superhero with the dopest skies
No wonder woman all our dreams are coming true
So don't be scared of losing me
Cause I'm always choosing you
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
And I choose you
And I choose you
Everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you
I need somebody to love, I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love, I need somebody to love
