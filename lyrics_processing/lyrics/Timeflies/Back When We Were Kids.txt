Walking these streets again, thinking back when I was ten
When my bike got stolen and dad, he drove me
Till we found that old thing in
In that sketchy parking lot, behind the market that's long gone
Where I used to roll that shopping cart down every aisle with mom
I miss when

Back when we were kids and the world was ours
Back when we were kids, before all the scars
Back when we were kids, where we'd never part
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this
Back when we were kids

It's been playing in my head, seeing these posters above my bed
About the first night that I got drunk, and everything we said
All we talked about was girls and booze, but we never had a plan
And the only thing we ever knew, is when the cops showed up we ran
I miss when

Back when we were kids and the world was ours
Back when we were kids, before all the scars
Back when we were kids, where we'd never part
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this
Back when we were kids

Every road, driving in
I was so innocent
Reminiscing about trying to get the explicit edition of Eminem
Man, back when we were kids again
When we only went to movies for the back row
When we only needed chalk and the asphalt
We knew this would happen
To be back to back to back when, back when, back when

Back when we were kids and the world was ours
Back when we were kids, before all the scars
Back when we were kids, where we'd never part
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this

Back when we were kids and the world was ours
Back when we were kids, before all the scars
Back when we were kids, where we'd never part
Back when we were kids, everything felt like this
