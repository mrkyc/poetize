Scene change, new chapters, my jersey's in the rafters
How I would've done it over, harder, better, faster
If I'm ghost, then I'm Casper, that's why I call you "boo"
This ain't normally some type of shit I do
I've been caught up in this moment, wonder if you notice
Girl, when I'm around you, I can't even focus
When you're not around, I feel down at my lowest
Will you catch me now or are you just as hopeless?
Oh no

Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
We fall, we fall, I guess we're falling in love
Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
Is it gravity or are we falling in love?
We fall, we fall, I guess we're falling in love

We fall, we fall, I guess we're falling in love
We fall, we fall, I guess we're falling in love

Life's good, never stressing
Take her to a thousand islands 'cause the way she dressing
Sunday love, make me count my blessings
I think I can, I think I can
Baby, let me go and start that engine
Look, she's Indie label crazy, baby got me acting super strange
Super freakin' every weekend, got me goin' Rick James
Stuck in your love, but it don't phase me
All the way up with you now, baby
