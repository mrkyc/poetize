I see you lightin' up your cigarette
Does it burn you like you burn me?
So many nights I've been tryna forget
Do they hurt you like they hurt me?
And all I been thinking about
That first night we walked home
You forgot your raincoat
Now you're here with somebody else
And I know you ain't yourself

I feel it in my body when you 're around
And I know that this party is bringing you down
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my, feel it in my body

Feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my body

Who is he? Who is she?
'Cause you look so good together
Who is she? Isn't me
You know we were so much better
I know we were so much better, I know, oh oh
Remember when we wake up in your living room
'Cause we couldn't make it to the bedroom
The next thing I remember, I was fucking you
And the smell of your perfume
Is all I keep thinking about
That night at your friend's place
We made out and smoked way too much
And I didn't wanna stay out
So I made up excuses just so we could be alone
Now all I keep thinking about
That first night we walked home
I forgot my raincoat on purpose
Now you're here with somebody else
Why is it somebody else? Oh oh

I feel it in my body when you are around
And I know that this party is bringing you down
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my, feel it in my body
Feel it in my body
Feel it in my body
I can feel it in my body
Feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my body

That first night we walked home
You forgot your raincoat
That first night we walked home
You forgot your raincoat
That first night we walked home
You forgot your raincoat
I forgot my raincoat on purpose

I feel it in my body when you 're around
And I know that this party is bringing you down
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my, feel it in my body
