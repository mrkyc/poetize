Fashionably late, I'm last in
I played the cards, time to cash in
All the girls here is lookin' like Maxim
Movie star life so it's lights, camera, action
So lemme direct only one word matters so let's call it respect
I am locked in from the minute I walk in
Through the middle of the floor so let's call it collect
Well I don't need a game plan
I rock a club like a mother fuckin' cave man
I was prayin' for these bottles and moddles
But now I got 'em so I'm chillin' in the back saying Amen
This too much fun you see we finally start to get it like we should
Like you been playin' Lotto for life and it looks like you just won
So when they see you and you're lookin' this good
Everybody gonna swoon

Out here the parties never end too soon
Happens every time I go and step up in the room
I do it like that so lemme see ya, lemme see ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
We could set it off make the bass go boom
Do it so fly I could take you to the moon
We gon' run it back so lemme see ya, lemme se ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
You might also like
Walked in place frozen up nowadays everybody shows up
It's like that from the minute that we pulled up
We gon' shut it down yeah until the club close up
Table in the back yeah I gotcha
See whatever you want, it won't cost ya
Welcome to the life yes we do this every night
Cause you know that all the bras pop off like cheap vodka
Swoon, girls around me got it lookin' like a huddle yeah
I need a hand I could use a stunt double
Somebody save me cause I'm gettin' into trouble
See I tired out your girl now all she wanna do is cuddle ha ha
I could get used to this cause you know we go and do this all the time
I walked up like excuse me miss you turnin' heads when you're lookin' so fine
Everybody gonna swoon

Out here the parties never end too soon
Happens every time I go and step up in the room
I do it like that so lemme see ya, lemme see ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
We could set it off make the bass go boom
Do it so fly I could take you to the moon
We gon' run it back so lemme see ya, lemme se ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
After all the drinks I consume party all night runnin' on fumes
Same clothes like I'm in the cartoons
Cause I went and did it hard from midnight till noon
Come around every time I sing a tune
All the girls are lookin' like Heidi Klum
Now everything I'm reppin is smellin' like perfume
And they do the same thing when I step up in the room
They swoon

Out here the parties never end too soon
Happens every time I go and step up in the room
I do it like that so lemme see ya, lemme see ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
We could set it off make the bass go boom
Do it so fly I could take you to the moon
We gon' run it back so lemme see ya, girl you gotta swoon
Out here the parties never end too soon
Happens every time I go and step up in the room
I do it like that so lemme see ya, lemme see ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
We could set it off make the bass go boom
Do it so fly I could take you to the moon
We gon' run it back so lemme see ya, lemme se ya swoon
Yeah lemme see ya swoon
Let me see ya swoon
Yeah let me see ya swoon
