I hear your heart beat, to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms, let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young

Ey they rap about, and I know they know this
I don't want to be dying on that winter solstice
But I know they gave a clue, like they killing Hostess
Drop it when we get it, oh you know we got the most is
Get it when I'm freeing here, knowing that I said again
When the world ends, we will be rocking out that R.E.M
If you pass the noise, won't you blast the noise
I'm fucking old school playing like those asteroids
Everything you're looking at, and you know I try the truth
And i've been killing bitches while I'm rocking in this booth
You know I'm trying, dying, no I'm never replying
They ending' all world on the calendar of the mayans
When they pick me on, I get that shit, no when I play
Best presidential speech, man I that from independence day
Looking on that shit, man, do it all alive
Looking up motherfucker, hope I don't die

I hear your heart beat, to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms, let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young
Like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

I'm a bad motherfucker like that dude professor Snape
If you get it when they spit, son, hold like Alan Rickman
Do it like that Harry Potter, man I do the dick man
If you won't get it i'll be sick and if you get it free
I don't know what that topic is about but i'll get in prime on top of me
War of the worlds why they dropping all these girls
I've been making noise on all you if you want to take it for L.A
For that ride I get him on my head, while I'm of my head
I'm rapping out and they kill this bitches while I'm on the dawn of dead
If you looking that ah, I know I taste ya
I'm riding rocking ships, like I'm Dr. Strangelove
Picking out this shit man I ain't done it for a minute
If you want it I'm looking at you, go and dive in it that's that
Like a heart attack, taking on cause you're part of that
Am I ending on this world like those motherfucking Mars Attacks!

I hear your heart beat, to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms, let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Hey yeah let me preach a lesson
Last one here bitches I Am Legend
Telling you where you go know you got the sorrow
Hang around forever like the day after tomorrow
If you see that way the city
I don't know if you fucking with me
I've been looking at that trouble but what sandy did to the city
If you needed what I getting on, do it like alive
I've been flowing like I get it cause I will survive
Come on!

I hear your heart beat, to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms, let's make the most of the night
