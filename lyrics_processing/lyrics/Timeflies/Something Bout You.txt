Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you

Okay, you showed up, almost with nice clothes
And tight clothes
Three girls, they strike in a nice pose
And you took a look around at the scene
Couple people here, all the sudden you lookin' at me
Then you took out your phone, looked at your friends
Tried to avoid eye contact, but it happened again
So then you walked over with your crew
Your other friends say, "You checkin' me out?"
"Oh no, I wasn't looking at you"
But her? Yes, girl on the left
Her cheeks turning bright red, just like her dress
I stand up, man up, can I get you a... (yes, yes)
Next step, time to impress
I'm from outside the city and damn you a bitty
I've been everywhere out from London to Chile
She tell me she visitin', I have been filling in
Loving your confidence, shut up and kiss me now
It's cold out and I got a spot down the street
Tell your friends that it's time to leave, let's go

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you
Woman

Press me 'gainst the elevator door
Lips lock, riding to the tippy, tippy-top floor
Then you, with your body lookin' like God bless
Push me on the bed, make me watch you get undressed
And you, you won't take your eyes off me
Hike your skirt a lil' bit, put your thighs on me
Oh you, baby, let it slide in deep
Let me be your rollercoaster, r-r-ride on me
Let me switch up the tempo, yup, I love your rhythms
Turn up your repetition and adrenaline drippin'
Cause it's lit tonight, up in the crib tonight
And they call me Cal Al, so you must be my kryptonite
She said that the truth is, "I don't normally do this"
But you just hit me with the lines, Confucius
Patron, limes, mixing all of the Gooses
But same time tonight, let's do this
Cause something 'bout you
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout you

There's somethin' 'bout you, babe
It's just somethin' 'bout you, babe
Woman
