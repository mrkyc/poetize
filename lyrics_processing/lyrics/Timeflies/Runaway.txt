Eyes closed, well I see
Why now? Why me?
Self doubt got me down again
Floating like a butterfly, sting like Ali
We plant the seeds, they be out of stock and bloom
'Cause everyone's a producer when they step into the room
And everyone's got opinions and everybody's a critic
And everyone tells you how it'd be different if they the one's who did it
But they didn't do it, I did it, you did it, we did it
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'll let you in for a minute
But look, don't touch, see the writing's on the wall
From the ones who came before, all the mighty who have fallen
We witness like Jehovas, H to the Izzo
Weight upon my shoulders, pain in the middle
So I stay here, waiting for a sign
And I hear the same voice start to echo in my mind

We could just run away, headed for fast cars and bright light
If you just follow me, let's explore and get lost in tonight
Don't hesitate, I could make you feel like you're alive
We could just run away, we could just run away

My biggest dream is my biggest fear
And I think it's by design
'Cause if we don't succeed at what we're trying to do
It's like we knew it would happen the whole time
It's opposite, it's like submarines and rocket ships
It's summits I've been scared to climb
My future me is on top of it
Calling down like you got this shit
Speechless, I stay talkative
Holding my breath for the last step
Oh man, if I could have done it over again
I'd do it different, I swear
As if we all have some road to follow like it's so apparent
I'm done caring, I want it, and if I want it, I take it
And if I take it, I hold it forever, don't be mistaken, no
One time, I'mma finish what I started
I'mma show you what could happen
I'm the apple in the garden
I'm the knowledge so forbidden
I'mma do now what I didn't
When the angels get to singing, I'mma finally start to listen
You might also like
We could just run away, headed for fast cars and bright light
If you just follow me, let's explore and get lost in tonight
Don't hesitate, I could make you feel like you're alive
We could just run away, we could just run away

I float in the stars now, what happens if I fall down?
Would you catch me, would you put me back together?
Don't you let me lose sight, what happens if it's too bright?
Would you tell me that nothing lasts forever?

We could just run away, headed for fast cars and bright light
If you just follow me, let's explore and get lost in tonight
Don't hesitate, I could make you feel like you're alive
