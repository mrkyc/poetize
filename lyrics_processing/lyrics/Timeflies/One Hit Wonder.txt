Maybe it's a vibe I give off
Maybe it's the reason I'm all stressed out
Maybe if I tried a little
Maybe I just can't help myself
Maybe this time is different
Then again maybe there's no one else
But I don't know why I didn't
Ever start tellin' you how I felt like
Fast forward, met her through a friend of a friend of a friend
Gettin' close, start talkin'
Fast forward, sat there at the bar 'til the end of the night
Then we both start walkin'
City was quiet and we turn on my street
She looked me dead in the eye
Like really cutting me deep
She said you talk a big game, time to show me
Before it got real then she told me

Said I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
That you just keep playin' again, playin' again, oh
Playin' again, playin' again, oh
I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
But if this is the one chance that I get
Then I'll be the one you never forget
You might also like
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, be your one hit wonder

I know I haven't been perfect, I know
You don't deserve it the way that we go
This ain't traditional, I'm on the road
Out of a suitcase and out of control
I keep on tellin' you things I think you wanna hear
But you want me here
And goddammit, it's like the minute you start pulling me close
Then you know that I'll disappear
And you think I lie to you, baby, look how I lie to myself
'Cause I feel the roof caving in, no I can't find a way out
Sometimes I feel like all this pressure's killing me
Look what it did to me, takin' the real in me
Something so wrong with this industry
I spend all this time out tryin' to make it
How could I not see
Should have know all along
It's not you, it's me

'Cause baby, I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
That you just keep playin' again, playin' again, oh
Playin' again, playin' again, oh
I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
But if this is the one chance that I get
Then I'll be the one you never forget
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, be your one hit wonder

I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
That you just keep playin' again, playin' again, oh
Playin' again, playin' again, oh
I don't wanna be your one hit wonder
But if this is the one chance that I get
Then I'll be the one you never forget

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna
