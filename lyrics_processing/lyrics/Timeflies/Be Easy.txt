I remember like it's yesterday
Back when I was west chest in May
Back when I was like 5ft5
And none of these girls was getting next to me
When my voice was high as I am now
When my nerves wouldn't let me on stage
I was cool but I never was a stand out
Shit look what I became
Rest is kicking it for old times like
We was way back in '09 look
Right back when we had Danny in the crew
And my mom came through, it was showtown
Saying live easy, look at this crowd
Five years out you gon' talk about now
Believe me, don't you ever look down
Keep your head up and feet on the ground

We got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana
But we got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana

I remember taking laps through the quad
Natty in the back of the Jeep with the squad
All the girls laying on our lawn while we're playing our song
Looking at us like 'oh my God'
Thinking man if we could just do that
If we could we get a song up on fresh new tracks
If Waldo doesn't call the cops
If 101 had blocks
If hotongue didn't get so packed
But Jerry and our peep we were hungry
And ever since they heard me free people love me
64 buzz deep on them rizzer beats
In the back seat of the town and country
No time for stress, I'm blessed, I confess
I'm pressed tryna turn all their no's into yes
I'm obsessed with being the best
Ain't no time for rest
I'ma turn lights checkmate into cash cheques

We got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana
But we got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana
We got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana
But we got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana

This is for the 156 and for 48-50
Rolling up spliffs 'cause all the dutches were gone
Back when we were just kids
Taking trains into the city
Singing nanananananana
Let 'em know

We got to be easy
Everything is alright
Got me feeling like nanananananana
But we got to be easy
Everything is alright
