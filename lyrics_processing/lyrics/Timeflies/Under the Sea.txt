When I came on this mic, yeah, you knew it happened
And when I stepped up in here and started rapping
Like at my shows when I see the hands, they clapping
Like when I'm under the sea chilling with Sebastian
Yeah, now the phone rings and who they calling?
Cause know that when I'm steppin' in, you know this dude is balling
But understand, like the hands you know they throwing up
Cause you understand them Disney Beats we never growing up
Yeah, and if you feel them, give me beats, I kill them
We can make on anything, you hit it with a steel drum
Shit, we out there killing it, don't know if you feeling it
Damn, I can do it from my mind, yes, I'm willing it
Uhh, and if you want it you take it home
Like I do with this microphone, yes, I'm in the zone
So you get it cause this is how it goes
And I know you can sing along cause this is how I flow, like

Under the sea (Yeah)
Under the sea (Yeah)

Yeah, coming up for air
I've been under the sea forever
Darling it's gotten better
Ever since we got together
In that moment when I started to dream
When I came on the stage
And ya'll started to scream
Like, this, see this the reason that we did it
We got too much to lose, to not go try and win it
I catch you on the flip side
I'll catch this life and flip it
And feed on this Timeflies
Ribbit
I'm in it, on it, did it, done it
And minus the additions to my life
I fucking love it
Yeah, I live it to the fullest
Ain't a minute that I let go
And we been doin' big like this
From the mothafucking get-go
Yeah, that's from the start, the arrival
Hold the antibiotics cause the videos are viral
So this is for the people cause we do this shit for you
Now, let's show them where these dreams come true

Just this time it seems that everything has changed
And we don't mind and nothing will ever be the same
Yeah, like I ain't did it in a minute
We are down on the floor you can go and hop in it
So come with me, I gotta show you
Baby let me take where you wanna go to
And that's...
