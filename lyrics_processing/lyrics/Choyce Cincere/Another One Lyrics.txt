It's your song repeat, its your song repeat
It's your song repeat

It's valentines day thirsty on a Tuesday
Frisk your body up free admission like a Friday
I make time, easy time, long time
Body get cranky I hit it cause it's your bedtime
Shawty love to bump Eric Bellinger
This gon' be your favorite song
Baby love the way that I turn her on
Guess she only one I'm focused on (focused on you baby)
We could hit a drive by, miss my exit
Too much good top girl you bless it
Girl the way that your body's been eyeing me
It's the same way your love's been craving
I know your last name is Errico
Well baby we can go taking it slow or whatever
I see them hitting up my woman (hitting up my woman)
If they ain't looking I don't want her (I don't want her)
I like to make these niggas jealous
R&B singer Jersey R&B reckless

Oh it's just interlude
The same nigga it ain't brand new
The same nigga it ain't brand new
It's just another interlude (interlude)
Same nigga it ain't brand new
Same nigga it ain't brand new
Ooh oh it's just another interlude (interlude)
Yeah yeah
You might also like
Say you looking for a lover well say say it
Girl you know I'll be here, yes I'll be here
I wanna smack it baby, I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna hear you say, I can get it lately
Baby you're so fucking fine
Nobody have to know
I really gotta show
What you're missing (what you're missing)

I wanna make you proud they haven't made you smiled for awhile
You got fake people showing fake love to you
They ain't in love with you
It's Valentine's Day
Baby I could roll with you
These niggas oh so basic they never wanna hear it
I'm too slight off from average these niggas never get it
They never wanna hear it
Shout to B Tiller
Feeling right self righteous
Too much good sauce that's how I left her body dressless
I'm bold to tell these bitches don't
If she with you why she calling on my phone
She's too busy she ain't picking up the phone
Lately I've been having too much with my goals
Shawties at my concert fighting over front rows
Keep the clouds up in air gas ain't never low
Grabbing on my belt like she was part of my designer
Telling former bosses they can't never get hire
My dick a long ride I gotta mag wit it
Too much weighing in she reloads on it
Ven a qui, that baby wanna work on it
Tra tra tra tra tra tra
Tienes que trajabar
Tra tra tra tra tra tra
Que yo lo vea, Trabajar
Hacen pal de dias

It's your song on repeat
It's your song on repeat
Oh it's just another interlude
Same nigga it ain't brand new
