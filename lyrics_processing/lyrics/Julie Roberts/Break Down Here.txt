Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pouring down
There's something smoking underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town

Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
You might also like
Baby, leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here
Oh, no...

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down
It's too late to turn around
I'd sure hate to break down here
