I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind
Hate to leave, my baby, but you treat me so unkind
I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind
Little girl, little girl, I got mean things all on my mind
Hate to leave you here, my baby, but you treats me so unkind
Runnin' down to the station, catch the first mail train I see
Runnin' down to the station, catch that old first mail train I see
I got the blues about Miss. So-and-So and her child got the blues about me
And I'm leavin' this mornin' with my arm fold up and cryin'
And I'm leavin' this mornin' with my arm fold up and cryin'
I hate to leave my baby but she treats me so unkind
I got mean things, I've got mean things on my mind
I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind
