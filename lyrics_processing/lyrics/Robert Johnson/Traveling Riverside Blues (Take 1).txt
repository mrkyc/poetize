If your man get personal, want you to have your fun

Come on back to Friar's Point, mama, and barrelhouse all night long

I got womens in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee
I got womens in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee
But my Friar's Point rider, now, hops all over me

I ain't gon' to state no color, but her front teeth is crowned with gold
I ain't gon' to state no color, but her front teeth crowned with gold
She got a lean on my body, now, mark is on my soul

I'm going to Rosedale, gon' take my rider by my side
Lord, I'm going to Rosedale, gon' take my rider by my side
We goin' to barrelhouse all night long, 'cause it's on the riverside

Now you can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my leg
