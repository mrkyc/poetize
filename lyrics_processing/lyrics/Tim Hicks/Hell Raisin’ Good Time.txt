Learned at college, bout booze and girls
Little money, big dreams and we hit the ground
Runnin' to the big bad world
Jump in head first, take the fast lane
If ya know what I'm sayin'
Lemme hear ya say
Yeah "yeah", yeah "yeah"
When it comes to livin' life
If it ain't broke, we gonna break it
If it ain't took, we gonna take it
If it ain't got, we gonna get it tonight
If it ain't sung, we gonna sing it
If it ain't drunk, we gonna drink it
We're hellbent on a hell raisin' good time
Don't worry bout what we did yesterday
Don't care what tomorrow's gonna bring
Right here, right now's where were gonna stay
So come on, if you're with me
