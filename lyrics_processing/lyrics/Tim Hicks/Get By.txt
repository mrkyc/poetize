She likes to smoke
They like to preach about things they don't know
He likes honky-tonk, she loves rock'n'roll (Rock'n'roll)
I like Chevy
She likes Ford
I'm automatic, shes a 4 on the floor
So who's to say what's wrong, what's right
So just do whatcha gotta do, cha' gotta do to get by
Everybody does a little something too much
Puttin' one to many down
Or lightin' one more up
Everybody loves to point their fingers and judge
But who are we to play God
And say "thats too much"
Hey
I like to drink
She likes to smoke
They like to preach about things they don't know
He likes honky-tonk, she loves rock'n'roll
I like Chevy
She likes Ford
I'm automatic, shes a 4 on the floor
So who's to say what's wrong, what's right
Just do whatcha gotta do, cha' gotta do to get by
Everybody loves to have a little bit of fun
Well you can call it a sin or you can come on in
We're 'bout to get this party on
So raise your glass to the workin' class
Don't worry 'bout right or wrong
Man, kick up the band, clap your hands
C'mon, sing along
