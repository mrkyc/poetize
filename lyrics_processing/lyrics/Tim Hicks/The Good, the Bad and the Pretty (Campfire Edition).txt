Somebody's name on a bathroom stall
We're full on Friday nights
And we got all kinds of kinds
Beer drinkin' boys on a softball team
Dolled up girls with fake IDs
One redneck lookin' to fight
And they're all here all night
Yeah, we're all the same but we're different
We're all just live and let livin'
Just a little ways out of the city
We're the good, the bad, and the pretty
We all need somethin' to sip and
A jar we can throw a little tip in
Tell the band, hey play Nitty Gritty
For the good, the bad, and the pretty
We're the good, the bad, and the pretty
Biker vests and business suits
Fresh hightops and old farm boots
They're all hangin' round
Cause it's the only bar in town
Drop dead legs in a little black dress
Pink lipstick on cigarettes
Only get two nights a week
To blow off all the steam

To go all night
We're all alright
