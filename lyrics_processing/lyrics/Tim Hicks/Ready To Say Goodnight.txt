Eleven thirty, got my suitcase packed
Sleep now, and there's no turning back
It's alright, we'll stay up all night
I wish I didn't have to leave so soon
Slip out of this bed without waking you
But it's alright, we'll stay up all night

As the moonlight fades
We got someplace to go
Down a long long lonely road

I ain't ready to say goodnight
I ain't ready to say goodbye
I ain't ready to watch the sun come up
Without you, without you
I ain't ready to shut it down
I ain't ready to hear the sound of the morning rain on the windshield as I roll out
Without you, without you

Six thirty, you'd be long gone
I hold you close 'til the morning comes
It's alright, we'll stay up all night
Let's spare all the tears that we got left
Saving more for tomorrow when we're awake
Babe, it's alright, we can stay up all night
You might also like
When the moonlight fades
And you're walking out that door
Down that long long lonely road

I ain't ready to say goodnight
I ain't ready to say goodbye
I ain't ready to watch the sun come up
Without you, without you
I ain't ready to shut it down
I ain't ready to hear the sound of the morning rain on the windshield as I roll out
Without you, without you
No I ain't, I ain't ready
No I ain't, I ain't ready
No I ain't, I ain't ready to say goodbye

Yeah I just wanna hold you close
And never let you go
Oh and I'll be waiting for you
When you get home

I ain't ready to say goodnight
I ain't ready to say goodbye
I ain't ready to watch the sun come up
Without you, without you
I ain't ready to shut it down
I ain't ready to hear the sound of the morning rain on the windshield as I roll out
Without you, without you
No I ain't, I ain't ready
No I ain't, I ain't ready
No I ain't, I ain't ready to say goodbye
No I ain't, I ain't ready
No I ain't, I ain't ready
