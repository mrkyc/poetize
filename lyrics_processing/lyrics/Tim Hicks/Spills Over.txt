It don't matter if it's been a minute
I run into you and we're right back in it
At a hole in the wall or a velvet rope downtown
We pretend like we can stop, girl
But when we fill it up to the top, girl
We know that we're gonna go for one more round

We always pour it on way too strong
Always wanna play one more song
Always wanna stay way too long
Baby, so much for clean break sober
'Cause it spills over when we order last call shots
Spills over to the cab in the parkin' lot
Then it's your place or mine, your hair fallin' on my shoulder
Every time that it spills over (It spills over, it spills over)

Clothes on the floor and the vinyl turnin'
Whiskey kisses and the candles burnin'
Black label bottle passed out by the door

Yeah, we always pour it on way too strong
Always wanna play one more song
Always wanna stay way too long
Baby, so much for clean break sober
'Cause it spills over when we order last call shots
Spills over to the cab in the parkin' lot
Then it's your place or mine, your hair fallin' on my shoulder
Every time that it spills over
It spills over (It spills over)
You might also like
Girl, we're a habit that we both can't kick
We sure make a mess of this callin' it quits

We always pour it on way too strong
Always wanna play one more song
Always wanna stay way too long
Baby, so much for clean break sober
'Cause it spills over when we order last call shots
Spills over to the cab in the parkin' lot
Then it's your place or mine, your hair fallin' on my shoulder
Every time that it spills over (It spills over)
Yeah, over and over and over and over (It spills over)
