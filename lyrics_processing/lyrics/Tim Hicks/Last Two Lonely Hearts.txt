I see you sittin' in a corner booth
I saw you sittin' there last night too
Drinkin' whiskey for one at a table for two
Swayin' when the band played a sad song
Me, yeah I been in love before
I watched a few walk out my door
Started comin' in here 'stead of walkin' the floor
'cause sometimes ain't the night too long

Girl don't it feel like everybody in here's in love
Everybody in here but us
I don't know about you
But I wanna know what it would feel like
To hold you for a song or two
Maybe kiss you in a crowded room
Like there's no one else around
But the last two lonely hearts in this town

I'm gettin' over somebody's goodbye
I see the same pain in your eyes
But we could lean on each other tonight
I was hopin' I could buy you a cold beer
A lot of couples on that ol' dance floor
Bet they got room for just one more
I know it ain't what we came here for
But there's somethin' going on here
You might also like
Girl don't it feel like everybody in here's in love
Everybody in here but us
I don't know about you
But I wanna know what it would feel like
To hold you for a song or two
Maybe kiss you in a crowded room
Like there's no one else around
But the last two lonely hearts in this town, yeah

Yeah, don't it feel like everybody in here's in love
Everybody in here but us
I don't know about you
But I wanna know what it would feel like
To hold you for a song or two
Maybe kiss you in a crowded room
Like there's no one else around
But the last two lonely hearts in this town

Woah
The last two lonely hearts
