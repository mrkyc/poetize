I'm sweating like a dog need to find a way
To cool off get out of this heat
Find a little water for my barefeet
So c'mon girl and grab your shades
Turn off your phone you don't need it today
Yeah the sky couldn't be more blue
Yeah there's only one thing to do
Dive in a pool jump in a creek
You and me baby we been waiting all week
Fly to the beach drive to the lake
Hell hook up the hose do whatever it takes
No o oh
No the sun couldn't get no hotter
So let's take a little bit of you
Take a little bit of me and just add water
It don't feel like summer time busting our butts working nine to nine
All work and not enough play don't think we could take another day
We both know how hot it can get well it's about time we got wet
Yeah the water couldn't be more blue
Yeah so how about me and you
Dive in a pool jump in a creek
You and me baby we been waiting all week
Fly to the beach drive to the lake
Hell hook up the hose do whatever it takes
No o oh
No the sun couldn't get no hotter
So lets take a little bit of you
Take a little of me and just add water
I'll throw a little beer on ice
You throw on a bikini I like
Baby it's long over due
Me and you lets find something to dive into
Dive in a pool jump in a creek
You and me baby we been waiting all week
Fly to the beach drive to the lake
Hell hook up the hose do whatever it takes
No o oh
No the sun couldn't get no hotter
So let's take a little bit of fun
Take a little heat take a little sand underneath our feet
