Down the road, there's a hard-working dad
Rolling eighteen wheels burning daylight and gasoline
Downtown there's a lonely little girl
Who's never seen herself on the cover of a magazine
Don't got much, but to keep on swinging
 till the bell starts ringing
Stand up, we gonna shock the world

To all the lovers, the fighters, the sinners, the beggars
This is for the underdogs
To all the boys and the girls
The freaks of the world
Who are never tired of giving up
To all the fire'ers and the liars in the gray big suits
You ain't got nothing on us
From the east to the west
The worst to the best
This is for the
Oh, this is for the underdogs
Yeah, this is for the underdogs

Edge of town, there's a skinny little kid
Heart of gold, but the coach says he'll never make the big leagues
Onstage, there's a four-piece band playing classic rock covers
Ain't a single person listening
They try to tell you that you're never gonna make it
I'm here to tell you that you don't have to take it
Don't back down, we gonna shock the world ( We gonna shock the world)
