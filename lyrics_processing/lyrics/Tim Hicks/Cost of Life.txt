Curve balls, fast balls
Long shots, close calls
If you're in the game, you'll dang sure see it all
Lowest of lows, highest of highs
Taste the dirt and touch the sky
Dodge a few and take one or two on the jaw

That's the cost of life when you're goin' for broke
Stay on the ground like it ain't no joke
Make your own bed and make your own luck
Get knocked down, you get right back up
You might find yourself goin' through hell
For a little bit of heaven down the road
That's the cost of life
When you're goin' for broke

To make it right, to prove 'em wrong
Dance your dance, sing your song
Gotta be tough, gotta be strong
There'll be sticks and there'll be stones

That's the cost of life when you're goin' for broke
Stay on the ground like it ain't no joke
Make your own bed and make your own luck
Get knocked down, you get right back up
You might find yourself goin' through hell
For a little bit of heaven down the road
That's the cost of life
When you're goin' for broke
You might also like
Go all in, all out
Burn up a road less rode down
Keep those headlights glory-bound
Come on, come on, here we go now

That's the cost of life when you're goin' for broke
Stay on the ground like it ain't no joke
Make your own bed and make your own luck
Get knocked down, you get right back up
You might find yourself goin' through hell
For a little bit of heaven down the road
That's the cost of life
Yeah, when you're goin' for broke (Life)
When you're goin' for broke
When you're goin' for broke (Life)

That's the cost of life, yeah
