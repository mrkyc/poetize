Like a lime on black that one with the lift kit
No massive hummer, can't miss it
You smoke em out every time you ran it (so do I)
You like to put a little party in a plastic cup
Sipping little but you must have raised it up
You chase that Jack till you catch a buzz (so do I)

You like to get a little crazy with your Friday nights
Want to make it go boom like dynamite
Go off, sky-high, c'mon, so do I
You like to shake it up, drink it up, turn it to ten
Burn it down to the ground, then do it again
Go lose your mind, get loose, so do I

See you like breathing that country air
And you like my fingers running through your hair
Well that's two more things we got in common (so do I)
You want to find a dark spot where we can park this thing
You wanna slide it on over and rock this thing
You wanna roll the window down and listen to the river sing (so do I)

You like to get a little crazy with your Friday nights
Want to make it go boom like dynamite
Go off, sky-high, c'mon, so do I
You like to shake it up, drink it up, turn it to ten
Burn it down to the ground, then do it again
Go lose your mind, get loose, so do I
So do I
