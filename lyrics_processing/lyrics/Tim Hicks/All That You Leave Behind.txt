You love rollin' like a tumbleweed
Can't stay in one place too long
You got a restless heart, always talkin 'bout you leavin'
Don't get hung up on hangin' 'round
Cause you're too damn good at gone
Go chase that greener grass and keep on dreamin'

I'll find you driftin' like a cloud of smoke
Somewhere down the road

So you go ride, you go run
Head out west into that settin' sun
You go fly, go be free
Go be anywhere you wanna be
Broken white lines, no stop signs
Better go before you change your mind
No regrets, just don't forget
All that you leave behind

May the desert stars shine down on you
May the moon light up your smile
Don't waste your time 'round here another minute
Go burn right through this rearview town
And the next one in ninety miles
Hey life's a trip, get a beat up truck, and jump in it
You might also like
Yeah, you go ride, you go run
Head out west into that settin' sun
You go fly, go be free
Go be anywhere you wanna be
Broken white lines, no stop signs
Better go before you change your mind
No regrets, just don't forget
All that you leave behind

Aye, all that you leave behind

You go ride, you go run
Go west into that settin' sun
You go fly, go be free
Be anywhere you wanna be
You go ride, you go run
Go west into that settin' sun
You go fly, go be free

Yeah, you go ride, you go run
Head out west into that settin' sun
You go fly, go be free
Go be anywhere you wanna be
Broken white lines, no stop signs
Better go before you change your mind
No regrets, just don't forget
All that you leave behind
So no regrets
Don't forget
