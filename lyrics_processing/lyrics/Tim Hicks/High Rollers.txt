Paycheck burnin' up a hole in my jeans
Overtime grind ain't got nothin' on me
Goin' all in, baby, every dollar, every cent
Put it all on black, yeah, we'll paint the town red
Ballin' like we're big-time, sippin' on fine wine
We fake it and fake it until we're on our last dime
Got my mind on my money, got my money on my mind
They said it won't buy you happiness, but baby, that's a lie

Tonight, we're high rollers, money in the bank
Cash in my pocket and premium in the tank
Yeah, we're high rollers, got expensive taste
Fifty-dollar shots, hundred-dollar champagne
Gonna spend it all, gonna do it up right
It ain't all the time, nah, just for the night
Yeah, we're high rollers
Hi-hi-high rollers

We ain't waitin' on nothing, girl, I got us on the list
Gonna live it up large like we're stars, like we're rich
Five star, caviar, credit's maxed out
From the black car, valet park, to the penthouse
Goin' Twitter-famous, selfies like we're shameless
We take it and take it until it looks just right
You're a perfect ten, girl, I'm dressed up to the nines
We're blowin' up Facebook, forty-seven likes

Stackin' twenties on fifties on hundred dollar bills
Throw it on the tab, drink up and refill
Stacking twenties on fifties on hundred dollar bills
I'll pick up the tab, drink up and refill

Yeah, we're high rollers
Hi-hi-high
