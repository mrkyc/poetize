If they don't make ya think
If they don't get you sober
It better make you drink
Yeah it's what you drive to, cry to
Make you feel alive to
When you got nothing left to lose
If they don't get you laughing
Or break your heart in two
That's what a song should do
It should make you go hell yeah, me too
Yeah, that's what a song should do
It should make you feel alright, all night
 and the truth, that's what a song should do
It's that old record your daddy used to play
It's that first dance on your wedding day
Yeah, it should shape you, change you
Break you down and break through
Like you got nothing left to prove
Worthy of words on your tattoo
That's what a song should do
It should make you go hell yeah, me too
Yeah, that's what a song should do
It should make you feel alright, all night
 and the truth, that's what a song should do
It should make you feel alright, all night
With four chords and the truth
You might also likeYeah it should be the soundtrack singing every moment of your life
The beat that'll keep you wide awake till the sunrise

(Whoa-whoa, whoa-oh)
That's what a song should do
That's what a song should do

So what keeps it going
What puts that flicker in your flame
And when your candle burns out
What song they gonna play
What song they gonna play
It should make you go hell yeah, me too
Yeah, that's what a song should do, whoa
