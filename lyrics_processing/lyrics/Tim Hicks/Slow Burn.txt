All dolled up, little black dress, little high heels on
Hot as hell, she's a girl just wanna have fun
With her sweet talking, jaw dropping, show stopping waist
Boot stomping, shout calling, straight up no chase

Let it burn burn burn burn
Let it burn burn burn for days

Keep you up she'll make you work in the middle of the night
Yeah, I don't know how she do it
But I know it feels right
Like whiskey goin' down she's the hit that gets you high
And she's gone before you even know it hurts

She's a slow, slow, slow burn
She's a slow, slow, slow burn

Takes her sweet, sweet time to get where she needs to go
She won't ask twice, 'cause she knows that I can't say no
She's a live wire, good liar, doesn't have she don't
A midnighter, lit lighter, let's hand it smoke
You might also like
Let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Let it burn, burn, burn 'till it's gone

Keep you up she'll make you work in the middle of the night
Yeah, I don't know how she do it
But I know it feels right
Like whiskey goin' down she's the hit that gets you high
And she's gone before you even know it hurts

She's a slow slow slow burn
She's a slow slow slow burn


Let it burn burn burn for days
Let it burn burn burn for days
Let it all go up in flames
Let it burn burn burn for days
Let it burn burn burn for days
Let it burn burn burn for days
Let it all go up in flames
Yeah yeah
Keep you up she'll make you work in the middle of the night
Yeah, I don't know how she do it
But I know it feels right
Like whiskey goin' down she's the hit that gets you high
And she's gone before you even know it hurts

She's a slow slow slow burn
She's a slow slow slow burn
She's a slow slow slow burn
