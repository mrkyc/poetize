I was on a beach somewhere
Ice cream runnin' down my hand
I was on my daddy's shoulders
When he was still Superman
Mama with a birthday cake
Blowin' out her "29"
Back when she had more years ahead of her
Than she had behind

If I could talk to time
I'd say, "Why you always flyin'?"
You say you're on my side
But you ain't no friend of mine
You don't do second chances
You don't like lookin' back
I blame it all on you
But it's me who's losin' track

Wish I could put you in a bottle
Wish I could hold you in my hand
Wish you would just slow down, slow down
But you don't give a damn
You might also like
Drinkin' in a parking lot
God, we thought that we were cool
Back when we believed that home was somethin'
We could always come back to
Then it was graduation day
We were on a football field
We were beggin' you to just speed up
Why couldn't you have just stood still?

If I could talk to time
I'd say, "Why you always flyin'?"
You say you're on my side
But you ain't no friend of mine
You don't do second chances
You don't like lookin' back
I blame it all on you
But it's me who's losin' track

Wish I could put you in a bottle
Wish I could hold you in my hand
Wish you would just slow down, slow down
But you don't give a damn
She was every perfect kiss
She was everything I loved
But you just couldn't help yourself
You had to go run out on us

If I could talk to time
I'd say, "Why you always flyin'?"
You say you're on my side
But you ain't no friend of mine
You don't do second chances
You don't like lookin' back
I blame it all on you
But it's me who's losin' track

Wish I could put you in a bottle
Wish I could hold you in my hand
Wish you would just slow down, slow down
But you don't give a damn
