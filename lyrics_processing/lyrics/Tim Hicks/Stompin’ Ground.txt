Sixteen and a six pack
Twenty bucks and a shouler tap
Gotcha too far gone to get back
Man, we were cool with that
Cuttin' class tryin' to duck our teachers
Bummin' smokes out behind the bleachers
Friday drive-in double feature
Took my girl and we didn't watch either

My stompin' ground
Where we got laid, where we got loud
Yeah, homegrown hometown proud
My crowd
Whoah, my stompin' ground
Only one road in and out
Wheels roll up, boots touch down
My town
Whoah, my stompin' ground

Around here there ain't no cops
We did alot of donuts in parking lots
To young to know when to stop
But we never got caught, no
If your parents went away for the weekend
Party at your place. What time they leavin'
Keep this  Blowin' up the speakers
Back pack of beer, better throw em in the freezer
