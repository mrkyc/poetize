One, two, three

Wish I could turn back time like an old cassette rewinds with a tooth marked pencil
When we were hands free out the window of that '89 Continental
Waiting all night long for that one song so we could press "Record"
We had summer nights and dashboard lights, yeah, we were never bored

I miss old payphones and gravel roads
In my best friend's Dad's old Chevy
I miss campfire smoke and cards in spokes
And twelve CDs for a penny
Time moves on and I guess I ain't ready
I miss Tom Petty

Piles of photographs and ticket halves in a shoebox in the closet
Full of souvenirs from long gone years, man, I thought I lost it
I used to know my way around this town but the streets don't look the same
They're an echo of what used to be like the way she said my name

I miss old pay phones and gravel roads
In my best friend's Dad's old Chevy
I miss campfire smoke, and cards in spokes
And twelve CDs for a penny
Time moves on and I guess I ain't ready
Yeah I miss Tom Petty
You might also like
Now I'm free
Fallin' down in a memory
I can't see
Any place I'd rather be

I miss old pay phones and gravel roads
In my best friend's Dad's old Chevy
I miss campfire smoke, and cards in spokes
And twelve CDs for a penny
Time moves on, I guess I ain't ready
Yeah
I miss old pay phones and gravel roads
In my best friend's Dad's old Chevy
I miss campfire smoke, and cards in spokes
And 12 CDs for a penny
Time moves on, I guess I ain't ready

And I won't back down even when the world gets heavy
I miss Tom Petty
