Hey here's to Sidler, back in seventy-six
He sent the reds packing with a flick of a wrist
And here's to Akral, handy and short
Hell I don't know who's funnier, y'all or Rod Ford

We've all been waiting since ninety-three
Here's to stomping tom, may he rest in peace
Everybody raise a glass and drink with me

So come on, do your thing
Everybody sing this drink-along
