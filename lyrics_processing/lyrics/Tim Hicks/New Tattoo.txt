I need a new tattoo
Something sexy, something dangerous
Something that's gonna make me think about us
I wanna feel that rush

I need a new kinda thrill
Something to get my mind outta my head
Something to give my heart a-thumping again
I might need too much
I need a new tattoo

I wanna feel like a new man
Like the first time you were holding my hand
Oh, after everything we've been through
I need a new tattoo
I wanna feel a little reckless
A little something that'll leave me breathless
Oh, I wanna feel like when I met you

I want a new tattoo
Something I know will always be with me
Something I couldn't lose so easily
Like I did with you
I need a new tattoo
You might also like
I wanna feel like a new man
Like the first time you were holding my hand
Oh, after everything we've been through
I need a new tattoo
I wanna feel a little reckless
A little something that'll leave me breathless
Oh, I wanna feel like when I met you
Oh, I need a new tattoo
Yeah!

I need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
I do, I do, I need a new tattoo

I wanna feel like a new man
Like the first time you were holding my hand
Oh, after everything we've been through
Yeah, I need a new tattoo
I wanna feel a little reckless
A little something that'll leave me breathless
Oh, I wanna feel like when I met you
Oh, I need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
I do, I do need a new tattoo
