Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced, but in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way

My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, my way, my way

Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced, but in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
