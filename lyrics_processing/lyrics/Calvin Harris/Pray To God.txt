Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And, oh, I lost the feeling, but I try to hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been layin' on the floor, sleepin' on the ground
I would give up everything in life I'd know how

'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was
Too late to see the signs
If I could go back, with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it to you, give it to you

Oh, when the moon was shinin' bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound

'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was
Too late to see the signs
If I could go back, with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it to you, give it to you

Can't hold back, reachin' out
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give it
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give it
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give it
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give it to you, give it to you

I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it to you, give it to you
I'd give it
I'd give it
I'd give it
