"Counterfeit, counterfeit," that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this end amicably
Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, "What do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be
(You want it to be)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

Coming back, coming back to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
(You fall out of view)
