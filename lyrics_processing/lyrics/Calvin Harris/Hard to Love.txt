(Oh, woah-woah)

I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a fiend
But then I pull out and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom"
(Woah-woah)

I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Oh, baby, I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (Listen)
I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (Yeah)

'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen (Oh, woah-woah)
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom
