Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'

Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else (Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself, ay (Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby

I'm not gon' act like I don't love you, baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (True)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (No)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (Yeah)
I 'member all of them times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Oh, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (Yeah)
Had to get counseling from my moms, she's a heartbreak teacher (Oh yeah)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face, made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, oh-oh-oh
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it? (Why you, why you, why you, why you?)
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it? (Holdin' it)
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it? (Over it)
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it? (It, yeah)
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby (Yeah)
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby (Oh)

Why you holdin' me?
