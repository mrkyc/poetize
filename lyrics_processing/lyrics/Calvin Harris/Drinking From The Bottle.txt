I-I-I-I-I-I-I could pay for everything that's on you (Yeah)
So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass, just bottles
And I'm buying everybody one each

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)

If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe

Just keep the bottles coming all night

D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito

We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
