Oh, say do you
See what I see?
Congress sitting here in sweet serenity
I could cheer
The reason's clear
For the first time in a year
Adams isn't here
And look
The sun is in the sky
A breeze is blowing by
And there's not a single fly
I sing Hosanna, Hosanna

Hosanna, Hosanna

And it's cool
Come ye cool, cool conservative men
Our like may never ever been seen again
We have land, cash in hand
Self-command, future planned
Fortune thrives, society survives
In neatly ordered lives
With well-endowered wives
You might also like
Come sing
Hosanna, Hosanna

In our breeding and our manner

We are cool

Come ye cool, cool considerate set
We'll dance together to the same minuet
To the right, ever to the right
Never to the left, forever to the right
Let our creed
Be never to exceed
Regulated speed
No matter what the need

Come sing
Hosanna, Hosanna

Emblazoned on our banner
Is "keep cool"
What we do
We do rationally

We never, ever go off half-cocked
Not we

Why begin
'Till we know that we can win?

And if we cannot win
Why bother to begin?

We say this game's not of our choosing
Why should we risk losing?

We cool, cool men

Mr. Hancock, you're a man of property. One of us. Why don't you join us in our minuet? Why do you persist on dancing with Mr. Adams? Good Lord, sir! You don't even like him!
That is true
He annoys me quite a lot
But still, I'd rather trot
To Mr. Adams' new gavotte

But why, sir? For personal glory? For a... place in history? Be careful, sir. History will brand Mr. Adams and his followers as traitors

Traitors, Mr. Dickinson? To what? The British crown? Or the British half-crown? Fortunately, there are not enough men of property in America to dictate policy

Well, perhaps not. But don't forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor. And that is why they will follow us!

To the right, ever to the right
Never to the left, forever to the right
Where there's gold
A market that will hold
Tradition that is old
Reluctant to be bold

I sing Hosanna, Hosanna
In a sane and lucid manner!
We are cool...

We're the cool, cool considerate men
Whose like may never, ever be seen again
With our land, cash in hand
Self-command, future planned
And we'll hold to our gold
Tradition that is old
Reluctant to be bold
We say this game's not of our choosing
Why should we risk losing?
We cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool
Cool
