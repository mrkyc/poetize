(Ooh my love)

In the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
Well you used to love to be behind those walls with her
Within these walls
Well, he watched from the corridor
Watched from the corner of his eyes
Seemingly waiting for the time
When the castle walls would all fall down

Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?

In the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
In this land or in that land
Well the castles all seem to belong to her
And all this talk about love and hate
And our separation way on down the line
Well, they just can't wait, can they?
No, they just can't wait

Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?

There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber
Where they spent all their time, well
There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber door
Where they seemed to spend all their time

Ooh my love
Ooh my love
Ooh my love

Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yes, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh, but there was a time when he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yeah, it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Hey, hey, baby
No one can take you away from me, no, no one
