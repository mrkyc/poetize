Some call her strange
Lady from the mountains
And others say she's not really real
Like a candle burns bright
Wants to burn faster
But maybe then at least
She really feels
Burning like the candle in the middle

She's lonely, lost
She's disconnected
She finds no comfort
In her surroundings
Beautiful, insecure
She has nothing
She moves from situation to situation
Like a ghost
Then she sees him
A candle burning

Strange
She runs with the one she can't keep up with
Ooh, it's so strange
He slows down
He's so desperate to stop her
Meet her in the middle
They both run from the one who hunts them
And they drop to the forest floor frozen
They drop to the forest floor frozen

He loves her
But he needs his life alone as well
But does he know
The road or the reasons why
If he leaves her
He'll be losing the chance
To stay alive
But the candle burns bright
Then the candle dies
Burning from the middle
Just like a candle

Strange
She runs with the one she can't keep up with
Ooh, it's so strange
He slows down
He's so desperate to stop her
And they meet in the middle
They both run from the one who hunts them
They drop to the forest floor frozen
They drop to the forest floor frozen

Strange
She's laid on the floor in silent pain
Strange
He sat in a chair for months just staring
Strange
She knows too much to walk away
Strange
She couldn't do it anyway
Strange
She's laid on the floor in silent pain
Strange
He sat in a chair for months just staring
She knows too much to walk away
She couldn't do it anyway
He slows down
He slows down
He slows down
She couldn't do it
She couldn't do it
