In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
This maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love... and be loved... by me
She was a child and I was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
We loved with a love that was more than a love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged angels of heaven
They coveted her, and me
And the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
The angels not half so happy in heaven
When envying her and me
That was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
The wind came out of the cloud that night
Killing my, my Annabel Lee

Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
But our love was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
I lie down... by the side of my darling
My life, my life and my bride
I lie down... by her side
I lie down by her side, my darling
My life, my life and my bride
I lie down... by her side
I lie down
By her side
I lie down
By the side
Oh I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
And my bride
I lie down
Ooooohhh
I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
And my bride
I lie down
Oooh
I lie down
I lie down
Oooh
