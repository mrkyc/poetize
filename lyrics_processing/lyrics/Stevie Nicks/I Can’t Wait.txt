I can't wait
How will I love you?
(I can't wait, I can't wait)

Sometime she talks to him
Sometimes while she's only dreaming
Then when she wakes up
Somehow, well, she still believes him

Yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
Yes, I know you
To be continued, it's too much, well

I can't wait, I can't wait
Well, if I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
Well, yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
What can I do when I'm crazy for you
See Stevie Nicks LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like
She wonders how many more hours
Her heart will feel broken
In secret she says she needs to see him
But no words are spoken

Well, she dances around in a circle
Well, she's got that feeling now
Blame it on something at first sight
Put the blame on me if you want to
To be continued

I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, now baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
What can I do when I'm crazy for you, baby?
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
If I'm wasting my time, make up your mind, baby

How will I love you?
How will I love you?
I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
Wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
How will I love you?
