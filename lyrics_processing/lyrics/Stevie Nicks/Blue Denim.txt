Saw him the other day
Saw him again, yesterday
I wonder if I'll ever see him again
He reminded me of blue denim

Blue-gray eyes, they change with the color
Change with the sun, they run with the sight
Change with the wind, but they're always bright
Bright eyes, blue denim
Bright eyes, blue denim

I knew him another way
I knew him another day
In some ways he'd forgotten me
In many ways he got to me
I turned away so he couldn't see
I turned away, it could never be

I never thought he could walk away
But I lost him again, yesterday

Blue-gray eyes, they change with the color
Change with the sun, they run with the sight
Change with the wind, but they're always bright
Bright eyes, blue denim
Bright eyes, blue denim

Understanding me
Understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do
Understanding me
And understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do

And I will never forget
The last time I saw you
Like a photograph so rare
Ooh, like a painting
No, I will never forget
The last time I saw you

Never to be, not you, not me
No, no

Blue-gray eyes, they change with the color
Change with the sun, they run with the sight
Change with the wind, but they're always bright
Bright eyes, blue denim
Bright eyes, blue denim
So I'm going away for a little while
To remember how to feel
And if I find the answer,I promise you
I'll come back and get you
Where as I'm going away for a little while
To remember how to feel
And if I find the answer, I promise you
I'll come back and get you
And if I find the answer, I promise you
I'll come back and get you
I'll come back and get you
I'll come back and get you
