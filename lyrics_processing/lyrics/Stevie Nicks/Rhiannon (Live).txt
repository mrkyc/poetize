And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Oh would you even try?
He says, "Rhiannon"
"Don't go"
And he says "Rhiannon"
"Stay"
And he says "I Still cry out for you"
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and
Won't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the sky
Where would you stay if she promised to you heaven
Would you even try?

And the she is your darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years you meet a lady like her rises
Oh no rhiannon you cry, and then she's gone
And your life well it knows no answer
And your life knows no answer
