Ooh, hoo-hoo

You've been holdin' back the tears
From all the hurt that you've been through, girl
You said he stole your heart away
But I can't tell you what to do, no

(No more) No more
(Sad songs) Sad songs
No more reminiscin'
It's time for new beginnin's
(Down for) Down for
(Too long) Too long
There'll be no more cryin'
If you come to me, and let me

Love all the hurt away
I'll make it so much better
Love all the hurt away
I give my heart to you
Let's be more than friends, let our love begin
Oh, girl, we'll love the hurt away, away

Hoo, hoo-hoo

It's time for someone in your life
You don't have to be alone anymore
It's time you open up your eyes
And see just what it is you're livin' for

(No more) No more
(Heartache) Heartache
No more reminiscin'
Think of what you're missin'
(Never) Never
(Too late) Too late
The second time will be much better
Baby, you and I together can

Love all the hurt away
There'll be no more cryin'
Love all the hurt away
I'm waitin' here for you
Let's be more than friends, let our love begin
Oh, girl, we'll love the hurt away, away

Baby, let me love all the hurt away (Love all the hurt away)
I'll make it so much better
Love all the hurt away
I give my love to you
Let's be more than friends, let our love begin
Oh, girl, we'll love the hurt away, away, yeah
Let's be more than friends, let our love begin
Oh, girl, we'll love the hurt away, away, yeah
Let's be more than friends, let our love begin
Oh, girl, we'll love the hurt away, away

I'll love the hurt away, there'll be a brighter day
I'll hurt the hurt away
(I know that once you start) You'll have a change of heart
(I'll love the hurt away) I'll love all the hurt away
Much stronger than before, no one could love you more
I'll love the hurt away
We'll take it to the top, we'll never, never stop
I'll love the hurt away, away
