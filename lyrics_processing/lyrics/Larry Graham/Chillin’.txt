Chillin', chillin'
Chillin'
Oh, chillin', chillin'
Chillin'

Life has a way of passin' by so fast
Let's spend some time together
If our relationship is gonna last
Let's steal away, away

Every day when we're apart, I just think of you
Weekend comes we know what we're gonna do

We'll be chillin', down by the bay (Chillin'), my time of day
(Chillin') Layin' in the sand, hand in hand
(Oh, chillin') Down at Venice beach (Chillin'), I'm out of reach
(Chillin') I can't hear no phones, 'til we get home
(Chillin') Just me and you (Chillin'), doin' what we do
Chillin', how sweet it is, it feels so good when we're
(Oh, chillin') Let's find the park (Chillin'), adjust the door
(Chillin') It don't matter much, as long as we touch
You might also like
Some people wait too long to figure out
They need some time together
But there are those who feel like you and I
Let's sail away, away

Every day when we're apart, I just think of you
Weekend comes we know what we're gonna do

We'll be (Chillin'), cruisin' in the car (Chillin'), maybe not too far
(Chillin') A drive in our car, we can go there
(Oh, chillin') Just anywhere (Chillin'), really, I don't care
(Chillin') What matters most, is when we get close, we'll be
(Chillin') Let's wine and dine (Chillin'), and then we'll find
(Chillin') A place to dance, it's part of romance, ooh
(Oh, chillin') Just chillin' out (Chillin'), without a doubt
(Chillin') It's the thing to do, especially with you, hoo

I treasure every moment
Spent with you
And every chance I get, girl
Here's what we'll do, hoo, hoo
(Chillin', chillin') Chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin'
(Oh, chillin') Chillin' (Chillin'), chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin' (Chillin'), chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin', hmm, hmm

(Oh, chillin') Down by the bay (Chillin'), my time of day
(Chillin') Layin' in the sand, hand in hand
(Oh, chillin') Down at Venice beach (Chillin'), I'm out of reach
(Chillin') I can't hear no phones, 'til I get home, oh

(Oh, chillin') Chillin' (Chillin'), chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin', hmm, hm
(Oh, chillin') Chillin' (Chillin'), I'm chillin'
(Chillin') Chillin', yeah, oh
