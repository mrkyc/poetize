I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't, can't stop
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't, can't stop

Everybody all over town, is talkin' 'bout a happenin' thing, ah
People ever is dancin', ah
And got this little song they sang, ah
I heard his first last Saturday night
I was walkin' down the street
I stepped on in the place, was jumpin'
And everyone was on their feet, and they was singin'

I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't, can't stop
Everyone was singin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't, can't stop

As I looked around, the first thing I found
Was everybody lookin' at me, ah
I really am not a shy kind of guy
So I thought I'd give 'em somethin' to see, ah
Jumped off in the middle of the crowd, ah
And started to do my thing, ah
Pretty soon, my heels were ringin'
'Cause everybody started to sing, and they were singin'

It wasn't long I learnt the song
Started singing at the top of my voice, ah
Things was movin' and people groovin'
Surprised that I ain't hoarse
We kept on dancin' 'til a quarter-to-three
And the man said, "Ya got to go, ah"
I didn't mind that we had to leave
We kept on singin' right on out the door, and we was singin'

I just can't stop dancin'
Everyone was singin'
I just can't, can't stop
People had me singin'
I just can't stop dancin'
Woo-wee, woah, can't
I just can't, can't stop
Everyone was singin'
I just can't stop dancin'
Sing on, sing on, sing on
I just can't, can't stop
And make me feel so good inside
I just can't stop dancing (Sing on, chillin')
Everybody sing it

Woo-wee, woo-wee, woah, woah, woo, heh
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
