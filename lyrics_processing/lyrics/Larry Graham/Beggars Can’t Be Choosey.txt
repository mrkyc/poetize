I met a man just the other day
We got involved in this heavy conversation
I felt so bad when I heard him say
"I'd rather die than live with my situation"

"Livin' on handouts day-to-day"
What hurts the most is when I hear him say that

Beggars can't be choosey, they say
Everything must be this way
I just keep believin' some way
There's gonna be a brighter day

We started walkin' down People Street
That's what it call it 'cause home is on the ground
Some searchin' trash cans for food to eat
Some pushin' carts full of everything they found

Hard to believe so many live this way
The problem's gettin' bigger every day

Hard to believe so many live this way

I can't believe I lost my job
The next thing I knew, I had to face the landlord
I told him, "Please believe me, I'll pay the rent
Soon as I get the money that my mother lost and
Now I'm on the streets with my family too
I don't know what to do, you would do
I heard somebody scream, "I can't take no more"
"Where you gonna go? It's gettin' cold, and your body's gettin' cold"

There's gonna be a brighter day (Some days, there will be a brighter day, yeah)
Beggars can't be choosey, they say (No)
Everything must be this way (Woo-hoo)
I just keep believin' some way (Keep believin')
There's gonna be a brighter day (Brighter day, hey, ayy)

Everything must be this way (Ya, ha, hoo)
I just keep believin' some way (I know some way)
There's gonna be a brighter day (Brighter, brighter, brighter)
