Kickin' back, thinkin' how life used to be
Full of misery
Imagine that, you with him and her with me
That's hard to see

One could say it's a miracle
How we met, fell above
I thank God above

Just this side of paradise
I got you, sure is nice
Just this side of paradise
Ho-ho, ho-ho, oh, oh
Just this side of paradise
I got you, sure is nice
Just this side of paradise
Ho-ho, ho-ho, oh, oh

Straight ahead, overcoming what has passed
We're happy at last
It's plain to see, you're the only girl for me
That's the way it should be
You might also like
One could say it's a miracle
How we met, fell in love
I thank God above

Just this side of paradise
I got you, sure is nice
Just this side of paradise
Ho-ho, ho-ho, oh, oh
Just this side of paradise
I got you, sure is nice
Just this side of paradise
Ho-ho, ho-ho, oh, oh

I got you, baby, you got me, baby
And that's the way it's always gonna be, lady
I got you, baby, you got me, baby
Oh, oh, oh (I got you, baby)

And that's the way it's always gonna be, lady
