How does it feel?
It feels like a child at play on a summer day
How does it feel?
It feels like a thousand thoughts with no words to say

If you never ever been in love before
Let me try my best to tell you what's in store (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How does it feel?
You feel you can jump so high, you can touch the sky
How does it feel?
You feel you can run so fast, set your shoes are on fire
How does it feel?
You feel that from now on, nothin' can go wrong
How does it feel?
You feel every word you say can be a new hit song

If you never ever been in love before (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me try my best to tell you what's in store (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How does it feel?
It feels like your heart is light, everything is right
How does it feel?
And you wanna be together every minute, every day and night
