Having you here in my life
Makes up for all the things that I never had
Girl, you make me feel so happy
I just can't tell you how I feel
You stay constantly on my mind
Only one thought and that one is about you
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your place

Love
No one can live without it
Love
And there ain't nobody doubtin'
Love
Stand up and shout about love
Love, love, love, love

In my arms is where you belong
You are my music, you are my song
From the first time I laid eyes on you
From then on, my life, I made a part of you
I'm gonna give you my everything
And from now on, about you, girl, I'll sing
It's me and you, it's me and you, baby
I know my love for you will never change
