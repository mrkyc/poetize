Some folks spend about all their time
Tryin' to get ahead
Tryin' to make a dime
And some folks, all they think about, hmm, hm
Is what they got to have
What they can't do without

But I'd rather be lovin' you
Lovin' you
There's nothin' in the world
That I would rather do
Girl, I'd rather be lovin' you
Lovin' you
Said there's nothin' in the world
That I would rather do

Some folks makin' and payin' bills, yes, they are
But while you're out there workin', someone breaks in and steal, hmm
Some folks worry 'bout bein' cool, bein' cool
Pleasin' so-called friends, but what I'd rather do

I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
I'd rather be lovin' you, girl (Lovin' you)
There's nothin' in this whole wide world
I would rather do
Girl, I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
Lovin' you, girl (Lovin' you)
There's nothin' in this world
That I would rather do, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
You might also like
Some folks just don't understand, mmm-mmm, what go
What it really takes
To really be a man, ayy-hey
And some folks spend about all their life, yes, they do
To find out that it's love
That keeps a man alive

That's why I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
Lovin' you, hmm (Lovin' you)
There's nothin' in the world
I would rather do, do, do, do, do
Than be lovin' you, ayy, woo-hoo (Lovin' you)
Lovin' you, girl (Lovin' you)
There's nothin' in this whole wide world
Me lovin' you
Girl, I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
Well, I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
I said there's nothin' in this world
That I would rather do
Girl, than be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
I said I'd rather be lovin' you (Lovin' you)
I said there's nothin' in this world
I would rather do, do
Lovin' you (Lovin' you)
