Any day now
And I'll believe it
Believe it when I say it out loud
But right now, I'm
Digging through the hurt
Looking for the words
That I'll never find
Right now, I'm
Digging through the hurt
Looking for the words
Trying to make 'em mine
I'm looking for the man that
I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that
I'll never find
I'm gonna please you
Any day now
Be the one who needs you
Any day now
You might also likeAnd every time that I wake up
You'll be the first thing to cross my mind
But right now, I wish that it was worth all the work and I wasn't tired
I can't just stop and try to fix it if I know that it was never right
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I thought that it would be you
I wanted it to be you
And I'm sorry, I was always looking
For the man that I'll never find
I thought I knew it when I looked you dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
