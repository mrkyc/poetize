Ah ha, she fell comatose waiting for this thing to grow
Ah ha, she's impatient 'cause she wants it now and so it shows
Ah ha, she can't be bothered by the ties that bind her
Ah ha, 'cause she's seen ivy when it strangles everything it holds

She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end of the telescope
Turn it around, turn it around

Ah ha, ah ha, ah
Ah ha, ah ha, ah

Ah ha, she closed the door with the intention of not looking back
Ah ha, but missed her step because she didn't have a steady track
Ah ha, she can't be bothered by the mistakes she's made
Ah ha, 'cause she's forgetting that's what guides you to the rightful path

She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end of the telescope
Turn it around, turn it around

Ah ha, well, as suspected, back at home, it grew out of control
Ah ha, well, that can happen when you leave things to a little girl
Ah ha, so now she's left without an option at hand
Ah ha, she better tend to it or she won't have another chance

She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end of the telescope
Turn it around, turn it around

She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end
She's looking through the wrong end of the telescope
(Turn it around)
Turn it around, turn it around

Ah ha, ah ha, ah
Ah ha, ah ha, ah
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ah ha, ah ha, ah
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ah ha, ah ha, ah
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
