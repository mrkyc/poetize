Let's straighten them out
Let's straighten this whole damn mess we've gotten ourselves in
This time didn't go the way I was hoping
You've gotta get out, I've gotta get out
Keep checking the mirrors, call me as soon as you can
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, can you keep it, can you keep it in?
Hey Doreen, we know what you have seen
It's the way, the way it had to be
Hey Doreen, we know what you have seen
It's the way it had to be
(cover your tracks, you know you can't take it back)
The sun's coming up, did you make it in time?
If anyone asks you
You weren't there I found the perfect alibi
A black dahlia blooms and then she dies
Lie after lie
Is what we do best and share in common, you and I
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, can you keep it, can you keep it in?
Hey Doreen, we know what you have seen
It's the way, the way it had to be
All your plans, just a nickel in her hands
It's the way it had to be
(cover your tracks, you know you can't take it back)
Hey Doreen, we know what you have seen
It's the way it had to be
(cover your tracks, you know you can't take it back)
