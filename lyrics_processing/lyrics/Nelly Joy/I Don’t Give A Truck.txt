We used to go mudding
Just so we could get stuck
What the hell happened?
You left my heart in the dust
We went from dancing in the headlights
I was champagne, you were Bud Light
Did you think I wouldn't find out you were running around?
There's only one yellow '57 Chevy in this town

Yeah, I don't give a truck about you
Wanna shotgun without you
Find a little love without you
I'm moving on
We ain't gonna cruise
Our wheels that are bigger than you
Throw it into four-wheel drive
And back out of my life
'Cause I don't give a truck
No, I don't, I don't
I don't give a truck

You can say sorry, but you can't put it in reverse
You went to that party and you left with her
I heard you took her down that backroad
To the same place only we know
And you wore out that suspension
That was pretty damn expensive

Yeah, I don't give a truck about you
Wanna shotgun without you
Find a little love without you
I'm moving on
We ain't gonna cruise
Our wheels that are bigger than you
Throw it into four-wheel drive
And back out of my life
'Cause I don't give a truck
No, I don't, I don't
I don't give a truck

Load up, we're done
Hope you like your freedom
Roll on, make a road stop
'Cause boy, you're gonna need 'em

Yeah, I don't give a truck about you
Wanna shotgun without you
Find a little love without you
I'm moving on
We ain't gonna cruise
Our wheels that are bigger than you
Throw it into four-wheel drive
And back out of my life
'Cause I don't give a truck
No, I don't, I don't
