Might be the seven-year itch that we just can't scratch
Walkin' 'round a rift, tryna fill in the cracks
Never been to prison, but I think we might be close

Makin' war a lot more than we're makin' love
Home is just a house when you're feelin' this stuck
Change of scenery could turn the tides, you never know

So I booked a last-resort vacation
To fix this sinking relationship
Well, shit

Only you, only you, only you can ruin a beach, yeah
Turn paradise into some kind of hell naturally, yeah
Throwin' petty shade all on my sunny day
Like gettin' hit in the face with a ten-foot wave
Spittin' in my daiquiri before I even get to taste it
Wasted, never knew it'd be easy to do
Only you, only you can ruin a beach, yeah

Thought we could bury our worries deep in the sand
A little R&R might save what we had
But damnit, boy, you sure know how to spoil a view, mmm
You might also like
And I gotta admit, it's a special kind of talent
To make me wanna take my chances swimmin' off the island
But I know how to swim with sharks from livin' with you
Well, shoot

Only you, only you, only you can ruin a beach, yeah
Turn paradise into some kind of hell naturally, yeah
Throwin' petty shade all on my sunny day
Like gettin' hit in the face with a ten-foot wave
Spittin' in my daiquiri before I even get to taste it
Wasted, never knew it'd be easy to do
Only you, only you can ruin a beach, yeah
Only you, only you can ruin a beach

Travel two thousand miles in first class style
Thinking palm trees and margis could save it
The heaven on earth ain't where you are, it's who you're with

And you can ruin a beach, yeah
Turn paradise into some kind of hell naturally, yeah
Throwin' petty shade all on my sunny day
Gettin' hit in the face with a ten-foot wave
Spittin' in my daiquiri before I even get to taste it
Wasted, never knew it'd be easy to do
Only you, only you can ruin a beach, yeah
