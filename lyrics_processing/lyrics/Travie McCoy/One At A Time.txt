Yeah
It's Travie!

Let's take a second and reflect on what we can do
To be smart and play a part in something beautiful
Embrace life appreciate the fact you even breathing
Cause we in the cross hairs and it's open season
If each one teaches one we got a good start
Your not a square cause you care and have a good heart
We gotta speak soft and listen harder
It's right in front of our face but we don't even bother

(Uh) Think about it
(Uh) Think about it
Be about, don't be afraid to speak about it
(Uh) Don't cry about it (Uh) even though they lie about it
Set a fire, inspire don't turn the other cheek about it

(Whoa) Can't change the world over night
(Whoa) But we can start by saving a life (Whoa)
One at a time, One at a time
(Whoa) So let's make history (Whoa)
And help out those in need (Whoa)
One at a time, One at a time
We can change a life

I be like my generations complaining
About things that we don't have
But if you think about if you think about it
We ain't got it so bad
Trust me I know bad and I met worst
And it'd be so sad, To sit it and let it get worst
It's a simple concept we need to grasp quickly
Before we end up wishing we did something differently
So go and spread the word and not the virus
C'mon, let's get together try and put this all behind us

(Uh) Think about it
(Uh) Think about it
Be about, don't be afraid to speak about it
(Uh) Don't cry about it (Uh) even though they lie about it
Set a fire, inspire don't turn the other cheek about it

One at a time, One at a time
(Whoa) So let's make history (Whoa)
And help out those in need (Whoa)
