Look, I've been pushed around, I've been shouted down, but I never let that get to me
'Cause I'd die before that day I ever let 'em get that victory
I've been spat at, called this and that to the point I was ready to forfeit
Now it's, "Hey, Travie, by the way, Travie," but that type of shit, you never forget
I tell 'em, "Look"
Check out what the hatred done done to me
Roll out red carpet all under me
Bad chicks, big checks all come to me
From a Geneva crib to that arena, kid
One mic, one stage, nothing between us, kid
A lot of people talk, but never seen the kid
Might seem like it, but they never made a scene this big
And if you don't know, then you know now, I got it locked down like the Vatican
In hindsight, I'm in a twilight, don't believe me, ask Rob Pattinson
Shut your mouth and stand still like a mannequin
Then go ahead and take this L 'cause I plan to win
And I'm finna go deep, I'ma let 'em all sleep like they popped one too many Ambien, yeah

Stop it (Stop it)

It's like no matter where I'm at or no matter where I go
They like, "Travie, why's there so many females at your show?"
I don't know (I don't know)
Guess that's the way that I roll (I roll)
Let's go (Let's go)
Although I had to make it fast, you know I'd rather take it slow
I only got a half an hour, girl, my bus about to go
Let me know (Let me know)
Are we hitting the road? (Come on, girl)
Then let's go (Let's go)
I'm hearing chitter chatter from the back all the way to the front door
You know them haters gon' hate, it's just embedded in they soul
Let it go (Let it go)
'Cause they just miserable (Miserable)
And I'm lovin' it

Yeah, I'm finna go in like my daddy told me
Brand new Travie, say goodbye to the old me
Yeah, you talk a good one, now show me
I'm Dumbledore, you a one trick pony
Past years, it was all about my girlfriend
Last year, I was caught up in the whirlwinds
This year, I'ma change all that

Get the hell on, go play somewhere and stop it (Stop it)
I got it (I got it)
You not it (You not it)
Get the hell on, go play somewhere and stop it (Fuck out my face)
So stop it (So stop it)
