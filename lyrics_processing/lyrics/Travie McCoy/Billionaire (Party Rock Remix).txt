I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire

Half-black, Half-white visiting you
She blow like a woodwind digeridoo
You live with your mama, say she living with you
I'm buying houses for my family and most of my crew
Me and Rich Branson on the moon dancing
I could fit the pyramids inside my mansion
Got your girl glancing inside my pants and
Now I got a head bopping like Hanson
Nothing like it's nothing, Mom and Stu are baking muffins
On my ???, it's funny cause your booty like pumpkins
Of course I help the world and share my success
I buy all the fatty-fats P-90 X, stretch

I wanna be a billionaire

I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire

Gucci Mane la Flare in the building, yeah
Right back like I never even went nowhere
Growing up, I dreamed I would be a billionaire
And when the Jordans came, I could buy a billion pair
Cause zillionaires swagged up, swear it ain't fair
Lames lay game and they too too square
Life's too short to sit back and look
Every night is a movie, my life's a book (Gucci)
Money rules the world, but money runs to me
You can't put a price tag on what God's done for me
I wanna be a billionaire so freaking bad
So I can tell all my haters to kiss my ass
It's Gucci
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire
