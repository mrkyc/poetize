We all love this city, we all love this city
We all love this city, we all love this city
I think the name alone says it all (New York)
United we stand, divided we fall
Either you lead, you follow, or get up out...
Basically we got it broken down to a silence
Everybody from Brooklyn put your hands in the air
And all my boogie down broads,big blue screen yeah
We know Queens in here
And the money making Manhattans over here by HA
Staten Island stand up
Three colors gottem shook right out that truck
Four rings, the thumbs gettin' anxious
Four words, "all in ____ ____"
B-G-L-E
Super hot definition bustin' out your TV
So go hard, I go home
We put an end to your run like zone
Get it yeeah
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!

We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in
We all love this city
(Money making now)
We all love this city
(Put me down)
We all love this city
(Brooklyn stay hard)
We all love this city
And you can see the skyline from the side line
No point to try to read between the fine line
Its right in front of your face, and if that ain't enough
We could put you on the field and give you a taste
Determination, Perseverance, if you ain't speaking that language then we ain't tryna hear it
That adrenalin settin' in
This a tight circle and you ain't gettin' in
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!

I'm so New York City its so unfair
Its like riding down in a cabby to Times Square
If you from the Big Apple I know you're with me
Put you're hands up, the same ones that built this city
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!
