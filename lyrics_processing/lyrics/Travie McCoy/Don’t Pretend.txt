Don't pretend
Don't pretend
Don't pretend that you will never love again
(Don't pretend that you will never love again)

Little Miss Teary Eyes, you have no reason to lie to me
And put your coat down, why you waving goodbye to me?
I've been reassessing the situation, sittin' silently
And finally realize why you can't look eye to eye with me
And I knew about him the whole time
The hotels, phone calls, pssh, the whole nine
But I guess that's what friends are for
And I've come to a conclusion
That you're nothing but a very selfish person

Open up my chest and you'll see
A cold cavity where my heart used to be
Makin' amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection
Ha, ha

Don't pretend (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna give you up (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that he is just a friend (Oh, no, oh, no)
Oh, no, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that you will never love again
You might also like
Okay, let me calm down
Here: have a seat, baby, maybe we can talk now
Guess I only have one question for you
Was I just another step in a progression for you?
And if so, why ain't you tell me that?
I wouldn't have sprung forward, I'd have fell back
But I guess that's what friends are for
The only word that comes to mind
Is that you're nothin' but a little brat

Open up my chest and you'll see
A cold cavity where my heart use to be
Makin' amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection
Ha, ha

Don't pretend (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna give you up (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that he is just a friend (Oh, no, oh, no)
Oh, no, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that you will never love again
Don't pretend that you will never love again
Don't pretend that you will never love again
We know it's nothing but the best, right?
But at night, I pray to God he won't rest right
You probably think I'm still bitter, well, you guessed right
How in the hell did we find ourselves in this mess, right?

I will bid farewell, Boobie
Sever the ties and I'mma keep it moving
