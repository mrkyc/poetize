Hey, hey
After midnight, we're out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Ooooh) Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the ghosts
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Yeah) Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sorta freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight

The shitty nine to five (Man, I hate this job)
It's gonna be the end of me (It's gonna be the end of me)
And since when did time (Since when did time)
Become my biggest enemy? (Become my biggest enemy)

I don't think it's smart standing so close to me
(So close, so close, you to close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine taking over me
(I-I-I feel it, I feel it taken over)
(Hey hey)

Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sort of freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight

It's midnight, it feels right, everybody's acting up
If you're a freak, be proud of it
You got it from your mother
And I have rather good manners
I just choose not to employ them
It's about that time for you to
Embrace your flaws and enjoy them
Everybody in the back, bring your ass up to the front
And never mind the fuss because we do what we want
You feeling how I'm feeling, put your hands up to the ceiling
And say "We don't need no blocks, let them motherfuckers go!"

After midnight, we're out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the dogs
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sort of freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight
I don't think it's smart standing so close to me
After midnight (So close, so close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine
Takin' over me (After midnight, I feel it taking over me)
I don't think it's smart standing so close to me (So close, so close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine
Taken over me (Yeah)
