Let the kids sing

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Uh, huh
Thinkin' back when things were so easy
Got me laughin' out loud, for no reason
I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels
Trading Garbage Pail Kid cards for sweet pickles
The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles
Yeah, your boy had the original Storm Shadow
And as of lately, things have been slow
So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows
Yeah, 'til I got snatched by the cops
With a Wiffle Ball bat and a hand full of rocks
Consider this song a throw back
'Cause all I wanna do is go back
Y'all sing it with me

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Tell 'em
And this was way before PlayStation
Rushing home to watch Video vibrations
Man, I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business
And I can't forget Rachel from Caribbean Rhythms
This was back when Rap City used to play the jams
This is how I first heard about the Wu-Tang Clan
Banged 36 chambers all summer long
And to this day, Canopy's my favorite summer song
And I can drop names for days
Of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way
But we probably need a lot more than just four minutes
So this is how I'm gonna end it, everybody sing

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Yeah, I'm on the bus in the back lounge
Sweaty, cold, confused in another unfamiliar town
Another sold out show
Spillin' my soul to a ton of people I don't know
And I can feel my skin wearin' thinner
Fourth night, no appetite for dinner
Shit, goddamn, well, ain't life grand?
Gettin' paid to stand on stage with your heart in your hand
Sometimes I squeeze it 'til they get worried
If this is Groundhogs Day, I guess I'm Bill Murray
And I swear I'm not complainin' at all
I love each and every one of ya'll
All I'm really sayin' is...
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
