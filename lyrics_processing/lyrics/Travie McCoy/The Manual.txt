They said anything is possible
And life's just another obstacle
Well show me the manual
And the man responsible, yeah
I went lookin' for answers in the hospital
And came back with a pocket full
When I stole the manual
And killed the man responsible

Now we all make mistakes
But those mistakes just make us who we are
And not who we choose to be (No)
My faith got misplaced
Somewhere between a superstar (Hey)
And the boy that I used to be (Hey)

I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
Hey!

They say clothes don't make the man
But I'ma show you how fresh I am
Soon as I pay my water bill
And a couple other bills
They say they got a cure for my smile
Rather for my lack thereof
So they gave me another pill
But it was just that water pill (Raiders!)

You know we all make mistakes
But they just make us insecure
And a little uncomfortable
My faith got misplaced
Between who I was before (Hey)
And the dude you think you know (Hey)

I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
Hey!
See, I can be in the hood sippin' 'gnac with my boys
Or at the keg party with the white boys
At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills
Or at a X party with Vicks and light toys
I guess you can call me a chameleon
I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in
And we all make mistakes
Yeah, I'm a walkin' contradiction
And plus I never listen, ooh
And my faith got misplaced
Somewhere along the lines of (Hey)
Tryin' to make my mind up, yeah (Hey)

I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
