Pick me up, I'm feeling like a fish out of water
Down and out in Los Angeles
I give up, this shitty city's pulling me under
Get me out of LA

My feet never fit the concrete in Los Angeles
So I kept it in, why I see you on the flip-side
I wandered out of soul, flight club got me covered though
It's time to pat my back, so get your flight to another show
Time was on my side until my clock started laughing at me
But who can I keep biding if my mind's the opposite of happy
My therapist said I should probably buy a plant
Started messing with these scallywags, what type of shit is that?
So now it's just me and my Bonsai tree
I'm trimming him instead of getting trim from blinds I see, huh
Oh, I never forgot my ducks in the order
Whenever I'm not chill, it's time to run for the border, yeah
It's probably better for my health
I can't love you 'cause I can barely stand myself
Ducking and diving, shucking and jiving
Tryna shake and bake to make a couple duckings to die with

Pick me up, I'm feeling a the fish out of water
Down and out in Los Angeles
I give up, this shitty city's pulling me under
Get me out of LA

Come on, Usain who?
I've been bolting from my problems since the age of twenty-two
Dodging responsibilities like, "No, thank you"
Sorry man, I'm on some other
While my band was thinking, "Damn, why can't he be more like his brother?"
Nine-to-five seemed like something for a slave
I mean, besides, who wants to die overworked and underpaid?
I'd rather be daydreaming under shade
Or with a big bottom girl and fresh squeezed lemonade
Let's just say I handcuff my own development
And shoved it in the basement 'til he came with something relevant
I like to cackle for the hell of it
At the thought of being thirty-six and celibate, no
I gave up a bunch of bad habits
When it comes to females, let's just say I'm still an addict
Tell her, shit, I'll get him back when I see him
But for now, I'ma car pay the fuck out of this DM

Pick me up, I'm feeling like a fish out of water
Down and out in Los Angeles
I give up, this shitty city's pulling me under
Get me out of LA
