Ha, ha
Yeah, it's Travie
Bring the hook in

Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)
Oh, oh, doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)
I want that feel good
That feel good

Dr. Feel Good, help me

Lately, I've been beside myself
And it's unlike me to hide myself
It's not like I like being by myself
I wanna see the world, but can't decide myself
Whether or not to get up off this couch
Whether or not to get up out this house
I wanna know what it's like to feel real good
Is there something you can prescribe, Dr. Feel Good?
I mean he's so happy, she's so free Doctor, what in the world is wrong with me?
I just need some reassurance, I know my carrier won't be insuring this
If you could just be earnest
Oops, I meant honest and make this promise
If any of this makes sense, let 'em know I wasn't crazy, just thoroughly convinced

Dr. Feel Good, help me

She got the set of lips like a sedative
Every time I kiss, it's like medicine
Something said to me no, no, don't let her in
'Cause every time I do, I end up upset again
And then it's back to the waiting room
Waiting patiently for them to bring another patient to 'em
Anything is possible
Especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope Dr. Feel Good can fix me
And help me find peace of mind before 50
(Mr. McCoy, you're up next)
I made a detour quickly
Hightailed it towards the exit door before they could get me
It didn't take much to lose 'em
But before I got home, I came to a conclusion
That feeling good means another appointment
Take two of these and don't expect a call in the morning
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)
Take the pain away, take the pain away
Oh, oh, doctor (Doctor)
Give me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)
Get me through the day, through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good

I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (That real good)
Dr. Feel Good, help me

Ladies and gentlemen, hey, pardon me, patients
See what I'mma do right now is break it down
Put your hands together
Repeat after me, come on
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Take the pain away, take the pain away
Oh, oh, doctor (Doctor)
