Drive slow, drive fast
Whatever the destination is
I'mma leave all the numbers on the dash
Sheriff's tryna come and see me, but it ain't my fault
Better say a prayer
'Cause I ain't tryna wait on the change
Like my name was John Mayer
I swear
I came here to give 'em a show

It's 11:34, I'm on a roll
It's almost noon and I ain't got nowhere to go
Ah, yeah, yeah
And this is the road of my life
So I'mma have a little fun and ride till I see the sun, yeah
Whoa, yeah

Got the time, got a place
If you want more of these Heineken's
You better go and give me my space (My space)
Before I kick the dirt and head to the trunk to get you a little taste
Yeah, I'm superbad
I'mma get ya a little something that your sister and your mama never had
Coulda been your dad
I gotta go, but I'll be right back
