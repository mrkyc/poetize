My shoulders were as heavy as lead
I felt something was just not right
I had to roll a little spliff for my head
So I took a walk inside
Talked to I, I self
Trying to ease these pains of mine
Oh, Jah give I strength
And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Rasta inna it, egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Eh, now I'm in a irie place
Now I'm in a irie space
Now I man can I dictate
Free ourselves from all that hate
Now I'm in an irie state
Now I man can I dictate
Free ourselves from all that hate
Bless them with Jah love and grace
And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Rasta inna it, egg, egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Eh, I didn't get no sleep at all first night, no
My shoulders we as heavy as lead
I felt something was just not right
Had to roll a little zig for my head, yeah
So I took a walk inside
Talk to I, I self
Free I from this frame of mind
Oh Jah, give I strength
And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di
C'mon man and if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
None shall escape Jah judgment
Jah judgment's gonna call on you
Red eye, red eye, red eye
Red eye, you're gonna turn to blue
None shall escape Jah judgment
Jah judgment's gonna fall on you
Red eye, red eye, red eye
Red eye, you're gonna turn to blue
So when we call Him Rastafari
What shall we contend with?
