A youth and youth fi have a plan and have some ambition
And make sure unnu firm ina di Armageddon
So when you son become a man, him know just where you stand
Him know him poopa set it so him follow tradition
If Marcus Garvey say fi read then why some man ah pree
Cause knowledge ah the key and it wll set the people free
And Haile I philosophy is African unity
Unno watch dey segregation and social impurity
The race is not just for the swift but those who can endure
Make sure you have a steady footing in ah zion door
And keep dem thoughts dem pure, Jah love is for the poor
But some likkkle bwoy ah burst some gun dem mooma can't afford
If Jah say blood fi run let Jah will be done
The heaven and the earth will pass away before him word no come
But if 'I'm rise without a cause there will be no reward
For you to enter Zion gates because you are a fraud
For the youths in the struggle
Fighting Guerilla warfare
Somalia to Ethiopia
From Egypt to Zimbabwe
You might also likeHaile Selassie say ah war if colour is a scar
If one from every nation can come live up an ah par
So don't care who you are there's a brighter morning star
It's shining with di town and tell the people near and far
You seek and you will search with science and research
The flesh it is the temple and the temple is the church
Haile Selassie say fi work so how some man ah lurks
Dem fix upon the cornerside like rubbish heap and dirt
Haile Selassie say ah one respect for every man
No care dey race, no care dey colour nor di religion
So make a decision fi bun di division
Cause each and every rasta youth to trot pon di mission
