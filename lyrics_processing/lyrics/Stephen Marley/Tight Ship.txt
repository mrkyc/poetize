Though the wicked persecute I, still my heart has love
Oh, my head's anointed with the powers of love
Though the wicked persecute I with envy and grudge
Oh, my head's anointed, ayy

There is no room for mistakes, we're sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom, sweep the place, oh, clear a space
There is no room for mistakes, mama said, sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom, sweep the place, oh, clear a space, yeah

Though the wicked persecute I, still my heart has love
Oh, my head's anointed with the powers of love
Though them wicked persecute I with envy and grudge
But my head's anointed, hey

There is no room for mistakes, we're sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom, sweep the place, oh, clear a space
There is no room for mistakes, papa said, sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom, sweep the place, oh, clear a space, yeah

Let's get this ship up and quick, in spick and spanking, yes
All hands on deck, I said, don't let me say it again
Let's get this ship up and quick, in spick and spanking, yes
All hands on deck, I said, don't let, I gotta say it again
