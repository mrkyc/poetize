Stephen Marley
Mr. Worldwide
History in the making
This for all the women that's been through it all
Seen it all, done it all, we feel you

She don't walk down every road
Way she smiles, it ever shows
That she's a freedom I've never known
She's a feeling you can't control

And I had to go insane
Cause I've been watching her for a while
While she's moving her body
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na

When she's dancing, yeah
She's the only star that shines
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
When she's dancing, yeah
When she's dancing, yeah
You might also like
And so she keeps on moving like
She's dancing for her life
For all to see in open sight
She don't care who is watching

And I had to go insane
Cause I've been watching her for a while
While she's moving her body
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na

When she's dancing, yeah
There's no mountain she can't climb
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like

Mami got the mind of a hustler
Body of a goddess slash con artist
She's beautiful, fine, sexy, exotic
Graduated from street college
She about that money, 'bout that cash
She about that life, livin' on fast
She's a business slash entrepreneur when she's shaking that
She's the only star that shines
When she move them hips and makin' them wine
Make you feel like a king for one night
Set you up on a lick and rob you blind
With her, there's no losing
Half Jamaican, the other half Cuban
Mami's dangerous, especially if you're famous
Watch out
And so she keeps on moving like
She's dancing for her life
For all to see in open sight
She don't care who is watching

When she's dancing, yeah
She's the only star that shines
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
When she's dancing, yeah
