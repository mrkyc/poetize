Turn 'em up
Get them ready
King sincerely (?)
Get them ready now...ready now...
She's a pretty little thing

It's time for us to get closer now
Wanna feel your touch
Wanna hear your sound
Every time I see, see your face
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know, if I have your heart
Cause every time I'm with ya
You paint the perfect picture

This relationship, society can't relate
They say we're two opposite
They say it's all a mistake
They say I'm no good for you
They say you're too good for me
Dem said our puzzle don't fit
Well baby I disagree
Your mama told you to be
A very good behaving
And now just because of me
They say you're miss behaving
Dad is not talking to you
Because he doesn't approve
You might also like
My lies no truth, my truth no lie
Oh Jah is here so I must abide
Oh you and I, a world apart
But every time I'm with ya
We paint the perfect picture
Please let me know, if I have your heart
We'll share the pains, oh we'll share the joy
'Cause every time I'm with ya
We paint the perfect picture

She said they taught her to love
And now they want her to hate
They say they're kicking her out
She told them she'll be okay
As long as she's loving me
She told them she'll be alright
She's so ready to live
She's excited for life
Is she reckless at heart
'Cause she won't leave me alone
She's always in my thoughts
I got her face on my phone
Picture's as perfect can be
Every time she's with me
It's time for us to get closer now
I'm gonna feel your touch
I'm gonna hear your sound
Every time I see, see your face
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know if I have your heart
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Well baby it's you and me
We're painting portraits of love
Why won't they let us be free
And just let God be the judge
They've never been so ashamed
We've never been so in love
I'd rather hold on to you
They'd rather hold on to grudge
It's always been we and them
It's always been you and I
They taught us live and let live
They'd rather live and let die
I pray they live to forgive
And I say baby don't cry.......
'Cause when it's all said and done
And man a shed flesh and bone
They won't care who was wrong
They would wish you were home
It's reminding me of a little story I know
It's like Ali and Marley
Or maybe Leah alone.. (?)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You're pretty like a picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You always paint the perfect picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You always paint the perfect picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa... you're my Mona Lisa...
You're my Mona Lisa.......picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You paint the perfect picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
