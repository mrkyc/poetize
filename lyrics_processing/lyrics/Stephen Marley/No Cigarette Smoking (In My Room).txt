Oh pa, pa, pa, na, ni
Hey

No cigarette smoking in my room
No alcoholic beverage in my room
Juju gave me a boom draw this afternoon
And I'm gonna get a next portion real soon

I'll be gone for a while, keep that perfect smile
Do your very best
I'll be gone for a while, keep that perfect smile
Do your very best

I'm keep you warm, it's cold outside
Protect you from the storm, the world outside
You know I love you baby
No need to worry about me

I'll be gone for a while, keep that perfect smile
Do your very best
I'll be gone for a while, keep that perfect smile
Do your very best
