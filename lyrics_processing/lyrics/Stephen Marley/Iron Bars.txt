What am I doing behind these iron bars
Never robbed nor killed, never done no one harm
You put me in shackles, you place I in chains
Said I'll never see the outside again
Oh!
Yeah, Yeah

I'm a prisoner locked up for what
Freedom of Speech ain't that all we've got
Wounded pride my head held up high
Rebels for life, we rebel for the right

Let me out, let me out
I'm a angry lion
Let me out, let me out
I'm a angry lion
Let me out, let me out
I'm a angry lion
Let me out, let me out
Oh you crazy mother

Heyo, listen, took my freedom, my honor, my pride
To provide for my family I tried
Gots to prepare, cuz listen
We's here for the ride
Vision's blocked cause we locked inside
Iron bars
Took my freedom, my honor, my pride
To provide for my family I tried
Gots to prepare, cuz listen
We's here for the ride
Vision's blocked cause we locked inside

Yo I was caught in the mix with nowhere to go
Rent need to be paid things moving slow
I just want to get a deal and spit this flow
See ain't that the dream to live well and get dough
You looking for a change man there ain't no changing
This money, this gun, this drug exchanging
And if you got seeds that makes you go even harder
If it ain't for them man then why even bother

You must think say man a sprat
Ain't no back and belly rat
Well man a lion, yeah
You must think say man a sprat
Don't play no back and belly rat
Well man a lion, yeah
Man a lion

Took my freedom, my honor, my pride

We's here for the ride
Vision's blocked cause we locked inside
Iron bars
Took my freedom, my honor, my pride
To provide for my family I tried
Gots to prepare, cuz listen
