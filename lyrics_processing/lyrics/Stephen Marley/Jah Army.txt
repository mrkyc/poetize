Only the King of Kings can sit down pon throne
And chase the crazy bumpheads from out of the town
And take on Babylon them evil boys pound fi pound
Without even blemishing his royal gown
Inspire I with clever adjectives and pronoun
To influence di yute dem with word power and sound
Well a build yuh house pon sand well if must fall down
What does not concern you said leave it alone
Not even one but several of the thing me bust a federal
Issued by the rasta general, enemies a meet them funeral
We pick the individual, sniper have them inna them visual
Babylon time a reach a minimal, we conquer them subliminal
There is warfare in a physical and warfare in a spiritual
There is warfare in a digital and warfare in a chemical
Sing to Babylon marijuana, me go check the Rasta medical
Dem think dem could a catch me off guard upon di mineral

Show your face in a place Gargamel
Buju raise and disperse
Them a no blessing them is a curse on them mother womb, huh
Soldier inna Jah army
A long time the suit them want me
Send a bagga fly fi swarm me
But them couldn't harm me
Stephen Marley done come warn me
Seh, "Gargamel, tek it calmly"
So me move like a snake
See suit them me on, the earth shake
Them couldn't get the dread 'cause me no fake
Them lock me inna jail
And talk 'bout them nah give me no bail
Me and me friend Josey Wales
Man a soldier pon bakklefield, man cyaan fail
Our style fresh while fi them style stale
Them wan' me fi sink but me ship just ah sail
Go di Buju glide over shark an whale
Over evil, goodness must prevail
Come genuine, no badda wid yuh fake hail
Lock up Gargamel and think you can prevail
Boy, unuh diss seh unuh whole plan fail
Me inna Jah army
A long time the suit them want me
Send a bagga fly fi swarm me
But dat couldn't harm me
'Cause Stephen Marley done come warn me
Seh, "Gargamel, tek it calmly"
Well, you a the reason, stand up and come on
Wokn ew ylnO only with one hand
Lion of Judah, conquering lion
Stand up on the wicked, them ah show them who I am
Some a say them bad but make them know we have God
And if them a the snake, make them know we have the rod
And if them a poison, we have antidote
Inna dancehall is a soldier, cyaan walk
Call me inna Jah army
Yuh think I know the suit them want me
But Gong did run come warn me
Seh, "Tek it calmly"
Look how long di bwoy dem a swarm me
Easy, Gargamel, easy, man
We are soldiers in Jah army
