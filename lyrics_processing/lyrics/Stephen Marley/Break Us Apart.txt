Would you let them break us apart?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break our hearts?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break us apart?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break our hearts?
Would you let them?

Together they can't break us, we are strong
Divide us in the road leads to destruction
Don't you fall a pray to Babylon
They want to pull us all in different directions
So they take you from the root and teach you their own truth
Open up your mind, please, don't you be so blind
Not in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
When it's all said and done, we're more than blood

Would you let them break us apart?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break our hearts?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break us apart?
Would you let them?
Would you let them break our hearts?
Would you let them?

But wi nah go tek dem lesson, nah go sit down inna dem class
Pon di road of corruption, ghetto yutes, wi nah go walk
Jah bless I every step, pon di rocky road wi march
Always have love inna wi heart
But see Jah now, dis mi positive and sure of
Everyday di rich a get rich and di poor a get poorer
Unite the people in and from the diaspora
No corruption cyaan come through da door yah, and say again

(La-la-la-la-la, ooh) Don't you loose your way
(La-la-la-la-la, ooh) Material couldn't make I dread
(La-la-la-la-la, ooh) We have love and happiness
(La-la-la-la-la, ooh) So we'll be alright
