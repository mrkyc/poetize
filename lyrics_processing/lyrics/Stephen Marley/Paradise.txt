I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise

She shows me that she loves me
And I'll never leave her
Cause every time i'm with her is like my favorite song
And my heart goes jumping (bum bum bum bum bum bum)
And she best believe me she can't do nothing wrong
Shows me that she loves me
And i'll never leave her
Cause everytime i'm with her is like my favorite song
And my heart goes jumping bum bum bum bum bum bum
And she best believe me

I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise
This is paradise
This is paradise

Paradise is a feeling of euphoria so glorious
And intimate it's soothing to your body
Paradise is when you roll one up in the Maserati
While you're listening to the music of a Marley
The wind on your face while you're on a Harley
On the road looking at unfamiliar faces
Gotta be a thuse if you want a caribbean cruise
Only you can take to an oasis (turn up)
And do you think I want to be with somebody hot (no)
And when i'm rubbing on her body
Do you think she gone be telling me to stop? (no)
So lil mama, you got a part and breath
And it's like i'm in the garden of eden
Surrounded by ice, paradise (yes)

I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise
I love you love of flow
My body like glow
You had me at hello
This is paradise
