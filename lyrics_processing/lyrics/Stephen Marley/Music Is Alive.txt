'Bout to get rowdy up in here. Get on up!
Yeah
Painkiller
Yeah
Shouts to Pain on the ones and twos
Yeah
Yeah

C'mon let me take you
Where the music is alive
Where it don't matter where you come from
It's gonna get you in the vibe
Roll one up let it blaze
And don't let none go to waste
From the get go you gon' let go
Of your ego and your pride

Pain Killer
Well now let me get a little minute on the mic, see
I'm gone blaze it up
The base is heavy
Drummer is steady
Hands in the air if you're arms ain't smelly
Turn up the heat set the roof on fire
Bubba baby bubba like your waist got wide
It's just the way that the DJ play
Hit ya with the music you can dance all day
Show me what you got baby love, tip-top
Pull up selector, start from top
I love the way that she makes it drop
Mix up the dancehall with hip-hop
You might also like
C'mon let me take you
Where the music is alive
Music is alive!
Where it don't matter where you come from
It's gonna get you in the vibe
Get you, ya-kna-mean, I know mystic up in here
Roll one up let it blaze
And don't let none go to waste
From the get go you gon' let go
Of your ego and your pride

You have some man come a dance with a pocket full of lint
And cannot purchase a Guinness nor two Icee Mint
And still stay the distance
From music a play, dem no response
Some woman come a dance and dem only cause trouble
Them will empty your pocket when you see how dem a bubble
And still stay the distance
From music a play, dem no response
Somebody must get deafer
Turn up the music, it must sound better
Chill, a Pain Killer weh the girls dem prefer
One life to live it up, it's now or never
Sometimes she need it rougher
But more talk, more make her love life suffer
Big Gong-zilla weh she can't get enough of
Real rubba dubba
Her man, she round and she bounce like rubber
Well it's me, the man on your microphone stand
Never leave the fam anywhere that I am, so
Jump around if ya love how me sound
Even when I ain't around, I'm the talk of your town
Now slow it down a little, let your waist go round
Want up in the chain, but you know that it clown
Sick, love the way how the AK sound
I love the way how the AR pound
Get up, get up, get wet up, wet up
You feel how I feel than you fed up, fed up
Natural as a mystic, puff a big spliff
Put you on a hit list, never diss this

C'mon let me take you
Where the music is alive
Music is alive!
Where it don't matter where you come from
It's gonna get you in the vibe
Roll one up let it blaze
And don't let none go to waste
From the get go you gon' let go
Of your ego and your pride
Of your ego and your pride
