Yow! (Ghetto)
They do more to the people, than for the people (Get out, Get it)
They crash the economy like a vehicle (Let's set it, I heard dem)
Seh dem a don and dem a dupes and dem a dadda (Stupid fools)
Inna the heart of the youths dem future yuh stick a dagger (That's what they did)
Let's do this ragga (Let's move)

Once I was a little child
Little things that make me smile
But quickly I became a man
The don put a gun into my hand
Told me that I could live or die
I didn't know the reason why
But my gun became my toy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy
The story of the ghetto boy

Well, di story of a ghetto boy

So him deploy inna di street to set a better joy
But now him buck up di police and him regret a choice Death is what him get a tise
Story of a ghetto yute

If yuh want to wear a better suit yuh want fi drive a coupe
Wear a couple gold chain and sleep with couple prostitute

But me proud a ghetto mi come outta

But my gun became my toy
