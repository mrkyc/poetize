Babylon...

Look what they doing, despicable, inhuman
And got the nerve to say that I'm 3/5ths of a human
Babylon is in ruins, inhabited by a beast
A bloodsucker, vampire to say the least
Look at the way that they're gnashing their teeth as they feast
Fighting to get a piece, something like Ancient Greece
Permanent Halloween, Trick or Treat
We're walking like zombies out in these streets
Shackled our hands and feet,
What you see?

Down there in Babylon
Where transgression increases
There they know no love
Hopeless are the days
Hold I stead 'Fari (JAH!)
From their wicked life
Smiles upon their faces
Evil in their hearts
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I
Babylon, Babylon
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Jah will never give you the crown
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Long you try fi hold Rasta down
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Rasta nuh 'fraid of no clown

Babylon is a Devil in a blue dress
Satan in a suit and tie
Oppression is freedom, Heaven is Hell
And the truth is a lie
They murder the youth, the police don't shoot in the sky
It's a warzone, you do what you gotta do to survive
You get suited and ride, life is hustle or starve
This is capitalism religion, money is God
America eats the young like cannibal breakfast
Wall Street is swarming with Hannibal Lecters
Crooked elections, politricks of the shitstem
Legal lynchings, modern day crucifixions
Slaves to the current conditions that we live in
More faith in the reverends than making our own heaven
It's foul how the youth glued to the television
Ain't heard of Assata but twitter following Paris Hilton
It's only right we want to be more than poor and righteous but
