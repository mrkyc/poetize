This is Ragamuffin from the ghetto youths camp
Anywhere me go me say me must leave my stamp
Marijuana whey me smoke them say it too ignorant
Just some other day, some po po hold me for one
Then my brother Juju and my I-thren name Dan
Bounce and listen to Gong we mashin' up the traffic jam
Police pull me over talking 'bout him smell corn
From me look inna him face me know this boy have a plan
Juju touch me 'pon my shoulder, say the boy ah demon
First thing him want to know is where that smell is coming from
Are you smokin' marijuana? and I said, yes I am
True him see say some mentions, say, it cost a couple grand
Him say make me see the license and registration
And where are you headed? What's your occupation?
Done know, say, ragamuffin nah go answer question
As is says on the paper, read the information
From me nah go take no street side interrogation
So book me, if you ah book me, carry down ah station
Make me show them how we did it inna style and pattern
You might also like

I'm the judge, the lawyer Jury, and my own bails man
And if you check it out that would be my station
Settle Juju royal from you run England
And when your plane land you nah go through no customs
This is ragamuffin in a different pattern
Me nah go inna no session unless it conk and ram
And from you see we face no bother ask no question
And anywhere we go we haffi ra pa pom, pom


Well, if ah ganja dem ah look for, them know where to find us
Well, we ah no criminal, say Rasta ever righteous
Some boy a scope out the ride how we ah drive and puff
And him jealous how we so shine and buff
And him jealous how we so shine and buff
Well, from him look inna the car and how the interior plush
And look upon the rims, how them full out and flush
And ah scope out we jewels him ah wonder how much
And him jealous cause them here price can't touch
And him jealous cause them here price can't touch
Then me say royal have a new tune fi rise and bust
And there extra large size muffin them ah light up
A boy dig down the car until him find some stuff
And him jealous cause we so rank and 'nuff
And him jealous cause we so rank and 'nuff
Him make Sarg cause a few stripes there 'pon him shoulder
Cause him too par with we, we there when demus show love
Give them couple CD, some promo photos
Now him jealous cause everybody knows us
Now him jealous cause everybody shows love
Yo some feel the way you pass and dem ah smile and blush
And true them see some man ah star
Them goodly have a light crush
Now him jealous now even twice as much
Now the boy jealous now even twice as much
It's just a minor set back, ah who them want cold up?
Every month then the super gets a thing fold up
Say natty dreadlocks no wear handcuff
Say any kind of cuff ah haffi diamond cuff
Go tell them every month then the super get a thing fold up
Say easy papa muffin you're rougher than rough
Ah settle Juju Royal, you're tougher than tough
And tell them say natty dreadlocks no wear handcuffs
Always stick together even when time tough
Boy you bright, you think ah shine and buff? settle!
