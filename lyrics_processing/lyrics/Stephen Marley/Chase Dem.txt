Aye! And they say it's part of it
So they buy, and you sell your soul
Well, my friend, the thought of it
Sell your soul for a piece of gold
While they in their companion sleep, steady through the night
Another baby-mama wept, for her baby's life

Chase dem; run them politicians
(When I see dem I get cold)
Chase dem; run them politicians
(When I see dem I get cold)
Chase dem; run them politicians
(When I see dem I get cold)
Chase dem; run them politicians
(When I see dem I get cold)

And they'll say it's a part of it
So they buy, and you sell your soul
Well, my friend, the thought of it
Sell your soul for a piece of gold
Can they and their companions sleep, steady through the night?
