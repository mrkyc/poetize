I get tired, I get lazy and my mind gets kinda hazy
I'm a walking apparition
My soul's facing extradition
Feel I'm past the point of saving
All this bullshit that I'm craving
Stone-cold ass that I can lean on
Warm, wet pussy just to cum in
Some days I think about dying
But I'm bold just like the lions
I'm the proudest and the mainest
And my heart will beat the loudest
Nobody nobody no one tells me what to do
Nobody nobody nobody no one tells me what to do
Nobody nobody nobody no one tells me what to do
Nobody nobody nobody da da da not even you
I like these games though that you're playing
All this bullshit that your saying
Is this what I am attracting, how I'm really interacting?
Look how much time that I'm wasting with this bullshit needs replacing
Where does it start?
Where does it stop?
Nobody messes with Dorsey the horsey
I need a break
I need to get off
Oh wait, I'm always getting off
It's hard to get down the sidewalk without a stain upon my jeans
This girl's committed to her squats
Just hold it open from the back whilst I attack cack cack cack cack
Then do some short lived reminiscing snuggling hugging softly kissing
Listening to some Norah Jones
Her freshman record is so dope
It's so dope
It's just so good, dope
The end all be all dope
She's like bitch come away with me
I'm only twenty years old

Nobody can judge me
No no no nobody can judge me
No no no not even you ha ha ha
Nobody can judge me
Nobody can judge me no no bah bah bah not even you
Only god can judge me
Just because you kiss and hug me and I let you come up on me
Doesn't mean that you can own me
'Til we find some wedding bands for the reception for our hands
Until then you can kiss the ring and fuck you
Politely, IMA do my thing
Nobody nobody nobody no one tells me what to do
De de de de de de de de de
Not even you
Nobody nobody no one tells me what to do
Nobody nobody de de de not even you
I'm going to sleep now
