I burn for you every time I hear your name
When I think I see your face, I know, it must be madness
I feel the sting striking at me like a match
Anything to bring you back - if only for a moment

I can feel your slow burn growing in me
Everywhere I go, you're right there with me...
Holding on, ever long
Wish I could forget I could not remember
All I have left is the ash and embers
Permanent, smoldering

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn
Say you'll never let me down and never go out

I fall apart like paper put to flame
The life we had reduced to ashes right before us
Every hurtful word, burned into my side
Much too hard to speak, scarred too deep to hide

I can feel your slow burn growing in me
Everywhere I go, you're right there with me...
Holding on, ever long

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn
Say you'll never let me down and never go out
My slow burn, burning me down

I walk the fire
I feed the flame
I walk the fire
I feed the flame
I'd walk the fire
I'd feed your flame
Feed your flame

Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn
Lay with me forever
Our light it shines forever, never fades away
Just like a slow burn, stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn
Say you'll never let me down
