Too late, this is not the answer
I need to pack it in
I can't pull your heart together
With just my voice alone
A thousand shards of glass I came to meet you in
You cut the peace out of me

And as you ripped it all apart, that's when I turned to watch you
And as the light in you went dark, I saw you turn to shadow
If you would salvage some part of you that once knew love
But I'm losing this
And I'm losing you

Oh, I've gotta turn and run
From faces that you never see
Oh, I've gotta save my blood
From all that you've broken
And pack up these pieces of me

It's too late now to stop the process
This was your choice, you let it in
This double life you lead
Is eating you up from within
A thousand shards of glass you pushed beneath my skin
And left me lying there to bleed

And as you showed me your scars, I only held you closer
But as the light in you went dark, I saw you turn over
I wanted always to be there for you and close to you
But I'm losing this
And I'm losing you

Oh, I've gotta turn and run
From faces that you never see
Oh, I've gotta save my blood
From all that you've broken
And pack up these pieces of me

The broken pieces
Pack up these pieces of me
The broken pieces
Pack up these pieces

Maybe without me you'll return to all the beauty I once knew
But if I stay, I know we will both be drowned by you holding onto me

Oh, I've gotta turn and run
From faces that you never see
Oh, I've gotta save my blood
From all that you've broken
And pack up these pieces of me
The broken pieces
Pack up these pieces of me
The broken pieces
