All in good time, I gave it my best
I was alone 'til I found myself
Grew up to be a man more or less
All in good time
All in good time, I drifted away
I ran my mouth 'til I'd nothing to say
You broke my heart, then I was okay
All in good time

All in good time, I trusted my eyes
Treated my losses like clouds in the sky
Finally picked on someone my size
All in good time
All in good time, I followed my nose
Learned where to bleed when a night comes to blows
Tried on your love, then I folded those clothes
All in good time

Throw your bread to falling birds
Buried friends and wasted words
Something wants to eat us all
Alive

All in good time, my angel came back
Made us some money, but that didn't last
We wouldn't cry, but we couldn't laugh
All in good time
All in good time, we fell like a star
We closed our eyes and we opened our arms
Ran off the road in our own stolen car
All in good time

All in good time and that's what it was
Mistook that cash in the mattress for love
Dropped all our weapons and shrank from the blood
All in good time
All in good time, we'd nothing to prove
We took the bait 'til we lost a tooth
No one believed it, but we told the truth
All in good time

All in good time, our plan went to shit
I told my future by reading your lips
You wore my ring until it didn't fit
All in good time
All in good time, we suffered enough
We met our muscle when push came to shove
Swept all that broken glass under the rug
All in good time
Dancing 'til we both collapsed
Wishing we could hide our tracks
Something wants to eat us all
Alive

All in good time, we'll remember when
Say our goodbyes and our hellos again
Huff and we'll puff until they let us in
All in good time
All in good time, we'll land on our feet
Your mother will sigh and my soldier will sleep
We'll swim in the ocean, fishes set free
All in good time

We'll swim the ocean
