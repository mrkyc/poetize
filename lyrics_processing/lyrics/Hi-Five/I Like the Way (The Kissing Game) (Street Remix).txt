I
You know what game I wanna play?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna play the kissing game
I wanna play the kissing game
I wanna play the kissing game
I wanna play the kissing game

All summer long
We've been together
And I never felt so good
'Cause when I'm with you
It's such a good time - yes, it is
And when you get next to me
You make my heartbeat fast
You throw me back when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
'Cause I can't get enough
'Cause I

(I like the way)
(I wanna play the kissing game, I wanna play the kissing game)
