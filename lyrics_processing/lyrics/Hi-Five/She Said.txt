She said
She said I will be with you forever (forever)
She said
She said I'm in love with you (forever)
She said
She said now baby, don't forget (forever)
(That no ones gonna love you more)
That no ones gonna love you more than I do

I didn't know life could be so cold
My baby's gone away
And left me with a broken heart
I'm falling apart
Just a kiss goodbye
But still I remember

She said
I will be with you forever
She said
I'm in love with you
She said
No no, baby, don't forget
That no one's gonna love you more than I do
You might also like
I care for you
I'm crazy
All day long I just think of you
Think of your love, yeah yeah
All I need
I'll do whatever it takes
Just please forgive me

She said
Oh yeah, I will be with you forever
She said
I'm in love with you
She said
No no no, baby, now don't forget
That no one's gonna love you more than I do


You're my dream (Oh, you're my dream)
You're my star (Ooh, my star)
You're the only one for me (The only one, the only one, for me)
How could you leave me
In the cold, all alone
I'm waiting by the phone, waiting for your call
It doesn't matter at all
She said (She said, you know, she said)
She said (She said, that she would be with me, for a very long time)
That no ones gonna love you more (No one, no one, no one's gonna love you like I do)

She said Tony, no one's gonna love you like I do
You think I believe that?
Well I did
Yo, she even left without even calling man
She just dogged me out
Yo, that's on the strength

She said
She said that she would be with me forever
She said
I'm crazy about you, baby
She said
That no one's gonna love you more

Girl I'm always thinking bout' you
But you left me and broke my heart in two
Not a kiss goodbye, just bye-bye
Still in love with you
You're my dreams
You're my star
I wanna be where you are
(That no one's gonna love you more)
She said (She said, yeah)
She said (She said, she said, I'm in love with you baby)
