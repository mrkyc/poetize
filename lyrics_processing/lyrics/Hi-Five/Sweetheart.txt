The first time I
Laid eyes on you
I knew exactly what I wanted
Thoughts of romance take up my time
But by His witness, I am haunted
(Pre-Chorus)
Your lovliness had me wrapped around your finger
It's like a perfume in the air
I can't fight this feeling
So deep down within
You got me hooked
I just can't win, girl
You might also like(Chorus)
Be my
Sweetheart (ooh, girl)
(I need ya to be, right here with me tonight)
Be my
Sweetheart (ooh, girl)
(Be mine, be my)

I lie awake
('Cause I) Just can't sleep
She won't even heal me
Girl, you know (that you)
Can be mine
Lady, we should be together
Ohhhh
(Pre-Chorus)
Your lovliness has me wrapped around your finger
It's like a perfume in the air
I can't fight this feeling
So deep down within
You've got me hooked
I just can't win, girl
(Chorus)
Be my
Sweetheart (ooh, girl)
(I need ya to be, right here with me, be my)
Be my
Sweetheart (ohh, oh, girl)
(Be mine, be my)

Daydreamin'
Taking my time with thoughts of you
I feel like a fool, 'cause it's true
I know it ain't cool
To be caught up
In a love affair that don't exist
Now I'm a frog, be my princess
Strike the kiss
Make a life-long(?) change, so alarming
Won't you be my Cinderella
And me your prince charming
What more can I say
In fact, I ripped the part
Please come to your senses
And be my sweetheart
(Pre-Chorus)
Your lovliness has me wrapped around your finger
Like a perfume in the air
I can't fight this feeling
You've got me hooked
I just can't win, girl
(Chorus)
Be my
Sweetheart
(I need ya to be, right here with me, be my)
Be my
Sweetheart (oooh, girl)
(Be mine, be mine)
Be my
Sweetheart
(be my, be my, sweetheart, girl)
She got it goin'-
Get, get goin' on
(Be mine, be my)
(Be my sweetheart)
I want ya to be, right here with me
Be my
Sweetheart
(Be mine, be my)
(Be mine, be my)
