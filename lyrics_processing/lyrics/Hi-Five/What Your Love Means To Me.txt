Romantic tonight with you
Like they do on the silver screen
I wanna make sweet love
Under the move
Let my heart feel everything

Waiting just for you
Building up emotions inside
Your tender kiss has been long
Overdue
When you touch me I just tremble inside

(and where we're headed there's no turnin' back)
Cause what I need (what I need)
