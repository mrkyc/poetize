Wooo, wooo
Wooo, wooo

It's Friday night, girl
And I'm here all alone
I can't stop dreaming
Of you at home
I love you so
And I want you to know
It's me for you
Baby, you for me
My heart belongs to you
I keep your picture by my bed every night
They bring me closer
To the feelings I have inside
You might also like(Pre-Hook)
I miss you so
Girl, I want you to know
Our love is so strong
I'll be faithful

Girl I'm so faithful (I will love you forever)
And you'll be faithful (Now we're still here together)
Girl, I'll be so faithful (I'll stay by your side)

Out on the road
There's groupies around
Trying to please me
And take me to be their own
But they don't know
That I have someone true
And I'm in love
Baby she's in love
No one else will do
Through all the rainy days and troubled times
Our hearts have conquered
First heartaches and the pain
(Pre-Hook)
I love you so
And I want you to know
Your love's so good
I'll be faithful
Girl I'm so faithful (I will love you forever)
And you'll be faithful (Now we're still here together)
Girl, I'll be so faithful (I'll stay by your side)
By your side
