Since you became my girl
I feel the special bond of love
Between you and I
The kinda love that will last forever
In the day, oh, I pray
That we will stay this way for always
?Cause we were meant to be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
You have made me realize
You're the best girl in the world
And I treasure every moment with you
I never thought that our love
Would ever be this way, I'm here to stay
You might also likeI don't wanna live without you
'Cause we were meant to be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
Baby girl, the love I have for you
Is oh so deep
Every time you touch me
I feel myself getting weak
Inseparable, you and me
Incredible, love so deep
Insatiable, can't you see
You're all that I need
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
We will be as one
As one, as one, as one, as one forever
Our love will always be forever
