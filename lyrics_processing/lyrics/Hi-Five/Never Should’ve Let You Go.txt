Girl, when I first met you, I didn't realize
You were looking to stay around but I was looking to play around
Now I can't forget you, can't forget your pretty smile
Took for granted the love you gave
And only thought of the love we made

Just when I found someone who could love me
Like the way that I need
I acted the fool and pushed her away from me

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I'll know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so (Tell you so)
That I never should have let you go

Do you think about me like I wasn't worth your time?
I would give anything I have if you give me another chance
Do you think you're better off without me?
Playing games with your heart and mind, oh yeah
I don't blame you for leaving me but now you gotta believe in me
You might also like
If you come back, girl, I promise that you'll see a change in my ways
I'll get down on my knees, I'll do anything you say

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day (Every day)
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so
That I never should have let you go

Is there someone else standing where I stood
Giving you the love you never got from me?
Girl, I would give you the world if I only could
Girl, you will see, will you come back to me
Won't you come back to me?

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I'll know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so (Tell you so)
That I never should have let you go (Oh yeah)
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
(Every night and every day)
'Cause in my heart I'll know
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so, no, I never should have let
No, I never should have let
No, I never should have let you go
