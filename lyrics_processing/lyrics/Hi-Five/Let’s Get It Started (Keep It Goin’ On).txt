You and me
Were meant to be
That's what my friends tell me
All through school
I always knew
Loving you would be reality, girl
(Pre-Hook)
Let's not wait (baby, any longer)
'Cause love's elating (the feeling's getting stronger, girl)
Don't hesitate (oh no, baby take my hand)
(Come on, baby)
(Let's get it started)

Let's get it started
Keep it goin' on, girl
Let's get it started
Let's get it, let's get it

Every guy wants it
That's why I'm tryin'
So hard to get up on it
Let me know
If another guy's around
Talk to me
'Cause I gotta know right now
(Pre-Hook)
Let's not wait (oh no, any longer, girl)
'Cause love's elating (the feeling's getting stronger, girl)

Coochie, coochie, coo
Let me tickle you
And then I'll show you all the freaky things that I could do
Then lay ya body down
Turn your frown to a smile
And I'll be there to pick you up whenever I see you down
So girl, let's get it started
You won't be broken-hearted
My love is like a (?)
I can never, never part it
You got another lover?
Well I'll play undercover
Yo T
Kick the bridge my brother

'Cause love's elating (this feeling's getting stronger, girl)
