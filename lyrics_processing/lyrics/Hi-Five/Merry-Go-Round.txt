Merry Go Rouuuuund
Ohhhhh
One, two, three
Huh
(Chorus)
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round

Whenever you walk by
I become so shy
Thinking of a way to catch your eye
When you're in my way
I don't know what to say
I'm so tired of these (games we play)
You might also like(Pre-Chorus)
I don't wanna move too soon
But I just can't stand this hangin' on
Why don't you give me a clue?
Girl, you want me and you know I want you
(Chorus)
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round

Girl I can't deny
The way I feel inside
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
The way you stop and go
You holding back, I know
I think you oughta let your (feelings show)
(Pre-Chorus)
I don't wanna move too soon
But I just can't stand this hangin' on
Why don't you give me a clue?
Girl, you want me and ya know I want you
(Chorus)
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round

A merry-go-round is a ride that will won't you
Up and down, so it feels my heart spins in a circle
I offer my love, but you trample like a stampede
What do I need to succeed
Or shall my heart bleed?
Passionate dreams of your lips as they meet mine
For the first time we caress, it's pure divine
Pleasure exceed, the rendezvous is great
But as the merry-go-round spins around
It's hard (?)
(Pre-Chorus)
I don't move too soon
But I just can't stand this hangin' on
Why don't you give me a clue?
Girl, you want me and you know I want
Youuuuu
(Chorus) x2
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round




(Chorus) x4
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round

Round and round
Girl, you've got me riding on your merry-go-round
Upside down
Round and round
