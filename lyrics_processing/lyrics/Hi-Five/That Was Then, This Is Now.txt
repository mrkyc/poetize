(Chorus)
'Cause that was then
But this is now
I'm all grown up (the new Hi-Five)
Gonna work it out
Girl, that was then (it's the new Hi-five)
But this is now
I promise you (the new Hi-Five)
Gonna work it out somehow
It's the new Hi-Five
The new Hi-Five
Girl that was then
But this is now
Girl that was then
But this is now

Oh, girl
You've been acting so strange
Tell me why
I get this feeling you've changed
And I
Wonder if it's because of me, baby
What did I do?
I know sometimes
I act as if I really don't care
Always pretending that you're not there, baby
And now I'm righting my wrongs
I'm gonna show you that I can changed
I have changed
You might also like(Chorus)
'Cause that was then
But this is now (this is now)
I'm all grown up
Gonna work it out (gonna work it out somehow)
Girl, that was then
But this is now
I promise you
Gonna work it out somehow
Ohhhhhh
(the new Hi-Five)
It's the new Hi-Five

I was young
Living my life with no concerns
It took forever for me to learn
How much I needed to benefit
From my mistakes
I never knew
Just what it meant to be a real man
Responsibilities I never had
Until you opened my eyes
You made me realize
Now I'm finally on my way, oh baby
(Chorus)
'Cause that was then
But this is now (this is now, babe)
I'm all grown up
Gonna work it out (gonna work it out somehow)
Girl, that was then
But this is now (yeah)
I promise you
Gonna work it out somehow (gonna work it out somehow)
'Cause that was then
But this is now (this is now)
I'm all grown up
Gonna work it out
Girl, that was then
But this is now (hang on in there)
I promise you
Gonna work it out

Girl from now on (I'm gonna be good to you)
(Promises that I make)
(Gonna see it through)
Don't you hesitate (If ya need me don't hesitate)
Call my name (just call on my name)
(Because I'll be there for you, baby)

Lemme hear ya say (the new Hi-Five)
Lemme hear ya say (it's the new Hi-Five)
Lemme hear ya say (the new Hi-FIve)
Lemme hear ya say (it's the new Hi-FIve)
Can't live without your love, love baby (I can't live without your love)
Do what I must to change your mind

Can't live without your love, love baby (I can't without your love, girl)
Can't live (can't live)
I can't live (can't live)
I can't live (can't live) without your love, baby
Girl that was then
But this is now (woooo)
Girl that was then
But this is now
Girl that was then
But this is now
Girl that was then
But this is now

(my soul, I let you walk right through) But this is now
(to show how much I appreciate) Girl that was then
But this is now
(all the love you've given me) Girl that was then
(you released my bind, you set me free) But this is now
(what would I do if you went away, baby) Girl that was then
But this is now

(Chorus)
Cause that was then
But this is now (this is now)
I'm all grown up
Gonna work it out (gonna work it out somehow, baby)
Girl, that was then
But this is now (I'm a a man, now)
I promise you (I'm a man)
Gonna work it out
The new Hi-Five
'Cause that was then
But this is now (this is now, baby)

Gonna work it out
Girl, that was then
