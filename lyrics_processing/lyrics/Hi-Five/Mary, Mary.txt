She look like she
Got it going on
Got it going on
Which one is that?
Mary Ann, Mary Jo?
Naw
Mary, Mary
Mary Mary
Make me run
Make me come to ya
Kick it now

Mary Mary
What's that secret you hide?
If I could know just what you do to me
I love the way you look away when I smile at ya
I love the way you bring me to my knees

Every day
It I get a little more attracted
You make me feel so strong
I'm not shy
You know i like to make it happen
Why do I wait so long?
Mary

Mary, Mary
Make me run
Make me come to ya
I wanna see you dancing in my dreams
Mary, Mary
Make me love
Make me run for you
You turn me on so much you make me stream
You turn me
You turn me
You turn me
Check out this verse>
Mary, Mary
Let me into your world
You know I know you've got another side
Don't tell me that you're just a shy little girl, Mary
Don't tell me that you won't go for a ride
(Pre-Hook)
Every day
I get more infatuated
I can't think of no one else, Mary

Mary, Mary
Make me run
Make me come to ya
I wanna see you dancing in my dreams
Mary, Mary
Make me love
Make me run for ya
You turn me on so much you make me stream
Come on, Mary
Awwww yeah
Mary

Actin' real shy, but you runnin' a game
Playing like you don't hear me calling ya name
A wink of your eye and I'm going insane
And every night my dream
Is the same
Yeah, I see you in my dreams in the dark of the night
Taking a nibble, taking a bite
Of my love
Why ya look me straight in the eyes
And prove it to me that you ain't really shy, Mary

I know I
I could be sorry that I waited
But only time will tell

Make me run
Make me come to ya
I wanna see you dancing in my dreams

Make me love
Make me run for ya
You turn me on so much you make me stream
Mary, Mary
Make me run
Make me come to ya
I wanna see you dancing in my dreams
Mary, Mary
Make me love

You turn me on so much you make me stream
Mary, Mary
Make me run
