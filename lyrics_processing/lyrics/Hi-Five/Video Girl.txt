And you will always
Be my

Oh what a day
I'm so in love
And she's exactly what I've been dreaming of
She stole my heart
Before I knew
No doubt about it, she's a dream come true
(Pre-Hook)
You look so good on the tv screen (oooh, you look so good)
Come bring your loving to me
(I wanna hold you in my arms) All night
(Baby we can swing)
(I want you to be my)

Video girl (girl, you look good to me)

What will it take to win your heart?
I'll do anything to get next to you
All you gotta do is say the word, girl
And I'll come running
Running to you, baby

Yo
Here we go with the new shabang swing
Like the Tiger says, "It's grrrreat"
Video girls all around us swingin' while we're singing
Yo video girl! (yeah)
Come here, cutie
Lemme tell you that I like
The way you do ya things, 'cause it's phat
Yo, I kinda got the ways that I wanna get next to you
Yo and I hope you feel the same too
You look good when you sway, yo
Walking up and down the video screen makes me say
I wanna get to know you better
Take long walks in the park and chit-chatter
And after the night is through
How 'bout me and you, a little rendezvous?
Yo, it's very easy to put you into my world
'Cause you're my video girl
Video girl (girl, you look so good)
Video girl (on the tv screen)
