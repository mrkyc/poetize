Woahhh
Yeah, babe
Yeah
I'm in need
I-
I-

How can lonliness be such a big part of my life?
I've got fame, but there's emptiness
No one to bring me joy inside
I can't take this feeling no more
You're just what I've been looking for
Please don't turn and walk away
Won't you hear me when I say

(I'm in need)
I'm in need of a love
(And it's you) that I'm thinking of
You might also like(I'm in need)
I'm in need of a love
(And it's you) that I'm thinking of

I
Feel your sweetness
Every time I look into your eyes
Love and happiness
Yes, I've learned that's something money can't buy
I can't shake this feeling no more
Do me baby, like never before
Love me forever
And a day
Won't you promise me you'll stay with me, baby
