(Chorus)
Whenever you say you want me
Whenever you say you need me
Whenever you say you want me, ya gonna get all of me

I want you to want me
But I don't wanna rush you
So baby, let's take it nice and slow
And wait
Until you know just what you wanna do
Take your time and think it over 'cause its never too late
(Pre-Chorus)
We patient as I can be, but in all honesty
I don't want our love to go 'round and 'round, oh no
But I respect ya baby
So take as long as you want
Girl
(Chorus)
Whenever you say you want me (Whenever you say you want me)
Whenever you say you need me
(I'm) Gonna be there for you
(And I'll never say that time's been wasted)
('Cause) Whenever you say you want me, ya gonna get all of me
You might also like
I don't take pride in being the kind
To move too fast
Overnight love ain't the type of love to last
And I will never pressure you
'Cause there's more to makin' love than one night can do
(Pre-Chorus)
I'm patient as I can be, but in all honesty
I don't want our love to go 'round and 'round, oh no
But I respect ya baby
So take as long as you want
Girl
(Chorus)
Whenever you say you want me (Whenever you say you want me)
Whenever you say you need me
(I'm) Gonna be there for you
(And I'll never say that time's been wasted)
('Cause) Whenever you say you need me, ya gonna get all of me
(Aw yeah) Whenever you say
Whenever you say
Whenever you say you want me (Whenever you say, girl)
Whenever you say
Whenever you (Say you want me)
Whenever you say
Whenever you say
Whenever you say you want me
Whenever you say you want me, (Ya gonna get all of me)

Honey you got a man
Willing to understand
That us loving eachother ain't somethin' thats gotta
Happen overnight
Baby you got my love
Tony don't ask for much
And I'll wait right here for you
(Until the time is right)
Whenever you say
Whenever you say
(Whenever you say, girl) Whenever you say you need me
Whenever you say
