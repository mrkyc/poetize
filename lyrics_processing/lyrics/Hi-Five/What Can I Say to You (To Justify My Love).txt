Babygirl, do you have a moment?
'Cause you and I need to have a
Talk
Ya been doubtin' everything that I'm saying
And I
Do
And that ain't cool
Do I need a reason?

How can you
Say that you
Doubt my love
When I show you each and every day
Just because
I go out
With my boys
Don't mean that I'm out on the chase
Tell me why
