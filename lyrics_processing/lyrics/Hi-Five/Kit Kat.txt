Excuse the freakiness
But girl I must confess
I can't stop thinking 'bout the love we make
In the morning I awake
Still turned on from the other day
And my mind it plays, yeah
(Pre-Chorus)
The way your body shivers when I deliver
The sounds you make when I enter
Never been so exciting, so inviting, yeah
It's never enough
That's why I'm asking you just to
(Chorus)
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that
And I promise you that I won't let it go to waste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Can't wait to get in that
Girl just let me get a taste
You might also likeBreak me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that
And I promise you that I won't let it go to waste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Relax and just kick back
While I take you to that place

And I don't know what it is
Exactly
But it is
Inside you
'Cause from the first time I was done
Never thought I'd be the one
That'll fiend for you everyday
But it's just that way
(Pre-Chorus)
Girl you got that bomb
Damn, it's so lethal
Where does it come from?
Should be illegal
Girl just break me off some, yeah
Of that chocolate, babe
It's never enough
That's why I'm asking you to just
(Chorus)
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that
And I promise you that I won't let it go to waste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Can't wait to get in that
Girl just let me get a taste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that
And I promise you that I won't let it go to waste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Relax and just kick back
While I take you to that place

Can't fight this thing for (nothing)
Gotta keep it (coming)
Kissing and we're (hugging)
Pushing and we're (shoving)
Neighbors think we (buggin')
Breaking stuff and (hollerin')
Ain't no need for (rushing)
(That Pink Ciroc is kicking in)
While the music's (bumping)
Taking all my (loving)
All over I'm (touching)
'Bout to hit the (spot again)
Feel your body (jumpin')
Ooh this cat is something
Break me off that chocolate loving
(Chorus)
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that
And I promise you that I won't let it go to waste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Can't wait to get in that
Girl just let me get a taste
Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
Sweet chocolate, I'm with that

Not a drip or a drop
Is you high

Girl you got me on lock
And I'm open
Let me taste
On your spot
I won't waste
Not a drip or a drop
Is you high
I won't stop
Girl you got me on lock
And I'm open
Let me taste
On your spot
I won't waste
Not a drip or a drop
Is you high
I won't stop
Girl you got me on lock
And I'm open

Break me off a piece of that kit-kat
