(Chorus)
They call you rag doll
But to me you're a superstar
Don't care what the older guys may say
('Cause I love you just the way you are)
They call you rag doll
But to me, you're a superstar
Don't care what the older guys may say
(Because I love you just the way you are)

You're always hangin' by yourself
Alone in school every single day
In the lunch room I tried to sit by you
But you got up and walked away, ooh
I know you feel as I do
When I catch you staring at me
I wanna carry your books home from school
But you (?)
(Pre-Chorus)
You know I want you girl
You know I need you girl
I got the key to your heart
Please let me into your world
You might also like(Chorus)
They call you rag doll
But to me you're a superstar
Don't care what the older guys may say
('Cause I love you just the way you are)
They call you rag doll
But to me, you're a superstar
Don't care what the older guys may say
(Because I love you just the way you are)
I don't know why all the guys always teasing you
I think they bored with their self, need sum'n to do
Lemme tell you a 'lil secret, you're a superstar
And won't give 'em no play
So they call you rag doll

Your love is like a flower
That blossom in the Summer time
You get sun rich each and ever day
Please say that you'll be mine
I want you for my girlfriend
And I'm sure you feel the same
Love me
You're with me
So don't pour it down the drain
(Pre-Chorus)
You know that I want you girl
You know that I need you girl
I got the key to your heart
Please let me into your world
(Chorus)
They call you rag doll
But to me you're a superstar
I don't care what the older guys may say
('Cause I love you just the way you are)
They call you rag doll
But to me, you're a superstar
I don't care what the older guys may say
(Because I love you just the way you are)
