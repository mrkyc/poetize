Verse 1:
I can tell by the look in her eyes
That she's into me
Cuz when she passes by and say "Hi"
I can tell by her smile
That she's shy as can be (She's playin')
I don't think she can see my crush on her
But I can feel her crush on me
Chorus:
She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit, oo yeah
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playin' hard

Even though she hasn't said a word
I bet she's glad I'm readin' her mind

And all that she doesn't say
Oh I'm sure
I see it in her eyes
