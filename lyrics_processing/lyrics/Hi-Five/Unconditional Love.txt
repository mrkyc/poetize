Swim the deepest sea
I would cross the desert land
I would do anything
For your love. Yeah
(Unconditional love)
Oh, oh, oh
I need unconditional love
Baby, once is not enough (No)
I can't live without your love (Oh, yeah)
Sent from the heavens up above
Unconditional love

Some people say that I'm just an old fashioned guy
But I believe in love and all that it means
I can never say no, to anything that you ask
And I really hope that you would do the same for me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How far will you go?

It's about trust and honesty
And that's the way it's supposed to be
Unconditional love (How far will you go, girl)
It's about time (Time) and sacrifice (Sacrifice)
We pay the price (Do or die), it's do or die
Unconditional love (Unconditional love)
