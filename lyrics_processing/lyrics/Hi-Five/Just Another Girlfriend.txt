Woo!
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
(all she ever was, baby)

Oh girl
Listen
I wanna know
The things that she's been saying 'bout me
And you
It's all lies, but she's got you to believin'
You and I are cheating
Took her out maybe or twice
Not too long ago
I told her then and I'll tell you now
She's just another girlfriend (just another girlfriend)
(Chorus)
Oh, girl (I don't care)
Listen (what she says)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
You might also likeGirl (can't you see?)
Baby (the jealousy)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)

When I'm
Missing
She comes around
And drops a line or two about me
To you
It ain't right, but she's got you to believin'
I would mess around
Your friends are saying that I'm no good
You can never believe what I say
But if the truth is all that you want
You running with the wrong ones (running with the wrong ones)
(Chorus)
Oh, girl (I don't care)
Listen (what she says)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
Girl (can't you see?)
Baby (the jealousy)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
You know that I
Like to have my fun
And you know that I wouldn't fool around
And if I did, she wouldn't be the one (around, around, baby)

Don't pay her no mind
When she's talking all of that trash
'Cause all she ever was a girlfriend from my past
And I don't care what she says
She barely knows her name
And if she drops mine again
She's got to be insane
All she ever
All she ever was, baby
All she ever
A-A-All she ever was
All she ever
All she ever was, baby
All she ever
A-A-All she ever was
Your friends are saying that I'm no good
You can never believe what I say
But if the real truth, baby, is what you want
You running with the wrong ones (running with the wrong ones)
(Chorus) x2
Oh, girl (I don't care)
Listen (what she says)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
Girl (can't you see?)
Baby (the jealousy)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
Girl (I don't care)
Listen (what she says)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
Girl (can't you see?)
Baby (the jealousy)
(All she ever was) was (just another girlfriend)
