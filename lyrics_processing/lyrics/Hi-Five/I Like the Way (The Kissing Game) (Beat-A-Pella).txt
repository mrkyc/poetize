Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

All summer long
We've been together
And I never felt so good
'Cause when I'm with you
It's such a good time - yes, it is
And when you get next to me
You make my heartbeat fast
You throw me back when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
'Cause I can't get enough
'Cause I

(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day
You might also like
We've got it good
We have it all it seems
We're living dream, yeah
This is our time
This wasn't meant to be (I like)
Just you and me (I like)
This is still new
We're still young in heart
Can break in two
But I know our love will always be there
(Forever and ever)
