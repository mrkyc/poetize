She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She had just about succeeded
When that low-down, no-good cheatin'
Good-for-nothing came strutting through the crowd

Oh, he was laying it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his never-ending love
Oh, but I never will forget
When she stood up and said
"So I guess you think we're just gonna kiss and make up, don't you?"
That's when she said

Why don't you kiss (Kiss), hey, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and you (Me and you), we're through (We're through)
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss (Kiss) this goodbye
You might also like
Well, the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

Well, it was just about now
That the crowd gathered 'round
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She reared back and she let him have it again, man
She said, she said

Why don't you kiss (Kiss), hey, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Hey, me and you (Me and you), we're through (We're through)
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this (Kiss)
Hey, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
And me and you (Me and you), we're through (We're through)
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this (Kiss) goodbye
