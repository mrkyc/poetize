I guess now is a good time to tell the truth
The pedigree I carry will swallow you
But I am not what you are
I'm flawless in every way
Bird's eye view
And I'm watching you
Sad, sad sight for the sore, sore eyes
And a headache for the weakest of minds
You've got the boys, the boys all tongue tied
But I know they're wasting their time
Go, go

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Oh just imagine what I thought when I opened up that door
It was a million things to one
And oh, just imagine what they'll think
When they see me lead you north
Hell, they'll be losing sleep
And you're wrong
Wrong
You might also like
You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

It's so wrong
So wrong
It's so wrong
You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your...

You can be the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You'll be the distance in between
You'll be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Jealous minds they think alike
You're a damn damn tie
You're wasting all my time
You are in love
Jealous minds they think alike
You're a damn damn tie
You're wasting all my time
