Winter blues in summer time
Yeah, that's not me, and that's not my vibe
Nothing but a temporary high
Holding on to what's not mine
You know that I don't know these parts
Achilles' heel, a tourist from the start
I don't know much but I do know this

Now it's 3AM and you're calling me up again
And you wanna know if I meant every word that I said
You should go home, but you just got a taste of the midnight air
You should go home, go home, but you wanna come here

Man, I just need a clean break
Don't wait around for me to change
I'll do this at my own pace and separate the real from fake
I'll be a stand-by in a haze

Now it's 3AM and you're calling me up again
And you wanna know if I meant every word that I said
You should go home, but you just got a taste of the midnight air
You should go home, go home, but you wanna come here
You might also like
I look through my contacts and I say
I hope that we're on the same page
I don't want no complications
Just make it easy for me to feel
And I don't want no complications
And just make it easy for me to feel

Now it's 3AM and you're calling me up again
And you wanna know if I meant every word that I said
You should go home, but you just got a taste of the midnight air
You should go home, go home, but you wanna come here

Nothing but a temporary high
Nothing but a temporary high
Nothing but a temporary high
Nothing but a temporary high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
