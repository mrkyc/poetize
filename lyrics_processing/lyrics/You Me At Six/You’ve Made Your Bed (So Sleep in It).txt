I'm so glad that your lipstick's on
Back seat of your best friend's car
Well, we were onto something here
Oh no, wait you will call it off and space is on the cards
Who'd drink to that? I won't drink to that
Oh, over hill will you teach me the games that you play so well
And I'll drink to that, who'll drink to that?

You've made your bed, so sleep in it, but never call me again
You've made your bed, so sleep with him
But know I'm the best you'll get
I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone
Can't blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more

Here's a list of the things you said and I won't get over it
You want to know, you, want to know and
The games that girls will play
Makes me move away so I can train
Train myself to trust again
Oh, over hill will you teach me the games you play so well and
I'll drink to that, will you drink to that?

You've made your bed, so sleep in it, but never call me again
You've made your bed, so sleep with him
But know I'm the best you'll get
I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone
Can't blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more
You might also like
Are you on or off? You on or...?
Are you on or off? You on or...?

I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone
Can't blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more

These words will convince you to never love me again
You want to be friends, but I won't do it
These words will convince you to never sleep with me again
