Everybody loves the original
Everybody's got time to be cynical
Old enough to know better by now
It's the greatest joke, don't go letting me down
Hold my drink, this just got physical
I'm on a new wave, it's getting visceral
I'm going toe to toe to see how you go
I'm in pain, so yes, it is painful

Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song, sing a sad song, won't you?
Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And it's a fresh start fever
Who wouldn't want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

As for now I reserve judgement
Until these chains, chains are redundant
The brave die young, and that's alright for some
But I'm after something long term, long term
Let's make resolutions
I've only got problems and no solutions
You're just someone to the road
But you're the world to someone else, so don't you
You might also like
Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song, sing a sad song, won't you?
Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And it's a fresh start fever
Who wouldn't want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger


You're a hard act to follow, so I stare down this empty bottle
But there's no message at the bottom, so how do I solve it?
I'm a hard act to follow, I know it sinks in slow
Shallow is as shallow does, keeping track on all those scars
I said you've got a chip on your shoulder, getting worse now you're older
Getting hard now you're sober, there's your life it's fucking over

And it's a fresh start fever
Who wouldn't want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger
And it's a fresh start fever
Who wouldn't want to be here?
Welcome to the future
