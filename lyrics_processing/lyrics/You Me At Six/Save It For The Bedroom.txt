Keep your hands to yourself
These lips belong to someone else
And you know that you will never get on it, it
Keep your lies to yourself
Every lie, you heard from someone else
And you know that you will never get on it, it
Well, I sussed you good, you knew I would
No, haven't you heard?
You're just a mark on my shirt
Another night and another girl, whoa
But I taste so good, well, you knew I would

So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
And I hope you don't

Go home and wash your jeans 'cause there's dirt on the knees
Your jealously doesn't sit with me
You love, I love you too
Below the waist I'll start charging you
'Cause that's just how the players play the game
My winning streak is missing
You might also like
So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
And I hope you don't
So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
And I hope you don't

And you whore...
