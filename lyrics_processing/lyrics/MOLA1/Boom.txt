The flow cold as the wind blows when it snows in the mitten. (No kiddin)
I'm tired of rappers yapping about pulling iron out and flipping birds
They should apply at diners, go and flip some burgers
Verses served by the slice, Katana diced up
Your honor, it's not a problem darling just turn my mic up
Exhibit A B and C? This is exhibit D
I'm reading over the shoulder of the Statue of Liberty
Look what she's given me...I hold the torch to my heart
To spark the pilot light of the fire that lives in me
Your next witness please. A flawless victory of authenticity
You're all guilty of trying to spit with me
The bittersweet symphony...breaking and building me
Living vicariously through sound, silence is killing me
Back in the day "what's in" would try to limit me
That was then...history, that was them...this is me
Boom
Boom
At the end of the day, it's night time (true) and it's time to get paid
I'll get it one way or another with a rhyme, or this face
I make haste when I get me a taste
And the sweetest revenge is success when it's served cold on a plate

I'm murdering everyone, I'm making my Mark. Thanks for playing a part
Good looks bro, you're going right in the foot notes...
"The Life and Times" ...My autobiographical book flow
Start with a good quote and leave em shook at the end...
No different than how it ever goes, I'm good with a pen
I'm the center of attention. Why you looking at them?
Self, centered. I'm achieving my Zen
I'm even keeled in descent. I could bend the space and time continuum
In this sentence and reappear at the beginning so we'll be here again
So never fear, for the time that we share's neither here, nor there
It's everywhere...from beginning to end
Boom
Boom
