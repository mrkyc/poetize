In a world of sin
No rest for my weary soul
But then I met a man
Who said He'd be my friend
All my burdens He did roll
God took those worldly desires
Gave me heavenly fires
Now I've got a brand new goal
And since I've met this man
Called Jesus Christ
I've got the joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy in my heart, joy in my soul
Joy since that happy day
Joy in my hands, joy in my feet
Joy in every way
God took those worldly desires
Gave me heavenly fires
Now I've got a brand new goal
And since I've met this man
Called Jesus Christ
I've got the joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy
Joy, joy, joy
Joy, joy, joy
Joy
