In my heart and in my mind
I will pass the glory curtain
And I'll leave this world behind
I will stand with the immortal
With the happy land in view
Then I'll journey through the portals
Down the golden avenue
I'm gonna leave some glorious morning
Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm gonna cross the chilly Jordan
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Though the water is deep and the river is wide
I'm gonna stand on the other side
I'm gonna live in heaven someday
Yes, I am, yes, I am
I am waiting at the station
Listening closely for the call
I have made my reservation
Through the One who paid it all
Not by might, not by power
But in Christ and Christ alone
I'm leaving any moment
Praise the lord I'm going home
