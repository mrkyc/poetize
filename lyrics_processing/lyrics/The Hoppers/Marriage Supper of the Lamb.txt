Each day it's getting harder
To cross this burning sand
Still, I know there's cool clear water up ahead
Where the dying soul of man shall soon be fed
And then He'll spread the welcome table
And I'll feast on heavenly manna
And my brand new wedding garment I shall wear
And I'll cry, "Holy, Holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
And I'll shout "Hallelujah, glory!"
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb
And I'll cry, "Holy, Holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
And I'll shout "Hallelujah, glory!"
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb
As the bride adorned
In garments white and clean waits
In great anticipation to behold The King
The celebration has begun and now's the time
He'll say "Welcome my beloved come and dine"
