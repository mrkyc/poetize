You're standing on holy ground"
But grace put shoes on the prodigal Son
What mercy what pardon he found
Jesus is the door that opens up to heaven
He died to take the sinners place
But if you ever get to walk on in
You gotta go by grace
Works don't matter
At the foot of the cross
Jesus paid it all, you see
Salvation is free to any and all
Who will just trust and believe
That veil tore down
From the top to the bottom
To open up the holy place
But if you ever get to walk on in
You gotta go by grace
That old tabernacle had a place for the priest
To offer sacrifices for sin
The law said the people had to stay out
But grace says come on in
Jesus shed His blood once and for all
To open up a better way
But if you ever get to walk on in
You gotta go by grace
