The limited sport will leave a spot on me
Early in the morning, I've given up with sleep
I'm in need of attention but all I hear is my heart beat
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
His spastic aspirations would make a man of me
Bulging from his brain, such sensitivity
Monsters of the present are the monsters of the past
Took a look in your lyric book, your head's right up your arse
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
Ooh-ooh ah oh-oh (You've got it, I want it, you want it, I've got it)
It's unbelievable
The way you've got it all
It seems improbable
Oh, Oh
The inner-city fauna is crawling round your feet
I've never really noticed how your eyebrows seem to meet
In perpetual fear of being swallowed whole
Beached in the suburbs in the body of a whale
