Girl, you must be tired
Cause you've been running
Through my mind all day, and
The more I try to think of other things
Your memory jumps right in the way
And I can't get no work done
There's no way or can I run my train

These two thumbs
All go on home, curl up with you
And talk about this picture perfect love
But I better setistrate, and try to
Concentrate on the work I have to do

I should be working overtime, but I
Just can't wait to see the side of you
Girl, you must be tired
Cause you've been running
Through my mind all day, and
The more I try to think of other things
Your memory jumps right in the way
And I can't get no work done
There's no way or can I run my train
Of thought derails that you embrace
Girl, you must be tired
Cause you've been running
Through my mind all day

Oh, girl you must be tired, cause you've
