I ain't got any weight that I can't pull
Right now I know that anything is possible
I'm gonna bang my drum
Blow my horn
I forget what these pills were ever for
An' I believe I won't need them anymore
I used to burn candles at both ends
Now I just throw the whole damn thing right in
Now playing traffic is easy
Once you learn where you get in
You wanna come with me
Then get on board
Now get in or get out
Use either door
The future's calling
An' it's me that it's looking for
'Cause it feels like summer again
(Feels like summer with you)
I was thinking that it just might never begin
After winter and spring
It's good to have the sun on my face again

I know I do
I ain't envious of anybody's shoes
I wear em' loose
Yeah maybe that's why it bothers you
I'm building my ship stick by stick
And where the waters get rough I'm getting in
The motion of the waves
It does not make me sick
'Cause it feels like summer again
(Feels like summer with you)
I was thinking that it just might never begin
After winter and spring
It's good to have the sun on my face again
I buried my horse in a shallow a grave
And I said few things
I had champagne
Now that beast gave me everything that nobody gave
An' I got high hopes
Tomorrow came
I won't look back on anything
I just found out
That my bird can really sing
And it feels like summer again
(Feels like summer with you)
I was thinking that it just might never begin
After winter and spring
(Feels like summer with you)
It's good to have the sun on my face again
It feels like summer again
(Feels like summer with you)
I was thinking that it just might never begin
After winter and spring
(Feels like summer with you)
