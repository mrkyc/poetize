Fire on the porch on a summer's night
All my things are there inside
Black smoke rise up
Now burn on, burn higher
I smell leaves and burning tires
Dogs in the meadows barking wild
Blackbird rise up
Now tell me what have you done

I'm not drunk and I'm not sad
There's nothing inside that I want back
Let me touch your lips
Let me see where you're at
Do you wonder how I am tonight
Don't lose time looking in my eyes
Not every tear means you're gonna cry

From the bottom of my heart
Comes a cold dark feeling
There is nothing but dust
In the layers I'm peeling
From the bottom of my heart
Beats a rattling drum
We're coming up from the depths
Into the rays of the sun

Now under crushing skies of grays
Paralyzed with phantom pains
Before this room became just a place
Where I just sleep through endless days
Spinning webs and carving names
Where thoughts break up, exploding in space

But I once crossed a quarter mile
Through black pools of razor wires
Cut through steel with the edge of a file
While singing rhapsodies in stride
Hellbent and dignified
But my time has come
Who ya fooling and why?

From the bottom of my heart
Comes a cold dark feeling
Oh, there is imminent death
To the promise I'm keeping
From the bottom of my heart
Comes an army of one
Marching back up the steps
Into the rays of the sun
Pale-faced and hollowed eyes
Buried under ruptured skies
Not every smile means I'm laughing inside
Two-faced and compromised
I've enraptured you with lies
Where everything means nothing and tonight everything is mine

From the bottom of my heart
Comes a cold dark feeling
I have buried so much
In the layers I'm peeling
From the bottom of my heart
A battle will come
Marching back up the steps
To the rays of the sun
From the bottom of my heart
Comes a cold dark feeling
Wrapped around tight
With no sign of leaving
From the bottom of my heart
A ballad is sung
Through a whisper she comes
