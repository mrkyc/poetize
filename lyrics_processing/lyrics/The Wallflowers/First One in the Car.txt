Someone's gonna break yours too
You'll laugh in the middle of getting it done
And having it done to you
I see the neck of the driver behind the wheel
You're looking at me in the side view mirror
You're changing your clothes
In the backseat you slip
From a girl to a woman in less than a minute
As we roll from the city under the stars
And go on down the boulevard
Say may God be the first one in the car
May he be the last one out of ours
Moonlight shining on a Lincoln's hood
Full of smoke and your perfume
You're thinking you might
I was hoping you would
Do just what your mother doesn't think you should
Now past the building where your father works
And the topless bars and the church
I ain't superstitious but it's making me nervous
Now shouldn't we at least say something first?

And go on down the boulevard
Say may God be the first one in the car
May he be the last one out of ours
As we come down from wishing the city will start making use of our open arms
Say may God be the first one in the car
May he be the last one out of ours
On to the off-ramp with my coat around you
May love be down there and ride with us too
Be happy to die with you here doing this
The impression of my face down on your lips
As we roll from the city under the stars
And go on down the boulevard
Say may God be the first one in the car
May he be the last one out of ours
As we come down from wishing the city will stop making use of these open hearts
Say may God be the first one in the car
May he be the last one out of ours
The last one out of ours
The last one out of ours
