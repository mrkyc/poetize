You got to move now before she explodes
Now look out the window and out below
Now back away from the glass
Well there she blows
The city's been leveled
The hills are in flames
The streets cracked open and they're pushing up clay
The temperature's dropped
The sky is grey
And it ain't even over
Here comes drivin' rain
It ain't me
That you feel
There's something moving around in here
Now that's blood
That's tears
This ain't a warning...
Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
'Cause you won't be here again
Everybody out of the water

Looking for a low spot or something to cling to
There's too many bodies
There's not enough room
God help me and God help you
They say nobody panic
Help is on its way
We're already on it
You got to be brave
If you can fix it now then don't make us wait
Man they ain't nobody coming
Back away from the case
That bell that you hear
Well that's hell ringing in your ears
I fear, that my dear
This ain't a warning...
Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
'Cause you won't be here again
Well I loved you then
Like I love you now
That won't matter anyhow
Well this is the new frontier
Everybody out of the water
Now I'm looking up and the shit keeps coming
Like shooting ducks in a barrel of honey
Got to learn how to pray
Love won't be enough
Admit it now: your information sucks
As I slip
Down in
I think of us someplace high on a mountain
Smoke clears
The fog lifts
Little by little we rebuild again
Until then...
Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
'Cause you won't be here again
Now I loved you then
Like I love you now
It won't matter any how
Well This is the new frontier
Everybody out of the water
Everybody out of the water
