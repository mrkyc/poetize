Break free from the
Wood of a coffin
If I need
But nothin's hard
As gettin' free from places
I've already been
I've been
Waist-deep In the
Burnin' meadows
Of my mind
In the engine
In cold December
Shootin' fire
From the hose
Now
Turn off your lights
Cause I'm
Not comin' home
'Til I'm delivered
For the first time
I was
First-born to a
Parade That follows
In rows
Down a narrow
Cold black river
Faceless shadows
Movin' slow
See The Wallflowers LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also likeI would
Move swift
When the
Sounds of a trumpet
Would blow
I've been the puppet
I've been the strings
I know the vacant face it brings
Now
The bells of curfew
They may ring before I'm through
But soon I'll be delivered
For the first time
You might
Keep clean
In the back of an angel motorcade
It doesn't matter
Who walks in you know
The joke is still the same
You'll just
Wake up like a
Disposable lover
Decomposed
I've been gone
I've been remembered
I've been alive
I've been a ghost
So now
Downtown explodes
I'll still
Be on this road
'Til I'm delivered
For the first time
I have
Drawn blood from the
Neckline
When vampires were in fashion
You know I'd
Even learn to cut my throat
If I thought I could fit in
Cause I
I once heard that you gotta learn
How to blend in
To this mess
Where nothin's hard
Nothin's precious
And nothin's smooth
Or flawless
Now
No more amused
Just
Screaming to
Be delivered
For the first time
Now I'm
Ten miles in the
Deep and the mighty
Blue sea
Looking back
Towards a long white beach
Burnin' up into yellow flames
And I just
Wave back like a little boy up on a pony
In a show
Cause I can't fix
Something this complex
Any more than I can build a rose
So just keep on letting go
Cause I
Must be close
To being delivered
For the first time
Now I'd
Rather bleed out a long stream from being lonely
And feel blessed
Than drown
Laying face down
In a puddle of respect
I was
Once lost in the corridors of the arena
In blindfolds
I've been the bull
I've been the whip
I just pulled down the matador
So now
Turn on your lights
Cause I'm
Comin' home
I've been delivered
