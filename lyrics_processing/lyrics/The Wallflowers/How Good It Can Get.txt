Use your words don't yell so much
I don't understand a word that you're saying
Now move in and come up close
You look like you maybe seen a ghost
Now tell me has someone gotten to you baby
Now open your arms
And pick up your head
And open your eyes
So you can see what happens next
You won't believe just how good it can get
We'll make a lover out of you yet
The fog is so thick I can't see my hands
Got much worse soon as I got in
I know you're somewhere here in the water
It's ten feet deep and the river won't stop
I'll tell you what's in it when I make it across
You could make it too if you let someone help you
Yeah but you gotta give in
When you gotta let go
Then you can begin
To come up slow like a desert rose

Now take a deep breath and hold it in tight
Put your face up right into the light
Oh can't you feel that full moon shining down on you?
Help is coming from the great unknown
Just maybe not when you needed it most
'Cause I can see you already know that you're leaving
But I wish you'd stay and just let me in
'cause everything can change
But you gotta be ready 'cause you won't know when
You won't believe just how good it can get
We'll make a lover out of you yet
(You won't believe how good it gets)
You won't believe just how good it can get
We'll make a lover out of you yet
(You won't believe how good it gets)
You won't believe how good it's gonna get
We're gonna make a lover... out of you yet
(You won't believe how good it gets)
