We did not pull through
You shouldn't blame me
I don't blame you
Now what else did you think that I would do?
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
I'm so tired of waking up feeling bad
You haven't been the kind of place I have
Could it hurt you now to let this pass?
Oooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
You want to make it so much harder
Now in another world I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead
The way you make me feel I could collapse
An epidemic I cannot outlast
How could you feel used when I feel trapped?
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
And just as my conscience starts to clear
I drag the river and you're still there
The way I bring you down could not compare
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough

But 'til then I'm here making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead
The way I sleep this bed just can't be made
I pull the covers up around my head
Now when I think of me I think of somebody else instead
As if it wasn't hard enough
You're gonna make it so much harder
Now in another world I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here making room for new regrets

Now some flowers they never bloom
