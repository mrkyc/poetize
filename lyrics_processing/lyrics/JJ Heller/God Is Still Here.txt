What if I forget the lyrics to the chorus of the song I wrote?
What if my daughter gets a fever while I'm out here on the road?
What if this kind of life I lead is damaging in ways I do not know?

What if I can never find a place where I can truly be myself?
What if I never chase my dreams and leave them sitting on the shelf?
What if I already missed my prime and get passed by for someone else?

What if the world doesn't end when the fears come true?
What if we have what we need to make it through?
There is manna from heaven and mercies new
What if God is still here in this desert too?

Every morning I am full of hope like Lazarus up from the grave
But by the time I fall in bed I'm burdened by a heavy weight
From picking up what isn't mine 'til I feel like there's no escape

What if I believed that God would meet me in my trouble and my pain
And all the truth that's in my head would move down to my heart and then
I shall not want for anything and finally be at peace again

What if the world doesn't end when the fears come true?
What if we have what we need to make it through?
There is manna from heaven and mercies new
What if God is still here in this desert too?


What if all my life I wrestle with my worry and anxiety?
What if the thorn deep in my side is only there to help me see
That though I never ask for it, the desert is God's gift to me?

What if the world doesn't end when the fears come true?
What if we have what we need to make it through?
There is manna from heaven and mercies new
What if God is still here in this desert?
