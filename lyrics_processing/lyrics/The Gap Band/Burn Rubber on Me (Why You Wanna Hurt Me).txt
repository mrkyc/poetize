(Car screeches)
Woo!
Gave you my money, I gave you my time
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Are you serious? I'm just curious
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Never ever had a love who put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlene
Oh, no, no, no
You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Then you upped and ran away
And made me just go crazy
I never ever had a love who put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlene
Oh, no, no, no
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?

You told me to go up the block
To get you a strawberry pop
When I got back to the flat
You had burned rubber at the bat
Went to the closet and saw no clothes
All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother
And told me you had burned rubber on me, Charlene
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Like the clock on the wall said ding-dong-dong
Got to find another lover that won't be gone
She won't put the pedal to the metal and burn rubber
