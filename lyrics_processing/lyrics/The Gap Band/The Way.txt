Where nothing's ever on my mind
We can do it when you're near
And you tell me you'll be always there
Whoa-whoa-whoa, take me
Take me on into your heart
(Mm-hmm)
Where rivers flow with peaceful joy and love
We can do it when you're near
And you tell me you'll be always there
Whoa-whoa-whoa, come on
Come and walk with me
(Together)
Where peaceful waters flow
Come and go with me
We won't come back no more
And this is the way for you and me
(It's the way)
This is the way, got no sympathy
(It's the way)
This is the way, it's the way for you
(It's the way)
It's the way for me, yeah

Until I see a smile upon your face
I've got to see a pretty smile
You've got to show me that you really care, oh...

(Mm-hmm)
Until you finally tell me you're my girl
I want to see a pretty smile
You've got to show me that you really care
Oh-whoa-whoa, come on, mmm...

Together hand in hand
(Oh-oh, come on)
