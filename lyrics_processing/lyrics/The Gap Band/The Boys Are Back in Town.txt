Back at home again
Reminiscing good old times
The things that happened then
Standing in a summer breeze
Whistling in the tall oak trees
No one here but the guys and me
The boys are back in town
Drifted into town one day
My, how things had changed
Skyscrapers and parking lots
Boy, it's a shame
How music calls you to your fame
Get out there and play its game
Come back home the whole town is strange
The boys are back again
Hear me say, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na, na
The boys are back in town
Hear me say, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na, na
The boys are back in town

Where a church had been
Watching all the young kids play
Make their spinning tops spin
Happy youthful children sounds
Mocked a crazy carnival clown
A little boy kicking a ball around town
Glad we're back in town
Went on to the town square
A crowd was gathered there
Looking at the pretty girls
The fairest of the fair
The whole damn crowd began to cheer
Many friends that we held so dear
Made us glad that we were all here
Glad we're back in town
Hear me say, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na, na
The boys are back in town

What the children need to see
Is what the world really should be
No one knows but the guys and me
