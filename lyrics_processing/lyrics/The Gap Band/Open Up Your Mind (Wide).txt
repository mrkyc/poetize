But your mind is filled with aggravation
You say you can't turn to your relations
You say you can't deal with world invasion
'Cause your mind is getting tighter
Don't think that the load's gonna get any lighter
Hoping that your world doesn't get any wider
Hoping that your life's gonna get any brighter
If you open up your mind
Turn your head toward the sky
Every little thing's
Gonna get a little better, yeah, yeah
If you open up your mind
Turn your head toward the sky
Reach way down in your heart
And you'll feel better

Turn your head toward the sky
Every little thing's
Gonna get a little brighter, yeah, yeah
If you open up your mind
Turn your head towards the sky
Reach way down in your heart
And you'll feel better
