I can't get over you
No matter what I do
Although you said that we were through
It's all about you
When I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord you'll come to me
Girl, I can't get over you
No matter what I do
Shoop

Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Over you

Don't let it be for keeps
'Cause you mean that much to me
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
Although you said that we were through
It's all about you
Shoop
