I understand that as a man I would never understand you
I can't understand how you let a man right out command you
And I'm not just speaking from Salt Lake City, 'cause that man ain't me
When clearly it should be, I'm just saying
I know you understand from past circumstances you lose
You do understand by me interjecting I'm breaking all types of man rules
And I understand I don't wear his shoes, but I hate seeing you blue
You know that I'm here for you when he don't give a fuck about you, yeah

I would lie, would cry, would die for you (Oh, I would)
I just want to understand you
I would lie, would cry, would die for you (Oh yeah)
I just want to understand you
I...

I understand that leaving him might create a broken man
But I understand sometimes better a broken man than his broken hand
I understand that I'll never understand what you going through
But I understand sometimes you just need someone to talk to
I understand sometimes we will lose our way
But I understand tomorrow comes a better day
And I understand you need someone to be your confidant
Well, I'm right here, just lay it down

I just want to understand you (Understand me, baby)
I would lie, would cry, would die for you (All I ever need)
I just want to understand you
I...
