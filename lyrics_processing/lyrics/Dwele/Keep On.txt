On, on, on, on, on, on
Hmm-mmm (Keep)
Mmm... mm

I
I'm stuck in love with you
I can't bend these pimping rules
No more than I been flexing them
Buddy love, spandexin'
And if you ain't know, I play by rules
And I'ma keep on, at least that's the plan
But if you keep on, I might be forced to leave game alone
(You hot like fire) It hurts to the touch
You burning my pimp game
(I'm avoiding) Long talks on the phone
'Cause you might have me gone
My lady if you keep on...

(on on on on...)
Moving your hips right (My lova, keep on)
Smacking your lips right (My lova, keep on)
Calling me papi (My lova, keep on)
Thinkin' bout me (My lova, keep on)
Rocking Prada (My lova, keep on)
Working it out, ma (My lova, keep on)
Doing your damn thing (My lova, keep on)
Making me sing this song about you

No captain save 'em, I'm more Donald Goines
Genie in a bottle, lucky sevens that hit the solid coins
(That's all I was) Tippin' my frame, had a different dip or a dame
Trip over game till they fall in love
Had pretty women kiss the ring, pecking the kicks
Bet I'm convinced, I'm everything they wished and dreamed
You was more than just a fish on string
Earned a crown that was fit for queens, you a fix for fiends
Nah mean? Got a dude sick to spleen
Type a girl that could pose for king
Listen (listen), you got a body, let me pick your brain
Get with dude, get this fame
Ditch your man, shake that lame
Come and take exotic trips
And exclusive whips with the premium bang
Hittin' the Autobahn, got us shifting lanes
Swear to God, just keep doing your thing
Just

My lova, keep on
(on on on on...)
Moving your hips right (My lova, keep on)
Smacking your lips right (My lova, keep on)
Calling me papi (My lova, keep on)
Thinkin' bout me (My lova, keep on)
Rocking Prada (My lova, keep on)
Working it out, ma (My lova, keep on)
Doing your damn thing (My lova, keep on)
Making me sing this song about you
Got me in love with you
I'm telling me, all the things you can do for me
To bring my change when you buy my money
I cop the range and now you ride with me
You doing things that make me wanna keep the range
Parked outside when the sun's high
And I love the range, but I can't lie
(You've got me higher) Than I've ever been
With any other woman, yeah
(I'm resigning) From this pimp game
Might see this pimpin' change
If you keep on...

(Keep on and on and on)
Moving your hips right (Moving)
Smacking your lips right (Smacking, babe)
Calling me papi (Mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm)
Thinkin' bout me (Keep on and on and on)
Rocking Prada (It's on, it's on, it's on)
Working it out, ma (You got to keep on, you got to keep on)
Doing your damn thing (You got to keep on, you got to keep on)
Making me sing this song about you

You got me from them things you do, baby
When you do what you do, when you put it on me
You've got me finding myself going crazy
I'm on my way to leave this game alone if you keep on
(On, on, on, on)
Moving your hips right (here it is, say, there we go, now here it is, yo)
Smacking your lips right (here it is, say, there we go, that's how it is, yo)
Calling me papi (here it is, say, there we go, now here it is, yo)
Thinkin' bout me (here it is, say, there we go, that's how it is, yo)
Rocking Prada (here it is, say, there we go, now here it is, yo)
Working it out ma (here it is, say, there we go, that's how it is, yo)
Doing your damn thing (here it is, say, there we go, that's how it is, how it is)
