Like a song from one to another
I feel so right inside when an idea
Comes to me about you
And I know that you feel
The same when you hear my song for you
Like one song to another
My love is designed uniquely for you
Each word you hear is from my heart
And that's why you feel this the way you do
I need you

All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
All I ever needed was a subject
Oh yeah

I saw lust when I looked in your eyes
Girl, you know you're wrong
You know this is supposed to be a love song
But at any rate things change
I must adapt and keep pace
So there's another side to you behind that sweet face
It's all love, though (it's all lust, though)
Your belly button, abs, your thighs, you legs, your ass
Your innocence, your sweetness, your afrodisiality
Your intimate eyes
I studied your curves twofold
Like an artist to subject I hold
A creation derived from you
You're welcome, lady, thank you
