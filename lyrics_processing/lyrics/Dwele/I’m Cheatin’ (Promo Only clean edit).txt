Cool Everyone I know
(Everybody cheats... ohhh)
I can never affair
With nobody else but u
You sexy as hell
But u know my girlfriend too
She says things about ya
Like how you's a freak at night
How you do things she neva
I neva get the pleasure
Because of the mornin after
The shame she would feel inside
The lecture I'd have to sit through
How her momma raised her right
Ya'll both rock different hairdos
But ya'll kinda look alike
I know the way I can tell it sounds wrong
But it feels so right
Girl, ohoh, girl, girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, girl, girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, yeah, girl, girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, girl, girl, that's my world
You might also likeI... you drink more than my girl
While she keeps me business post
She dresses warm in the summer
While you don't wear any clothes (in the winter)
Rememberin the other day(when I sent ya)
A dozen of them longstem roses
You told me neva eva
Send roses you would rather
Me send them to the other
And then you took off your clothes
You asked me who I wanted
The nasty one I suppose
We tussled into the moonlight
A break from my everyday world
I fell asleep with my love affair
And woke up next to my
Girl, yeah yeah, girl, girl, I'm cheatin with my
Girl, yeah yeah, girl, girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my own, girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
When love is free
It's a matter of time
Before before... (that's wrong)
Some have a girl with a chick on the side(I don't need it)
My girl is all
She's all I need so I don't mind cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl, girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl, girl, said I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl, girl, oahhh
Girl, oooohhh, girl, girl, I'm cheating on my
Girl, with my, girl girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl-girl, I'm cheatin on my
Girl, with my, girl girl, I'm cheating

With my gril, I'm cheating on my girl with my girl
