You're saying thangs
No one stays the same
So I take it lightly
When you say that I've changed
All that I do
Is done for you
And I can't help but feel bad
When you place me at the blame

I'm such a sucker for you, baby
Oh, oh
I'm such a sucker for you, babe
Oh, oh, oh

I got enough money
To fly you around
And around the world again
Until you're ready to come down (All the way down)
But let's keep it real
Had it not been for the fame
I probably wouldn't have even known you
Or even got to know your name
You might also like
Can you blame me for wanting to hold on to something this vain
(Sucker) It's all for you
(I'm a sucker) Everything I do
(I'm a sucker) It's all for you
(I'm a sucker) Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh

I'm amazed at your selfish ways
You want to take me from my travels
All my musical gains
(But could you live here without)
Could you live here without a flat screen
Your diamonds and thangs
If I took a breath and left this business for you
I might lose you in the same

Can you blame me for wanting to hold on to something this vain
(I'm a sucker for you) Oh, La-la-la-la-la
(I'm vain too) I don't want to lose what I got with you
(It's all for you) Oh, oh yeah
(I'm a sucker for you) Yeah
(I'm such a sucker for you)
(I'm such a sucker for you) Sucker for you, oh
(I'm such a sucker for you) Oh, oh yeah
(I'm such a sucker for you) Hey, I can't believe you
I'm such a...
Can you blame me for wanting to hold on to something this vain
(Sucker for you) You gotta know it's all for you
(I'm such a sucker for you) Every little thing, yeah
(I'm such a sucker) Can you blame me for wanting to hold on
(Sucker for you) Everything
(I'm such a sucker for you) Everything, you and me, yeah
(I'm such a...) Can you blame me for wanting to hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to you and me
