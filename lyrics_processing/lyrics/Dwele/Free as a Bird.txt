Yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Set you free as a bird
You can do as you please
Don't let these memories
Bring you back to a place
Where you won't find love again
Set you free as a bird
You can do as you please
Don't let these memories
Bring you back to a place
Where you won't find love

Held my tongue when you talked all that la-la
Held your hand in the mall when we balled out
Found a way to get your ticket when it's sold out
Just to be with you (Be with you)
It threw my heart for a loop when I found out
'Bout your plans and the things you was all about
Didn't see 'cause I was just all about
Finding love with you
But you can't tell the deed
You wasn't playin' me
After all these things I've done
Just to make you happy
I wish I could find a way
To make me let you stay
I've done all that I can do
Except let you fly away
You might also like
Set you free as a bird
You can do as you please
Don't let these memories
Bring you back to a place
Where you can't find love again
Set you free as a bird
You can do as you please
Don't let these memories
Bring you back to a place
Where you won't find love

Kiss your lips in the morning when we wake up
Held my comments 'til you put on your makeup
Even ate the whole plate of pancakes up
Just to keep it cool (Keep it cool)
So this how you do
When a man come through and try and do for you
Shoulda known 'cause your homegirl's shady too
I'm mad 'cause I spent love on you (Oh, oh)
And it took too long to see
That you wasted all my time
After all these things I've done
Just to make you happy
But check this sh** out right here
I want you to meet someone
Brand new special in my life
'Cause you and I are done
Set you free
Yeah, ah, ah, ah
Gonna set you free, yeah
I'm gonna set you...

Oh, oh, hey
I know
Feels so good
To be free from love
Sign of beginning
Free from love
Free from hate
