My lady, my Lady, my lady, baby, mmm

My lady, you're doing it
I can't withstand
You better slow it down
Where I'm from, Dwele will make you forget your man
I'm trying to hold tight
But I can't help if he don't move you like you need to be
(Ooh, oh baby, alright)

(All I) wanna do (is) glide in slow motion straight to you
(Then) Figure a way to make you move (by)
Using my hands, using my dance
(All I) wanna know (is) when you get it down on the floor
(How) does your body move and make me grab your hand
And find out your name, baby

Ah, my lady
Wanna know what you eat, what you speak, wanna know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna know if you smoke, if you toke, wanna know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna call you tonight but I don't even know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna know how you feel about me gettin' to know you
You might also like
I got you, step with me, you need a ting, I
Got you, come with me, now I think it's time
Wait, it's so close
Let's move on to the after party
I'm hoping that you'll stay with me for
Tonight there's no greater love, love

(All I) needed was
(one) line, one dance I thought just
(two) minutes ago you had a man
But (now) things done changed, I see nothing stays the same
(All I) wanna know (is) the quickest way to the back door (Oh)
If you don't mind, I won't complain
I don't even know your name, ah baby

Ah, my lady
Wanna know what you eat, what you speak, wanna know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna know if you smoke, if you toke, wanna know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna call you tonight but I don't even know your name
Ah, my lady
Wanna know how you feel about me gettin' to know you
(How you feel about)
You are (my lady)
I wanna get to know you babe, said you are (My lady)
I need to know you in every way because you are (My lady)
You're my my my, I need to know you in a special way (My lady, my my)
So come on, baby

Ah, my lady
Wanna know what you eat, what you speak, wanna know your name
(I wanna know what you...)
Ah, my lady (...live like, baby)
Wanna know if you smoke, if you toke, wanna know your name
(I wanna live it too)
Ah, my lady (Real soon, baby)
Wanna call you tonight but I don't even know your name
