Ah, ah, yeah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah
I, I-I, I-I, I-I-I, I-I, I-I, I-I, oh-oh-oh

I'm better as a man and it's all because of you, baby
And now I understand when they say 'Behind a strong man there's you'
Some can't comprehend the words I speak on track ten, baby
But there's a new meaning for the truth
If the truth is in the pudding, your Jell-O pop's on Cosby
If the truth is bare naked, then the truth, it look good on you
Semper fi, baby, we make it do what it do
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you

I'm so glad you're mine (You're mine)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes)
Ghetto, you're so fine (So defined)
A few reasons why you're mine (Oh)
I'm so glad you're mine (So defined)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes)
Ghetto, you're so fine (You're mine)
A few reasons why you're mine

This song is my ode to you, for the twice time, baby
I learned a few things since the last time I told you the truth
Got me outside with no umbrella and it's rainin'
But I don't mind your wetness (Oh), it's cool
If we had computer love, I would let you hack my MySpace
If your love was a dance, you could YouTube it and watch me yoo
You, you, you bring out the youth in an old soul, baby
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you

I'm so glad you're mine (So defined)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes, yeah)
Ghetto, you're so fine (So fine)
A few reasons why you're mine (You're mine)
I'm so glad you're mine (My divine)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes)
Ghetto, you're so fine (So defined)
A few reasons why you're mine (Ooh, ooh)

It's true you got me
Trying to find things about you to not be
So wrapped up into you
But obvi-ously it's hopeless, that's why I wrote this
I can't help but to focus on
Your ass, your smile, your eyes
Just gotta keep it truthful with myself 'cause in the end
I'ma want you for more than a friend
If you ain't heard me, I'll say it again, I'm so...
I'm so glad you're mine (You're mine)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes)
Ghetto, you're so fine (So fine)
A few reasons why you're mine (You're mine)
I'm so glad you're mine (So glad)
Scale of one to ten, you're about a (couple of dimes)
Ghetto, you're so fine (So fine)
A few reasons why you're mine

Oh, ah, ah, ah (So glad)
Oh, ah, ah, ah (You're mine)
Oh, ah, ah, ah (Oh, oh)
Oh, ah, ah, ah (Oh, oh)
Oh, ah, ah, ah (You're mine)
Oh, ah, ah, ah
