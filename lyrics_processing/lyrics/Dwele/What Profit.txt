A man was steady stackin' chips, ridin' in the best whips
Living every day like his birthday
And house got a door with the door man
But it seems that your man forgot what you need in the worst way

Is to be loved
From the top of your head down to your pretty pedicured toes, oh
You wanna be loved
It's the thing that last long after all the money comes and goes
(Money comes and goes)

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl (Lose his girl)
If I was your man (If I was your man)
I'd do all that I can to keep you, girl
What profit a man

Lately when he took you out
Mostly all he talked about
Were things that meant little to you, babe (You, baby)
Hollywood had him gone, he forgot what turned you on
Almost as if he never knew you
You might also like
Needed to be loved
From deep inside of your mind down to the depths of your soul, oh
You wanna be loved
You see, love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes
(Money comes and goes)

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
(To lose) To lose his girl
(Hey, it means nothing in life unless I got you)
If I was your man (If I was your man)
I'd do all that I can to keep you, girl
(Yeah, I'd do what I can)
What profit a man

To get these material things
And turn around and lose your queen
The one who was there
Ridin' for you when it was all just a dream
How you gonna get brand new
With the only girl who ever loved you
(Ever, ever loved you) Ooh, baby

What profit a man (Profit a man), to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl
(Hey, I'd rather not lose you, baby)
If I was your man (If I was your man)
I'd do all that I can to keep you, girl
(Just to keep you, oh)
What profit a man
What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl
(I'd rather lose everything than lose you, baby, hey)
If I was your man (If I was your man)
I'd do all that I can to keep you, girl
(Just to keep you)
