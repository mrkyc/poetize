Mmm, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It used to be...we would be...the best of all friends
It turned to be...L-O-V-E, and I was your man, so
You was my, lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how
To keep the love, 'cause I was young
I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I-I...

I was hopin' we could find a way
(Said I was hopin' we could find a way)
To have what we had again today
(To have what we had again today)
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try (Hurt to try)
To find our love
You might also like
Wish that I, would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know, until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day, your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that, can't we
Just slow down a minute and talk it out
I've been, in my share, of love since then
Don't know about, what you've been through
But nothin compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back
And I know that you need me back
Baby, let's try again to find our love, oh, oh

I was hopin' we could find a way (Yeah, baby)
To have what we had again today (Again today, yeah)
Though it's been some time since you and I (Oh yeah, yeah)
It wouldn't hurt to try (Hurt to try)
To find our love (Oh no, no, no)
I was hopin' we could find a way (Ah, ah)
To have what we had again today
(To have what we had again)
Though it's been some time since you and I (It's too long)
It wouldn't hurt to try (It wouldn't hurt to try, yeah)
To find our love (Oh baby)
I can't forget (I can't forget) the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone (Oh, oh)
'Til I moved on ('Til I moved on)
Now I'm right back to square one again (Oh, oh, oh)

I was hopin' we could find a way
(I was hopin' we could find a way)
To have what we had again today
(Oh, oh baby)
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try (It wouldn't hurt to try)
To find our love (To find our love, yeah)
I was hopin' we could find a way
(I was hopin' we could find a way)
To have what we had again today
(again, baby)
Though it's been some time since you and I (Oh no)
It wouldn't hurt to try (Hurt to try)
To find our love (Hurt to try)

Baby, oh no, babe
Find our love, baby
