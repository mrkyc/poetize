Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Kanye to the, yeah, okay

I'm gettin' spins all day in L.A. like Felli Fel
Or we could go the D where Dwele dwell
DC, PG or ATL
Back in the Chi, I mean, my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well, that's X-X-L
Far as the penthouse, yeah, that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' her vibe, her body and soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well, let's kill all the polyin', I offer you a cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be, in the Robb Re-
P-O-R-T, but what's more important to me is that you

Open your ears
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years
Fearing lullabies, containing the same old lies (Same old lies)
Dealing just to deal is just a crime
Besides I know you wouldn't mind
Trying something new, so
You might also like
Let's (Let's) try (Try)
We can work it out (We can work it out)
If you let love (Love) guide (Guide)
The way that you feel for me (The way that you feel for me)
(Oh) Why (Why)
Let this opportunity pass (Pass) by (By)
(Don't let this pass, no, oh)
You should hold on

Please don't resist (Don't resist)
Let those harmonies to me escape your lips (Escape your lips)
There's no need to go home
Just to dance alone (Dance alone)
I know you can't enjoy it on your own
Really I don't see nothing wrong (Yeah)
With you and I spending some time
Also let me mention (Ooh)
My only intention (Ooh)
Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for
In my heart I have to (Ooh)
And want to have you (Ooh)
So fulfilled that you will never need to ask for more

Let's try (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

(Oh) Why (Why)
Let this opportunity pass (Pass) by (By)
(Don't let this opportunity)
You should hold on (Hold on, oh)
And someone told my girl that she's a trophy wife
Sorta like Grant Hill and Kobe's wife
So when we out in public she be so polite
But when we back at home she be poltergeist
I mean provokin' fights
Tryna poke me with knifes
And last time I tried to poke her she just told me "goodnight"
See, her clothing be tight, she was pervert approved
'Til she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
Hypnotized by the tube, so she stay with the clicker
And a cup full of liquor, thinkin' it's makin' her thicker
But it's makin' her slimmer, so her future is dimmer
I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner
See, I was in her sister, who was freaky and ruthless
And the Yorkshire terrier, the pocket for pooches
And the pocket of her Gucci's was takin' my lunch money
Just like the Gooches, I'll tell you the truth, miss

Girl, instead of running from my love
Yo, this Consequence
I'm with Detroit's finest, my man Dwele
Kanye West on the track
You can run to
Ladies, you know what that means
It's time to hit the dance floor
To these arms that's meant for you
My man John Legend on the keys
GLC, I see you, baby
Come on, Dwele, take me outta here
So why not stay around
Let's (Let's) try (Try, baby)
We can work it out (We can work it out)
If you let love (Love) guide (Guide)
The way that you feel for me (Oh-ho-oh)
Why (Oh-ho-ho, oh no)
Let this opportunity pass (Pass) by (By)
You should hold on (Hold on)
Let's (Let's) try (Try, baby)
We can work it out (We can work it out)
If you let love (Love) guide (Guide)
The way that you feel for me (Way that you feel for me)
Why (Why)
Let this opportunity pass (Pass) by (By)
(Why can't we let this pass, oh)
You should hold on (You should hold on)
