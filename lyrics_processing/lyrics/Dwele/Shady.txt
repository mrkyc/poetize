It's been some time, I tripped up this day
She don't need
No knowledge of how she ran my
Memory
Up until this day
This fine day in may
Certainly I flashedback to bobby
And remembering
A special envy
He possesed the only thing my life was missing
Can only guess why every bodies telling me that shes shady...
Ooohhhhhhhhh, whhhyyyyy? oooooooohhhhhhhhhh....soooooo
Shady shady shady
Shady mothafuu...
Cuz I was blinded by beauty I
I didn't see the ??
After three weeks have passed
Of courtin this chick and I still ain't hit that ass
She had the nerve to ask a favor of Dwe
'I'm in dire straights' she said
'I need five hundred for books for class'
But I don't understand, the semester's over
Before I can let her know
She followed it up with head shots called fellatio
She found my weakness
That shady mothafuu...
That shady mothafuu... fuu ooooohhhhhh whhhyyyyyyy
Oooooohhhoooo soo so
Shady shady shady
After her job was done
She went to the bathroom and said 'I'll be back soon'
But what was strange?
She picked up her phone
I overheard her say, 'bobby I got the dough meet me on monroe'
I choked on pride, this bitch was wrong
But I held my tongue...
As she exited the bathroom and came in
I grabbed her legs
Threw her onto my bed
I released my tongue
Karma lingeres until she screamed jesus!
I nto her ear I whispered.. pssssss..
And a single tear drop falls
Simply caused her to the realize this pimpin
She looked uneasy
She says 'I got to go.'
She met Bobby on Monroe, yeah
She asked for the key to the stash for the cash, B
Bobby's birthday was tomorrow
She promised to suck my skabarro
The keys to unlock the safe is
Of three years of Bobby girl's shadiness
?? threw Bobby a kiss and smiled. *muah*
Meanwhile
I go to take a piss
She dropped a note in the bathroom sink and
With the inked was ran and shit
Something about 'Japan first class ticket'
I used my only lead
I got in my whip to see about Monroe street
There I see a limousine
Windows cracked with this bitch in the backseat
I said 'What the hell is this?'
She said 'I can't withstand your pimpin it's profound'
Now how does Tokyo sound.'
Oh you Shady Mothafuuu...
