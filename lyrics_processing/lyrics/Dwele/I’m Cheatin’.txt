Huh, everybody cheat, right? Come on
Everyone I know
Everybody cheat, oh, oh

Oh, I can never affair
With nobody else but you
You sexy as hell
But you know my girlfriend too
She say things about ya
Like how you's a freak at night
How you do things she'd never
I never get the pleasure
Because of the morning after
The shame she would feel inside
The lecture I'd have to sit through
How her mama raised her right
Y'all both rock different hairdos
But y'all kinda look alike
I know the way I can tell it sounds wrong
But it feels so right

Girl, girl, girl, I'm cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, I'm cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, I'm cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, that's my world
You might also like
Ah, you drink more than my girl
While she keeps the business post
She dress warm in the summer
While you don't wear any clothes (In the winter)
Rememberin' the other day (When I sent ya)
A dozen of them long stem roses
You told me never ever send roses
You would rather, me send them to the other
And then you took off your clothes
You asked me who I wanted
The nasty one I suppose
We tussled into the moonlight
A break from my everyday world
I fell asleep with my love affair
And woke up next to my

Girl (Yeah, yeah), girl, girl, I'm cheatin' with my
Girl (Yeah, yeah), girl, girl, I'm cheatin' on my
Girl (With my own), girl, girl (Girl, girl, girl)
With my own, girl (Girl), girl, girl

When love is free
It's a matter of time (Ah yeah)
Before it falls (It's natural)
Some have a girl with a chick on the side (I don't need it)
My girl is all
Hey, she's all I need, so I don't mind cheatin' on my
Girl (With my), girl, girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl
Said I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, (With my) girl, girl

I'm cheatin' on my girl, with my girl
I'm cheatin' on my girl, with my girl
