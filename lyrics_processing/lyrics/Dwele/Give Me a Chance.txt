Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah

Hey, pretty lady, you must have a man
You ain't answer fast enough
You should take my hand
And let me show you things about this nigga
It's too late, baby, you hesitated
Just let me entertain you

Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
Show you love (Ah yeah, baby, give me)
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
Show you love (Oh yeah, baby, give me a)

Give me a second, you should take my seven
Can we talk for a minute?
Nah, my name ain't Tevin
Keep you hot like Campbells
Wrap you tight like diesel, clothing in a seven
You like a nine, maybe a dime, maybe eleven
But who's really counting? (I ain't, no way)
I understand sometimes you've gotta breathe (For a minute)
I respect your space, you need yours and I need mine
But right now I'm in your face until you
You might also like
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
Show you love (To show you love, to give you love)
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show)
Show you love (Oh yeah, baby, give me)

Time is getting harder, baby, you need to laugh
You don't need that clown ass nigga
I can make you laugh
Girl, feel my fabric, boyfriend material
Baby, you can have it
Wear it 'til you can't no more
Look, there's no pressure, thank you for your time
Now you got my seven, please keep me in mind
And you can call me like a question
Baby, I will answer
I can be life enhancer in a man
If you wanna take a chance

Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
Show you love (Show you love, baby, give me)
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show)
Show you love (Oh yeah, baby, give me)
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
Show you love (Oh yeah, baby, give me, yeah)
Give me a chance (Give me a chance to show you)
