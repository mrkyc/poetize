Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh no, no, mmm
Don't, don't, don't, oh, whoa

Last night
Somebody told me that you would be in town
I opened up my eyes and you were staring me down
I often think about the last times we spent together
Mmm, hmm, mmm
And sometimes
When no one was around and it's just me
Mmm, you serve a special parted memory

(Mmm) It's our dream to see
(Oh, baby) You here with me
(I miss you) After all this time, you're still fine
(Girl let's chill) For the Weekend
(For the Weekend babe
I'd like to chill for the weekend)
It's our dream to see
(Oh) You here with me
(I miss you) After all this time, you're still fine
(Girl let's chill for the weekend) For the Weekend
Mmm, I'd like to chill for the weekend, babe
You might also like
This morning
I awake to find you next to me
Holding a long conversation over a green tea, baby
We speak about the love before (The night before)
Night before
And it's killing me (no way)
I gotta let you leave (Although)
But at least we know
That We made another memory
Of the Way you let me
Love you, hold you, you've got me so in love

It's our dream to see (Oh)
You here with me (I miss you)
After all this time (Baby)
You're still fine (you're still fine, let's chill)
For the Weekend (for the weekend, babe)
(you and I) I thank the man above for my Weekend Love
It's our dream to see (you here with me)
You here with me (can you believe)
After all this time (You're still fine)
You're still fine (on my mind)
For the Weekend (for the weekend)
So let's do you and me for the Weekend, baby
It's our dream to see (Oh, no)
You here with me (You here with me)
After all this time (all this time)
You're still fine (let's chill)
For the Weekend (for the weekend, baby)
Mmm hmm
