But I swear it seems like 2 years at least
Whether face to face or over the phone
When I hear your voice, I'm right at home
You're so beautiful
More than a man could ever want, girl
Got me looking for cameras to see if I'm being punk'd
Trying to take it slow
Ain't no sense in lying to you or to myself
I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
(So)
(But I)
Gotta let you know
(That I)
I think I love you
The way you touch me, the way you look at me
Everything about you is so so sexy
You do your own thing, got your own money
Everything about you is so damn
You're so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful
More than a man could ever ant girl
Got me looking for Ashton to see if I'm being punk'd
Trying to take it slow
Ain't no sense in lying to you or to myself
I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
(So)
(But I)
Gotta let you know
(That I)
I think I love you
I never felt this way so fast
So fast about anyone, real spit
Hate to admit it, but I got it bad
I got it bad, baby girl
But it's a good thing
I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
(So)
(But I)
Gotta let you know
(That I)
I think I love you, I think I love you
I think I love you
You're so beautiful, got me looking for
Trying to take it slow
