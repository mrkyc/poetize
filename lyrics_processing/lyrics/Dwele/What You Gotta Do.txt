Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh
Hoo, hoo, hoo

Hey, sip on some wine coolers
Like you're nineteen again
When love was so naive
Before past relationships built a wall of bricks
And made you wear your baggage on your sleeve
When she was rockin' dookie braids
And time wasn't of the essence
Let the whole day pass away
Rest in peace Saturday

(I know you) Feel me
(I know you) Hear me
To keep your baby happy
That's what you need to do

'Cause what you wanna do, what you need
Is what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open
It's what you want, it's what you need, man
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open

High school crush on the phone call
No, no, no, two way interruptin' y'all
The pureness and innocence
When love was so rich and fair
Before broken hearts and tampered feelings
When it was the thing to do
On the park bench, caught you
She was waiting with a ponytail
And bamboo in her earrings
Standing at the bus stop, suckin' on a lollipop
An around the way type of girl

(I know you) You feel me
(I know you) You hear me
To keep your baby happy
That's what you need to do

That's what you wanna do, what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open
It's what you want, it's what you need, man (Yeah, yeah)
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open
(What you want, yeah, what you need)
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open
(What you want, what you need, man)
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
How to keep that woman open
It's what you want, it's what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Gotta do to keep her open (Keep that girl happy)
It's what you want, it's what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Gotta do to keep her open
It's what you want, it's what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Gotta do to keep her open
What you want, what you need (Open)
You gotta do, you wanna do
What you want, what you need
You gotta do, you wanna do
What you want, what you need, man
You gotta do to keep that woman strong
