Bodies are sticky we sweatin' out
And we ain't even got our clothes on
Lips hips feet are intertwined
I'm in your ear screamin' hold on
Yeah i know we end up tangled when we tango
A man in lust am I
Every time is better than the first time
When you
Move on it grind on me
Slide down me baby
Slide up and grind down slow
Take your time and groove
I love when you let it go
I'm lovin' your every move
Rock fast or slow

It take 22 tango

Keep your body so close to mine oooo
Workin' a horizontal dance move
But anytime of day
Were dancin' with the stars and a half moon
I know we need to find our groove
And when we do
A man in lust am I
Every time you give me that
Ooo grind slide down me baby
Slide up and grind down slow
Take your time and groove
I love when you let it go
I'm lovin' your every move
Rock fast or slow
You might also like
It take 22 tango

Keep your body close to mine oooo
Baby this ain't your first time
Take a minute explode
My horizontal dance flow
We don't need no teacher
We can learn as we go

As we cum we can cum as one
And we ain't even hit our groove yet
Play connect the dots wit ya sweat beads
Like my lover the remixer
I'm guessin' that you like that
I'm seein' how your toes curl back
Sometimes its like that
Just wait til we do the flapjack
Before you can dance
With your girl in romance
There's a few things you should do
I'm just tryna help you cuz you my dude yea
It takes22tango
First make her comfortable
She won't know what hit her when til done ya heard
Believe me that's my word
