There she goes again
Walking home, all alone, looking sad
Baby, where's your friends?
Why you never smile?
Let the sun, wash away, all your pain, so your inner child
(Ooh) Could fly
Maybe we can be friends and I'll dry your pretty eyes

Get up off your sorrow
Shake it up all night
Throw up your hands high
And let your hair down (Let your hair down, yeah)
Get up off your sorrow
Shake it up all night (Ooh, ooh)
Throw up your hands high
And let your hair down (Oh, oh)

There's no need to hide
Grab your purse and your keys
Come on out, let the world inside
Girl, it's time to play, yeah
'Cause tomorrow's untold
Let your dreams unfold your day, yeah
Just fly (Just fly)
Tell me we can be friends and I'll dry your pretty eyes
Come on and
