When the needle hits we don't want no crowd vexin'
This record's only, only for the cool section
Its just like sex, except you don't need no damn protection
To feel the groove and move your booty
Let's get down
Show me your step (Step)
And don't hold back, baby
I will show you mines
But mines is a little shady
This groove might make me
Learn how to dance maybe
If you promise me you'll step with me
But hold on, gotta let it breathe

You feel so
Good, baby

Move your
Body, baby
You know I
Need you (Need you)
By my side, baby
Just move with
Me to
Left to
Right, baby

It's a lot goin' on but you lookin' fly, baby
That drink you're holdin', keep it in the sky, please
I paid way too much for you to be lettin' it fly
Just hold on tighter, the next one could be water, ooh, ooh
Or maybe juice, 'cause you got me crazy on the floor
This I ain't used to, but I'm not ashamed to ask for more
It's almost deuces, before long they'll be closing doors
But I feel so good, I might have to take you home

We go from the crib alone
To give up all body and soul
(When it feels good, baby)
When it feels good (And)
And when it's time to dance
(When it's time to dance)
We throw up our hands and let go (Let go)
