If I got a girlfriend, you got a boyfriend
We've got a love thing, everything is right
Funny how some things work out soon as you acknowledge it
What we got is smooth, all we gotta do is polish it
I gotta love you, you gotta love me
We gotta fuckin' be what we wanted to
Believe that I got plans to hold you down
I can see a future in this being A-shot team

I gotta want you, you gotta want me
We gotta want the best of love
I already want you, you already want me
We got a love thing, we got a love thing
I gotta need you, you gotta need me
We gotta want the best of love
I already need you, you already need me
We got a love thing, we got a love thing

Is this a rap song, or is it vocals?
Am I hip hop or neo-soul?
Baby it don't matter just as long as you loving it
It's gon be the same thing that it was when you discovered it
Music, in a lot of ways, mimics relationships
It gets tainted when you bring rules into it
Believe I'm trying to free your mind
Respect my light, I'll respect yours, and...

I gotta want you, you gotta want me
We gotta want the best of love
I already want you, you already want me
We got a love thing, we got a love thing
I gotta need you, you gotta need me
We gotta want the best of love
I already need you, you already need me
We got a love thing, we got a love thing

HO!, I, I've got a love thing
We-e need to elate
I said we need to elate
(Love thing) Hey!
Said we need to elate
Ho oh oh oh oh for real, elate
I watched your friend get out of that car
I promised that I'd get that
And All I could think when I saw you at the bar
Was caking up with them flapjacks
But now that I know your past, beauty, and face
You've changed where my thought process is at
But I would be wrong if I didn't state:
Damn you got some good flapjacks!
