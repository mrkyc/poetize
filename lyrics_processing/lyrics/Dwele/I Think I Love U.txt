We've been together, less than a week
But I swear it seems like 2 years at least
Whether face to face or over the phone
When I hear your voice, I'm right at home

(You're so beautiful)
More than a man could ever want, girl
(Got me looking for)
Cameras to see if I'm being punk'd
(Trying to take it slow)
Ain't no sense in lying to you or to myself

I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, (so) out of the blue
(But I) gotta let you know, (that I) I think I love you

The way you touch me, the way you look at me
Everything about you is so, so sexy
You do your own thing, got your own money
Everything about you is so damn
You're so damn beautiful
You might also like
(You're so beautiful)
More than a man could ever want, girl
(Got me looking for)
Ashton to see if I'm being punk'd
(Trying to take it slow)
Ain't no sense in lying to you or to myself

I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
Gotta let you know, I think I love you

(I never felt this way so fast)
So fast about anyone, real spit
(Hate to admit it, but I got it bad)
I got it bad, baby girl
But it's a good thing

I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
Gotta let you know, I think I love you
I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, out of the blue
Gotta let you know, I think I love you
I think I love you (You're so beautiful)
You are so beautiful
Got me looking for (got me looking for)
Trying to take it slow (trying to take it slow, babe)
Oh yeah, babe
I think I love you (I think I love you)
