Old lovas
Young at heart, puppy lovers
Big old kids, both of us
Co-exist, hand in hand
We will be ripe

Big old kids, both of us
Co-exist, hand in hand
We will be ripe
Old lovas

Laid up and young at heart
That's what I am when I'm with you
I wouldn't mind even growing old
As long as you're by my side
Piece of mind and piece of soul
Life has no worries when I'm with you
Something like a child at play on a summer day
Through this life we will spend our time (old lovas)
Like we're big old kids (young at heart)

Puppy lovers
Big old kids, both of us
Co-exist, hand in hand
We will be ripe

Young at heart, puppy lovers
Big old kids, both of us
Co-exist, hand in hand
We will be ripe

At 45, a song that's special
That's what I hope for you to be with me
In 15 years of holding on
Your sound is still sweet to me
Or maybe you can be my M.P.C.E.B
Part of my everyday endeavor
When I touch your keys
Your sweet melodies, they bring me pleasure
That's why I'ma freak you forever, yeah
But something bout this feel just like a dream
An unfortunate familiar scene, I finally found love
And now, I, I don't know
I'll just continue to pray that this is real

(Verse 3:)
I'm hoping that this is not a dream
'Cause that would mean one of us would have to leave
Depending on who is the dreamer and who's the dreammee
(Regardless)
We both are here (So let's find love)
'Til our Golden years, 'til the heaven's close
And our eyes open, I hope I ain't dreaming
And I hope that we'll can, till we're
