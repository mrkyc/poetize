Is this is a dream?
Is my car this mean?
Am I imagining things?
Diamond in the back
Of my Cadillac
If this ain't a fact, oh no
(Don't wake me, oh no)
Who's this girl?
And who's this girl?
Together like plural, oh no (Oh no)
Say you wanna ride with this super fly (Fly)
How can I decline? I can't, no way
If this is dreaming i don't want to be
In reality, no, I don't, no
I must be high on someone's on supply
'Cause my mind is trippin'
Or am I pimpin'

La la la la la la la (La la la)
Goes my system in my car (Oh oh)
If my dame is only you
I don't want your daily love
This is pimpin' livin'
You might also like

These diamond rings (Oh)
And platinum things (Oh)
I can't complain, can I?
Where's my Armani suit? (Oh)
And, where's my gator boots? (Oh)
My girls used to call me cute
But, where's my girlfriend? (I don't know)
It was just a dream, and
I ain't got a thing
And my chain don't swing, no, it don't
I ain't got no girl
My fade don't blend, I
I got fifty cents
With no residence
But I'm still pimpin'

 Ooh, look at that line
 Damn, man, I ain't 'bout to stand in this, dawg
 It's too long anyway
 For real
 Ayy, man, that look like the chick from yesterday, dude...yeah, that's her
 You, you, you, not you
 Li'l Jamie, how you doing? You alright, Woody?
 I'm good. I'll see you at the club, we'll be getting some after this
 I'm tryna party, dawg, man there's too many girls going up in the club, that's what's up
 What's up, right here, man, we good, it's good
 What up, though?
