Money don't mean a thing
I'd rather have someone that makes me happy
One on one, me, her, love
Holdin' each other, watchin' the sun come up
And I would give up everything
Just to have a shorty that loves me, for me

I got a house on a hill with seventeen acres around me
But it feels empty, yes it does
And I can call two or three girls at the same time to make love to me
But I still feel lonely, so lonely
Now I can go from zero to sixty in my V-1-2 with the chromed out shoes
But it feels like I'm standin' still, standin' still
We can take a cruise around the world and I'll pay the cost
But I feel lost, I feel so lost, money don't mean a thing

Money don't mean a thing
I'd rather have someone that makes me happy (Ah yeah)
One on one, me (Me), her (Her), love (Love)
Holdin' each other, watchin' the sun come up (And I would give everything)
And I would give up everything
Just to have a shorty that loves me, for me

When I look out my window, I can see a small body of water
And I wish I could sail away, sail away
Well, it ain't that far, I can probably can get from here to Abidjan
A place in the motherland, y'all don't understand
From the outside lookin' in, I live the perfect life
But that ain't right no, no, no, so far from right
So I do what I gotta do, just to take it through, I'm waitin on you
Cause it don't mean a thing, without you, money don't mean a thing

Money don't mean a thing
I'd rather have someone that makes me happy
One on one, me, her, love
Holdin' each other, watchin' the sun come up
And I would give up everything
Just to have a shorty that loves me, for me
