Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take, take, take all that you have for me
In sin, where are we going?

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

And the sad, sad, sad, all the sad faces drown
In this town, where are we going? Yeah

And they all want you to change (Where are we going? Yeah, yeah)
