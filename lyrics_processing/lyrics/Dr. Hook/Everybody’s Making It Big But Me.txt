Hey, that's really tight
You know we worked a long time on this
Yeah, hell, it really should be our time
Let's try it again

Elvis, he's a hero, he's a superstar
And I hear that Paul McCartney drives a Rolls Royce car
And Dylan sings for millions and I just sing for free
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me

Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it, everybody's makin' it)
Everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it, everybody's makin' it)
Neil Diamond sings for diamonds and here's ol' rhinestone me
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it big but me)

Well I hear that Alice Cooper's got a foxy chick
To wipe off his snake, and keep him rich
And Elton John's got two fine ladies and Doctor John's got three
And I'm still seein' them same ol' sleazos that I used to see
You might also like
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it, yeah everybody's makin' it)
Yeah everybody's makin' it big but me
(Yeah everybody's makin' it, yeah everybody's makin' it)
Well, I've got charisma, and personality
Oh how come everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it big but me)

Wha-what's wrong with that
(I don't see nothin' wrong with it, Rik)

Well I paint my face with glitter just like Bowie does
And I wear the same mascara that Mick Jagger does
And I even put some lipstick on
But that just hurt my dad and mom
Everybody's makin' it big but me

Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it, everybody's makin' it)
(Everybody's makin' it big)
Yeah, everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it, everybody's makin' it)
(Everybody's makin' it big)
They got groupies for their bands and all I've got is my right hand
And everybody's makin' it big but me
(Everybody's makin' it big but me)
Everybody's makin' it, makin' it, makin' it
Everybody's makin' it big
Everybody's makin' it, makin' it, makin' it
Everybody's makin' it big
Everybody's makin' it, makin' it, makin' it
Everybody's makin' it big
