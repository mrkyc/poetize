Second Street and Broadway, sittin' in a door way
Head held in his hands
Looked to all the world, like he was prayin'
Oh nah

Foot wrapped in an old rag, bottle in a brown bag
I saw him try to stand
Then I heard the words, that he was sayin'
Oh yeah

And he said come on Carrie, carry me a little farther (yeah, yeah)
Come on Carrie, carry me one more mile (oh, no-no-no)
I don't know where it's leadin' to
But I know I can make it if I lean on you, so
Come on Carrie, carry me a little, yes
I carried you, now carry me a little
Come on Carrie, carry me a little while, yeah, oh no
Oh no (carry me)

Well he struggled to his feet, and staggered down the street
To the window of the five-and-dime, oh
He stood and laughed a while at his reflection, yeah
Yeah nah
Yeah

And then I heard him shoutin' something about a mountain
He could surely climb
If she was only there to point the right direction
But she ain't no, but she ain't no

He said come on Carrie, carry me a little farther, ah, yeah, oh, oh
Come on Carrie, carry me one more mile (carry me) (where's it goin', where's it goin', yeah, yeah)
I don't know where it's leadin' to
But I know I can make it if I lean on you, so
Come on Carrie, carry me a little (yeah)
I carried you, now carry me a little
Come on Carrie, carry me a little while, yeah
Carry me, Carrie
You got to carry me
Carry me! Yes, oh

Hey, yeah, carry me, Carrie
(You got to carry me) Carry me! Carry me!
(You got to carry me) c-c-c-c-Carrie
(So, you got to carry me) I carried you!
(Carry me, Carrie) You carry me!
(Carry me, Carrie) Yeah! Yeah!
(You got to carry me) Got to carry, got to carry
