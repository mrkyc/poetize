Before we begin, thank you
Thank you, all, thank you
Thank you
Thank you

I'm not a bad person (I know), I don't drink, and I don't kill
I got no evil habits, and I probably never will
I don't sing like Elvis Presley, I can't dance like Fred Astaire
But there's one thing in my favor, I'm a millionaire (that's beautiful)

And I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
Well, having all this money is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around

I could get myself a nose job, I could diet for a year
But I'll never be Robert Redford 'cause I'm much to fond of beer
Please don't misunderstand me, it's not love I'm trying to buy
It's just I got all this here money and I'm a pretty ordinary guy

And I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
But having all this money is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around
You might also like
I don't mind if you love me for my money
If you love me for whatever else I got
But 'cept for all this stuff I'm a lonely Fort Knox
I don't guess I'm doing all that hot

But I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
But having all this money is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around
