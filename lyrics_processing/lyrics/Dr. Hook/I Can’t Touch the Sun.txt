I'll never reach the sun for you
I've never done the things that you need done for you
I've stretched as high as I can reach
I guess I'm not the one for you
'Cause I can't touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
No I can't reach the clouds or touch the sun
I can't turn back time for you
And make you sweet sixteen again
I can't turn your barren fields to green again
And I won't sit around and talk
Of how things might have been again
No I can't turn back time and make you young again
I can't turn back time and make you young
I hope you find somebody who
Can do the things I didn't do
And find the road I didn't find
And build a brighter world for you
I hope you find somebody old
Enough to reach and take a hold
And guide your ever changing mind
And free your ever risin' soul
But I can't, no
No I can't
You might also likeI can't look inside your mind
And see the things you're hopin' for
And I can't help you chase the dream you're gropin' for
You say your arms are open wide
But Lord knows who they're open for
No I can't know your mind or chase your dreams with you
No I can't chase your dreams or know your mind
So say goodbye and don't look back
I've had some happy days with you
Sorry I can't be the one who stays with you
And when they ask about me
You can say I was the one with you
Who never touched the clouds or reached the sun with you
No I can't reach the clouds or touch the sun
I guess it's done
I can't touch the sun for you, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't touch the sun
(I can't no I can't) ooh, no, ooh, no
I can't touch the sun
