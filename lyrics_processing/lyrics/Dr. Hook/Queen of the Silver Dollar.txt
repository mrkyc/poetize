And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters, they flock around her, and they fight to win her favours
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She arrives in all her splendour every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is a cross-town bus that stops right down the block
The ol' piano minstrel plays a song as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar, she's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favours
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Her royal gown is a satin dress, that's stained and slightly torn
And her sparkling jewels are rhinestones, and her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's travelled and the wonderous sights she's seen
And I watch her and I pray God save the queen
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favours
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
The queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her, and I brought her to this world
Yes I'm the man who made a queen of a simple country girl

And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favours
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
