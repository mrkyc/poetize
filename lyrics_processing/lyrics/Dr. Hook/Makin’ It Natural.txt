I'm gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, 'cause baby all I'll ever need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural, ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on, I no longer have to lean on
'Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
But I'd trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple gold wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural, but don't you ask me how, huh
It's been the cause of all my sorrow, but I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now, mm

I'm gonna throw it out the window (some day)
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
You might also like
And we'll be makin' it natural, don't you ask me how
But you know we can do it babe if we tried
Just takes a little willpower, that's all, just a little willpower
So let's get together and build up a little willpower now

Roll me up another one
Makin' it natural (makin' it natural)
Makin' it natural (makin' it natural)
You know we can do it baby, now (makin' it natural)
Let's all go out in the sunshine and fresh air (makin' it natural)
Mm, meanwhile, meanwhile (makin' it natural)
Pass me some of that vitamin tea, woo, it's good for me
Hey, how we gon' get outta here?
Out the back door, and be quick (shoo)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Oh boy George you've done it again
