What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate?

It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat
It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
Dig below the surface, find your insecurities

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

You always walk away
Soon, you'll have to face it
Your distance from reality
Won't bury or erase it
I tried to do the same
Living so complacent
But the problems wouldn't go away
So I turned around to face them

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long
