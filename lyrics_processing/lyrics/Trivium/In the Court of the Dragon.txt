In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
In the court of the dragon
You will know your worth

Hammer clenched
Open mouth
Living 'neath the tides of pain
Surely any man would drown
Horrid king
Cries unheard
Bathed in blood
You'll get what you deserved
Burning home
Only child
Hidden from the deadly ones
Hunted far but never found
Nightmare past
Haunting him
Bides his time
Sinks into the sea

In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
In the court of the dragon
You will know your worth

Final clash
Beast and man
Rising from the violent waves
With the bloodied head in hand
Open mouth
Swallowing the king
Gods devoured whole
Light extinguishing
No more
Will the sun look down to illuminate the world

In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend

The stars have died and the heavens go up in flames
Earth
Sinks
The stars have died and the heavens go up in flames
Earth
Sinks
The stars have died and the heavens go up in flames
Earth
Sinks
The stars have died and the heavens go up in flames
In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend
In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend

In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
