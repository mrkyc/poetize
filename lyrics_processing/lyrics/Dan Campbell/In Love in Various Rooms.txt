In my broke down Honda Civic
The piece of shit barely drives
We played songs from the backseat
I held you close as you cried
It's always a little damp here after the rain
It seeps through the cracks in the window frame
Our first place in Columbus. Apartment 21
With the dirty, dingy carpet
With the beige colored tub
But i feel like myself here laying with you
I think that you know what we gotta do

We don't need your congratulations
What we've got is a big bright ball of light
We don't need anyone's permission
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that i die
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that i die

A little room there with your parents
We escaped to the beach
My heart breaks for the millionth time
When your mom starts to scream
Someday it'll just be me and you
We could sit here as long as we wanted to

On a backdrop made for pets
We got married with our friends around
Still took our photos on the courthouse steps
To let 'em know they couldn't stop us if they tried
I kissed you under the pale Ohio sky

We don't need your congratulations
What we've got is a big bright ball of light
We don't need anyone's permission
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that i die
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that i die

A little house in Carolina
And a cool autumn breeze
Watching the sunset from the hammock
Our names carved into the tree
Thinking of the steps that brought us here
How there's no way i finish without you dear

We don't need your congratulations
What we've got is a big bright ball of light
We don't need anyone's permission
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die
