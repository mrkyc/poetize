As the day turns to night
Under these suburban skies
Think of all willing lies, of cutting ties
The emptiness
At first light, first sight
The world seems like a miracle
But try to hold it in your hands
And watch it get away, oh the ugliness of fate

When you're always on this line
When you're always on this line
You could've crossed a million times
But you're always on this line
Oh, put your hands up, claim your crime
'Cause you never had the time
You still get to work just fine
When you're always on this line

But it's alright, it's okay
When there's excuses in your way
You can try, just make it up
Settle down but don't look up
At first bite, first lie
The world seems like it serves you well
But try to catch it in your hands
Treating it like a slave of the emptiness you crave
You might also like
When you're always on this line
When you're always on this line
You could've crossed a million times
But you're always on this line
Oh, put your hands up, claim your crime
'Cause you never had the time
You still get to work just fine
When you're always on this line

Oh, it might be unkind of me to make you feel bad
Oh, it might be a shame of me to treat you like that
When there's everything you've worked for in your life
On this line

When you're always on this line
When you're always on this line
You could've crossed a million times
But you're always on this line
Oh, put your hands up, claim your crime
'Cause you never had the time
You still get to work just fine
When you're always on this line
So
So
You're so
So
