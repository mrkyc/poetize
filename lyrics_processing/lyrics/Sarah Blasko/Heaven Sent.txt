Don't wanna know where we all go
Up above or down below
I'm gonna hit my stride, play my part
Before I wake the dead from their rest

Don't wanna know where we all came from
On a star or were we reborn
Just wanna heal my scars, play my part
Well I am in this life, not in the next

I could be right, I could be wrong
But all that matters to me
What is in the heart, not what you believe
Open up my eyes so that I can meet
A world within my reach, right in front of me

If the answers are blowin' in the wind
There's no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Were the ashes of my mother her returning?
I've no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Or just a dream
You might also like
Don't wanna know where we all will go
Up above or down below
I know we've hit this hard, burst these scars
Don't wanna wake the dead from their beds

Don't wanna know where we all came from
But what we're doing to weather the storm
I wanna play my part, repel the dark
Until I leave this life for what comes next

I might be right, I might be wrong
But all that matters to me
What is in the heart, not what you believe
Open up my eyes so that I can meet
A world within my reach, right in front of me

If the answers are blowin' in the wind
There's no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Were the ashes of my mother her returning?
I've no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Or just a dream
Or just a dream
You and I are moving in the same realm
Regardless of our views on heaven and hell
So let's commune before this precious time ends
Reflections of the light that is surrounding

Might be right, might be wrong
But all that matters to me
What is in the heart, not what you believe
Open up my eyes so that I can meet
A world within my reach, right in front of me

If the answers are blowin' in the wind
There's no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Were the ashes of my mother her returning?
I've no way of knowing
If we're heaven sent
We could be heaven sent
Or just a dream
Or just a dream
Or just a dream
