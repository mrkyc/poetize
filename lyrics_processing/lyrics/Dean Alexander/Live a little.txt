Yeah, live a little
Live a little
Everybody's got a friend, got a buddy
Got somebody that ain't livin' it up (live a little)
Afraid of fallin', afraid to go all in
When all they gotta do is jump (live a little)
We got a dream, got a wish
All we all gotta do is quit wasting time
And live a little life
Yeah, live a little
Get your girl, get your Chevy
Find a spot, find a dock, find a levee
Get your kiss, you know you're ready
Let love fall on you like confetti
You only got one shot don't waste it
Get a taste, better get a bite
And live a little life
Yeah, live a little
For every boy there's a girl
That's sitting on a bar stool batting an eye
And there's another one of you, and he's looking at her too
Brother don't let her pass you by, yeah
She's a bright sunny day, take a risk
Catch a wave, the water's fine
And live a little life
Yeah, live a little

If there's a top to pop, if there's a party to rock
You're the only one slowing you down
Don't hesitate, cause it will be too late
If it's any later than right now
