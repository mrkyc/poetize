Girl, I loved you (for real)
I accepted all your flaws, I never judged you (I ain't never say nothin')
But I heard a lot of shit from my dawgs
Now I feel I can't trust you ('cause you be on some bullshit)
'Cause you play too many games
You must think I'm one of them lames
You use to talk to (but I'm not)
But I gave up the pimpin' for your broke ass (Damn right)
And I let you spend when you had no cash
But you played me (like Nintendo)
I called you my lady
I never asked you where you was going (Where you been?)
'Cause you would lie and say out with your friends You must think I'm crazy, but I'ma show you crazy (I'm 'bout to lose it)

'Cause I feel some type of way (feel some type of way, yeah)
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way (Yes, I do)
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now

Tell me who put food on your table (me)
Kept up wit your lights and your cable (me)
But if I don't see you, tell me who gon' feed you  (real talk baby)
And everything you said was so phony
I shoulda never introduced to my homies (no)
But really I don't need you ( I don't need you)
And this is why we through
You might also like
Cause I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now

Have you ever wanted your shorty to stay the night
But she told you no and it made you tight
That was your girl your whole world you would've made her your wife
But come to find out, your homeboy was laying the pipe
She was the reason for me making them songs "Beautiful" and "Special Friend" and even "Love Making" all night long
Now that I'm without her it feel like my day getting long
So if I feel some type of way am I wrong?

'Cause I feel some type of way (I feel some type of way)
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
I feel some type of way right now
I feel some type of way
