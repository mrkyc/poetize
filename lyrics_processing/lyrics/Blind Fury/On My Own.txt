I been out here on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
Ever since I was grown
Now I just gotta roam until I find me a home
I'll be out here on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time

I woke up this morning and talked to the Lord before I got dressed (Amen!)
Told him, "Send me a sign and get me up outta this mess,"
Lately haters and fakers got me so down and depressed
But I keep my faith in the Savior 'cause I'm too blessed to be stressed
I got the mind of a madman and the heart of a lion
Wish I spent more time laughing, not all of it cryin'
I feel so small to these giants, it's like I'm talkin' to tyrants
Don't believe in the Stevie, well shut the fuck up and try it
M-mama tell me, "Keep tryin',"
But I don't know if I wanna
Labels ain't paying me lately, I should sell dope on the corner
Most of my homies is goners 'cause they got caught up in trappin'
E-either locked up in prison or they got caught up in traffic
I paint a portrait so graphic
My mind is warped and it's tragic
Don't do interviews often 'cause I hate talkin' to rappers
Put it all in my raps 'til I make an album full of songs
But until then I be out here on my own
You might also like
I been out here on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
Ever since I was grown
Now I just gotta roam until I find me a home
I'll be out here on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time

I'm sick and tired of these people using my kindness for weakness
They be mistreatin' me secretly, like I'm blind and don't see it
Just 'cause I'm blind it don't mean you can go get grimey with Stevie
But they be constantly lyin' to me like I'ma believe 'em
Respect my mind and my freedom
I do the same for you, homie
If I had problems and beef, I woulda came for you, homie
I'll lend some game to you, homie
If your li'l brain can absorb it
But if you can't then ignore it
Don't try to make me a target
I made a lane for these artists
Nobody gimme my credit
Nobody handed me nothing
I had to go out and get it
Now I show out with bitches wanting more than attention
'Cause I be hoping and wishing I could get throat in a Bentley
So I just inhale the loud
L-l-let you blow out the midget
Use my name and my fame and these bitches throw out the digits
I take 'em out to the car and blow the sour 'cause it's strong
But after that, I'll be out here on my own
I been out here on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
For a long time
For a long, long time
Yeah, I been on my own
Ever since I was grown
Now I just gotta roam until I find me a home
I'll be out here on my own
For a long time
