(Yeah)
Ay, look
Just put me on the mic
Let me get right in to it
I do like this every night
Ladies be loving my music
I get em' crazy and krunk
Til' they get stupid and lose it
Gotta' respect what I'm doing
Cause this is more than a movement
I be like
Killed them all in the beginning because I was singing
But now I'm a switch it up
Holding the mic in my hand, it's so tight I feel like I
Been breaking my wrist's up
Rolling around with the wisemen
Ain't nobody is gettin' as rich as us
And I'm addicted to money, I get it all the time
But I can not get enough
Yeah
Ain't nobody killing it in this backroom
Cause I'm coming in with a filthy mouth
That's dirtier than a bathroom
In the back of a nasty house
Occupied by some blind white guy
Who ghost write rhymes, but the price is sky-high
They waitin' for me to get reckless
I know, they probably expect this
I stay real mellow and ride real slow
Just like I came down from Texas
I got my main man Earl
And ya' know I'm taking over the world
Got DJ Live on the tables
And he gon' make them records swirl

The album dropped on March 25th
So, I'm doin' the shows, all over globe
Been getting plenty chips
Don't worry about me cause I'm doing fine
I just wrote and I freestyled a couple a bars off in this rhyme
But you don't know which one is which
The flow it really switch
Gotta' change up my pitch, cause I swear I feel filthy rich
Really, I'm still just humble
Fuck around in the concrete jungle
And they know that I'm ridin' through the tunnel
This is a Royal Rumble
Yeah
Got a whole lot of flows
And I gotta' get mo' of em'
Gotta' go to the studio drop a couple flow
Cause you know that the dough comin'
Don't got no bun in the oven, and I ain't trying to make one
But I holla at DJ Live to do a show, cause I gotta' get the cake son!
Now I'm on a cake run
Let me just flip it, cause I been terrific
I was born up in 84 but they know that I'm bout to kill em wit' lyrics
I don't be listenin' to the radio because it be filled up wit' gibberish
Gutter, just like trash, they won't play mine, so, I am not feeling it
