Yeah
(Oh yeah)

I been workin' all week
And I need to unwind
So I'm 'boutta buy a case
And then find a place
To get some peace of mind
Turning off my phone
So don't worry 'bout callin' me
'Cause I got a nice cold can in my left hand
And I'm right where I'm supposed to be

'Cause I like to drink beer in the morning
And beer in the afternoon
It's Friday, I just got paid
And y'all know what I'm 'bout to do
Yeah, I like to drink beer when I'm happy
And beer when I'm feelin' blue
It's the weekend, let the fun begin
I'ma pop me a top or two

Yeah, I like 'em in a bottle
And I like 'em in a can
I like 'em on draft, keep 'em coming back to back
And I keep one in my hand
I like to drink 'em at the ball game
I like to drink 'em at the bar
And if they close it down, it's still going down
I got some more left in Troy's car

'Cause I like to drink beer in the morning
And beer in the afternoon
It's Friday, I just got paid
And y'all know what I'm 'bout to do

And beer when I'm feelin' blue
