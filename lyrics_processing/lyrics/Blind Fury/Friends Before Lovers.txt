Uh, she was a little bit shorter than me
A little bit older than me
But when she started noticing me
It was everything I thought it would be
No it was better (better), more better
A whole lot of pressure made me keep it from the world
And I was getting pleasure outta cheating on my girl
Sneaking and creeping and hardly ever speaking
Till I started visiting your crib on the weekend
I remember when you sat down and learned all my songs
And in the background we made love, all night long
I never thought of catching feelings that will be this strong
For something that feels so right, it can't be wrong
I was too busy thinking about my daily buzz
Instead of recognizing what we had, maybe love
I wish I can take it back to the way we was
You know before you was my lady, cause

We were friends
Then we were lovers
Now we can't stand seeing each other
What am I gonna do
What did I do to you
To make you say that we're through
You said it so it must be true
You might also like
Getting high, telling lies
What made the relationship die
Or maybe it never lived
I gave what I could give
Even when I couldn't, used take care of you at the crib
I was doing it big then I kinda slacked off
When I ain't had no bread, that's when you backed off
The love that I thought I'd found and got lost
And if it got your boy rattled like a bad cough
Yeah I'm mad for it, but she is too
Did a U-turn cause you didn't want to see shit through
Tried to keep it cool but you act like you ain't have sense
Left me a message and I ain't called you back since
I'm doing black flips thinking it over
You got me so messed up I had to drink to get sober
And the web you was weaving bout tangled the soldier
But you was the only plan I ever stuck to
And baby that's why I love you

We were friends
Then we were lovers
Now we can't stand seeing each other
What am I gonna do
What did I do to you
To make you say that we're through
You said it so it must be true
Sitting back and I'm thinking bout it
Wishin' I could get her back but I really doubt it
'Cause ain't enough words I can say for the lies I told
And like Mary J, she don't wanna cry no more
Plus I get the feeling she done move on to the next
'Cause she don't return calls or respond to my text
I don't know what I did to make you act like that
But listen I just want my best friend back, holla

We were friends
Then we were lovers
Now we can't stand seeing each other
What am I gonna do
What did I do to you
To make you say that we're through
You said it so it must be true

We were friends
Then we were lovers
Now we can't stand seeing each other
What am I gonna do
What did I do to you
To make you say that we're through
