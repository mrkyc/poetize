I think it's time I clear the air
'Cause every time I turn around, I got a hater
Watching what I do now just to talk about it later
Tried to get away, but they follow me everywhere
So all you haters, you can hate on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me (ha)
I don't see why they can't leave me by my lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely (yeah, huh huh)
So you can hate on me

Well-known in my city, I'm at home in my town
I ain't know them like Diddy, but I'm holding it down
All the phonies and clowns, they just wanna be down
Behind my back they act like they just don't want me around
I don't spit to impress you, find a bitch to get next to
Hard to believe, but if you sneezed, then I still wouldn't bless you
It's time I keep it real, 'cause ain't no pussies here
Unless you talking about females, then there's some pussy here
I speak the truth up in this booth, just like I've done for years
Got called a junkie by my peers, but look who put me here
Don't need a label to tell me that I'm the fucking illest
As long as when my album drop, somebody fucking feels it
Lock that inside with my pride, and you can't fucking steal it
Take away the key and seal it, off in a tomb
This mixture of weed and shrooms is about to make you feel the boom
Looking forward to an album coming soon

I ain't Waka Flocka Flame but I'm about to drop the pain
On all 'em half-ass rappers that have to holler out my name
I swear it's gotten kinda lame with the profit margin change
Every time you holler it's like goin' to shout it out for fame (Aghhh)
'Cause you prolly need it
No, I'm not conceited
I just don't like what you spit 'cause I don't fuckin' believe it
Anybody alive that really wanna take a shot at the guys
I'm guaranteeing that you're all gonna die
And your boldness is gonna the reason you end in a spot regarding the sky
Talk about my flows, and then come out for shows
I cut your life off like a pillow covering your mouth and nose
Everybody in the south just knows, we them killas that run it
Always whipping in something
Everyday, twist up an onion
Make a million by Monday, to a hustler, it's nothing
Labels say they want the album, tell 'em it's coming
I ain't telling 'em nothing, you know what I'm 'bout to do
Get up in the T Block and a mothafucker like me get to boppin' tunes 
I think it's time I clear the air
'Cause every time I turn around, I got a hater
Watching what I do now just to talk about it later
Tried to get away, but they follow me everywhere
So all you haters, you can hate on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me (ha)
I don't see why they can't leave me by my lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely (yeah, huh huh)
