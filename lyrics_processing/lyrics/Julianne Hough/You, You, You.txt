When I saw your face
And how I felt as unstable
As the patio table
That September day
And Madonna was playing
From a car that was waiting
For the light to turn
And it only took a minute
The love that had me in it
And the fire began to burn
It's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front
Of a train, train, train
Just to hold your hand
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do
Just to be with
You, You, You
You might also likeWell I'd seen you before
A couple times or more
I even called your friend
But when the stars were ready
You were always going steady
Up there on the fence
And when love came around
My guard was never down
I was quick on my feet
And I never would've thought
That I'd ever get caught
With my heart on my sleeve
Yeah I know it's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front
Of a train, train, train
Just to water your flowers
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do
Just to be with
You, You, Yeah, You
Well I would run every stop sign
And I don't care
I would always be the first one there
Just to see that look in your eyes
When you know that you never have to, have to ask me twice
Yeah I know it's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front
Of a train, train, train
Just to wash your car
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do
Just to be with
You, You, You
Just to hold your hand
Water your flowers
Hm, just to be with
