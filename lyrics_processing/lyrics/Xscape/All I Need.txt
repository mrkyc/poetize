Can't you see your love is all I need?
(Your love, your love, your love)
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave

Baby, I think you should take the time alone
To sort out your feelings and be sure you're not goin' wrong, no
You see, I know you hear many things that make you cry
But our love is too strong to be ruined by a lie, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

Can't you see your love is all I need?
(Can't you see? Can't you see?)
Without you I'm nothing (I'm nothing) so please don't ever leave
(Please don't ever leave)

Now tell me, how I could ever live without you
(I can't live without you)
If you left me now I don't know what I would do, oh, oh, oh, baby

I've never known anyone who could love me (Love me) like you do
(You mean the world)
You mean the world to me
(Oh yes you do, baby, yeah yeah)
And I feel (Feel I mean as much to you, yeah)
