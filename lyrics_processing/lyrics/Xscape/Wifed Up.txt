When you got a good one, act like you know
Don't wait too long
Cuz if you don't lock it down, you never know
She might be gone... one day
Chorus (Tameka):
Stop tryin' to run away from commitment
You need to stay
Shouldn't be a debate
You be gone at the first sight of emotion
If you got a good one, give her a promotion
(Tasha):
(and wife her up) If you got a girl that you can trust
(wife her up) Don't you say it really show that love
(Tameka)
(wife her, wife her) Real ones can't do nothing but respect it
(wife her, wife her) If you got a down one, don't neglect it
Gon 'head get your wifey
Gon 'head get your wifey
Men will might just swipe her
Men will might just swipe her
You paying too much, if it's more than attention
You should slow down and give your heart to somebody
Yeah wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey yeah yeah yeah
