Ah yeah
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up
Yo, if you got a groove that you like and you like it a lot
(Pump it up, pump it up)
If you know the place with the bass that's the neighborhood hot spot
(Pump it up, pump it up)
Hello to that girl in that blue, tell me what you gon' do
(Pump it up, pump it up)
And to that negro in red, tell me what I said
(Pump it up, pump it up)
You gotta keep pumpin'

I went out looking for a good place
But everywhere I went was dull
I went here, and I went there
But I never found the stuff
But then I met this boy that said
He had the perfect place
That I would just love, yeah
He took me in
Ooh, let me tell you, girlfriend
The place was jumpin'
And it was sho 'nuff pumpin'
(Pumpin')

You gotta keep it pumpin'
You gotta keep it pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
You gotta keep it pumpin'
You gotta keep it pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
(Yo Kandi, break 'em off)

I found my spot
Nothing about the place seemed dull
And the stuff I was looking for
I found the stuff
The sound was hot, like I never heard before
The bass was boomin'
And there were people all over the dance floor
Then I met another guy
And he asked me would I like to dance
He showed me steps I never seen before
I walked in
Ooh, let me tell you, girlfriend
The place was jumpin'
And it was sho 'nuff pumpin'
(Pumpin')
You gotta keep it pumpin'
You gotta keep it pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
You gotta keep it pumpin'
You gotta keep it pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)

That's the way I like it
I like it when it's pumpin'
That's the way I like it
I like it when it's pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
That's the way I like it
I like it when it's pumpin'
That's the way I like it
I like it when it's pumpin'
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
Yo, if you got a groove that you like
And you like it a lot

Hello to that girl in that blue
