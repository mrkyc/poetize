Just had to get up on this here thang and stamp it for y'all
Keep it hot, S.W.A.T, College Park, Decatur
That's on the real
No, no
Tell me, tell me
Keep it on the real
(The real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)

Trust is something that we can't live without
Honesty must be there, ain't got no room for no doubt
Reality can't waste no more of our precious time
Trying to escape the pressures of our mind

I don't ask for much, no no
Baby, if you want me you've gotta tell me something, yeah
All I want from you is just to keep it comin', no no
Keep it on the real
(The real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)

Faithfully I'll give my loving to you
Soulfully our spirits will make it through
Respect me, baby, and I'll respect you
What more can two lovers do?
