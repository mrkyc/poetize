Woo, you gave me up and left me breathing
But now I'm up and I've got reason
To believe you didn't want me to make it this far
You're so bad like a heathen
Some say luck, but it's my season
To climb above the ground and stand up tall

Your words don't hurt, you can say whatever
Judge me, judge me, I'ma do better
Fight me, fight me all that you want
But I'll never be done

So you haven't seen the last of me
I'ma come back harder
I'ma be so damn tougher
You better take cover
'Cause you haven't seen the last of me
I'ma be filled with laughter
I'm still standing after
All that's been done to me
You haven't seen the last of me

You took my love and you misplaced it
So my trust is on vacation
Something you could use for fun
You took my breath and tried to keep it
That was then, now I don't need it
'Cause now I know I can make it on my own

Your words don't hurt, you can say whatever
Judge me, judge me, I'ma do better
Fight me, fight me all that you want
But I'll never be done

So you haven't seen the last of me
I'ma come back harder
I'ma be so damn tougher
You better take cover
'Cause you haven't seen the last of me
I'ma be filled with laughter
I'm still standing after
All that's been done to me
You haven't seen the last of me

It's not over, I'm not done, no
My new life has just begun
Now I'm gonna do what I want to
I'm gonna make sure that I do
My best to get better
Fall back game strong, I swear

So you haven't seen the last of me
I'ma come back harder (I'm still, coming back)
I'ma be so damn tougher (I will, I will)
You better take cover
'Cause you haven't seen the last of me (Me, oh)
I'ma be filled with laughter
I'm still standing after (I'm standing, oh-oh-oh)
All that's been done to me
