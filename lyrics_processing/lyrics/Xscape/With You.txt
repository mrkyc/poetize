Ah yeah
This the kinda jam you can smoke a big fat ass blunt to
Break it down, baby

I wanna spend my whole life with you
There's nothing else better than being with you
(There's nothing else I'd rather do)
I wanna spend my whole life
My whole life with you (You)

Do you remember all those precious times
We shared back in the past
No one knew about the things we did
Out in the grass (Nasty)
We're older now
And we both need companionship
So let's stop these games
And get on with our relationship

Ain't no second guessin' about
(The way I feel) when I'm with you
(It makes me feel so real)
Ain't no living without you
'Cause you're all the man I need
And I want you just for me

I wanna spend my whole life with you
There's nothing else better than being with you
I wanna spend my whole life
My whole life with you

Why is it (Funky)
When I say I love you (Nasty)
You shy away from me?
When loving's all I wanna do
Even though we've never been
More than just friends
There's no reason
We should have to let our feelings end

Ain't no second guessin' about
(The way I feel) when I'm with you
(It makes me feel so real)
Ain't no living without you
'Cause you're all the man I need
And I want you just for me

I wanna spend my whole life with you
There's nothing else better than being with you
I wanna spend my whole life
My whole life with you
I wanna spend my whole life with you
There's nothing else better than being with you
I wanna spend my whole life
My whole life with you
Ain't no second guessin' about
When I'm with you
Ain't no living without you

I wanna spend my whole life with you
There's nothing else better than being with you
I wanna spend my whole life
My whole life with you

I wanna spend my whole life with you
I'm telling you, and there's nothing else I'd rather do
I wanna spend my whole life
