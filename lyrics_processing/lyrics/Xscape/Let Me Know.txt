I got something for you
And I think you're sexy
And if you want me, let me know
You ain't gotta spend no money
Just a little time with me, honey
And that will let me know you love me so

There are so many things
I want to talk to you about
Like do you want me, do you love me?
'Cause I have my doubts
I have a funny feeling
That you want me around for just one thing
To push your little ego
With the knowledge that I bring

I got something for you
(Got something for you)
And I think you're sexy
And if you want me let me know
(Just let me know)
You ain't gotta spend no money
Just a little time with me, honey
And that will let me know you love me so

I never knew that love could ever have me slipping
