Tocha, Kandi, Tiny, Tamika, you know the flavor
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?

When I hear your voice
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
When you come around
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
When you touch me
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
When I look in your eyes
And you look into mine
Do you know what you do to me?

Just when you think you know the game
It all comes to an end someday
'Cause everybody's got somebody
That moves built in some way
See, I never thought I could happen to me
I couldn't see it
Until I met you, you set me free, baby

If this was a crush I would've been long over you
But I know it's more
'Cause you got me doin' things I said I'd never do
My heart beat beat beat, I'm losin' sleep
Wanna see you again
I'm doin' everything to let you know
I wanna be more than friends

When it comes to you I lose all my control
I let the situation get out of hand
Situation get out of hand
'Cause after life of playin' with you
Don't wanna be by myself
I can't seem to see you wit no one else
Baby, baby, that's the kind of things you do to me
Do you know what you do to me?
Do you know what you do to me?
