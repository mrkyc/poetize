Play me some music, and pour me some wine
I'm in the mood now, I got love on my mind
I want you to know, that I like it real slow
And whenever you're ready, you can slide off my clothes
And touch my body, anywhere
I'm yours tonight, make it right
Baby, just take me there

Take your time and work me slowly (Work it)
'Cause I'm the kind of girl
Who needs the kind of guy
That can last (Ooh, work it, work it)
Don't need a man around
If he's throwin' down too fast
You gotta work me slowly

Now change your position, and keep it right there
Just go with my motions, rub you hands through my hair
I hope you don't mind it, if I let out a scream
'Cause it's feeling too good to me, it's more than I dreamed
It's more than pleasure, it's ecstasy
Up and down, round and round
Baby, just come with me, take your time

Take your time and work me slowly (Work it)
'Cause I'm the kind of girl
Who needs the kind of guy
That can last (Work it, work it)
Don't need a man around
If he's throwin' down too fast
You gotta work me slowly

Then in the morning
We'll do it all over again
(We'll do it all over again)
I don't want this feeling to ever end, no (No no)
I can't believe how you're loving me
You give me all (You're giving me all)
I can't believe you're still stroking me
'Cause baby, you're taking it all

Take your time and work me slowly (Work it)
'Cause I'm the kind of girl
Who needs the kind of guy
That can last (Work it, work it)
Don't need a man around
If he's throwin' down too fast
You gotta work me slowly
Take your time and work me slowly (Work it)
'Cause I'm the kind of girl
Who needs the kind of guy
That can last (Work it, work it)
Don't need a man around
If he's throwin' down too fast
