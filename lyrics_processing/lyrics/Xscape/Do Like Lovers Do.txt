We've been to the movies once or twice
Had a candlelight dinner, baby
That was oh so nice
I enjoyed all the times at the fair
And walking hand in hand on the beach
With the wind in my hair

Oh, I really like all the things you do
But right about now my body's calling you
It seems like, it seems like
It's time to put all of that to the side
There's a time and place for everything (Everything)
And at this time all I ask you bring is yourself
'Cause tonight is just for you and me
I want you to

Let the night wind down, baby
Fall into my groove
And meet me at my house
To do like true lovers do
I want you to
Let the night wind down, baby
Fall into my groove
And meet me at my house
To do like true lovers do

When you come through my doors
Take off your clothes
I ain't got all mine, baby
So you won't need yours
The places I'ma take you
You won't be needing them
So let's stop all this talking
And let the party begin

Oh, I, I really like all the things you do (Yes I do)
But right about now my body's calling you (Oh, yes it is, baby)
It seems like, it seems like
It's time to put all of that behind
There's a time and place for everything (Everything)
And at this time all I ask you bring is yourself (Yourself)
Tonight, tonight's the night for you and me

Let the night wind down baby
Fall into my groove
And meet me at my house
To do like true lovers do
I want you to
Let the night wind down baby
Take me
Fall into my groove
Take me
And meet me at my house
To do like true lovers do
Like true lovers do, baby
