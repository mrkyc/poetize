Ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-woah, ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-woah

Suddenly, it happened so fast
I couldn't believe the news that I received
My heart stopped as I hit the floor
I fell to my knees crying, "Lord, help me"

No matter what time brings
All the changes we go through
In life, there's some things that
We just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love ya
For the rest of my life
Don't they know
True love never dies?
I promise to love ya
For the rest of my life

"Life goes on," that's what they say
Time will heal all your pain away
But I feel, feel so alone, and
Now you're gone, how can I live on?

No matter what time brings
All the changes we go through
In life, there's some things that
We just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do (What they do)
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love ya ('Cause I'm gonna love ya)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)
Don't they know (True love)
True love never dies? (It never, never, never, never dies)
I promise to love ya (Gonna love ya, gonna love ya)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life, ooh)

Until I see you again (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll hold on to sweet memories, yeah
I'll treasure the times we spent
I see ya, I'd do anything
I see your face, I see your smile
You're calling out my name
I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do (What they do)
I don't care what they think (I'm gonna love)
I'm gonna love ya (I'm gonna love ya)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)
Don't they know
True love never dies? (Never dies, no)
I promise to love ya (Gonna love)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)

What they say
What they do (I don't care, babe)
What they think (I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya)
Love ya for the rest of my life
(I don't care what they say, I don't care what they do)
Of my life ('Cause I promise)
To love you (I promise to love you)
To love you (For the rest of my life)
