Boy, make up your mind
Do you want on the ride?
I can be whatever
Whatever you like

'Cause whatever it is
I would go and get it
Go and get it for you
So don't you be a scared kitty
'Cause scared don't look good on you
But I do
I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I do
I sure do

'Cause you got me craving (I gotta have it), craving
You got me craving (I gotta have it), craving
(You like it when I grab it)
Everything that comes with you
It could be old or new
(I'm) Craving, (I'm) craving
(I gotta have it)
