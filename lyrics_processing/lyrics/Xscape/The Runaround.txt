But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin', baby

It's Friday night and I've been freakin' out
Nine hundred times, I know I called your house
So many times your mama cursed me out
But I'm not sorry
Saturday mornin', I ain't slept at all
I smelled her perfume and your alcohol, mmm
They say that you and her have had a ball
Don't you dare lie to me

I know I'm gettin' the runaround
I know that you sleep around
So don't try and play it down
I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it
I'm gettin' the runaround
I know that you sleep around
So don't try and play it down
I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it

I grabbed my keys and I jumped in my ride
I may be hurt but I ain't gonna cry (Tonight, I'll cry)
Just wanna find out what you did last night
Before I leave you
Oh, I found her number and I know her name
I gotta front this girl, make her explain (Talk to me)
I can't believe she dipped into my thing
Yeah, she's getting over

It took a lot for me to give you all my lovin', yeah
And just to think I gave you everything for nothing
I tried my best to satisfy you
All the times that I stood right by you
I think that I'll be better on my own, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it
But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe
