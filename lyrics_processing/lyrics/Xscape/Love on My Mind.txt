Why don't you listen to this recording with interest

Boy, I can't wait to get you alone inside my house
'Cause baby, it's you and only you that I keep on thinking about
I know what you want and how good my love could be
Tonight you'll get the answers, I'll satisfy your curiosity

Take me away in ecstasy
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, yeah
Boy, take your time because I have all night
I'm gonna show you what I've been thinking of

I got love on my mind
I know I should wait but tonight feels right
I think it's about that time
I got love on my mind ('Cause I'm in the mood)
And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to

I've been watching you and thinking to myself
You're looking so so def to me, and I'm feeling so sexy
You know I never felt this way before
I really can't help myself, 'cause I'm thinking of nothing else
