The show is cancelled
So I'm flying home to see my man
Been gone two weeks
So I'm feenin' for his loving
Get my bags headed straight to the limo
Mika, Tocha, Kiesha let's go
Slow your roll lil' mama we're coming girl
Pulled up to the crib and I noticed his car in the driveway that ain't right
Now my heart is beating, nigga better not be cheating
Wait a minute that's ol' girl's beamer
But she knew I had a show in Cleveland
Now nobody don't jump to conclusions
Well, she better have a damn good excuse then

Somebody better call the police
This shit ain't happening to me
They done made a fool outta me
Who they think they playing with?
It's goin down on 1059 Starland Drive
I'ma bout to bring out the heat
Somebody better call the police
Somebody better call the police
This shit ain't happening to me
They done made a fool outta me
Who they think they playing with?
It's goin down on 1059 Starland Drive
I'ma bout to bring out the heat

Let's go buzz up in his bedroom
Girl I think that you should play it cool
I ain't tryna hear it
Somebody's about to get it
Just kicked in the door
They lyin' in the bed just like we thought
Shut up don't say a word
Nothing you can say cause I don't wanna hear it
Somebody grab that trick
Why you playing don't you move a motherfucking inch
I'm about to count
It's too late to turn back now

Somebody better call the police

Ain't nothing but that girl is a hoe
I betcha she won't do it no more
Yeah he's in the closet, put you in the closet, rest in the closet
Stop, wait, think before you go and do something crazy
Cause he ain't worth it no
He'll miss you when you're gone
Just get your things and go
Tiny no!
