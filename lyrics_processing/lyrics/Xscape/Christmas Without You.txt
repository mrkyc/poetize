The snow is falling like I knew it would
Carolers are already singing
(La la la la la, la la la)
Last year is all that I can think about
Every time I hear sleigh bells ringing

But I, I know
That when summer came I pushed you away
I should have never let you go, no
Now all I'm really trying to say is

I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(I miss you so much)
You're all that I want (I want)
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
I miss you, come home (I miss you)

I remember all the love we made
I miss your stocking on the fireplace
Ooh, underneath the mistletoe we stayed
T'was a very special holiday

But I, I know
That when summer came I pushed you away
I should have never let you go, no
Now all I'm really trying to say is

I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(Oh, I) You're all that I want
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(Come on home, come on)
I miss you, come home

There's a fire that's still burning in my heart tonight
There's no reason why we both should be alone
It's the night before Christmas
And I'm waiting here for you to come home, come home

I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(There'll never be another Christmas without you, baby)
You're all that I want
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(Without you here in my life)
I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(I know there'll never be, there'll never be another Christmas, no, oh no)
You're all that I want
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(No, baby)
I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
(Never be, there'll never be another Christmas)
You're all that I want
