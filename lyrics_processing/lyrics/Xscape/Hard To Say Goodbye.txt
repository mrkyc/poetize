Time has been short since you left me
So I can't help but think
Of how things between us used to be
You were a piece of my heart
And I thought that we were swell
Until you told me you were leaving
To find a better life for yourself, oh I

I wish we were together again
Loving the way we used to love
(The way we used to love)
Boy, I miss you much
(Boy, I miss you much)
I wish we were together again
Oh, how I'm missing you
(Heaven knows)
It's so hard for me to say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Goodbye

Mmm, you know that I love you
And for you there ain't nothing in this world
That I won't do
If you would only come back to me, mmm
And let me show you how loving me could be

I, I've got feelings, ha ha
But you act like you don't care
You treat me so unfair

Love has no meaning
Since you walked right out my life
You've touched a part of me
Can't you see that I'm in need of you?

I wish we were together again
(Oh, I'm missing you) (Missing you)
(Oh, I'm missing you)
Loving the way we used to love
(The way we used to love)
Boy, I miss you much
(Boy, I miss you much)
I wish we were together again
(Wish we were together)
Oh, how I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)
It's so hard for me to say goodbye
(Bye bye bye bye)
I wish we were together again
(Bye bye bye bye)
(I wish were were together, baby)
Loving the way we used to love
(Oh, yes I do)
Boy, I miss you much
(Oh, the way you used to love me, baby)
I wish we were together again
Oh, how I'm missing you
It's so hard for me to say goodbye (Bye)
