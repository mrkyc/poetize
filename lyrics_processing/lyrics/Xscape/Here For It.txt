I'm not new to this life
Been slaying all my life
Make you hit me with the look back twice
Make you hit me with the look back twice (Woo)

Hand it over to the rightful owner
Spotlight, never in the corner
Thick thighs, can you handle all of this woman?
Thick thighs, can you handle all of this water? (Splash, splash)
Don't waste my time tryna bring me down
If you can't match my bank account
That's something to think about
My body still bring the haters out
So I'ma keep giving something to hate about

Wait, wait, wait, let me tell you what they say (What they say)
That's too much drip for a lady (For a lady)
Bossin' on the regular
Put myself on a pedestal
Wait, wait, wait, let me tell you what they say (What they say)
I'm heavy on the sauce and the seasoning
And you right, though, for no reason
For your info, I always please

I don't know about you but I'm here for it
Where you at?
Fix your face before you make a look
I know I'm hot, body badder than a mug
I don't know about you but I'm here for it
Where you at?
Uh, tell me where you at
Send the locate, tell me how about that

Being popping off, being extra saucy
Been heavy with the hip game
Bought P, no propane
But only for my main 'cause they nigga lame
Having it and renting it ain't the same thing
It's okay to do you in your own lane

Send it, you know I'll come to wherever you are
Really having it, I compare my shine to a star
Not the sun, since it goes down at nighttime
I've been two-way with it glist', two-way with it glist'
Two-way with it glistening

Being popping off, being extra saucy
Been heavy with the hip game
Bought P, no propane
But only for my main 'cause they nigga lame
