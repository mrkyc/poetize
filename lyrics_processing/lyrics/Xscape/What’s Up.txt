Up in the club with my girls looking good
Feelin' sexy like I'm s'posed to be
('Cause I'm the shit)
My jeans huggin' tight, hangin' low
(Lookin' ready for it)
And I see you watchin' me

'Cause you like it when I shake it, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh-oh
Don't you like it when I take it
To the floor, drop it low?
Shawty, you can't handle this
I'm that girl, oh
You will love it but I know the game
You ain't 'bout to play me

You be lookin' at me like you wanna come and hit it
But I know what's goin' on so you ain't gonna get it (Oh no)
All my girls in the club, let 'em know that you ain't wit' it
But what's up? (What's up?)
What's up? (What's up?)
What's up? (What's up?)
What's up? (What's up?)
See Xscape LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
Feels like you're gettin' too close, back it up
Shawty, can you give a girl some room
('Cause I'm the shit)
Damn, can you please let me breathe?
You don't want me to walk away

'Cause you like it when I shake it, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh-oh
Don't you like it when I take it
To the floor, drop it low?
Shawty, you can't handle this
I'm that girl, oh
You will love it but I know the game
You ain't 'bout to play me

Can handle this

You be lookin' at me like you wanna come and hit it
