I gave you all of mine
You pushed me to the side
Boy you know I tried to put you first
You gave it to me right even though you lied
I stayed with you and that's what really hurts
You promised me the world, said i'm your perfect girl
And I was so invested in your love
Then I opened up the blind and uncovered my eyes
Cause you ain't never cared about us (no)
{Chorus: LaTocha Scott}
You sold it to me, then stole it from me
Boy you nothing but a dream killa (killa)
My one and only, tried to control me
Boy you nothing but a dream killa
(Killa 5x)
Boy you nothing but a dream killa
(Killa 3x)
Yeah (Killa)
Boy you nothing but a dream killa
{Verse 2: Tameka "Tiny" Harris}
You wanted me at home
When you know it don't work like that
When you're dealing with me
You can't tell me no that's not the way it goes
If you don't want it to be a scene
But you know what it was everytime it was us
But somehow you just wanna play games
Sometimes I think it's lust, You confuse it with love
But i'm not hoping that you change

You sold it to me, then stole it from me

{Verse 4: Tameka "Tiny" Harris}
Just leave if you're not happy
Ain't no need for acting
I don't want to fix it
Since you do me different
Just leave if you're not happy
Ain't no need for acting
Cause you know (5x)
What you doing babe
