Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ooh (Baby), ooh (Well, well, well)
Ooh, ooh

It's a glowing inner feeling
Like a summer sun that slowly rises
On a new horizon of love
And it's more exotic than Jamaica
Or the rain that falls in Costa Rica
Like a waterfall to the sea
So tell me, baby

Do you wanna fly?
I can take you high
Come ride over these midnight skies (Come ride with me, come lay with me, me)
If you're looking for heaven's only door
You got the key
Baby, open me (Baby)

Baby, won't you come inside? (Mm-hmm)
I'll take you on a fantasy ride (I'll take you, boy, I'll take you there)
Take a journey through my universe (Through my universe)
My love's the softest place on Earth (Mm-hmm)
You don't have to pull the blinds (No)
Let the neighbors lose their minds (Uh)
Baby, you can be the first
Inside the softest place on Earth

We can do it in the movies, or my jacuzzi
Or maybe Central Park, it ain't matter (It's all right with me, baby)
So if there's any doubt, that's what I'm all about
