Know
Who's that man?

He's got a different little style than all the men today
He does his thing with a swing
And everything you see him do is in a different way
You've never ever seen before

He's not your ordinary slick, uptown type of brother
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another
*There goes the man behind the mask
You've never ever seen before*
(Never never seen him before)

Know (Whoa, yeah)
Who's that man?
