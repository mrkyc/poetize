...ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Come a little bit closer and look into my eyes
If only for a moment, boy, don't be surprised
I want you right here next to me
So, tell me, can we spend some time?
So, I can hold you softly in these gentle arms of mine
(And the moonlight's gazing, ooh)
Shinin' on my window pane
Beaming down on the midnight hour
I hear the sound of rain

Tonight, tonight
Oh
(Tonight)
Tonight, tonight
Oh

So, why don't you stay awhile?
I can't help it if you're puttin' me in a daze, boy
But you look so good to me, me
In your satin PJs
So, let's make love by candlelight
And listen to the quiet storm
As I kiss you in the places that make your body warm
