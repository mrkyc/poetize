I can make any man do whatever it takes
Yet I hesitate
Sit 'em down or wine and dine and make it plain
There's more to love (More to love) than you're thinking of (Thinking of)
If I can wait, then why won't you my my my my love

There's more to love then making love
So why don't you just hold on
There's a time for everything
But I have got to know
(Hold on to love) Hold on to love
(Hold on to love) Hold on to love
(Hold on to love) Hold on to love
Hold on to love

It's not too late
To slow it down, settle down and appreciate
All the love I'm showing you and giving you in other ways
Soon enough my heart will say to you I do, to love always
I'll give myself to you that day
Ooh, my baby, oh yeah yeah yeah

I don't want to be another one (Another one)
So you can say that you've had your way (No, no no, no no)
I'll show you I'm worth the wait (Worth the wait)
Just hold on to every day (Every day)
And we will know how far to go in time
