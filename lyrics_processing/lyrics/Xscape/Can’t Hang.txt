Let's get down
Let's get down

You claim, you've been waiting
With no game, just anticipating
How it would be if you and I were in the sack
But to me, you look like you wouldn't know how to act

I need someone to hold me, all night long
It must be you, my darlin' - am I wrong?
It ain't a damn thing, baby, show me what you can bring
Cause some try to swang but they still can't hang

You and me, let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang
You and me let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang

You claim, you can do this, this and that
Ain't no shame in my game
If it's wack, I gotta tell you that
So you better be up on your down stroke
You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat
'Cause in my mind I think you're gonna slip, baby

I need someone to hold me, all night long
It must be you, my darlin' - am I wrong?
It ain't a damn thing, baby, show me what you can bring
'Cause some try to swang but they still can't hang

You and me, let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang
You and me, let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang

You talk a lot of this and you talk a lot of that
Is it all fact, brotha man, are you fat?
'Cause if it's on the real, I come with mad sex appeal
Flip Lyte to luscious, you know the deal
Hey, that's me, I be the sleek
The one with the physique
I freak you in the sheets
I take a nigga deep down under
Make him wonder
How to make the lighting come before the thunder
That's the pleasure I bring
I make a nigga get up and sing, ting-a-ling-a-ling-ling
I got the pow, the boogie and the bang bang
You can't hang? Don't talk the yang
You and me, let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang
You and me, let's get down (Let's get down)
Even though you claim that you've been around
I bet ya can't hang, I bet ya can't hang

You and me, you and me (Let's get down)
You and me, you and me (Let's get down)
