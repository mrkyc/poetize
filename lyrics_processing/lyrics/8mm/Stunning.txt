You make your case, oh, so well
And I can tell
It's the same ole' song and dance
But I can't help feeling
We just might
Might get it right this time
But I can't help feeling
Boy, I'm dreamin', just who are we kidding babe?

And isn't it stunning
How I'm gonna fall again
And isn't it stunning
Divine and fine to find myself
In your binds again
Hopeless to no end
And isn't it stunning
How we both know it's gonna end

Oh, maybe if it weren't so fun
And oh, oh, oh
If I didn't think that you were the one
I might walk I might talk
Like I had some pride
But I can't help feeling
It's in your arms
In your arms I've died
You might also like
And isn't it stunning
How I'm gonna fall again
And isn't it stunning
Divine and fine to find myself
In your binds again
Hopeless to no end
And isn't it stunning
How we both know it's gonna end

I could be your everything
If you let me, if you let me
I could be your everything
If you let me, let me

And isn't it stunning
How I'm gonna fall again
And isn't it stunning
Divine and fine to find myself
In your binds again
Hopeless to no end
And isn't it stunning
How we both know it's gonna end
And isn't it stunning
I could be your everything if you let me
(I'm falling)
If you let me be
(Isn't it stunning)
I could be your everything if you let me

If you let me be
