You know it has to end like this
You know that it's the only way
You know it has to end like this
You know it, babe...
You know it has to end like this
You know that it's the only way
Bite my lip and with the slip of your tongue
Now look how it's come undone

You know, you know
I thought it was all for me
You know, you know
I thought it was all for me
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha

You know I don't want to make this mess
But I might do it anyway
You thought kiss and a little confess
No, it's not that easy, babe
You might also like
You know, you know
I thought it was all for me
You know, you know
I thought it was all for

You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this
You made me do this

You know, you know
I thought it was all for me
You know, you know
I thought it was all for me
You know, you know
I thought it was all for
You said it was all for
I thought it was all for
You said it was all for me
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
Heart and soul you're mine
Flesh and bone you're mine
