Sometimes we give it all up just for love
Just to find out that it wasn't love at all
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes we want somebody in our bed
So bad we give up ourselves
Sometimes, sometimes

So it ain't nothing wrong
With thinking with our hearts
And letting someone in
The storm might break you down
But you'll get up again
And learn from your mistakes
Forgive but don't forget
Don't let it hold you back
'Cause sooner or later

You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You might also like
Sometimes it feels like everything's going wrong
And we feel like it's all our fault
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes we feel like when it's all said and done
Like all of our love is never gonna come
Sometimes

So it ain't nothing wrong
With thinking with our hearts
And letting someone in
The storm might break you down
But you'll get up again
And learn from your mistakes
Forgive but don't forget
Don't let it hold you back
'Cause sooner or later

You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
You will be loved (Be loved, be loved)
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
Sometimes you feel like you're stuck on the ground 'cause of love ('Cause of love)
Sometimes you're down, sometimes you're up
Just at the point when you thought about giving up on love
(On love, on love)

Sooner or later, you will be loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
You will be loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
You'll be loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
Be loved, loved, loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
Loved, loved, loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
You'll be loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
Be loved
(You will be loved, be loved, be loved)
Yeah
You, you will be
You will be loved
You, you will be
You will be loved
You, you will be
