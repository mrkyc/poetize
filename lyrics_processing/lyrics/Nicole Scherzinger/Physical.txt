Come on, girl

Let me, let me into your life
Gimme a minute, baby, gimme the night
I know a secret spot where we can hide
I'll take you there if you're willing to ride

Look around the places, there's no surprise
I'm the girl and, baby, you the guy
I got a body you can exercise
Let's kick it up a notch to ninety-nine

Let's dance, let's get physical
And work your body like some cardio
Let's dance, let's get physical
Let's get emotional and take off our clothes, let's

Don't need the breakfast, goin' overdrive
I thought the clock was goin' overtime
I got authority to overwrite
Made up my mind, I'm staying overnight
You might also like
Look around the place, there's no surprise
I'm the girl and, baby, you the guy
I got a body you can exercise
Let's kick it up a notch to ninety-nine

Let's dance, let's get physical
And work your body like some cardio
Let's dance, let's get physical
Let's get emotional and take off our clothes, let's

Let's keep it moving, don't you stop
We got the groove, let's make it hot
You got to show me what you got
Let's take it to the top

Let's dance, let's get physical (Physical)
And work your body like some cardio (Body like some cardi)
Let's dance, let's get physical (Let's dance)
