To the bedroom, babe
And make it up to me
You better give it right
'Cause I need to feel it
Get a good firm grip
I'm at your fingertips
Wanna good fight tonight
So let me beat it

If this is good
Then why're you driving my heart insane?
And if it's bad
Then why can't I just walk away?
It's crazy how you got me
Lost in pleasure and pain
Oh yeah
It's sweet misery!

There you go breaking me
Then you go building me
It hurts so good
You'll keep me coming for more
It's taking over me
It's sick how you're controlling me
It hurts so good
You'll keep me dying for more

So go 'head, punish me
If that's your fantasy
Don't need to say it
Baby, I know you mean it
Only just like that
And make them eyes roll back
Come write a murder act
Let me read it

If this is good
Then why're you driving my heart insane?
And if it's bad
Then why can't I just walk away?
It's crazy how you got me
Lost in pleasure and pain
Oh yeah
It's sweet misery!
There you go breaking me
Then you go building me
It hurts so good
You'll keep me coming for more
It's taking over me
It's sick how you're controlling me
It hurts so good
You'll keep me dying for more
