Nicole!
This is for all my Club Banger Nation!
Are you ready?

Electric guns are
Lighting up the place tonight
You know where the party's at
Ice-cream delicious
But hot, hot tonight
You know where the party's at

We're staying 'til the sun comes up
Let's beat as one
Let's be lovers
I shouldn't love it on the rush
A few more shots
Then we're ready to go
You might also like
Everybody is aflew high
So jump of that rock
You know where the party's at
Club Banger Nation
The night is alive
You know where the party's at

It's going down
It's going down, down, down
It's going down
It's going down, down, down

Blow up the sound system
Dim down the lights
This is where the party's at
It's a Genie in the Turntable
Better rock him right
Tell 'em where the party's at!

We're staying 'til the sun comes up

You know where the party's at

The night is alive

It's going down
It's going down, down, down
It's going down
It's going down down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
