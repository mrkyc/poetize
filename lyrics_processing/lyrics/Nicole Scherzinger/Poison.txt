Ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Got venom dripping from my lips
Know who you're about to kiss
Think that you can handle it (Boy, it's on)
Just step into the danger zone
Sugar, if you wanna roll
Never bend, just take control (Stakes are on)

So sick, kill it quick, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this
Pick it up, let it drop, in my cup, sip it up
Oh no, I'll never stop

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight, got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind

I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
You might also like
So cruel, I'm better in the scene
'Cause tonight I need clean my sexy little dirty screen
(Yeah, it's on)
And then I'll get you in my stream, play it hard to the extreme
You're so cool, baby, you're so mean (Turn me on, turn me on)

So sick, kill it quick, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this (Hey)
Pick it up, let it drop, in my cup, sip it up
Oh no, I'll never stop (Hey)

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight, got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind

I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind

I got that poison, that poison, that poison
I'll make you fall in love with me (Turn me on, turn me on)
I got that poison, that poison, that poison
I'll make you fall in love with me (Turn me on, turn me on)
That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine till the light
Got poison on my mind (Mind, mind, mind)

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight, got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind

I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
(Oh-ho, oh-ho), that poison on my mind
I got that poison (Uh-huh), I got that poison (Uh-huh)
