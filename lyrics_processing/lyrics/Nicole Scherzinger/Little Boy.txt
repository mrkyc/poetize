One day, your love will impress me
Not fancy cars or diamond rings
When it's all about the little things
Little Boy, Little Boy
Someday you'll see what I see
But, chances are you'll see with me
When it's all about the little things
Little Boy, Little Boy

One day I'll come home to flowers
And look at him and say "Babe, I love you"
One day someone will lay with me for hours
And that will be the day

But, you're not the one
You're not the one
Boy, you're not the one
You're not the one
Oh, you're not the one

One day you will look for me but
In his arms is where I'll be
When I've shed myself of you and me
Little Boy, Little Boy
One day you will try to call
But someone else picks up the phone
And at that moment you'll know I'm gone
Little Boy, Little Boy
You might also like
One day I'll come home to flowers
And look at him and say "Babe, I love you"
One day I'll lay with someone for hours
That will be the day

But, you're not the one
You're not the one
You're not the one
You're not the one
Baby, you're not the one

Little Boy, grow up
Maybe that man will show up
It's not cool to miss what you had
Even a fool could see that
Little Boy, grow up
Maybe that man will show up
It's not cool to miss what you had
Even a fool could see that

One day I'll come home to flowers
And look at him and say "Babe, I love you"
One day I'll lay with someone for hours
That will be the day
But, you're not the one
No, you're not the one
Oh, you're not the one
No, you're not the one
