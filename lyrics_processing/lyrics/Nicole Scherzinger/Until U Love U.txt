Ooh

You know sometime when u see your self
Just see your self
Someone not good enough
And though there's times when you feel like
You can't do nothing right
And then security takes ahold
Obscures your vision of your soul
You can't see what's inside
Open up your eyes

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are
Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
You can't love nobody else
Until you love you

I know sometime it's so hard to keep
Up your self esteem
Sometime you can feel so small
And its so easy to tell yourself
You're not worth much at all
When you aren't sure of who you are
And now it's tearing you apart
You can't see what is true
Change your point of view
You might also like
Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are
Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
You can't love nobody else
Until you love you

Find what is real is what's inside you
Know there's no one else in this world like you
Take maybe just a little time to start and see
Just who you really are

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are
Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
You can't love nobody else
Until you love you
Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are
Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
You can't love nobody else
Until you love...
Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
Hmm
Take a look in the mirror (Take a look in the mirror)
Take a look in the mirror
