In a safe space, a dark safe place
They tied a rope around my hands and around my waist
Found me bound up in a sealed up case
Slowed my breathing 'cause my hearts been racin'

Drowning in the mud like a dirty diamond
Lost in the mud like a dirty diamond
Uncut, but my light is still blinding, still blinding

'Cause I know I wasn't meant for chains
No, I got fire in my veins
I, I hear the worst in my head
But I know the best will come again
So go and let the rain pour down
Let the rain pour down
I'mma let my lashes grow
Let 'em all come out
Metamorphosis
Metamorphosis
Metamorphosis

A change is coming now
Metamorphosis
A change is coming now
You might also like
I got wings growing, now I'm wide awake
Spinning 'round, up and down, see the face of grace
It's like a blood moon turnin' to the sun
I'm getting stronger as the day comes up

Drowning in the mud like a dirty diamond
Lost in the mud like a dirty diamond
Uncut, but my light is still blinding, still blinding

'Cause I know I wasn't meant for chains
No, I got fire in my veins
I, I hear the worst in my head
But I know the best will come again
So go and let the rain pour down
Let the rain pour down
I'mma let my lashes grow
Let 'em all come out
Metamorphosis

Spin myself in a cocoon
And prepare to die (Prepare to die)
And when I wake up (wake up)
I come back a butterfly

'Cause I know I wasn't meant for chains
No, I got fire in my veins
I, I hear the worst in my head
But I know the best will come again
So go and let the rain pour down
Let the rain pour down
I'mma let my lashes grow
Let 'em all come out

Ooh
Metamorphosis
Ooh
Metamorphosis

A change is coming now
Metamorphosis
