When I was your woman
And you was my man
You used to say the sweetest things to me
But you was always good at that
You used to tell me I was pretty
The best that you ever had
And there was nothing more important to you
Than being with the perfect ten

So my, my nails were done
I had my hair on point
Kept my, my body tight the way you like it boy
Yes, I played the part
Then you broke my heart
As if I meant nothing to you
Can't believe how you made me feel pretty

Pretty upset
Pretty broken
I feel so pretty
Pretty messed up
Pretty much done
Done with all your so-called pretty
All in all it pretty much sucks
I don't wanna be pretty no more
You might also like
When I was your woman (yeah)
I tried to share my world with you
But you just did not give a damn
You'd just tell me I was pretty
As if that's all that I am (yeah)
It's like you never even knew me
Or tried to get to know me
Was just an accessory
Oh, can't believe
How you made me feel pretty

Pretty upset
Pretty broken
I feel so pretty
Pretty messed up
Pretty much done
Done with all your so-called pretty
All in all it pretty much sucks
I don't wanna be pretty

I was so caught up
That when I looked in the mirror
I didn't recognize me
Somewhere I lost me
I was so in love
But I guess that wasn't love, no, no
If I had to do it
All over again
I can swear it's gonna be hella different
'Cause you made me question
Who I really am
I don't know why I put up with you
Can't believe
How you made me feel pretty
Pretty upset
Pretty broken
I feel so pretty
Pretty messed up
Pretty much done
Done with all your so-called pretty
All in all it pretty much sucks
I don't wanna be pretty no more

Pretty
Oh, oh
I wanna feel pretty
Oh, oh
Done with all your so called pretty
All in all it pretty much sucks
