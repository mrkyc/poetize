You know I need a supervillain

Don't want a man who flies
Wears a cape or tights cause see
That ain't my kinda guy
No, that ain't my cup of tea
Dark hoodies and jeans on
His swagger so mean
Oh, you know what I mean
(I just want a bad boy)

Though I know they're bad for my soul
Oh, I just can't leave 'em alone (I just want a bad boy)
See the heroes were never my type
I need the boys with the kryptonite tonight

Oh, so you can try to save me from love
But I rather wear his chains and handcuffs
Make me his prisoner-er-er
Don't wanna be Louis and Clark
I wanna be Bonnie and Clyde
Cause I ride or die

Although I know they're bad for my soul
Oh, I just can't leave 'em alone
And see the good boys aren't my type
I like them boys from the dark side
