My boyfriend doesn't look for
All the little things every girl knows to look for
My boyfriend must be stupid
Not to take the time to find the panties she left

My head is spinning out
I feel my heart fall down
Roll underneath my bed
Next to the note she left
I'ma use my audacity and the effort
To appreciate my love
Yes my love

Well, you could of gone to Motel 6
But you came in my house, on my bed
In my sheets, on my pillow
There's hair
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Who do you think you are?
Yeah, you've gone way too far this time

My ex boyfriend, just doesn't get it
Can't clean up his mess and still won't admit it
My ex boyfriend's got some problems
Has to put it in other girls just to solve 'em

I could be violent now
I should just take you out
Save us the misery of your stupidity
I'ma use my audacity and the effort
To appreciate my love
Yes my love

Well, you could of gone to Motel 6
But you came in my house, on my bed
In my sheets, on my pillow
There's hair
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Who do you think you are?
Yeah you've gone way too far this time
Well, you could of gone to Motel Six
But you came in my house, on my bed
In my sheets, on my pillow
Lay his head
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Who do you think you are?
Yeah you've gone way too far this time

My head is spinning out
I feel my heart fall down
Roll underneath my bed
Next to the note she left
I'ma use my audacity and the effort
To appreciate my love
Yes my love
Well, you could of gone to Motel 6
But you came in my house, on my bed
In my sheets, on my pillow
There's hair
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Who do you think you are?
