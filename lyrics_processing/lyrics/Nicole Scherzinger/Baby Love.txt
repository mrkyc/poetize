I remember like it was yesterday
First kiss and I knew you changed the game
You have me exactly
Where you want it and I'm on it
And I ain't ever gonna let you get away
Holding hands never made me feel this way
So special, boy, it's your
Your smile, and we so in

Love, la, la, la, la, yeah, we so in
Love, la-la, la, la, la and I just can't get
Enough of your la, la, la, la, yeah, we so in
Love, love and I want you to know

You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up
(Oh boy, oh boy) You're my every
Everything that I could ever dream of
You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up
(Oh boy, oh boy) You're my every
Every, every, everything
You might also like
Been a minute and we're still holding it down
Butterflies every time you come around
You make me so crazy
It's crazy, oh baby
And I don't ever wanna be with no one else
You're the only one that ever made me melt
You're special, boy, it's your
Your style, we so in

Love, la, la, la, la, yeah, we so in
Love, la-la, la, la, la and I just can't get
Enough of your la, la, la, la, yeah, that's all I'm thinkin'
Of, love and I want you to know
