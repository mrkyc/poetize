Try again

Had the baddest, upped your status to a pro
Me on your arm made you a superstar (Ah)
Hand in my hand transformed you to a man
Like, damn, everybody knowin' who you are
Then you presented symptoms of brain damage
I'm convinced that you bumped your head
Let my heart slip right out of your hands
(Right out of your hands)

And now, I'm frozen
Some glass should remain broken
You wanted out, you chose this
Messed up and slit your wrist (Killed love, killed us)
And now, we're frozen
Some glass should remain broken
You wanted out, you chose this
Your mistakes that made you sick (Killed love, killed us, but I live)

You say without me here, your life is like
A nightmare (So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost its rhythm
Cause I'm gone (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding
From the inside, but you made your mess
Now, roll in it, and the next time your heartbeats
I hope it breaks yo' chest
You might also like
I was right there by your side just like an arm
So strong, lost me, now you're handicapped
Tried to apologize, but you ran out of your charm
Had the world till you fell right off the map
I'm so through with you built up my system
I'm immune, won't be a victim
Snatched my life right up out of your hands
(Up out of your hands)

You say without me here, your life is like
A nightmare (So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost its rhythm
Cause I'm gone (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding
From the inside, but you made your mess
Now, roll in it, and the next time your heartbeats
I hope it breaks yo' chest

Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, breaks yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Breaks yo', breaks, brea-brea-breaks, breaks yo chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, breaks yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Che-che-che-che-chest, chest, chest, oh-oh-oh-oh
I hope you can
Feel it
Hope it breaks you into a
Thousand pieces

You say without me here, your life is like (You save me, oh)
A nightmare (So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost its rhythm (Ooh)
Cause I'm gone (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam)
From the inside, but you made your mess (From the inside)
Now, roll in it, and the next time your heartbeats
I hope it breaks yo' chest
You say without me here, your life is like (Hey-ey)
A nightmare (So dream on)
You swear your heart has lost its rhythm (Dream on)
Cause I'm gone (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam)
You're telling me it's like you bleeding (Pa-ram-pam-pam-pam-pam-pa-pam)
From the inside, but you made your mess
Now, roll in it, and the next time your heartbeats
I hope it breaks yo' chest (Hey, ow)

Chest, che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Chest, che-che-chest, che-che-chest, breaks yo' chest
Chest, che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Breaks yo', breaks, brea-brea-breaks, breaks yo chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, breaks yo' chest
Che-che-chest, che-che-chest, chest, yo' chest
