I don't think I want this anymore
As she drops the ring
To the floor
She says to herself
You've left before
And this time you will stay gone
That's for sure

And he shouted something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally, this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car, she said

No
Happily never after
That just ain't for me
Because finally (Because finally)
I know (Ooh)
I deserve better after
All
(I'll never let another teardrop fall)

As she drove away
She starts to smile
Realize she hadn't
For a while
No destination
She drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed
In such denial, laughing about

The way he shouted something as (Shouted something as)
To drag her suitcase down the path (Mmm)
To the driveway (To the driveway)
She had never gone that far (Never gone that far)
Normally, this would be the time that she (Ooh, ooh)
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car, she said (Ooh)

No
Happily never after
That just ain't for me
Because finally (Because finally)
I know (Ooh)
I deserve better after
All
(I'll never let another teardrop fall)
(I'm done, I'm done, I'm done) Said I'm so done
(So done, oh, done and I'm done) So done, I'm so done
(I'm free, I'm free, I'm free) Said I'm so free
(Free to be me) I'm so free, I'm so free
She inhaled in air
She'd never breathed before
The air of no drama
No more, she said

No
Happily never after
That just ain't for me
Because finally
I know
I deserve better after
All
(I'll never let another teardrop fall) No, woah
No (Ooh)
Happily never after
That just ain't for me
Because finally (Because finally)
I know (Ooh)
I deserve better after
All, all
(I'll never let another teardrop fall)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Another teardrop fall
I'll never let a
No, I'll never let a
No, I'll never let a
