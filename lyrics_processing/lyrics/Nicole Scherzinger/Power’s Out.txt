Now lay
Now lay, lay-ay
Now lay, now lay (Oh)
Lay, lay-ay

I got a shoulder built for you
Just in case you need it to lean on
These hands I have are for you
Just in case you need help to hold on

The world is just a supersized merry-go-round
Sometimes your fingers lose their grip, we all fall down
Don't sit there in the dark, don't worry your heart
Everything will be fine if trees fall on your power line

If the winds turns strong
You will always have a home
If your power's out
If the lights turns dark
You can stay here in my heart
If your power's out
You might also like
My food is yours
Take all you want
My bed is yours
Sleep all you want, yeah

Now lay (Now lay), now lay (Now lay)
Now lay, la-ay

I have clothes here for you
If it's twenty below (Low)
I'll warm past your cold (Cold)
I have room just for you
Pillows, blankets
Enough for two

Now, I'll be the place for your lost and found
What's mine is yours, just point it out
Don't sit there in the dark, don't worry your heart
Everything will be fine if trees fall on your power line

If the winds turns strong
You will always have a home
If your power's out
If the lights turns dark
You can stay here in my heart
If your power's out, power's out
My food is yours
Take all you want (Take all you want)
My bed is yours
Sleep all you want, yeah
My food is yours
Take all you want (You want, you want)
My bed is yours
Sleep all you want, yeah

Without a doubt
You can call on me
I will be there
Babe
Without a doubt
You can count on me
Please, don't be scared

If the winds turns strong
You will always have a home
If your power's out
If the lights turns dark
You can stay here in my heart
