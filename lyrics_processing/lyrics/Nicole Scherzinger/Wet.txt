Yeah

I feel like everybody's standing around me watching me now
I feel like whatever I do tonight will be the talk of the town
They wanna know how I'm gonna move my body when the beat goes
'Cause something comes over me when the beat goes

Well, I'ma rip my clothes off, take a leap
And surf through the crowd, yeah, yeah
Drippin' down my neck, soakin' wet
Sink or swim or you drown, yeah, yeah

Let's get a little wet
I like the way you're workin' me out
Let's get a little wet
I like the way you're workin' me out

Body's getting super hot
Feels like a hundred degrees
I'm waitin' for a man with the fan
Who can give me a breeze
If you touch me there
Please beware, you can start up a fire
I don't mind if you take me home
Cool me off in the shower

I love it when the heat
From the beat melts me to the ground
I love it when it
Gets so wet starts tricklin' down
This beat is filthy dirty
I feel it all over me
Yeah Eah-yeah
