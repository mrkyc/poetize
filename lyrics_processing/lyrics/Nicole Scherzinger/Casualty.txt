Too close to see so much in love we stop breathing
Sweet history ain't enough to keep my heart beating
Too many tears for you I sacrifice
Too many lies for you I justify
How can you stand there sayin' no one's to blame
How can you act like everything is okay?

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has got to leave
Or one of us is gonna be
A casualty

It's cold in here
And my heart still wants you to hold me, baby
You're never here
But when you're with me I get so lonely
I see you talking but your lips don't make a sound
You see me crying but my tears don't hurt you now
How can you stand there sayin' no one's to blame
How can you act like everything is OK?
You might also like
Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has got to leave
Or one of us is gonna be
A casualty

Breathe in, breathe out
Defend, or back down
Over and over again
I stand there, too cold
Remember and I'd fall
Over and over again

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has got to leave
Or one of us is gonna be
A casualty
One of us has got to leave
Or one of us is gonna be
