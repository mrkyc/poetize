You're all out there
Waiting to break my heart again
Break my heart, dear friend
You're on one team, yet, still contemplating
Break my heart again
Oh dear friend

Bet you thought all that runnin' 'round wasn't gon' catch up with ya
Let that door hit your ass, I'll Photoshop you out this picture
See, you wasn't around for this
So you might wanna sit down for this
It hurts so bad that I should cry
Awkward silence, you know why

Let's have a drink (Hey)
Let's have a drink
No, you sit right there
Here's to you and me, oh-oh
Let's take a shot (Hey)
Since you've been takin' shots
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
Oh-oh, oh-oh
On the rocks
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
You might also like
Now you're out there without me
Breaking hearts again, oh dear friend
But I tried to tell ya
That love will show ya
That you would break your own heart in the end

Bet you thought all that runnin' 'round wasn't gon' catch up with ya
Let that door hit your ass, I'll Photoshop you out this picture
See, you wasn't around for this
So you might wanna sit down for this
It hurts so bad that I should cry
Awkward silence, you know why
