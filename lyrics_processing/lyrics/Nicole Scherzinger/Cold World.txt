Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Baby, baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh baby, have you ever wondered why
Or even questioned why I was leaving
And why I was cheating, and why I lied
Oh baby, I know you have to think this for yourself
See I'm never around, I'm always out of town
You know I'm with someone else

But you think you're cool
Well if you're cool tell me why am I leaving?
You think your love's so smooth
Oh, won't you tell me why I'm deceiving you?
If your heart was so warm, tell me why I don't need you
Because when you told me that you loved me
I never believed you

I guess it's a cold, cold, cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Cold, cold, cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

Oh baby, tell me are you out your mind?
If love was a job, anybody could get it
If all you gotta be is fine
Oh baby, you better be careful what you say
Cause old just gets older, world keeps gettin' colder
Nobody will look your way

But you think you're so cool
So cool, then why am I leaving?
You think you're so smooth
Tell me why am I deceiving you?
And if your kisses were so sweet
Tell me why I don't need you
Because when you told me that you loved me
I never believed you

I guess it's a cold, cold, cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Cold, cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
All aboard, all aboard, this ship is leaving
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Not a war, not a war, my soldiers are retreating
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

I guess it's a cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
I guess it's a cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
I guess it's a cold, cold world
Babe, that we're living in
Na na na na na na na na na
