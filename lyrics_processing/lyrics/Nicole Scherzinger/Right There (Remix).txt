50, Nicole
It's just another one
Another number one

I'm complex, difficult to understand
I don't know if it's me or just the makeup of a man
I want it in the morning, bright and early, I want it
I rise as the sun rise, baby, now get up on it
Give it to me good, shawty, work it like you should
You follow instructions, then I follow instructions
The ultimate seduction, more kissing and touching
Feels supernatural, first chance, I'm at you

Hands on my body, oh, oh, oh
