As I looked through the windshield at the quiet little street
He was smiling so proud as he gave me the key
But inside I knew he was as nervous as me
And I said daddy oh daddy are you sure I know how
Are you sure that I'm ready to drive this car now
He said I'm right here beside you and you're gonna do fine
All you gotta do is keep it between the lines
Cause it's a long narrow road
Only the good Lord knows where it leads in the end but you got to begin
So keep your hands on the wheel believe in the things that are real
Just take your time and keep it between the lines
I was sitting in my chair and sneaking a look at him
Lying on the floor with his coloring book
Then he caught me watching and he climbed on my knee
He said daddy oh daddy would you do one with me
Then I hugged him so tightly as we turned the page
Said I haven't done this since I was your age
He said I'm right here beside you and you're gonna do fine
Daddy all you gotta do is keep it between the lines
So we finished the picture and I put him to bed
Got down on my knees and I bowed my head
And I said father oh father I feel so alone
Are you sure I can raise him with his mommy gone

And words of my daddy from so long ago
Said I'm right here beside you and you're gonna do fine
All you gotta do is keep it between the lines
So keep your hands on the wheel believe in the things that are real
Take your time and keep it between the lines
Just take your time and keep it between the lines
