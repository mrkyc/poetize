I ain't n-n-nothing far as I can see
And I'm worn out from working too hard
Why don't you give me a break?
I know that lately things ain't been so good
I'll make it up just like I told you I would
But I'm tired and I want to sit down
To ease this old backache
You say you're having trouble figuring me
I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man
I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
I am a simple man
You say we've got some things to talk about
A lot of problems that we need to work out
But we just wind up fighting
Why don't you give it a rest?
I don't know what else I can say to you
I'm doing everything I know to do
And I can't give you anything more
When I'm giving my best

I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man
I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
I am a simple man
I want a place I can lay my head
Soft woman and a warm bed
A little time off before I'm dead
I am just a simple man
You say you're having trouble figuring me
I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man
I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
