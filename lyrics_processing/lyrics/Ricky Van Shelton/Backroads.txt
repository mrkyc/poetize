And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind
Well, when I woke up this morning, well, I took me a look outside
It was plain to see it was one of those days tailor-made for taking a ride
So I went downstairs and cleared my head with coffee and cigarettes
And when it hit me right there, then my mind was set
Well, I phoned work and told 'em they're going to be a man short today
I got the sunny day blues, there's only one thing that's gonna make them go away
So I went out and I climbed into my big ol' Chevrolet
And with a turn of the key and a cloud of dust, I was on my way
I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind
Well, maybe I did maybe I didn't go and lose my job today
But you can take my cares, take my worries and blow them all away
For there comes a time in any man's life when he's got to break free
I got four good wheels and an endless road stretched out in front of me
I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind
