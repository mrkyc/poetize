Simple conversation gets me tongue-tied
And you're telling me to speak with a maniac king
Or could it be I've lost my mind?
And besides, I am weak, don't you want someone strong
To lead them out of Egypt when they've been there so long?
And anyway, they won't believe you ever spoke to me
It's not your problem, God replied, and the rest is history
There's a bigger picture you can't see
You don't have to change the world, just trust in me
'Cause I am your creator, I am working out my plan
And through you I will show them I am
Now Lord, are you sure, he's just a shepherd boy
Too small for battle gear with a giant to destroy
What on earth can he do with five stones and a sling?
It's not your problem, God replied, 'cause I can do anything
There's a bigger picture you can't see
You don't have to change the world, just trust in Me
'Cause I am your creator, I am working out my plan
And through you I will show them
I am the first, I am the last
I am the present and the past
I am tomorrow and today
I am the only way

You say that I will bring your son into the world
How can I understand this thing you're gonna do?
It's not your problem, God replied
'Cause there's a bigger picture
You don't have to change the world
I'm your creator, I am working out my plan
And through you I will show them
There's a bigger picture you can't see
You don't have to change the world, just trust in me
I'm your creator, I am working out my plan
And through you I will show them I am
