Just to share Your story, bring You glory, and win souls for You
I could sing like an angel, songs so humble and so thankful
Full of drama and emotion, so the world would know Your truth
I could give away my money and my clothes and my food
To restore those people who are poor, lost, and down-and-out
Oh, I could succeed at all these things
Find favor with peasants and kings
But if I do not love, I am nothing
I could live a flawless life
Never cheat or steal or lie
And always speak so kindly, smile warmly, and go about doing good
I could dedicate myself to do what everyone else wants me to-
Listen to them, compliment them, say the things I should
I could show up every Sunday, lead the Choir and Bible Study
And they all might come to know me as a leader and a friend
Oh, I could achieve success on Earth, but success cannot define my worth
And all these actions, all these words, will not matter in the end-
Songs will fade to silence
Stories, they will cease
The dust will settle, covering all my selfless deeds
So as I strive to serve You
Won't You makes it clear to me
If I do not love, I am nothing
You might also likeIf I cannot live my life loving my brother
Then how can I love the One who lived His life for me?
Sent to Earth from Heaven
Humble Servant, Holy King
Come to share a story, get no glory, and save my searching soul
You knew that I'd deny You, crucify You, but nothing could stop You from
Living for me, dying for me, so that I would know-
Songs will fade to silence
Stories they will cease
The dust will settle covering these selfless deeds
But Your life here has made it clear enough for me to see
