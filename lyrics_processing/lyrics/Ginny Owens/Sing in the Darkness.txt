From the light of creation
Your love on display
The power that authors every life now gives us faith
Though the path feels uncertain
Lord, You are the way
You'll strengthen our hearts until our eyes see face to face

We will sing, we'll sing in the darkness
Of Your light, Your light here among us
Let our voices rise
Through the trials of the night
We will sing of Your great love
We'll sing of Your great love

You're a god of compassion
Every promise is true
When we're in the shadows, Lord, we're never far from You
Yeah, even in shadows, Lord, we're never far from You

We will sing, we'll sing in the darkness
Of Your light, Your light here among us
Let our voices rise
Through the trials of the night
We will sing of Your great love
We'll sing of Your great love
Ooh, sing of Your great love
Ooh-ooh-ooh
