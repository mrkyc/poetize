It's like the throes of an epileptic seizure
Like the crud that you feel after sleeping for days
Like a dream, like a trip, like a drug-induced haze
And I recall only little bits and pieces of
Vague similitudes that my instinct says are not even mine
They're not even mine
They're not even mine
They're not even mine
Like a slope, like a maze, like a bottomless pit
Winding around in a secret combination
Like the strain that you make trying to figure it out
Like a death, like a gap, like a watery grave
And all I hear is impossibly distorted impressions
Of a world that I'm positive is not even mine
It's not even mine
It's not even mine
It's not even mine
I knew a thing or two until the time
Strange outer forces wasted my tiny mind
I could not stop it
Stop it
Not stop it
Stop it
You might also likeLike an edge, like a void, like a limitless fall;
Entire lives spent in constant isolation
Like a shard from a frozen shattered aeon of time
Like a voice, like a crack, like a whispering shriek
That echoes on like it's carpet-bombing feverish white
Jungles of thought that I'm positive are not even mine
They're not even mine
They're not even mine
They're not even mine
I knew a thing or two until the time
Strange outer forces wasted my tiny mind
I could not stop it
Stop it
Not stop it
Stop it
How long have I been gone
Tucked down inside this limbo while
My dreams are crushing me?
Enormous gulfs, enormous glyphs, enormous galleries
Fragmented visions of a nightmare city
Full of cone-shaped beings and me
I knew a thing or two until the time
Strange outer forces wasted my tiny mind
I could not stop it
Stop it
Not stop it
Stop it
