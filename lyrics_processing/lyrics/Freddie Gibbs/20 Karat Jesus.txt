Yeah, Kane
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My ambitions as a rider, nigga, survival off that powder, nigga
Currently smokin' that kill in the hills where you can't find a nigga
Crack cocaine, microwave, dinner was on that timer, nigga
No sleep, bags under my eyes is designer, nigga
Blinded and misguided, nigga, Heavenly Father take the wheel
I'm on the interstate with some gorilla weight
Shit that can get me like 200 years
Duckin' the pen', I need forgiveness
I'm livin' like a every decision a sin
I know my niggas don't want me to win
Jealousy, choppin' off all of my friends

I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Spent my last 200 thou' on a bird and a Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment
You might also like
Now I-I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the elevator
The goal when you try to kick that dope, stuck on the respirator
Got symptoms of withdrawal from the fall when I used to ball
I show you how in one summer one nigga could lose it all
Like why we gotta feel this pain and her friends and family don't?
My cellie like to walk around in his sleep, I rather stay woke
I must evoke, these are the results of the realest shit that I wrote
These hoes get in your ear and burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes

That's why I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Split my last two hundred thou' on a bird and Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up off the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

I-I-I-I be kickin' shit just like Rodman did the camera man
I'm pure 100 dope like the poppy seed in Afghanistan
I been done dropped my nuts for this cabbage, hands do damage, nigga
Rips from the clip leave you stiff, Mannequin Challenge, nigga
Me and my chips with dip boy, ain't no play play 'bout that Frito-Lay
Tried to give me ten, I beat the case so it's gon' be okay
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
Mama say I live next door to the death cause I live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'
Nigga, I'm livin' in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'
I'll be there in the mornin'
I'll be there in the mornin'
Nigga, I'm livin' in the moment
Part 2

Yeah, Kane baby
I drink holy water

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Scar across my face, strap on my shoulder on some Tony shit
Taught myself the streets, you know my pop ain't never taught me shit
'Cept, "Fuck a friend, you gon' be solo in your coffin, bitch"
Walkin' home from work, my .44 bulldog what I'm walkin' with
Old folks out the church say, "He need Jesus, that boy off a bit"
Preacher's daughter said, "I'll let you fuck, it just might cost a bit"
Type of shit a nigga been through make you dog a bitch
Lost a bitch, married these streets, she prenup, you can't divorce her
Lyin' from my cell, electrical tape on my tape recorder, sucker shit
Don't blow your money, young nigga, pay your lawyer
Niggas is wrapped in electrical tape, they walkin' tape recorders, yeah
Yeah, bitch, your first motherfuckin' mixtape was a snitch tape
You ain't think I knew that shit though, I know though

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Drove on 65, brought 65, I sold the whole shit
Po-po searched my Cutlass on the road, I got my Os hit
Boy you know the rules, they pick you up, don't call my phone bitch
Boy you know the rules, that shit don't jump unless you sold it down
S.W.A.T. team break, they cut the water off, can't flush the toilet down
454 my motor down, got green, got dog, got Yoda now
They playin' theyself for exposure now, this rappin' shit just for the posers now
The losers now
All these bitch niggas got videos up with their toolies out
Everybody flashin' real money
Niggas card crackin', gettin' Visa money
I don't knock it, I just do the dope and blow it
I gotta get it so I gotta see the money
Y'all remember peacin' out 28th
To get the blunt liquor and a piece of money, young nigga

Young nigga
Stay smooth, stay solid, nigga
These niggas'll put your name in everythin' but a prayer, amen

Glory be to God, what's happening, pimps?
It is I, the alpha and omega, the original righteous player
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
It's your boy Jesus, man
Yes my nigga, Jesus is your homeboy
Hahahahahah
Say it again so I can uh reiterate it, man
Your minds not ready and your heart's not open
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what's wrong with you, man
You doin' all that covetin'
You tryin' to, you-you-you wan't what other niggas got
You not even just payin' attention to your gift, nigga
God gave you a gift, nigga
Pay attention to what he got for you
You, other niggas over here
Yeah, he could sell dope real good, that's not your lane, my nigga
God gave you hands, you a chef my nigga
