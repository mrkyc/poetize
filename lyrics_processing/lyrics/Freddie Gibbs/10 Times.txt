Living legend (Nigga)

Baby are you still down, still down for me?
Still down to take a brick, out of town for me?
Rippin off the whole clip, thirty rounds for me
See them niggas runnin' up, now lay it down for me
Foreign cars for all solid broads that I know
I drive through and slide all these bum bitches McDonalds
I'm bustin down a pack of that boy-boy in Chicago
You make it to a brick in my hood and you hit the lotto
I hit the lotto like Powerball on a ho
Finna make a money shower fall on a ho
Smokin at the Trump Tower, bout to call a ho
Nigga finna make a money shower fall on a ho

I'm lookin at her and she's lookin at me
When I walked past the bitch, she probably felt a light breeze
Me and her at the Heat game, check the feet game
And I bet she start cryin' if she ever don't meet
But she'll never, ever, ever find another like me
Stop thinkin' bout yourself, gotta think about the team
Like Hakeem on the Dream, yeah, Olajuwon bitch
Throw a lot of ones bitch, have a lot of fun bitch
Strip, but I love my girl and bodyguard bitch
Your main chick fascinated by my body art trick

In the Benz got twins in the Bentley and I wanna fuck her friends
See you baby 'fore I lend it to you baby

In three or four way, I'ma sin for my lady
And if I'm ever in the jail, better send me something baby
Colder than a motherfucker, colder than a motherfucker

Ugh, lifestyle ribbit

She bad, she fast, she gon' get a ticket
Thicker than a buttermilk biscuit
Down for the get down, want a real nigga, fuck a clown
When he pound, she don't even make a sound
When I pound, I'ma leave it sore, make her pussy clap like a encore
Ask the people next door, ugh!
She got a gap that's out of hand and this her favorite song
There's something 'bout a broad that like to suck her thumb
She on my shoes like a piece of gum (What she know you not?)
She know I'm not the two, I'm the one (Biatch!)
Colder than a motherfucker, colder than a motherfucker
10 times out of 10, she's a 10 and I wanna fuck her friends
Colder than a motherfucker, colder than a motherfucker
10 times out of 10, she's a 10 and I wanna fuck her friends
