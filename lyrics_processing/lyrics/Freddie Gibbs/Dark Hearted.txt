Yeah (Space Rabbit)
Yeah-yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah (Space Rabbit push a space coupe straight out of Monaco, yeah)
I pray the choppa never jam on me, yeah
I pray the Lord put his hands on me (Yeah), yeah-yeah
I pray the choppa never jam

Dirty .30 in my hand
DEA and detectives, they got me cuffed on that ambulance
Nigga, ain't no solvin' no murders, welcome to Murderland
Send a hit and scratch off a hit, bitch, I'm the murder man
Pray the Lord put his hands on me
And I know I took a risk with this shit when I put my hands on it
All my enemies watchin', they plot and plan on me
They gon' end up one of them dead homies

'Cause how can niggas stand on it when it ain't the truth?
Pussy niggas ran on me when it's time to shoot
Motherfuck a friend, got them bitches out my crew
I know you wouldn't fuck with me if I didn't have no loot
'Cause I'm the one that push a hard line
Tell me what niggas know about hard time
Empty stomach give you the heart to go do a homicide
I know some bitch niggas that snitch, niggas on my side
Still a rich nigga with mob ties
You might also like
'Cause, nigga, we was locked in
Me and six of my niggas in one apartment
We was pushin' that molly, powder and hard then
Back when bitches, they used to play with my heart then
Police might shoot me and kill me over my dark skin
Man, this game got me dark-hearted
Smoke and drink like a alcoholic, don't get me started
I thought we was gon' thug it out 'til the end
But I guess that shit just wasn't in the plans
I pray this choppa never jam

Dirty .30 in my hands
Shoot him, if he ain't DOA, we shoot up the ambulance
Nigga, ain't no solvin' no murders, welcome to Murderland
Bulletproof my shit, they might hit it, bitch, I'm the murder man
Dead nigga put his hands on me
I'ma pop another bottle and pour one out for your dead homie
Swear my friends turnin' fed on me (Bitch)
Man, these pussy niggas might take the stand on me

Well, how can niggas stand on it when it ain't the truth?
Pussy niggas ran on me when it's time to shoot
She think I'm her man, baby, I'm just knockin' boots
I know you wouldn't fuck with me if I didn't have no loot
'Cause I'm the one that push a hard line
Tell me what bitches know about hard time
Empty stomach give you the heart to go do a homicide
Know some bitch niggas that snitch, niggas on my side
Still a rich nigga with mob ties
'Cause, nigga, we was locked in
Me and six of my niggas in one apartment
We was pushin' that molly, powder and hard then
Back when bitches, they used to play with my heart then
Police might shoot me and kill me over my dark skin
Man, this game got me dark-hearted
Smoke and drink like a alcoholic, don't get me started
I thought we was gon' thug it out 'til the end
But I guess that shit just wasn't in the plans
I pray this choppa never jam (Uh, yeah-yeah)

I pray the choppa never jam (Yeah-yeah)
I pray the choppa never jam on me (Yeah-yeah)
I pray the Lord put his hands on me (Yeah-yeah)
I pray the choppa never jam
I pray the choppa never jam (Yeah-yeah)
I pray the choppa never jam on me (Yeah-yeah)
