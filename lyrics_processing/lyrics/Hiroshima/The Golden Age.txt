We are the chosen few
We share this home for a thousand years
Take a look around and youll see
We leave a stain on the page of history
With the words of hope for love in a stream of tears
But if we learn to love we can turn to another page
Then we will live in peace together in the golden age
And when were hand in hand I know were gonna make a change
We can set the stage to live together in the golden age
Living in the golden age
We waste this home land
Then fail to understand
The children hope we will even leave a world behind
But do we really try
Do we cry
Or do we close one eye and live a lie
The lessons learned makes a place a perfect crime
But if we learn to love we can turn to another page
(Living together)
Then we will live in peace together in the golden age
(Working together)
And when were hand in hand I know were gonna make a change
(I know it's gonna make a change)
We can set the stage to live together in the golden age

Then we will live in peace together in the golden age
(We are golden together)
And when were hand in hand I know were gonna make a change
(I know it's gonna make a change)
We can set the stage to live together in the golden age
