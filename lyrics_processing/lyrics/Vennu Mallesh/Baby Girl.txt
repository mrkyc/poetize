Baby girl, move like a salsa
I saw you out the corner of my eye
Felt like a spotlight on ya
No one in the room but you and I

Baby, be my dancing partner
Come take a walk with me after
Together we make a departure
We'll make a departure

Let's move, baby, let's move faster
Let's move, baby, let's move faster
Let's move, baby, let's move faster
Oh, no, make a departure now

Whenever I got out with ya
Want them to know I'm with ya
Whenever I slow down with ya
You make my heart beat faster

Baby, be my dancing partner
Come take a walk with me after
Together we make a departure
We'll make a departure

Girl, I just wanna

Baby, be my dancing partner
Come take a walk with me after

Let's move, baby, let's move faster
Let's move, baby, let's move faster

And tonight we gonna ride, into the night
And it's just you and I, mm, hmm
Inside your eyes, I can see that light
And it's shining so bright
I just wanna make you move, just for tonight
We could do this all night long, tell me, is that alright?
I just wanna dance with you, just for tonight
Wanna take a chance with you, tell me, is that alright?

Together we make a departure
