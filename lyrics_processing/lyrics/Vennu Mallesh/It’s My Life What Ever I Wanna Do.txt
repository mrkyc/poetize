Hey, are you going to sing?
Ya, but it's not a song, it's my life
Ah

It's my life, whatever I wanna do
It's my life, wherever I wanna go
It's my life, whom I wanna love, uh-oh
It's my life, whatever I wanna talk
It's my life, wherever I wanna walk
It's my life, whom I wanna leave, uh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

If you live like that, do you know what people think about you?

People think that I am somewhat mental
They don't know I am very sentimental
Friend of mine said I am a waste fellow
He don't know the taste of this fellow
My teacher scolds me that I neglect education
She don't know I collect real education
My neighbour thinks that I am wasting my time
He don't know that he is wasting his time
My mother sees me and she always bother
My father trusts me and treats like his father

Hey, hey, hey
What the hell do you think of yourself?

I always search good in bad
I also search bad in good, so

I am a very good bad boy
I am a very good bad boy
I am a very good bad boy

I am a day dreamer, I am a night worker
I am a risk taker, I am a self-blamer
I am a brain eater, I am a heart stealer
I am a mind reader, I am a truth finder
I am a smart cheater, I am a pain killer
I am a good teacher, I am a perfect learner
I am a backbencher, I am a new sencer
I am a kids lover, I am a soul builder
I am very anger, I know it's very danger
I am my life driver, I am a routine changer
I am a rules breaker, I'll start a new chapter
Okay, okay, okay
So what do you wanna convey everyone?

Just leave everyone, believe only one
If you don't like anyone, live alone
Just leave everyone, believe only one
If you don't like anyone, live alone

Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
