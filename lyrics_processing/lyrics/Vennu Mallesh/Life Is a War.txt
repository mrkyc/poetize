Going through which makes you sad
Never get you what you want you know
Being with whom you don't like
Staying where you don't want to
Never get the peace you need, bro
Leave the stress, stay blessed
Just do what it feels so good
It's your gain, it's your loss
It's your win and only you
Only bite when you can chew
Fight for what you can achieve
Your army and your strength
Is the one and only you
Life is a war
Warrior you are
Life is a war
Warrior you are
Leave the stress, stay blessed
Just do what it feels so good
It's your gain, it's your loss
It's your win and only you
Only bite when you can chew
Fight for what you can achieve
Your army and your strength
Is the one and only you

Just be like their dad
Don't give them chance to bring you down
If you face anything bad
Just be like their dad
Don't give them chance to bring you down, oh
Live your life without fear
Die only once, dear
This world is full of morons, careful, hey
Just don't think about what they think about you
It's none of your business, I say
Doing things which you don't like
Going through which makes you sad
Never get you what you want you know
Being with whom you don't like
Staying where you don't want to
Never get the peace you need, bro
Leave the stress, stay blessed
Just do what it feels so good
It's your gain, it's your loss
It's your win and only you
Only bite when you can chew
Fight for what you can achieve
Your army and your strength
Is the one and only you
Life is a war (life is a war)
Warrior you are (warrior you are)
Life is a war (life is a war)
