Oh-No

He has the blood on the floor
And it's on the floor, so it's a blood walker
You know what you did because you didn't have your own fresh slide
Yeah bloodwalker (Oh) everytime, but why did you left him
He-e-e was doing the exact same way of you
I don't know you even like it I guess you were confused but

Still I don't know how you got so good at it
Bloodwalker is the only way
Yeah that's a Bloodwalker
He has the blood on the floor
And it's on the floor so it's a blood walker
And it's definitely not a streetwalker
Or a track star or a stick tone
But the bloodwalker he knows don't say anything, your a pink
Every track's like I'm calling in ill for work (Cmon Girl)
I come with a sick tone
I been known to the extraterrestrials
Beings in Mars, my zip code is non-indentified
I been livin' in a lost dimension
Where they talk and tell me that I'm oddly different
So I gotta live it like I'm on a missioN
Really I'm on a mission to search the bloodwalker
Yeah I see the tools of you
You got behind you
And this Is not your choice
'Cause I know the bloodwalker
And I know where is it
{The Blood on The floor}

He has the blood on the floor
And it's on the floor so it's a blood walker
And it's definitely not a streetwalker

But the bloodwalker he knows don't say anything, your a pink
Yeah that's a Bloodwalker
He has the blood on the floor
And it's on the floor so it's a blood walker
And it's definitely not a streetwalker
Or a track star or a stick tone
