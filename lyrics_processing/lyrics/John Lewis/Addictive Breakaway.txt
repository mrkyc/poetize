Hahaha
I don't think they're ready for this
Ay
Comin' from around the way
Y'all just tell me "You can't do this or that way"
But if that was you would you feel the same way
As I do in this sake'
Don't be trippin' on me little bitch for god sake
You probably haven't seen my struggles
You made me feel like breakin' out of the house
So call this escape a addictive breakaway
Yeah, Ay
Overcome with emotion
Slowly numb and unfocused
Hold onto hope-loathing uncomfortably exploding
Grown but feel like running away
Roll a blunt and I blaze
I'm so stuck in my ways
So I suffer the same
Pray so much in hopes that someone will rush to my aid, and save me
One thing you could never claim is I'm lazy
Death chased me my whole life like we've been racing, it's been crazy
And though I try to fight it overtakes me
Can't cave in or bend
Have to play til the end
And basically pretend that everything
Will be cake in the end
Feeling caged in my sin
Need a savior again
As I savor this Gin in fear of this maze that I'm in
Wanna break from my skin and crawl to the surface
It's all a circus, look how Godless this Earth is
He oughta burn it
What's worse is I keep on searching for honesty
I deserve it, but constantly leave deserted
Apologies go un worded
Far from perfect at all
But I've learned from my fall
What's hurts the most is having is only
Having one person to call
All my friends and every girl I was jerks to them all
More concerned with lurking off
To crush percs in the stall
Flirting with death
Reserving tables in Heaven
In my arrogance assuming once I'm dead that I'll get in
Not even thinking how my mother would cope
Or brother would mope, too stubborn
And broke to let the light that's shed in
But it's not even just the drugs
That's been enslaving me
It's all the trauma that I've seen
That stuck it's fangs in me
I pray to God but something
Tells me I need faith in Me
'Cause everyday I run around and wander aimlessly
Afraid to see this vacancy
Conveyed to me through therapists
And save my ego shamelessly
By saying they embellished this
Switched my Meds for new prescriptions thought I fell in bliss
But opiates are surely Satan if a Hell exists
As my story continues
I keep sorting through issues
I'll need more than these tissues
Lord I need purity in you
Why do I go to war with you? I'm mourning I'm hit too
At my core I just miss you
Hope your door's still in use
Fuck everything and run
Or face Everything and rise
Fear has a double meaning
Always stay a king inside
I pray we win and fly so high that the creator's in my eyes
Satan dies, and the angels dive to save us from the sky
Balance is key but I'm still human I'm flawed
Bound by my feet behind this futile facade
Through God I counter every challenge
I meet used to the fog
Though gruesome and odd
Approached it clean, aloof, and with charm
Don't let me steer ya wrong
Won't front the fear is strong
With every year that's gone I can't stare in the mirror long
Gotta take care of Mom
Gotta make clear what's wrong
Gotta adhere to psalms and listen 'fore my hearing's gone
Comin' from around the way
Y'all just tell me "You can't do this or that way"
But if that was you would you feel the same way
As I do in this sake'
Don't be trippin' on me little bitch for god sake
You probably haven't seen my struggles
You made me feel like breakin' out of the house
So call this escape a addictive breakaway
Yeah, Ay
I think I'm going to just fade away
