So magical, unmatchable, spectacular, unbreakable
You shakin' me? Not probable
Y'all get ridiculed for even tryin' to comment

Y'all aren't in my league at all, don't speed, you'll fall
Fake bitch, fake tits, fake weave and all
What's wrong with y'all?
Don't start no mess today
Gun holders, put your toast away
Have a drink on me, I got chips to play
Twist tops, straight shots, hand rock a Zay
It's still all good
Still around the wave
Tighter than your grandma's vagina

I gotta roll, I can't stand still
