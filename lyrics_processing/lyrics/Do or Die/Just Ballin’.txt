Chorus (2X):
Ask what we're doing, just ballin
Trying to keep my bills straight stacking never fallin
Caddy or a Lex, trying to hit the next plateau
Flex with the roll droppin drooly go-go's
I was smoking B's since I was a po po
Got the pimp to my soul, so I'll pimp till I'm old
Hold on for a minute let me call my you know (you know)
Over Chorus
There I go steppin out the Caddy or a Lexus, doing my thing
Just Ballin' trying to hit the next plateau
Flexin roll rolls droppin drooly go-go's
Smoking b's
Verse 1:
You know about uno, two hoes let us flex slow, to the front row
You know when the hoes be fallin down, think with instinction get attention
Should I mention, let a baller long lead that dragon staggin lidow
But let me proceed to approach the widow, simple complicated like riddle
Can't smoke a "b" without no weed in it though
Pimp ala 'g' got her face in the pillow, but really though
Ain't got no time for a silly ho cause I gotta page everybody and I'm like
Really yo
Brother's start takin so I dial until I hit the last number
Three bad girls from last summer
La da da drink that we sipped in the hummer
Meet me on the shore cause a nigga got drummer
I'm still flyin love, smokin dub, banging in the clubs
Hanging with the thugs and um, conversation too raw
Bumping all the hoes you saw, never overrest can't go against law

Verse 2:
Um, shimmy shaw
Hoppin out the Lex with an arm full of pretty hoes
Put the Caddy to the side, do you wanna smoke and ride
Cause you heard that a playa just went gone
Cause I attact all the pretty hoes
Don Mack and it's on with the pretty clothes
And I set off the click like a centerfold
When I'm in the mall, take a pull of the overdose of indow
Light tint on the window, holler at the last one to bag one
You get this "b", take a pull and I pass one
Roll on my wrist and escape when I flash my bad ass hoes all the fast ass
Hoes
I take a pose so call the ho fro
7 after 4 go Lex in my mode, mm-mm-mm if only they know
When I get blowed slappin that show
]From the C-H-I-C-A-G-O, AKA better known as Belo
Cause I'm still flyin love, smokin dub, banging in the clubs
Hanging with the thugs and um, conversation too raw
Bumping all the hoes you saw, never overrest can't go against law
Chorus (2X)
Verse 3:
It was Don Perignon I was sippin
Now, bout, 4 or 5 girls I was pimpin
Now, this weed got me laughing and trippin
Slippin clippin, smash riding the tippin
Talk about the niggas in the game that was flippin
Violated for the thing they say after dippin
But squash this, see it's all about the ballin
All the stars and the juice that a nigga be flexin
With the 5 double O without the fins on your Lexus
Make the hoes write your taxes
Keep it real so they know what your checkin
Need to protection, for disrepectin a pescar recollectin
Baby girl need some action
Well, she can meet me at the crib for her lesson
Smell the ass in and the weed smellin fresh and
Shotguns in the chest and check out the blowed expression
I wasn't really undressin, it's more than you're askin
I'm at the click hittin acid
And I'm still flyin love, smokin dub, banging in the clubs
Hanging with the thugs havin conversation in the raw
Bumping all the hoes you saw, never choose red over law
