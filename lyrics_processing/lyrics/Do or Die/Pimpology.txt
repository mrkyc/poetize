Pimpin ain't easy, but somebody's gotta do it..

I see lookin all good with a see-through dress on, nails pressed on
Get your flex on, like fuckin off that song
Lookin like you gotta vest on
By the way you thinkin you gotta peel with it
But if you can't deal with it
It's all cirentricals baby you ain't real with it
If you down then we'll feel it
But thats all them lils said
But licks told we can pick up the looks to the field yo
We can party with P.T.s on T.P. with a tub of hennesse
Three hoes screamin cuz they straight out da hood
Chi-town pimps that all it took
Better yet we can say this party booked
Let's ride to the corner and get some more
On the way back we can pick up some hoes
Show em how to talk em out of their clothes
Handle some freaky shit behind those
See how the pimp be peeped with them flow
Do or Die's all I know
Make em do shit they ain't did before
Number one rule, don't kiss them low
Lemme do my pimp hard
