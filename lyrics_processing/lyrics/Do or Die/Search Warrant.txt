I bend one easy to the driveway fo' Friday, cock back my nine baby, just to see my lady
As I undress to take a shower for half an hour, thinking about this money that brought me power, and all the deals that went sour
Plus, hop out the shower as I feed on, steak what I eat, lead on to the bedroom to get my knob polished
And when I acknowledge was in the room and I assume anotha' drug bust, I hear the door crush, the dogs rush, good Lord its Fed up, fuck!
Unload my nine and shot them dogs up, ATF threw my walls up there's no one I can call up, big balla'
Search Warrant, put they guns in my face, took me to an unknown place as they began to shoot I says my grace

July 16th I'm at the crib playin' in my stack, ain't handled no (?) since '92 when I always kept my strap
Knock at the wood, I grab my good because I'm sick on bidness, two blacks in suits with magazines I figured Jehovah's witness
Ran to the door rushed to the floor and now I'm pounded on, routinely beaten with the flashlight and asounded on
I manage to hustle in the tussle and quickly grab my shit, it's '96 I ain't done no murda' who dey fuckin' wit'
Furniture tossed from head to toe, what they lookin' for, stopped servin' that product, pistol legal, who I'm tooken for?
They said I was wanted for First Degree but there's no paper with ink on it, I know my rights, betta' call my lawya, make dem bitches think on it
I ain't done no murda', I ain't been in trouble since two years probation, didn't read no rights just roughed me, cuffed me straight down to the station
Now I'm locked in the cell, already post my bail, fifty G's from the street now I'm set free, if I'm found guilty in this verdict, I'ma fled to a country
