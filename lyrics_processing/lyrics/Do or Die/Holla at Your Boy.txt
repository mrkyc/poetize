(Johnny P, singing)
One pimp, two pimp her
Don't let your lover down, holla at your boy
One Pimp, two pimp her
Don't let your lover down, but holla at your boy
(Belo)
Spinnin' like twenty-two's on the Maybach
Kick ya Prada shoes up and lay back
To the industry and some pay back
'96, Po Pimp, we go way back
(Verse 1, AK)
Oh yeah, we told 'em, right!?
We still gon' mold 'em, right!?
Cause we gon' pimp it like Goldie, right!?
I could make you a celebrity overnight!
That's just what Twista said
That's just what Kanye said
Spit the game wit' the perfect name
You can lay right back, and they'll give you head
As I spark, cause I love to spark 'em
While I'm thinkin' to myself, I gotta get this bread
And I pulled to the curb, and made her think it's red
Nah, slow down, we lookin' at the ass-ets!
Baby girl, know she got that throw-back
And she a picture peferct moment in the Kodak
With the twenty-two's spinnin' on the Maybach
And when I give ya my number, ya better page back

You do it again so don't stop, don' stop, don't stop now
You're lovin' has set me freeee (Closer I, closer I, closer I get to you)
(Verse 2, Belo)
I'm about to sip this Hennessy, and uhh, take you to Barille
Matter of fact, gotta coupe in the back
Could you just step right off up in heaa?
I'm stayin' at the W, what'll you, do for Belo?
Give respect, cause you know I'm D.O
Take ya shoe when ya walk on my floor
332, 332 oh, bet'cha said she's a virgin, you know?
Gimme lip when I'm puffin' the dro
I ain't tryina be ya man, young chick!
I put the worm on the hook, and you bit
One slip of the lip and you sit
I need a number, not the game that you spit
Man this ain't chu wit' yo back out
Let her cop it on down when I max out
Me and you makin' love on the back route
Go ahead little mama, put the duck out
You struck out, you struck out

(Verse 3, N.A.R.D)
I'm chillin' at a quarter to eight
While I'm bendin' through the city
Cause you know I get my stroll on
Representin' the Chi block for so long
I'm about to let my hair down, hold on
Pull up on the side of a lexus, pull my pin out
Pour the paper n the cup full of Gin out
To my niggas thats gone, and then I spinned out
Go up to the penthouse, throw a couple fins out
(Belo)
Don't it feel good to be a hustla y'all?
(N.A.R.D)
To get her in the raw in the mall
Playa like who gon' fall? That's me?
That's what? That's who?
Got another hit, that's true
Afilliated with the Pimp Max Ju'
Church of the mood, that's new
Now I'm feelin' ya baby, let me put a cause on it
Cuz if I put a pause on it, you gon' wanna put the draws on it
Somethin' like a little bad draws type leak
Somethin' like a little bad draws type leak
