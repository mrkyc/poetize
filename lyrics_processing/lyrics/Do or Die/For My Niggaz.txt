For the block niggas (This is for the block niggas)
Hell yeah
To my muh'fuckin' niggas, to my muh'fuckin niggas
Same old block, same old block, yeah
Somebody light a B for me (Where the lighter at?)
(Hook, AK & Traxter Trump)
For my niggas I live (TT: I live)

(Verse 1, N.A.R.D)
You ever fight, young gun clutcher?
We steady bustin' at these blood suckers
Whatever my nigga, better bust on these muh'fuckas
As I spin on the block, put the rocks in socks
And then, cock the Glock and bend
No hesitation when we ready to flop the man
The big picture is uh, coppin' lots of land
The street fame brought be lots and lots of fans
I asked myself, can I hold my pride within?
Cause I heard that they had to drop my man
Damn it stopped the plan, now I'm ridin' again
Wit' the fourty Glock, cocked up, off the Hen
Here come the coppers wit' the news, stay firm wit' it
Fuck, I lost my man
Got a motherfucka smokin' weed again
Pour out my motherfuckin' liqour, proceed to vent
Goin' to get some Grey, sittin' in the rain, tryina make sense of it
I love you, and I miss your "Warm Embrace"
Up in Heaven, still see ya smilin' face
I keep it real, take it to a slower pace
Ol' B, caught another fuckin' case
But we livin' from day to day, to eat
Stayin' on our feet, still carry heat
Or should I say that he's tryina receive the piece
But if they come at me, for my niggas I...

(Verse 2, Belo)
For my motherfuckin' nigga I die
And hope my songs reach the Heavens with glory
Tell my niggas, "take care of my fam"
And tell my truth about the whole damn story
I pick the Glock up, and then go ride for us
And sent to lock up, and then do time for it
Cause it's the heart-felt shit in my blood
And you can't pay for the real when it's love
Fake niggas keep hate just because
But real niggas graduate to a thug
And we pray no hate, but love
But the streets kinda weak, for blood
I look around and see the world, with no change
An epidemic, livin' crysis of cocaine
To obliviate the blacks, then point-aim
And knock our ass off the map, with no shame
But in the hood we pour liquor, the dead gone
We leave a path for our youngin's just to carry on
Is it better than my heart, to carry on?
And we can overcome poverty, we stayin' strong
Cause we mob 'round here, so go on
Think you catch me on my square? You dead wrong
To my niggas, rest in peace, and live on
For my niggas I'mma strive, to live long

(Verse 3, AK)
I sent a letter to my brother, and it's on
Let'cha know that it hurts in my heart that'cha gone
You left me in a place to fight these situations all alone
And I'mma keep fightin' 'em everyday til' I'm gone
And they can hate what I'm on
But ain't no need for 'em to hate what I'm on
Cause we gotta stick together til' the struggle pain is torn
One day, we gotta number, so we all gon' mourn
Goin' straight to the storm, we goin' straight to the tune
Now the cemetary lookin' like it ain't no room
And it's Revalation's, got me, that my times real soon
Cause we all still stuck between the Earth and the Moon
So watch how I turn, when we get learned
Wit' my face full of tears, and my fist fulla sherm
And I'm all covered up wit' tattoes on my arm
I'm standin' at the grave, just lookin' at my fam
Do you feel concerned? Reach down deep since the shit here burns
Cause I only touched the life of the family that was torn
But there only two strikes, is from the Lord you can learn
When it's all said and done, you just gotta stand firm
And I won't be free, til' the day I see
You standin' at the pearly gates next to me
We embraced eachother, just the way it used to be
So, to my brotha's you can rest in peace
