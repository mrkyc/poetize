Yeah, yeah (you Must be Strong), gotta be strong nigga, only the strong will survive
I got fourteen in, niggas think i'm playing, yo Tommy Tee what's popping
Yo mommy, yo Dave, paris in the house, D.I.T. signal
You know what i mean, yeah yo AD where you at (RIP)
Will will the ave low row nine fifty (Yes in Norway)

The first six months of my life I was hooked to a respirator
Probably gods way of giving me extra flavor
2 years later I'm blowing out cape
And they said it wouldn't happen so we got in on tape
That night cousin came through the fire escape
Stole some money even ate the swan on the plate
He was stressing, I seen the lines in his face
Next time I seen him was online at his weight
At six the youngest nigga trying to get laid
Sixteen the youngest nigga trying to get paid
At ten years old is when I first got played
Little cutie from the project she even wore fade
At fourteen I had pussy on my mind
Couldn't concentrate dick hard all the time
At seventeen that's when the shit got real
I got a taste of jail and the taste is stale I'm thinking

You Must Be Strong, (No doubt niggas)
You Must Be Strong, (I came a long motherfucking way dawg)
You Must Be Strong, (And I got a long motherfucking way to go)
You Must Be Strong, (You feeling me)

I'm nineteen back to jail grand death ordeal
Bullshit charge but I ain't coming to court though
And as faith would have it
Hooked up with Lord Finesse the same year
And recorded a classic (A ghetto bastard)
My pops was never there so they laughed at my gear, And this was every year
New clothes was old clothes shit was golly
Shoot souls, had hoes, socks was bloody
And the bitches that I liked, they didn't like me
And now it can't be the shoes then again it might be
What they didn't now, there's not another like me
But all had changed once I sold a diamond
They killed L, they killed O, they killed Hans
They killed Shaka, they killed Pop, they killed Papa
Shook ones, look son they took pun
I won't stop you understand when a hook come


This is that shit here, this is that pain
Pain makes great music they told me
R.I.P to all my niggas
Jam Master J
All my niggas on lock dawgs I feel ya
(Trigger tone)
For real nigga though my man Arivera
Yo L if it wasn't for you I probably would've stopped already dawg
Andre The Giant
I forgot about him huh
Alright
It's time to wake your fucking ass up dawg
