Aiiyo this is the mic curator aka the sound selector
Dancehall director, virtual night viper
Rhyme script designer, got to see it, multiply it
 on earth
Got us life manifested through birth
structures niggas is crushed with
Like bytes of  is compressed
 through golden trees, let the Jah bless
Verbal killa scrims 
You feel the  when young  hit your flesh
Underground sounds leave your chest up in a mess
Niggas 
They relying in me, only bust the blockbusters
I stand on stage, initialize my thunder gear
Raw melodies, just let the soul of god come me near
I appear, you niggas disappear, me reappear
Shockwave be that nigga that be all up in your ear
I spite the enemy with vivid symphonies
The sound is a vital storm, I brings the chronicles of light
 mi celestial cry
So you can feel the touch of the Eye and I
May these lines guide you through the omniverse
The  i focus on hip hop
To burn niggas out the frame
I die with bloodlines and ghostly ancestors
Fresh as resurrection, of the ebony essence
You might also like
A black medallion
So just treasure this like gold
Shoot the flow through your soul
Make your whole body glow
A black medallion
Just treasure this like gold
Shoot the flow through your soul
Make your whole body glow
A white medallion
So just treasure this like gold
Shoot the flow through your soul
Make your whole body glow
A white medallion
Just treasure this like gold
Shoot the flow through your soul
Make your whole body glow

As my heavy rhyme flow gather momentum
Reveal a fraction of my inner sanctum
And have you cats dubbing this like the national anthem
So radiant, don't even at a peace for throwing tantrums
When you approach our fortress you better be cautious
Put out your torches and shut your mouth cause you're making me nauseous
You shock and endorse this
My rhyme rocket launches
On your haunches
Searching for the cause of your laws
Check the flaws in your clause
Your period is out like I'm at a pause
Two days , realize my metaphors
Hunt you with megaforce like a predator
My retorics are satelites in orbits
Shockwave and Norway, you know we drop the raw shit

Yo, my mental poetry portrays pictures
 fantasies are final fiction
We met our vision, it's my decision
 basehead on crack rock addiction
 rhyme style encryption
Three way reflex
My words deploy a high dosage of voltz
My voice is 

Dpn't get the order wrong, type musical selection
We cross borders with the Dutch-Carribia connection
In every section, TP interseption
Who the next thing? Step into perfection
I got you open like a brothel
See in my gospel, mad colossal
What you getting rec'in with these mc's
Barriers, degrees, please
See the drama increase
