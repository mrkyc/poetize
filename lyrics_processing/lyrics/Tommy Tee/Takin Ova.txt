As we lead MCs into battle
I stand ground with Tee Studios as my castle
Roaming through Norwegian wastelands
Visualizing my verbal style through spray cans
Takin' ova building empires like Caesar
Try to screw me and I Scrooge you like Ebenezer
Nice gals on the mic fights for the grand prize
N-Light-N be the torch in the forest of the midnight

Camelot returning, 98
3 times Merlin casting spells leaving walls burning
Two shadow knights riding through the wood sites
Mic carriers in the moonlight
Soon fight, battle, whom write the remedy
Voice maleficence, slingin' like Yosemite
Benevolance versus malevolance
You represent irrelevance
We're heaven-sent elegance
Telling tales with a dark age relevance
The men mc's talked about in the past tense

Sereneties of the industry

T.P; Theological Prophecies
I give you beliefs, Tiara energies
Fuck 'em in the streets V.O.T chase you out of town
The sound men about to catch another beat down
Yo, Tee lay the beat down (Who am I?)
The best Norwegian producer on the M-I
I take you to the sea, the open type
On any open MIC I shine, saint-like
Glorious! Viviendo cada palabra
I'm sailing in with the Spanish Armada
From the horseback to a 24-track recorder
My beats be walkin' the water, crossin' the border
Shoutouts to Cope2 and the crew C.O.D
Let's whack these others crews like cap MPC

Kid Karma drop the drama, shiny armor Ivanhoe
Seven swords swinging soldiers in the 
Harrow head heroes from beyond the seven meadows
Tellin tough tales from the backside of the meadow
We can never settle, battle for the nine noble kings
Clingin' steel and reprint shields is what we bring
Tee takes the lead, like Arthur we won't fail
Adventures awaits, search for the Holy Grail

The Mudstained Trubadour
Masquerader, element to carry through for my cause
Pearly white teeth connected to my jaws
I pause a bit
To let my palms get in position
Play their role out of suspicion
My mission is sparklin' clear
And I won't fail, V.O.T in my back
T.P must prevail, royalty
Suckers better pay a fee
A very important point is loyalty
Now I reveal my disguise
You guys see blurry flashes of my eyes
Which are evil not sober
Lettin' you know T.P is
