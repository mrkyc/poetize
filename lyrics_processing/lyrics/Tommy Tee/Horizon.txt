My soul is in the clutches of the sin that I spin
E duck and weave
Your epic is septic
Skeptics exit, this next shit is hectic
Pull down Lex my wreck's eclectic
With no mutants your shit ain't worth two cents
Present false pretense while I'm tree dense
Can not keep kosher, bacon inhaler
Eon sacrilegious, inhaling swine dishes
I clench the stench, you call it hellish
Have the judges throw it up to fulfill my blunt fetish
God passed me over, lamb's blood resident
Constant torment, inventing elements
Horrific when lifted, terrific when spliffed
Your blurbs through the curb, my proverbs superb
I rock from top tens and decades of Air Max
These weapons ain't worthy stay laced on the track

Every day I rise, sunlight in my eyes
Stay focused on the prize
(If I can make it I'ma take it)
Late night here we are, wishing on a star
So close but so far
(So close I can taste it)
Every day I rise, sunlight in my eyes
Stay focused on the prize
(Jump on my own two and chase it)
Late night here we are, wishing on a star
So close but so far
(Face it our lyrics lace it)

Yo it's my turn now and I'ma what? Put it on ya
I'm the kid in the hall who gets high when he wanna
Baring south, south east
That is if you stand in the cannon
Of the fresh mouth piece that spit flames on an amateur
Position is relevant
Long as you eloquent
If not I don't want it hear about your block, stop
Aggressive, of course I'm referring to the backwards movements
Like Catholic students who got the rules bent
Reprimandation for those who living in the past
Or the future, energy remains super
Through the fibers of glass
The past sound proof class doing my thing
Which is not sucking a label's ass
Or copy catting what's new and hot this year
Drop a tear for all of dem who fell off to Cape Fear
Mad scared like, "Will my shit sell? Will my shit sell?"
Face facts, you just in it so yo can cop a flip sale
Call your gay friends who really got no ends
See y'all can chill in videos like yo, we rock gems
I network it with brothers who ain't so concerned with surface
And we ain't mad at ya, we laugh at ya

Yo I freak ya telepathy
Take a deep breath and see
The goddess quest a G
Heat up the session we
Light flames on wax
Giving me the energy to break a devil back if he trying a Tec
You getting smacked with the gat, you know the format
An ambush in the night
We taking control, bullshitters get it right
As my front unite you might feel some fright
Surrounded by shadows in the dark
Fight, aight

Analyse these memoirs
Shadow assassins, double up on ten bars
Like drug czars for cash and sacrifice the street sheppard
Music messiah move like a leopard
Fuel injected Jaguar cap bless this biblical scandal
Baptize the sandals
Nazareth nomad, vocab vandal
Tony Randal
Felix Unger
Arm cuff 'em, take 'em under
Run like precipitation, sounds of thunder
Torn us under
They shark notes no jokes any hip hop hoax
My flows will flame ya folks, make a move
Groove merchant
Soul searching
Hard labor keep working
Person to person conversing, deep like sea urchins
King cobras, snake charmers link like figaroers
Forever, eat 'em like cayenne pepper
For better or for worse one verse
Black Sun burst
