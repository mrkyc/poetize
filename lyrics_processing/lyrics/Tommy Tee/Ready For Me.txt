Aiiyo G, I don't think they ready yo
Rhymes
They say every man is put here for a purpose
Tommy Tee that is
What's yours?
Eyes closed
Matter of fact, here's mine

Sex and fame, lusting for destiny
I.G. Off and Haz dropped on the world unexpectedly
The highest is the illest, hope you ready for me
I say the highest is the illest, hope you ready for me
Sex and faith, stay lusting for destiny
I.G. Off and Haz dropped on the world unexpectedly
The highest is the illest, hope you ready for me
I say the highest is the illest, hope you ready for me

July '71, premature ejaculation
Intercourse with no protection, the immaculate conception
Raised in the far rock section
One hit too many
Mom said "mother eff 'em" scooped me in her arms and left 'em
We ran away, then she moved back in with fam
Gramps used to sneak in and give me sips of beer from his can
Sit me on his lap, say I was part of a bigger plan
Slide tables, watch me perform with a brush in my hand
My  early, teacher said I was a bright, young man
An ill rap cat, never really one for the pill
Shorties I drilled, the street taught me hustling skill
Birds love crooks, thugs die young, plus get their shit took
Babies having babies, lost one's outlook
My moms tried to keep my head in the good book
I left the hood shook
Splashed this cat that was supposed to be buck
We had the gods screaming "Shorty G Off", the name stuck
Like quick  on back staircases
Cases of forties on the bench
But when I pour me while they kick war stories
Plastic cups of cokie mixed with ciscio
Drunk as hell seing life through a project window
Jam Tec's  and project raps
Fast women  whips and cash
Leak heads  laced with hash
Old timers tried to lick the weight of the white horse off they mustache
For one they tried to pull off all my niggas that past
Marry death in a red suit if you're handle ain't fast
A lot of cats close they eyes when they squeeze off and blast
In the odds you miss we shoot, you're stuck
Do the math, do the math
Y'all rap cats, do the math

I broke the best off
I've pissed the rest off
Four clip of cop killas knock the vest off
Rip your chest off
I'ma die in the cross
I was married to crack money, but I got a divorce
My styles break a nigga up like brute force
My babys moms got me in court for child support
We play for keeps  of blood sport
So i pack a sawed off and keep my eyes for task force
Come to my block, you taking the jewels off
Otherwise, she gon' light you up like the fourth
Can't believe everything you read in The Source
Icicles dripping off my wrist like I'm Jack Frost
My moms had an eight track, she stays playing Diana Ross
Now when I buy something I don't even ask how much it cost
They do it to theyself, so I can't feel remorse
Came here to battle, you going home with a loss
Burned ass niggas getting housed like red cross
Jumping out a chromed out Porsche, jungle Smirnoff
Smell flesh burning in my cypher like holocaust
Fuck going to jail, I'd rather be dead, I'd be better off
