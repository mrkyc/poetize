I walk through Lost city's filled with rash
And snowdrift the temperature never shifts
You can't travel cause your sails got rifts
Approach my coast and I'mma give you lifts
Icicles and frost is what I'm spitting
No heat it's just the cans that be clicking
You get frosted if you enter my land, the scandinavian island
When I'm on dry land, inhold strong characters, sticking up mic carriers
We're savages. you've been born to rock Hammet with horns
On the grave of my ancestors i've sworn to keep doing mic pilages
The wars we're thundering, plundering your villages
That's how real it is in these cold waters, of whaleslaugthers
We live under lips of porters

Defenders, defenders, defenders, defenders, defenders of the north sea
Don't fuck with the stormy weather
Defenders, defenders, defenders, defenders, defenders of the north sea, (north sea)

I'm crossing ice majestic like a polar bear, disturbing the planets atmosphere
It's naval warfare, out here where I'm from
Leading fleet into open sea confront, I'm on some
Evacuate type of shit, no need for GPS to navigate my ship
I used to win force to set the course, and I always return to the north
To the mighty fjords surrounded by a wood belt
MC explorers get dealt I make the poles melt
As I scream towards the, open sea rapidly, Splitting it as a faculty
You wanna battle me, element number 4
Offshore I drag you down to the seafloor
Where death finders can't locate me
The Black Star soar home where they can't trace me
You might also like

Outshine foreign MCs like More eels
I swallow 'em like whales do with krills
From the glacial conti', the Kon-ti-ki defender of the north pedigree
Me, measure, my velocity in knots
But I move at such speed the vices can't lock
I split you flock, hunt you down one by one
You get done done by my nautical tounge
Took the title from pre storm controllers
Poseidon and I allers, the seven sea holders
Now who's the ballers you, ha, ha, try again
Bring it on I got a coast line to defend
Mermen off and on like the tide
The most fly beats be the waves I ride
From the north side, of things
