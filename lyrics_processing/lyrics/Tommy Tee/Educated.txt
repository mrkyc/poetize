Educated, (Educated), (Educated)

Opaque, world premiere, T.P V.O.T. y'all
Education outside high school keep you oriented, yo
Education is the main priority

Making stress die, from the shit I'll be blazing
This for the occasion, busting moves I'm never faking
Lyrical when I'm baking, honey booty be shaking
When my voice gets high, your breath I be taking
Making noise pushing my way out to the top
My evil soul (?)
Won't stop doing hideous you're moral craze and shit
If you bother me to much in your leg hang
So pay to get a visit from the kid with the big flame gasoline
And the other hand is a god damn shame
What could happen to you in your own house
Torch the shit even more when you try to douse
Educated in the streets of OC
Which means stares a lot of people down with me
With or without a job I know I won't survive
Your crime marry a bitch laid I never strive
You might also like
Educated
Educated
As long as I'm in the streets I stay Educated
Educated, (Educated) (Educated)
Educated
Education is the main priority

Educated the streets is watching you get sufficated
I'm catching record get intimidated
I verbalize metaphores and sentences in disguise
Like Warlocks hit Time Flies
In a world filled with lies
I'm trying to get by day by day
Slap pass you fly and I slay
Rhymes I say on a beat made by Tommy and
Guest on who's (?)rhyming
I'm a verbal diamond and I keep telling you all the time and
Great profound lifted airborn without even leaving the ground
And I just love the sound of dope beats with fly rhymes
And funky compositions in the background
I don't stick to terms when I'm the bird you the fucking worm
Guess I'm gonna reach like sperm
Everybody talking bout ecstasy pills and acid
You bring you blast it
I just talk shit and pass it

Educate my show my skills my words fly like missiles
To give thrills to people eat pills and never chill
I reveal my smarts and inflict pain
In the (?) known as The Mudstained Troubadour
Smack whores and kicking down doors
I'm in your business suddenly a great loss
Above the Oslo fjord I see a shining star
I'm contemplating about how small we ark
And reach far for my soul those people look straws
And now it's time for me to take charge and barge in
To the industry and make a fuss because I cuss
And only few I can trust
I bust rhymes about what's in my head and what I see
Everything reflects OPAQUE
I wanna make money, and flee and see the world
And see them girls, oh we shine like pearls, yeah
Strut your butt as long as I get a cut
My woman through you better keep your mouth shut
Little slut Opaque clean and x-rated
But as long as I'm in the streets I stay Educated
