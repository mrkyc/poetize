I could go on and on, (shawty)
About That Girl
I could go on and on
(yeah) I could go on and on About That Girl

We'ill never know pushing through Oslo
This tight little oversea shawty was a unlocked though
Slick part in the head to figure what it's all there
Can't understand half of what you saying and don't care
Imma give her everything she want
Everything she need is my pleasure indeed
With both hands together wet clay sculpture
Introudce me to another culture
Sit up in the cafe laughing over some latte
Late up in the flatten just old tune blaze
Mixed into the haze the perfume aroma
Once i let it touch me it's over
I'm in another world with the broad sun here's some real talk
When i'm with her i don't miss New York
So call me later i sent you a postcard
With nothing but love CL is down

See high thang got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
I could go on and on About That Girl
Got-got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
I could go on and on About That Girl

Shawty like to read them books
She can't stand the hang with halfway crooks
Hand me your look she's tight with the nookie
Love it when i reach for the cookie
Love it when it's night time flight time walking on silk lights
She a type of queen that nobody is built like
See them haters is the club they don't feel right
Cause when she walks into the room spotlight
Walking on air she hot fronting the rear
Can't stop talking to stairs not that I care
Cause she be on that not like the pidgeons when we sit around and discuss
Religion
Love it when we talk about the world and political issues
Everytime on the phone I tell you I miss you
We even break br'er when we fight to
On the strenght baby nobody is like you

See high thang got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
I could go on and on About That Girl
Got-got-got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
I could go on and on About That Girl
About That Girl
I could go on and on
See high thang got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
I could go on and on About That
High thang got me feeling the flavor
I could go on and on About That Girl
Sweet thang got me going insane
