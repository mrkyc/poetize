Moves you can't trace
Terror face-to-face
I lace the bass and drums with nuff taste
When its crunch time, I invite MCs to my lunch time
With a punch line, bake beef like a mongoose
Even if its one line, and do rhyme
I track em all down, waste a few rounds
Clownass niggas get shot like grave robbahz
Get around like my ballahz
In the Coup de Ville, no time to chill
Sun too hot to stop
See the world through a blink of an eye, imagine dat
I weight cannabis cats steadly takin' naps
Perhaps, I fuck up ya dome like Pete Snaps
No fake cats I need to procede with mine
So long I step on the stage I spit fire
I'm da natty, definatly living up the party
I shut the fuckahz down if these niggas dont respect me
Make em shake like epelepsy
Can't stress me
Can't test me with that talk ya talk keep it walkin'
I walk mine till the end of time, connecting
Collaborating with my comrades from everywhere
True is how I keep it secret: I never leak it
Hot like bahama beaches, with ya girl eating peaches
Shadeeqy lace the track like niki
Hiphop's a fine ho love the way she freak me

Momma always said there'd be days like diz
I'd be stressed like diz, and fall victim to the streets
At an early age have my peeps call early graves
In the early days like around the late 80s
When chicks around the waist had no tits but had babies
My crew went crazy, drug money made us lazy
I never wanted to work, just sell this rap drug
To fiends everywhere with their headphones plugged
Verbal injectah
Hold the gadget like Inspectah
12 bars or pressure
Ghetto story lecture
Indiano, aka C-malo, a hard act to follow
Nigga chew before ya swollow
Yo yo yo yo
Get ya best lined up, get ready so we can combat
I stomp that, blow bags and flow tracks
Where the do at, bless a nigga format(?) packs
Like gats by the ass crack when I click niggas past that
They make lyricis, I blast back with a phat rap
I back trakcs, u relapse, I pack stacks, u eat that
Shit you talkin' new york bronx state of (?)
Double bread niggas who shine get blind of the realness
Yo feel diz
Got my cake stacked up, and blaze shorty with the sex
Got my games backed up, I bought a half a million worth of ice
Keep it confidential, presidential on a rolex
Go tex with the lex as we flex this
General who da federal
Interlectual 40 more with the residue dirty dogs
B-X we bless like the hands of Christ
And roll dice triple 7 for eternal life

My infra-red sizing you up, you live what nigga what
Promote and curruptness, or necceary ruptness
When I bliss, hiss the fist with (?) clips
(?) up those tips between lips and shit
Now and dat shitez
Force and I dont cries smash da dice
The cubes I hold I wrote, see low?? twice
Shakin' up the standard turnin' scramblahz to can't handle us
I want it all be to be, a bad (?) gambler
Shacked ya girl as angela?? got her on camera-rush
And when my mom sees how I'm mashin' or flashin' it from da door-step
Ya niggas ain't vile, ya gotta disscuss the wild
Fuckin' slim girls the project's gotta pee now
Meanwhile niggas be fucking my guns keep bustin'
Chicken heads keep fussin'
Ya bitches always want to suck
My .45 is cussing cops is coming but I ain't runnin'
Joe Sex lets get added motherfuckahz
