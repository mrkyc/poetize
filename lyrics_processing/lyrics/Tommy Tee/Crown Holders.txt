Take a leap of faith into the arms of a blind man
Not to many words come to the mind to define Skam
The unfortunate waits
Portrate of lost faith
More steps of success then the endless source race
Giving up a dream is something we all hate
Arrogance and humbleness
Makes them believe a raw taste
On anyone on coke with two lost hopes
So tell me who gonna be the most ill or most dope
And most choke at the side of the whole of my head
So just help me and kill me gon leave me for dead
Thats what society did
My atmosphere turn cold how the hell are you gon explain death to a 9 year old
And how deep into your mind do gotta look to define the moment of time of the punishment for the crime
So when it's my turn to shine im getting up off the grind
Reaching for the starts touching and draging em down
When i form my last breath it's confined to my quarters
You have no rights for my OldWorldDisorder
You have no rights for my OldWorldDisorder
You have no rights
Chorus
See the sun in Miami keep beating my down so im reaching for the stars and im pulling em down
Standing on a battle ground holding a crown but since God created gravity we holding it down
Verse 2
Got this onlock like a blood thirsty pig everytime I see a mic I wanna grab it and flip my mind is like a tech with 39 in the clip
Put holes in your body and watch your soul drift
Now im all you strippin and bustin a yo clique plus i got my strip thats double my profit
Say that im heartless but I say that it's logic
She telling me she love me but i'm not gonna flip
But the hour I get back she sucking a man's dick
She only with me for the course and the (?)
In the mornin she on point with the eggs and grits
She she way over our heads coz im way to slick
Serious with this like bombs and arabics
(?) fit with 50's n 100's
Hollow point tips got you caught in the mix
Now you better make the ice and your body is stiff
If you wanna step upto us you gotta hav my gift the last cat I had to rock I think his name was St Nick
Chorus
See the sun in Queens keep beating my down so im reaching for the stars and im pulling em down
Standing on a battle ground holding a crown but since God created gravity we holding it down
Verse 3
Ayo jerk yo head back wearing signed yank caps
Crack jaws of physical contact
Streets we rule that
Hot shit
We spit that
Getting Nostalgic shorty rock mics since (?) stolen dirtbikes
Fuckin with fate
Looking for destiny
Hell and extacy
To hot to be next to me
Even eregulate
I let em go after I flow they hesitate
There name alone intimidate
I.G Off and Hazadous
We made mistakes
The hot society bass line
Rest my head on the clouds pull my feet up onto the shore line
Close my eyes let my soul reflect the night time
Ahead of my time
Killer rhyme
(?) in the form of a head lock
Everyday we blaze it's hot
Weather it's writen or off the top
What you chasin we flamin
(?)
I guarentee the game will never be the same again
Chorus
See the sun in Miami keep beating my down so im reaching for the stars and im pulling em down
See the sun in Bronx keep beating my down so im reaching for the stars and im pulling em down
