Now they ain't know too much about me
7 5 with a sick ass glow about me
I get live with a sick ass flow about me
Never spotted with the trick ass ho about me, stop fronting
This country gets to me like small sweaters
I got bigger and better V for Vendetta
I breathe together with MC's that fight and believe together
Dropping one eye open now we see together
Spit a one line wonder now we free together
Never left you alone it's Deep Green forever
Fire, plus it's heat by Tommy and beats by Tommy
Rappers fish out of water like fit tsunamis
Lord have mercy it ain't safe
Face a federal Mc like son it's red tape
You're dead weight to me, not too hard to see
The bottom's not a great place to be (A-Lee)

This shit is not an issue
To what's that got an issue
You say the game why you playing man Beats Me
This shit'll straight hit you
Man how fucked up is you
You say the game why you playing man Beats Me
You might also like
This ain't game why you playing man beats you
I'm saying the same same saying that keeps you
Stay in the same place your brain needs to
Erase it away, it may made people
Say the same we do
Sane or insane we made them T.P. still saying
(What do we do)
Fucking Build gates rappers, mic goes off
Doing playback shows where the mic is off
The lyrics beats spore me, I got asthma
Think what the fuck I would've done if I could breathe normally
My feces are Mc's I eat abnormally
I'm like your ex girlfriend
(Come on man get over me)
Any of us motherfuckers start a ruckus anytime I got
Many, plenty to fuck with talking any can
Steady, nah I'm as fucked up as you
Man I don't even like rap I got nothing to do fool
 (x2)

My team get up, rise above it
My cats push and shove it, my queens they love it
And haters still echo echo still reco recognize
We'll mechanize the Deep Green real deal
Vectorize the angles my star spank or ban
Type of grammar outlast my peers like Santana
And y'all can't stand a fat MC why?
And y'all can't stand an angry MC huh?
Your team plan to be mad at me
Understandably you ain't family
Your crew looks raggedy
My front leave you shook savagely
My imagery is books in the making
Now that sound like a plan to me
Look up in the sky that's me
The last cat flying after world war 3
The last cat dying breed last MC
The pearly gaze after life flash MC

This shit is not an issue
To what's that got an issue
You say the game why you playing man Beats Me
This shit'll straight hit you
Man how fucked up is you
This ain't a game why you playing man beats me
