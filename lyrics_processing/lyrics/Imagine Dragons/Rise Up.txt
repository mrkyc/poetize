I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)
