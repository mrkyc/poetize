(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

(I bet, I bet my life)
Now remember when I told you (I)
That's the last you'll see of me? (I)
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh, I bet, I bet my life)
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me (I)
I gave you hell through all the years (I)

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you
(I bet, I bet my life)
I've told a million lies (I)
But now I tell a single truth (I)
There's you in everything I do (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh)

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
