There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier, oh, easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
