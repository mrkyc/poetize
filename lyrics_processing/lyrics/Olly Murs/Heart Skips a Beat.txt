My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat
Olly Murs, true lad
Rizzle Kicks, yeah

I can see
You're not yourself
Even when you're here with me
I know that you're somewhere else

So put another record on, kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat
You might also like
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

So hung up
We can't let go
If you really have to leave
One more time, just move me slow

So put another record on, play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
'Cause all you ever need to know is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Rizzle Kicks, yeah
At the start of the night I was like, what? Let's have a team talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see Saw
Ooh, she let me sleep with her, I figured her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'm a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (Skip a beat)

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Heart skips, skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
