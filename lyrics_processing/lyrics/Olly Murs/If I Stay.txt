There's too much light in this room
But soon the moon will be gone from view
There's too much fight til we bruise
One step from saying goodbye to you

Maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out
Maybe it's the darkness all around, all around
Tore this love apart what happens now?

If I stay will you hold me again?
If I stay to forgive and forget
If I lay my defenses down on the floor
If we come to our senses and love like before
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late?
If I stay

My bags are packed in a row
Don't think I'm ready to let you go now
This hurts me more than you know
The sound of silence before the showdown
You might also like
Maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out
Maybe its the darkness all around, all around
Tear this love apart I'll stand my ground

If I stay will you hold me again?
If I stay to forgive and forget
If I lay my defenses down on the floor
If we come to our senses and love like before
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late?

If I stay right here and hold you forever
A thousand years for worse or for better
We can't stop now we'll make it together some way
If I stay

Ooh if I stay
If I stay will you hold me again?
If I stay to forgive and forget
If I lay my defeses down on the floor
If we come to our senses and love like before
Will you say will you say that it's not too late?
