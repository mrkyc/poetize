You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip, got my head spinning around
After a drink or two, I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I have the strength to stand

(Oh, oh, oh) Trouble, troublemaker, yeah that's your middle name
(Oh, oh, oh) I know you're no good, but you're stuck in my brain, and I wanna know

Why does it feel so good, but hurt so bad (Oh, oh, oh)
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can
I say I'm done, but then you pull me back (Oh, oh, oh)
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see your silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
Cause I keep coming back again for more

(Oh, oh, oh) Trouble, troublemaker, yeah that's your middle name
(Oh, oh, oh) I know you're no good, but you're stuck in my brain, and I wanna know

Why does it feel so good, but hurt so bad (Oh, oh, oh)
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can

Troublemaker
Why does it feel so good, but hurt so bad (Hurt so bad)
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can (You troublemaker)
I say I'm done, but then you pull me back (Oh, oh, oh)
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

You're so dangerous
Yes you've got me in your clutch
So ridiculous
Seems like I can't get enough
Caught up in your web
How'd I get in such a mess?
Tied up to your bed-bed-bed-bed-bed (Yeah)

Why does it feel so good, but hurt so bad (Oh, oh, oh)
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can (Troublemaker)
I say I'm done, but then you pull me back (Oh, oh, oh)
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker!
Why does it feel so good, but hurt so bad (Oh, hurt so bad yeah)
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can (Troublemaker)
I say I'm done, but then you pull me back (Oh, oh, oh)
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
