Oh, you're slurrin' all your words, there's make-up on my shirt
You're dancin' on the tables, can't you see
That you look like a mess and you're singin' Whitney? (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you
Hate you when you're drunk

Oh, you got them drunken eyes, should we call it a night?
'Cause you've been tellin' stories four-five times
Yeah, I've heard it before and my ears are bleedin' (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you
Hate you when you're drunk

Because you wanna buy champagne (Oh-ooh-oh)
And you wanna throw the shots back (Oh-oh)
And now you're takin' photographs (Oh-ooh-oh)
Why am I the only one that don't laugh? (Oh-oh)
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you
Hate you when you're drunk
So quit actin' like a fool
'Cause I hate you when you're drunk

Oh, it's funny how you won't remember anything
But baby, I'ma love you all the same
'Cause I'll pick you up, when you do it all again
Woah-oh-oh
You might also like
Because you wanna buy champagne (Oh-ooh-oh)
And you wanna throw the shots back (Oh-oh)
And now you're takin' photographs (Oh-ooh-oh)
Why am I the only one that don't laugh? (Oh-oh)
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you
Hate you when you're drunk
So quit actin' like a fool
'Cause I hate you when you're drunk

Oh, when the morning comes, you'll blame it all on me
And when you ask for a hug, I got no sympathy
Because I hate you when you're drunk

Because you wanna buy champagne
And you wanna throw the shots back
And now you're takin' photographs
Why am I the only one that don't laugh?
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you
Hate you when you're drunk
So quit actin' like a fool
'Cause I hate you when you're drunk

Hey
Lala-lala, lala, lala-lala, lala-lala, lala, lala-lala
Lala-lala, lala, lala-lala, lala-lala, lala, lala-lala
Lala-lala, lala, lala-lala, lala-lala, lala, lala-lala
Oh, I hate you, hate you, I hate you, hate you when you're drunk
So quit actin' like a fool
