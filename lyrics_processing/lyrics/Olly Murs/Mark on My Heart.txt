Whether you make this easy
Whether you made it hard
Whether you hurt me deeply
Whether you rocked my heart
Even when you're not around, you're never really gone
Yeah, the memories you leave are goin' on and on
Completely, you're written in my stars, stars

Hey now, I never forget you
There's a piece of you that ain't never left
So when the good times come, or whether they left
You know you'll always be a part of me
And now you know

For everyone that's come with me this far (Do-do-do, do-do-do)
Don't have to tell you, you know who you are (Do-do-do, do-do-do)
If you left your fingerprints or left a scar
Want you to know
Ooh, you made a mark, ooh, you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart

Maybe you make me stronger, maybe you brought me down
Maybe it's what I needed
That's how I see it now, now
Even when you're not around, you're never really gone
Yeah, the memories you leave are goin' on and on
Completely, you know there ain't no doubt, yeah

Made a mark on my heart (Oh, oh)

If you ever held me close
Or if you ever let me go (Oh, oh)
