She ties her hair up tight
Puts her armour on when she steps outside
She lives in black and white
And the colour's gone, but it's in her eyes

Yeah, time and time again, we're going back to the start
And I try and try again to bring some light to the dark
You know everyday's a battle and it tears her apart
And I don't know why
And I'm picking up the pieces when they fall to her feet
She been fighting off her demons, no, she'll never be free
She been hiding in the shadows, yeah, it's hard to believe
No, I don't know why

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you see
You're beautiful to me, oh

She, she never gets it right
And it feels like rain on a perfect night
And I'll, I'll be a hand to hold
She can push me hard, but I won't let go

Yeah, time and time again, we're going back to the start
And I try and try again to bring some light to the dark
You know everyday's a battle and it tears her apart
But don't you cry

My love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you see
You're beautiful to me (You're beautiful to me)

Love, open your heart and let it go
You're so amazing, don't you know?
I don't care what you see
You're beautiful to me (You're beautiful to me), oh

Light breaks through your hair and
They all stop and stare and
I'd go anywhere
Oh, why can't you just see that?
I'm crazy about you
I can't live without you
You don't see it, but you're beautiful to me
Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you see
You're beautiful, oh
Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you see
You're beautiful to me (You're beautiful to me)

Love, open your heart and let it go
You're so amazing, don't you know?
I don't care what you see
