You go 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
You go 'round
But he lets you down and down and down and down
He let's you down
Everybody knows your business in this town
'Cause you can't help it
No, you can't help it
And he'll tell ya, tell ya, tell ya, tell ya what you want
But you've been faking, faking, faking it more than once
And you keep calling, calling me
Every time he's gone
Like you can't help it
You can't help it

Wo-o-o-o-oah
He don't see what I see
And he don't know what you need
He's gon' know when I take your love away
He only loves you part-time
Sure that you cry on his mind
Waiting for me to take your love away
And every piece that he breaks
Is another piece that I take
Until he's made that last mistake
He don't think that you'll leave
And he don't know about me
Well he's gon' know when I take your love away
You might also like
I'll take your love away

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
You go round
But he lets you down and down and down and down
He lets you down
And you keep calling, calling me
Every time he's gone
Like you can't help it
You can't help it

Wo-o-o-o-oah
And he don't see what I see
And he don't know what you need
He's gon' know when I take your love away
He only loves you part-time
Sure that you cry on his mind
Waiting for me to take your love away
And every piece that he breaks
Is another piece that I'll take
Until he's made that last mistake
He don't think that you'll leave
No, he don't know about me
Well he's gon' know when I take your love away
I'll take your love away
When I take your love away

All I know is when we're on our own
Then you drink and it's over
Back to him when you're sober
So you stay, thinking he might change
But I know that he won't
'Cause I know that he don't

He don't see what I see
And he don't know what you need
He's gon' know when I take your love away
He don't think that you'll leave
No, he don't know about me
Well, he's gon' know when I take your love away (Oh)

I take your love away
(He don't think that you'll leave)
(He don't know about me)
