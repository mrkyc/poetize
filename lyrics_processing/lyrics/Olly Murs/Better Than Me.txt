Nothing ever feels like the first date
Everyone changes, it's okay
You and I we both shared the blame
I was trying far too hard to give you
You just want someone with you
But now you got that, it's not the same

'Cause he can't love you better than I
If I said it, than it's a lie
If you don't believe it
Tell me goodbye

I don't ever want anyone else to love you
We were meant to be together
I won't let you go, never
I won't ever let anyone come and take you
Gonna fight for you forever
Until we're back together
I love you better than he
He can't love you better than me
Better than me
Better than me
You might also like
You could put a different face in the same frame
Even call him by my nickname
But both of us know that he isn't me
I could have her wear your perfume
We can make love in the same room
But how would she feel when I call out your name? (Oh yeah)

'Cause he can't love you better than I
If I said it, than it's a lie
If you don't believe it
Tell me goodbye

I don't ever want anyone else to love you
We were meant to be together
I won't let you go, never
I won't ever let anyone come and take you
Gonna fight for you forever
Until we're back together
I love you better than he
He can't love you better than me
Better than me
Better than me

Oh, I don't ever want anyone else to love you
We were meant to be together
I won't let you go, never
I won't ever let anyone come and take you
Gonna fight for you forever
Until we're back together
I love you better than he
He can't love you better than me
Better than me
Better than me
