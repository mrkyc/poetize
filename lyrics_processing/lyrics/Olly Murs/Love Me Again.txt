You walk in, you're with him, it ain't exactly hard to notice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch you dance in his hands, it's hard to deal with all this closeness, closeness

Now I'm standing here all alone
Putting numbers up in my phone
But none of these girls compare to you
Three drinks baby I'm a mess
Too late to second guess
One thing I gotta ask you

Can you love, can you love, can you love me again?
I messed up, I know what I did wrong, but don't say it's the end
Can you love, can you love, can you love me again?
Let's forgive and forget 'cause I'm hating this state that I'm in
Can you love, can you love, can you love me again? (oh na na)

Hey, l-l-love me again (Oh na na)
Hey, l-l-love me again (Oh na na)
Hey, l-l-love me again (Oh na na)
Hey, l-l-love me

Confession; I'm messed up
That chapters gone, why can't we close it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See you there in the dark, it's like you're moving in slow motion
Emotion (Can you love, can you love, can you love?)

Missing that, missing that hot body
Missing you putting that up on me
Wishing you wouldn't hang up on me
(Can you love, can you love, can you love?)
Cause I'm missing that, missing that hot body
Missing you putting that up on me
Wishing you wouldn't hang up on me, yeah
