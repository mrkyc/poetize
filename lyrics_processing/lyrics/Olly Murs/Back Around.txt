I could feel the memory in my brain
I could feel the cold running through my veins
Like it's been, been this way, all of my life
Looking in the mirror through your eyes
Nothing makes sense, these tears won't dry
I let you down, down and out, never thought twice

But that was then
This is now
I know I said I'd never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead, in this town
So tell me when will you bring love back around?
Bring love back around
Love back around

Funny how you never quite realise
That you already have paradise
Til it's gone, gone away, out of your life
Looking in the mirror, don't know myself
Nothing makes sense, this feels like hell
I let you down, down and out, never thought twice

But that was then (That was then)
This is now (This is now)
I know I said I'd never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead, (It feels dead) in this town (In this town)
So tell me when will you bring love back around?
Love back around
Bring love, oh, oh love, your love
Bring love back around, yeah
Back around, (Bring love), oh oh
Oh, love love love
Bring love back around, yeah

Who can I touch? (There ain't nobody)
Who can I trust? (There ain't nobody)
Who can I love? (There ain't nobody)
If it ain't you, you, you
Who can I touch? (There ain't nobody)
Who can I trust? (There ain't nobody)
Who can I love? (There ain't nobody)
If it ain't you, you, you

But that was then (That was then)
This is now (This is now)
I know I said I'd never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead (It feels dead) in this town (In this town)
So tell me when will you bring love back around?
Back around
Bring love, oh, oh, your love, your love
Bring love back around, yeah (Your love)
Back around (Bring love)
Oh oh
Oh, love love love
Bring love back around, yeah
