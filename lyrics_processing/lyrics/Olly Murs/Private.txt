It's been a long night
And we've both had a bit too much
I can see in your eyes
You're in the mood, I know you're wanting some

You're trying to kiss me and touch me
You're all up in my face
But we're in public, so stop it, 'cause I don't do PDA
I know you know me but there's no need
No need to make a scene
We gotta cover it up, gotta get up to get down
If you know what I mean

Keep it private, baby
Don't need no people watching
Us now maybe
Yeah, we should keep it private
Believe I'm ready
But we should keep it on the low
Low oh oh oh

Tryna be honest
It's just that I've been through this all before
You already know I want it
So let me do the things you like to do behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
You might also like
You're trying to kiss me and touch me
You're all up in my face
But we're in public, so stop it, 'cause I don't do PDA
I know you know me but there's no need
No need to make a scene
We gotta cover it up, gotta get up to get down
If you know what I mean

Keep it private, baby
Don't need no people watching
Us now maybe
Yeah, we should keep it private
Believe I'm ready
But don't tell anybody
No no no
We should keep it private, baby
Don't need no people watching
Us now maybe
Yeah, we should keep it private
Believe I'm ready
But we should keep it on the low, oh low oh oh oh

Let's keep it on the low, low, low
Let's keep it on the low (low, low)
Lets keep it on the low (low oh oh)

Let's keep it on the low
Ain't nobody gotta know
