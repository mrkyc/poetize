Done messin' up, messin' your head
'Cause this time, no roses will do (For you)
Waited all night in the pourin' rain
In a white dinner suit, woah

Oh, baby, shame on me, shame on me
Shame on me for lovin' you, so desperately, desperately, oh-oh
And I'll put the blame on me, blame on me
Blame on me for lovin' you, so selfishly, selfishly, oh-oh
So if you leave me now

I think I'd die of a broken heart
I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight
'Cause baby, your face, a work of art
Oh, I think I'd die of a broken heart, that's right
There's seven billion people in the world
And all I want is you
I'd go maniac if you walked out
If you walked out, it's true
I think I'd die of a broken heart
I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight

Tattooed your name under my eyes
So everyone knows you're mine, and I know
And I'm done, so done takin' my own advice, yeah
'Cause I'm not too good at goodbyes, woah

Shame on me for lovin' you, so desperately, desperately, oh-oh
And I'll put the blame on me, blame on me (Blame on me)

So if you leave me now

I think I'd die of a broken heart
I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight
'Cause baby, your face, a work of art
Oh, I think I'd die of a broken heart, that's right

I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight

Shame on me, shame on me
Shame on me for lovin' you, so desperately, desperately, oh-oh
And I want the world to see, world to see
That I would lose my sanity for you baby, you baby, oh-oh
For you, baby
I think I'd die of a broken heart (Yeah, yeah)
I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight
'Cause baby, your face, a work of art
Oh, I think I'd die of a broken heart, that's right
I think I'd die of a broken heart (Ooh)
I think I'd die of a broken heart tonight
'Cause baby, your face, a work of art
(A work, a work, a work, a work of art)
Oh, I think I'd die of a broken heart, that's right
There's seven billion people in the world
And all I want is you
I'd go maniac if you walked out
If you walked out, it's true
I think I'd die of a broken heart, yeah
