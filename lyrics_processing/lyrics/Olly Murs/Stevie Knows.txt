Stevie

The door's are locked
The night is ready for you
Dinner's still hot
You don't want dessert to spoil

So baby, come home, come home, come home, come
Baby, come home, come home, ooh
Baby, come home, come home, come home
Soon as you come in this house
I'm gonna take you to higher ground

'Cause Stevie don't wonder, Stevie knows
Stevie don't wonder, Stevie knows
Stevie don't wonder (Stevie don't wonder)
Stevie knows (Stevie knows)
Soon as you come in this house
I'm gonna take you to higher ground

The bed's undressed
Like you it's looking gorgeous
Lay on my chest
Then ride out into the morning
You might also like
So baby, come home, come home, come home, come
Baby, come home, come home, ooh
Baby, come home, come home, come home
Soon as you come in this house
I'm gonna take you to higher ground

Stevie don't wonder, Stevie knows
Stevie don't wonder, Stevie knows
Stevie don't wonder (Stevie don't wonder)
Stevie knows (Stevie knows)
Soon as you come in this house
I'm gonna take you to higher ground
