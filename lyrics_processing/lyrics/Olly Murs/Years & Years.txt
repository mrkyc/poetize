When I'm alone, in the dark
I paint a picture inside my mind
Of all the things that I wanted
But I never thought I would find
And it blows my mind
Because there you are, by my side
Maybe you know, maybe you don't
But it's a question I have to ask
I know we're young and we got life
But life always goes so fast
But while you're mine
Yeah, it feels like time's on our side

Years and years, forever young
Years and years, yet to come
I take every second of every minute
Long as you're in it, you know I'm winning
Years and years, we won't forget
The time and place that we met
And I remember it all so clear
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here

No, we're not at the end
But we came close, maybe once or twice
We got burned, but we learned not to listen to bad advice
Now I know you're mine
'Cause it feels like time's on our side
This feeling will never get older
Will never be over while you're still mine
You might also like
Years and years, forever young
Years and years, yet to come
I take every second of every minute
As long as you're in it, you know I'm winning
Years and years, we won't forget
The time and place that we met
And I remember it all so clear
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here

It doesn't matter where we go
It's all I want, it's all I know
This feeling's never ever getting old
It's all I know, know

Years and years, forever young
Years and years, yet to come
I take every second of every minute
As long as you're in it, I know I'm winning
Years and years, we won't forget
The time and place that we met
And I remember it all so clear
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here
Years and years
Years and years
Years and years
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here
Years and years
Years and years
Years and years
You signed your name on my heart
