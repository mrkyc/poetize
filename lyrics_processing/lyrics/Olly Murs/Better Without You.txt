There goes my girl
There goes my world falling to pieces
Damn, how'd we get here, what a bad year, season by season
Day by day
I've been reaching, I've been reaching out for you

And I don't know why you're stuck in my mind
It's like I can't shake you
And I tell myself it wasn't our time
Cause I couldn't make you stay
But day by day I get closer, I get closer to the truth

Oh, I, I won't be waiting for your call all night
No, I don't need your body by my side
I'm better without you
I, I won't be hanging by the telephone
But I'll be lying when I tell myself
I'm better without you

Hey, what can I say, what can I do?
I got to keep moving
Oh, every night I'm thinking about you
When all that I'm losing
Day by day, I got nothing, I got nothing left to prove
You might also like
And I don't know why you're stuck in my mind
It's like I can't shake you
And I tell myself it wasn't our time
Cause I couldn't make you stay
But day by day I get closer, I get closer to the truth

Oh, I, I won't be waiting for your call all night
No, I don't need your body by my side
I'm better without you
I, I won't be hanging by the telephone
But I'll be lying when I tell myself
I'm better without you

Day by day, I miss you, I miss you more
Day by day, I miss you, I miss you more
Day by day, I've been reaching
I've been reaching out for you

Oh, I, I won't be waiting for your call all night
No, I don't need your body by my side
I'm better without you
I, I won't be hanging by the telephone
But I'll be lying when I tell myself
