This is my confessional
Pen and paper, I'm gonna write this down
Saying things you never thought
That were on my mind
Let the truth pour out

'Cause I'm tired of the games
I won't lie, no I'm not okay
You were wrong, you're to blame
Now the world knows your name

So here you go
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down?
Now I curse the day that I met you
I hope, you know, this song is about you
This was no mistake, yes, I meant to
I hope, you know, this song is about you, about you
This song is about you, yeah, yeah

Seems I'm feeling better now
Like the weight I had's lifting off my chest
Should have done this months ago
If I knew back then, it would feel like this
You might also like
'Cause you've done all the games
I won't lie, no I'm not okay
You were wrong, you're to blame
Now the world knows your name

So here you go
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down?
Now I curse the day that I met you
I hope, you know, this song is about you
This was no mistake, yes, I meant to
I hope, you know, this song is about you, about you
This song is about you, yeah, yeah

When you hear this play
I hope you feel the same way that I felt that day
That you let me, yeah, you left me
This is my confessional
Pen and paper, I'm gonna write this down

So here you go
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down?
Now I curse the day that I met you
I hope, you know, this song is about you
This was no mistake, yes, I meant to
I hope, you know, this song is about you, about you
This song is about you
About you, about you, about you
This song is about you
This song is about you, yeah
This song is about you
