Late night calling
Let me know when and I'll meet you there
Time fast forward, and we'll play a little truth or dare
But it's better if we walk away
So we only have one drink left
But it's typical of you and me, me, me, me

Baby, if you wanna stay the night
Getting down until we blow the lights
Put your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind
'Cause when I'm loving you I know, know, know
Baby, I ain't got no self control
Put your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind

Daylight is falling
Baby, I still feel it in the air
Close those curtains
Play another game of truth or dare
So I guess we should have walked away
'Cause you know what brings us into pain
But it's typical of you and me, me, me
You might also like
Baby, if you wanna stay the night
Getting down until we blow the lights
Put your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind
'Cause when I'm lovin' you, I know, know, know
Baby, I ain't got no self control
With your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind

Late night calling
Let me know when and I'll meet you there
Time fast forward

Baby, if you wanna stay the night
Getting down until we blow the lights
Put your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind
'Cause when I'm lovin' you, I know, know, know
Baby I ain't got no self control
With your body next to mine
You don't have to read my mind

You don't have to read my mind
You don't have to read my mind
You don't have to read my mind
