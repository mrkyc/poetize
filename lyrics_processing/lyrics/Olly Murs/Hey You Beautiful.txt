(Hey, you, beautiful)

Hey, you, beautiful, girl, you knock me down
Haven't seen you before, tryna feel you out
Die hard, disregard, comin' out your mouth
But your body sayin' something else

You say that you don't, don't, but I know you do, do
Playin' hard to get, get, girl, I'm onto you
You're tellin' me no, no, you really mean yes, yes
Let yourself go, go why don't you confess?

Ooh, feel your body callin' out to me
Don't deny this electricity
Know there's something dirty on your mind
You don't have to lie, no, you don't have to lie

(Ooh) I know it, (Ooh) you got it
(Ooh) Sex is in your eyes
(Ooh) I know it, (Ooh) you got it
(Ooh) Sex is in your eyes

Okay, now I see, you just love the chase
Lucky for you, my dear, that's my favourite game
Won't stop till I got you callin' my name
You know you can't resist it, baby

You say that you don't, don't, but I know you do, do
Playin' hard to get, get, girl, I'm onto you
You're tellin' me no, no, you really mean yes, yes
Let yourself go, go why don't you confess?

Ooh, feel your body callin' out to me
Don't deny this electricity
Know there's something dirty on your mind
You don't have to lie, no, you don't have to lie

(Ooh) I know it, (Ooh) you got it
(Ooh) Sex is in your eyes
