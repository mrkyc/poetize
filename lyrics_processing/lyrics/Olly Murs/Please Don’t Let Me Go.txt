Where do I begin?
Should I tell you
How bad I need you now, yeah
You're underneath my skin
But I'm confused
My head is spinning all around, oh-oh

I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind?

Normally I try to run
And I might even wanna hide
'Cause I never knew what I wanted
'Til I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign
That you feel how I feel for you

Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
Da-da de-de, da da

Don't leave me in the dark, no
But baby don't put out this spark, no

I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind?

Normally I try to run
And I might even wanna hide
'Cause I never knew what I wanted
'Til I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?

Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
Pardon the inquisition
Under these conditions
I need a definition
Is it love that we're sharing?
Show me that your caring
You see my fascination
Tell me I'm not mistaken
Give me the information I need
1, 2, 3, woo
