I ain't tryin' to get over your lovin'
'Cause a song without you means nothing
In a dark room, you and me touchin'
Just you and I, you and I, hey
Starting over
Then the beat comes out of nowhere
By the time this night is over
It'll be you and I, you and I

Hearts will break
We'll make mistakes
But it's okay
But that don't ever stop us from living the high life

From bad times
The hello's, and goodbye's
And after all this time, I still go hard for you
You know we make up, and we fight
We give up, then we try
You're mine for a lifetime
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)

(I go hard)
(I go hard)
(I go hard)
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)
You might also like
Your friends say we should be over
But we're love drunk even when sober
Who gives a fuck whatever they told ya?
'Cause it's you and I, you and I, yeah
Let's meet in the middle
Put your hands on me just a little
Yeah, nothing else feels this simple
It's you and I, you and I

Hearts will break
We'll make mistakes
But it's okay
But that don't ever stop us from living the high life

From bad times
The hello's, and goodbye's
And after all this time, I still go hard for you
You know we make up, and we fight
We give up, then we try
You're mine for a lifetime
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)

(I go hard)
(I go hard)
(I go hard)
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)
We got crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy love
Out of our minds and we ain't givin' up
We got crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy love, yeah
Out of our minds, but that don't ever stop us

From living the high life
From bad times
The hello's, and goodbye's
And after all this time, I still go hard for you
You know we make up, and we fight
We give up, then we try
You're mine for a lifetime
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)

Oh (I go hard)
(I go hard)
Oh (I go hard)
I still go hard (I still go hard for you)

The high life
From bad times
The hello's, and goodbye's
And after all this time, I still go hard for you
You know we make up, and we fight
We give up, then we try
You're mine for a lifetime
