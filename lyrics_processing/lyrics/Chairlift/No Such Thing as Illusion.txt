There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing
There is no such thing as illusion

To walk around in circles
And now I have the story straight
And running down a mountain
Tears of gold running down my head
To wake up from a nightmare
To your warm familiar face
Oh love can be as simple
As your hand wrapped around my waist

After all I thought I wanted
Ripped in two while on display
After all you're my permission
To unloop and walk away

And after all the crying is solace
But won't come free
You know the status quo of nature
The strong eat the weak
You might also like
I'll tell em all the expectations
Were lost along the way
I'll tell em all I ever needed
Was your arm around my waist

There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing
There is no such thing as illusion

Don't tell me that it's fleeting
Don't tell me it's a honeymoon
Don't tell me that this feeling
Comes and goes, yeah, I know what they say
This ain't no new car leather
There's no return it if it breaks
This can be everlasting
Just don't go
When I get the shakes

After all I thought I wanted
Ripped in two while on display
I'll tell em all I ever needed
Was your arm around my waist
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing as illusion
There is no such thing
