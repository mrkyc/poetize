Take a break from the moving mountains, I wanna show you off
Laying low at home, whatever, I wanna show you off
To the boys who think they're clever, I wanna show you off
So that they see who's finally saying yes to you

You can trust this, you can have this
I'm not playing a game
I wanna let this go public and not be ashamed
Ooh, they don't make them like you anymore (No, no)

'Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real, and if you want it, babe
Show it off
Let 'em see how you get on
Roll the window down to flaunt it, babe
Show it off
Show it off

See, I can be a discreet lover, but I wanna show you off
Can't get this undercover (like the showing better)
If you wanna bring your boys around
Then you can show me off too
You might also like
You can trust this, you can have this
I'm not playing a game
I wanna preach this, unleash this, and not be ashamed
Ooh, they don't make them like you anymore
So take a second, take a minute

'Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real, and if you want it, babe
Show it off
Let 'em see how you get on
Roll the window down to flaunt it, babe
Show it off
Show it off

I-I-I'm past the point of asking why
Why I-I-I, why I let the whole world know you're mine

'Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real
Let 'em see how you get on it
Roll my window down to flaunt it, babe
Show it off
Show it off
'Cause if you got it like we got it
If you got it like we do
Hey, if it's real, be real
Gotta see if you're down, down, down, down (hey)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So be real
