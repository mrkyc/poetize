I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
Cause tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking till the morning light

Cause we like to party
Ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
We like to party
Ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way that I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close don't let me go
So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
Cause tonight
I'll give it all away
Music knocking till the morning light
Cause we like to party

Kool A.D., tragicomic mulatto
I'm Pablo Picasso, I'm an asshole
I'm Drake versus Common, who cares
I'm Gil Scott-Heron, I'm new here, I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm Lenny Kravitz, I'm Lenny Kravitz
Girls love me, no you're a faggot
Shout to Li'l B and Kanye West backup dancers
Texts to Jessica for stage passes and got no answers
It's cool, though. What up to Jessica
What up to Ivy, Marquetta, Chelsea, et cetera
I'm Elian Gonzalez, I'm being honest
My politic too organic to understand it
I ought to quit, maybe I ought to not
Thought a bit about it for a second so probably not
First world problem child, I got a lot of styles
Le boss say the French pay Lacoste: crocodiles
My rap album praised in magazines for rockophiles
What's it all mean? I don't know, man
I don't know, man

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
Cause tonight
I'll do it every way
Music knocking till the morning light
