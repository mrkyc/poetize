Damn, bih

Ch-ching, ch-ching
Ch-ching, ch-ching

This is rump-shaker music, jump up, pump, faker music
Superstar stunt maker music
Sun breaker music and God gave her all of that ass
Wait a minute, hold up, make 'em lose it
It's safe to assume that it's great making cash off of this
Even better, making cash off of hits
So excuse me if I ball out when it's bank time
For spending, I'mma make time, checking on them blank lines
Dollar, dollar, dollar, but that ain't gon' feed us
A hundred million money bags, there ain't no reason
On why we worship hundreds, like, they ain't no Jesus
But I've been putting work in, it's a green back season
I need my bank rolls and the stacks thick
Piling up my bills to spend it all, it's just practice
Sometimes you try to do it all for the cactus
Got return for my taxes and I splurge like a bachelor

Getting what you want can be dangerous (uh-oh)
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret (uh-oh)
And pass it back under the table to me
I put the stash in the bookshelf (uh-oh)
Open your mouth and I'll slip you the key
Now crack that combination (uh-oh)
Like 27-99-23

Do me the biggest favor, don't you need no favors
I got my own club, got my own paper
Back when I had nothing, you would get me down
When I was on the road grinding, you would sleep around
Now wake your ass up to the reality
That I done came up, way up, I know you mad at me
You would be happy if I ain't have all of this cash with me
Even happier if I jumped off the balcony
But if I ever jumped, it's with a set of wings
Somewhere in the sky because you let me free
Free from all the hate and you can't buy my love
You can try to sabotage, but baby, try your luck
And this here ain't luck, this is destiny
And hard work and right answers when he texting me
100 'til the day that I leave
Road running, getting money, ch-ching, yeah

Ch-ching, ch-ching
27-99-23
Ch-ching, ch-ching

And this here ain't luck, this is destiny
All you're gonna get is the best of me, yeah
This here ain't luck, this is destiny, yeah

Getting what you want can be dangerous
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret
And pass it back under the table to me
I put the stash in the bookshelf
Open your mouth and I'll slip you the key
Now crack that combination like 27-99-23

Ch-ching, ch-ching
