Fake niggas, Fake niggas I'm tired of fake niggas, aye, huh

It's way too many fake niggas, I'm tired of fake niggas
Sneak dissin' but be all in my face nigga
All these snake niggas, how much can I take, nigga?
Money replace niggas, I stay far away from niggas
Too many hatin' niggas, I'm tired of hatin' niggas
Niggas act like bitches, might as well go chill with my bitches (Yeah)
Seems like fake niggas just surround me
Do me a favor if you fake, stay from 'round me

Fake niggas, lemme' tell you somethin' bout' fake niggas
Got 150 niggas ridin' with me
But I only fuck with bout '8 niggas
No really though, circle small, Cheerio
Hatin' on Lil Bibby flow, when I take off, where did he go?
I'm gone, cup full of that kickstand just put me in my zone
Ain't doin' shit just coolin' it, these niggas hittin' my phone
Grippin' on chrome, haters get gone, better watch yo' tone
Takin' kush to the dome
Red beam on the gun, you'on wanna get domed
Lotta' white chalk, you'on wanna get drawn
Haters get blown put a body on the 9
Leave yo' face on a lot of shirts
Leave 'em dead with a clothing line
Leave his ass right on the 9, Lil Bibby, I'm supposed to shine
My bitches be over fine, what you need? I'm on the grind
In my face it's all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
Got Irene, bout' a pound
They only come around when I'm blowin' loud
In my face it's all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
Got Irene, bout' a pound
They only come around when I'm blowin' loud

Fake niggas can't fuck with them, hatin' niggas stay away from me
GBE, NLMB, them the niggas who fuck with me
It's way too many fake niggas who wanna just be around me
Foreign money and foreign guns that's all I need around me
Not even a bitch, on bro n'em, I can't trust em' (Nah)
Bust today then you can bust away, I ain't even tryna' fuck her
One thing about these niggas, if you flexin' keep a nigga back
Niggas snakes, niggas fakes, them niggas will get you whacked
Pull up foreign (Skrrt, skrrt), I'm flexin' on these hoes
Bitch, I only want the mouth, yeah, hoe, that's all I know
Head shots, it's war time, Bibby tell me when to go
Man, I can't fuck with niggas, trigger happy just to blow
This .30 under this Gucci belt, cock back then we spazzin' out
Robin Jeans and True Religions, this rap shit, we cashin' out
New niggas out my circle, face shots we passin' out
Roc Block or no Block, fuck niggas we flashin' out
It's way too many fake niggas, I'm tired of fake niggas

Yea, Lil Herbie takin' off so I got niggas hatin'
Then they see my diamonds black and white, intergration
Kushy puffin', Remy tastin', daily trappin', Benji' chasin'
Tryna touch this bread but I got niggas at my head
Guess they wanna see me dead, or wanna see me in the feds
Cause' I'm gettin' it
And all they gon' do is see me spending it
And now they wanna get with this but not when we was into shit
So if they on some stealin' shit, I'm spittin' it
Faster than I'm spittin' this and faster than that new M6
When I drive the newest whips, just make me do the rudest shit
Might whip out on my newest chick like:
"Yeah, what you gon do with this?"
Suck it til' it's nice and stiff
But make sure you don't bite the tip, you triflin' bitch
Fake niggas all around me, in the water tryna' drown me
Just starin' and shit, playin' and shit
Gon' make me let this cannon spit
And 'cause some fuckin' damages, with alcohol and bandages
So try me and I'm blammin' it, no panickin'
It's way too many fake niggas, I'm tired of fake niggas
Sneak dissin' but be all in my face nigga
All these snake niggas, how much can I take, nigga?
Money replace niggas, I stay far away from niggas
