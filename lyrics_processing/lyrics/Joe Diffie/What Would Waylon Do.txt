Hey Possum
Yehhhh
Let's do a lttle singin' whatta you say
Yehhhh
Well the doors open at seven and the crowds are filing through
Somebody dropped my guitar and I can't find my left boot
There's a genius running monitors and he ain't got a clue
Well what would Waylon do
There's blue cheese in the green room
What are we suppose to eat
And the opening act's a poker band and they can't keep a beat
The promoter wants a second show and he's copped an attitude
Well what would Waylon do
Kick in the door, shoot out the lights
Scare the fool out of the sound man with a "Hoss let's get this one righr"
Bring down the house with the "Waymore Blues"
Well what would Waylon do
Well the sheriff's got the drug dogs tearing up our bus
We're just two mealy singers "I think he's profiling us"
And now he wants an autograph and a free tee shirt or two
Well what would Waylon do
Kick in the door, shoot out the lights
Scare the dog out of the sound man with a "Hoss let's get this one righr"
Take down the house with the "Waymore Blues"
Well what would Waylon do
Well the drummer's just informed us that we ain't gettin' paid
"They'll send a check out Monday"
" No the Hell you say"
Who would that 'Ole Outlaw" strangle if he was in our shoes
What would Waylon do
Kick in the door, shoot out the lights
Scare the pants off of the sound man with a "Hoss let's get this right"
Bring down the house with the "Waymore Blues"
Well what would Waylon do
Bring down the house with the "Waymore Blues"
Well what would Waylon do
Yeh, what would "Ole Waymore" do,well
