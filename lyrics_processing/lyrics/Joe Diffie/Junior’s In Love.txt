Junior pulled up into her sidelot
Carried them up to the front door and hollered
"Wanda, lookit what I got!"
She was sittin there watchin TV
With a drywall hanger named Shorty
She pressed her nose to the screen door and said
"They smell like WD40"
He said, "Now don't you be that way
You know how much I love you
I can't hardly sleep at night and when I do
I dream of you
And by the way Shorty I thank you
You could've had them put me in jail, Son
I'm just glad I run out of air hose
When I come at you with that nail gun."
Oh Junior's in love, ain't that a good one?
He'll track her down and then if she should run
He'll bring her home like a deer on the hood, Son
Junior's in love
Wanda walked down the front steps and said
"I hate to break up the party
But I've got to get to work by 5
Would you run me over there, Shorty?"
That's when Junior turned bright red and said
"I'm taking her to the diner!"
And he threw Shorty in the truck bed
With a busted nose and a shiner

There's lots of lovers and Junior he's not one
Don't know a kiss from a hug from a shotgun
Junior's in love
Oh you know there's an old puddle down by the diner
And it came out of his transmission
That's where he parks every night and stares through the window
In a lovesick and sorry condition
Oh Junior's in love, ain't that a good one?
He'll track her down and then if she should run
He'll bring her home like a deer on the hood, Son
Junior's in love
