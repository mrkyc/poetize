Whoa, she's a hot one

It's a hot day, and I've got a pocketful of money
Friday, tires roarin', you can hear me comin'
Cooler in the back, Bud Light ice cold
Me and my buddies cuttin' down an old back road
I got a jacked up truck, but it ain't much
A fixer upper with a brand new clutch
Yeah, it takes me anywhere I wanna go even though
It's hard for me to keep my eyes on the road

But that girl ridin' in the shotgun
Sunkissed by the Dixie hot sun
Whoa, she's a hot one, yeah
Aldean all up on the radio
Dashboard lights shinin' on my baby, oh
Later on, gonna have me a little fun
With that girl ridin' shotgun, yeah
Whoa, girl ridin' shotgun

She's the girl of my dreams, she gives me everything
Wearin' short shorts or some tight blue jeans
She's country, and she ain't afraid to break a nail
Raise hell, or go to jail, I keep her by my side
She's always ready to ride, and sometimes
She even drives when it's in four wheel drive
Never known to back down from anything
And you know she keeps her motor clean, yeah

Later on, gonna have me a little fun
With that girl ridin' shotgun, yeah
Whoa, girl ridin' shotgun

She could be the centerfold of "Field and Stream"
Holdin' that double barrel twelve gauge
To me, nothin' sweeter than a Georgia peach
Playin' air guitar to a song I sang, a song I sang, a song I sang
Talkin' 'bout that

Pretty little redneck girl ridin' shotgun
Sunkissed by the Georgia hot sun
Whoa, she's a hot one, yeah
Aldean all up on the radio
Dashboard lights shinin' on my baby, oh
Later on, gonna have me a little fun
With that girl ridin' shotgun, yeah
Whoa, that girl ridin' shotgun
