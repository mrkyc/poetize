Man, that smells good

I can't get rich, I can't make a living
But I sure do something for the neighborhood women
I wake up every morning with 'em knocking at my door
You can't keep 'em waiting when they're begging for more

"Back, back," I hollered to my hound
"You're supposed to keep 'em from coming around"
I used to think they were after me
But they're just after my recipe
For good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
I said good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)

You can sop it with a biscuit, you can eat it from a pan
You can lick it off your fingers when it's running down your hand
If I could get a backer, I could cause a big commotion
I could put it on the market, call it "Biscuit Lotion"

"Back, back," I hollered to my hound
"You're supposed to keep 'em from coming around"
I used to think they were after me
But they're just after my recipe
For good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
I said good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
Oh, whip me up a batch, boy

Well, Granny told my mama 'bout the power that it had
Good brown gravy is the way she got my dad
They tried to get me in the Army, tried to get me in the Navy
Just to get the secret of my good brown gravy

"Back, back," I hollered to my hound
"You're supposed to keep 'em from coming around"
I used to think they were after me
But they're just after my recipe
For good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
I said good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
Good brown gravy (Good brown gravy)
I mean good brown gravy

Oh, love that brown gravy, yeah
Oh yeah, sing it, baby
Talkin' good brown gravy
Hey, Joe (What, Billy?)
What you got cooking in there, man?
Good brown gravy (Ow)
Want my, want my, want my good brown gravy
My good brown gravy, ooh
Could you pass the biscuits, please?
That a little Martha White?
What do you think of it, Billy?
Got a little bit thick, try another batch
