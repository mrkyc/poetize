One hip at a time
Like a broken field runner
Slippin' through the lines
He likes the way she looks
So he calls a little wife
Says don't wait up for me
I'll be workin late tonight
Wife hangs up the phone bursts into tears
Calls her sister up and cries get over here
Sister tells her boyfriend be back in awhile
Boyfriend wants a beer, the store is just a mile
Leaves the motor runnin' he'll only be a minute
His car drives away with teenagers in it
Driver tells his buddies, got one life to live
They scream into the night, lets get it over with
Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the earth, third rock from the sun
The kid guns the gas, car starts to swerve
Heads for a semi-truck, jumps the curb
Truck hits a bigboy in the Shoney's parking lot
Flies through the air, takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole, transformer sparks
Lines go down, town goes dark
You might also likeWaitress calls the cops says she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the mayor says there's panic in the street
Hate to wake you up but we can't find the chief
Mayor says use your head, if he ain't in his car
He's hiding from his wife, down at Smokey's bar
Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the earth, third rock from the sun
Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the earth, third rock from the sun
Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
Welcome to Earth third rock from the sun
