What would you do if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm going to try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel at the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)

I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm going to try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)
I need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody?)
I just want someone to love
