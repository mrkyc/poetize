Six o'clock in the morning, you've just gone to sleep
I wipe a tear from my eye
It can't be the kind of company I keep

That keeps me askin', you keep me askin'
You keep me wonderin' why

I don't treat you like I like to treat you
Every planet in the sky's in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I should

It could be the comfort going to my head
That makes me wanna dream of you
But while you're sleeping softly in your bed

I wanna tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too

I (I) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you) like I like to treat you
Every diamond in the sky's in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I should

No I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I should

I know you would say, you love my way
It's good enough for you
But I know for sure, I could do more (more), more (more)

I want to tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too

I (I) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you) like I like to treat you
Every diamond in the sky's in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I

But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I could
But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I should (Ooh-oo-ooh)
But I don't treat you like I
No I don't treat you like I
