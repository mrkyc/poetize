Stop and take the time to smell the roses
Stop and take the time to fill your noses
Stop as you stroll through life, (pitter patter, pitter patter)
Stop and take the time to talk it over with your wife
I said, stop and take the time, take the time to read the label
Stop, you must remember Clark and Betty Grable
Stop, there's no train to catch, no there isn't, rose
No, no, no
Come on, everybody, you've got to stop
Stop on the highway
Stop when you're in a car on that highway
Roll down your window
Look for a man in a Porsche and say
"Brother, let's get out and walk, let's go! Can you hear me?"
Stop
You know when you're accident prone
Nobody likes you
Wave to a man in a Rolls
'Cause he knows how to live, ha ha
Stop and take the time to stop that smoking
Stop, before that light turns green
You won't be blue
Stop in the name of the law

You know, and I said to myself, what's all this hurry
What's all this hustle and bustle
Why don't I just stop, look at the pretty roses
Smell them for one moment, take the time to see
Take the time to smell, have a good time in life
Don't let everything pass you by, you're only here once
And I've been here longer than most of you
So stop and take the time to buy this album
So I can plant roses and smell them all day long
Stop everything you're doing
Run to your local record shop and say
"Gimme that record called 'Stop'"
I'm going crazy with this record business
I want to stop it, you want me to stop it
