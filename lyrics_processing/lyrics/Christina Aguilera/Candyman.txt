Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman
Hey, hey, yeah, uh

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me workin' up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothin' more dangerous than a boy with charm

He's a one-stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Ooh yeah, yeah-eah

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (For a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline (Oh-oh, oh)

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot (Hit the spot, yeah)
He had lips like sugar cane (Oh)
Good things come for boys who wait
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, Candyman

Squared herself away as she let out a yell
