You know how to read my mind
I'm lost and it's you I find
Rushin' to my side, you hold me tight
I know when to take your hand
I know when you're feelin' bad
Make you feel you can feel like a man

And when you're feelin' blue, I know
You're sad, I'll give you all my love
Cause I know you, yeah I know you
I got your back, I do
Boo you keep me safe from harm
Ooh you take me in your arms
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
You've got telepathy

I've got you and you've got me
Yeah I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy
