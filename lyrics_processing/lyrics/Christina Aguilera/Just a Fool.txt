Uh
Yeah

Another shot of whiskey, please, bartender
Keep it coming 'til I don't remember at all
How bad it hurts when you're gone (Na, na, na, oh)
Turn the music up a little bit louder
Just gotta get past the midnight hour (Uh-huh)
Maybe tomorrow it won't be this hard

Who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

I, I had my heart set on you
But nothin' else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I, waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'd be true (Yeah, yeah)
I'm just a fool
Yeah
You might also like
I say that I don't care and walk away, whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together (Uh-huh)
But that's just me tryna move on without you

But who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

I, I had my heart set on you
But nothin' else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I, waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'd be true (Yeah, yeah)

I'm just a fool for holdin' onto somethin' that's
Never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost
I should've let it go, held my tongue
Kept my big mouth shut
'Cause now everything is just wrong, wrong, wrong
I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I, I had my heart set on you
But nothin' else hurts like you do (Uh)
Who knew that love was so cruel (Yeah, yeah)
Hey, yeah, yeah
I, waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'd be true (Yeah, yeah)

I'm just a fool (Oh, yeah)
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
It's my fault to think you'd be true (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah
