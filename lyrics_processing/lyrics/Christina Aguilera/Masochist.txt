Oh
Ooh

Sometimes I get lonely
I get needy, I call you
I know that it's crazy
That it's stupid, but it's the truth

I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, but

I must be some kind of masochist
To hurt myself in this way
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me, oh
But I just can't walk away

I get all my pleasure
In your bedroom, in your arms
You get all your pleasure
From my torture, from my harm
You might also like
I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, ooh
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, but

I must be some kind of masochist, ooh
To hurt myself in this way
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me, oh
But I just can't walk away, oh

The more I stay in this madness
The more the hurt is my comfort and release
And maybe I'm just too damaged
To really know what's good for me

I should go (I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, oh)
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, ooh

I must be some kind of masochist, oh, yeah
To hurt myself in this way, ooh, yeah
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me, oh
But I just can't walk away, away
And even though it's so obvious, oh (So obvious)
That all you give me is pain, oh
I must be some kind of masochist, oh
'Cause I just can't walk away from you, from you, from you
Oh, I just can't walk away, away
