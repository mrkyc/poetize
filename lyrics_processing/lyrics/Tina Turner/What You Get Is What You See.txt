Some boys just got the look of a Greek Adonis
And some boys just try to talk you off of your feet
Some boys think they're God's gift to woman
And some boys just think they're sweet enough to eat

I change the habit of a lifetime
Don't even try
'Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing
You realize

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

Some guys just got lips that you can't help kissing
(Mwah, mwah, mwah)
And some guys just got a smile you can't resist
Some guys just got to build a reputation
They just wanna add you to the list
You might also like
You got a lot of physical attraction, I can't deny
But can you guarantee me satisfaction?
While, I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Oohhh

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love


So, let me see your cards on the table
Before I buy
I always read the writing on the label
So, give me reason to believe
There's more to you than meets the eye

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love
Ain't nothing more to it
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter at all
I don't want your kind of love
Ain't nothing else to it
I don't want your kind of love, oooohh
