Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and judge all his responses
Having played the mating game
She doesn't waste time 'cause all that she wants is
Real and honest emotion
Ones he can't help but show

I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love

Women who have made mistakes
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed by those manly advances
