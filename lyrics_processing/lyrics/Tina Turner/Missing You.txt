Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long-distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all  (Missing you)
Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you (Missing you)
No matter what I might say (Missing you)

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world, I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
You might also like
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long-distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you (Missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)

There's a message that I'm sending out
Via telegraph to your soul
And if I can't breach this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you (Missing you)
No matter what my friends say (Missing you)

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I can't lie to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you, missing you
I ain't missing you, oh no
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
