He was my lover, he was working undercover
Fella knew all of the moves
He really had me romping, we were barefoot and stomping
He just kept igniting my fuse
He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stockings
He was rocking with an optical illusion
And this ain't how I thought it'd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion

He took me for a ride and rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the Blues, yeah, woo

He never really needed love from any direction, no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier, hook, line, and sinker, y'all
Ju-ju-just too hot to handle

He took me by storm, must have been a season for the fools
So bad, he was an undercover agent for the Blues
Get on, ow
