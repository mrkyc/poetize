I'm talking to the priest
The high priest
And everybody out there in the universe
If what I'm saying is wrong
Then tell me the right way to say it
'Cause I wanna be made over

Paint me red, paint me green
Give me liberty, oh, wash me clean
Make me over, make me nice
'Cause when I'm done, Lord, I wanna be right

Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
(Make me over, I wanna be made over)

Make me smart, make me king
Give a lot, ah, give me steam
I want eternal beauty, spiritual things
'Cause when I'm done, yes, I wanna be a good thing

But in my heart, let beauty reign
