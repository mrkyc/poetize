I'm a new pair of eyes every time I am born
And original mind because I just died
But I'm scanning the horizon for someone recognizing
That I might've been queen
For every sun that sets, there is a new one dawning
For every empire crushed, there is a brand new nation
Let the waters rise, I have ridden each tide
From the gates of the city where the firstborn died

And I might've been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the river won't stop for me
No, the river won't stop for me

I'm a new pair of eyes and original mind
With my senses of old and the heart of a giant
And I'm searching through the wreckage for some re-recollection
That I might have been queen
For every sage that falls, there's an ancient child

And I might've been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the river won't stop for me
No, the river won't stop for me

I look up to the stars with my perfect memory
I look through it all and my future's no shock to me
I look down, but I see no tragedy
I look up to my past, a spirit running free
I look down, I look down and I'm there in history
Oh, I'm a soul survivor

A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river (I might've been queen)
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop (I know the secret combination)
A soul survivor on the river (I might've been queen)
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop (I know the secret combination)
A soul survivor on the river (I might've been queen)
But it won't stop (I know the secret combination)
A soul survivor on the river (I might've been queen)
But it won't stop (I know the secret combination)
A soul survivor on the river (I might've been queen)
