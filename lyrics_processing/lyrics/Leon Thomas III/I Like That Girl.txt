Tell me what should I do
What should I say
I'm lost for words so I'm comin to ya sisters will you
Help me
See I don't know
Where to start
To find the keys to win over a girl's heart

Well they say just remember when your game comes into play (Watcha say)
Gain your composure, some respect, and you'll be okay
Because the ladies will like it when
When you don't succed don't get offened
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend and be
Always there when she needs a friend
So many things about a girl I can't comprehend

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl
Yeah she says that she likes me too
But she's to shy to come talk to me so
I don't know how to make a move
But I want her to be
Mine, mine, mine, mine, yeah
(I want the baby girl to be mine)
You might also like
Is she the one who will give me love (real love)
Love me for me I'm not askin' much
'Cause true love don't come easily
And if it's meant to be it happens naturally
If you don't look for love it might actually find you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like that girl
You know, mommi your the best thing
I ever seen some my way and
I want you to be down with me like I'm with you
Yes you, girl you know you make me go
Ooh, yeah, girl ya got me sayin' Ooh yeah
Ya got me sayin' Ooh yeah
Ya got me sayin' Ooh yeah

Alright, I'm feelin' everything you've been talkin' about
And for her I need to kick the player out
With no doubt it's been runnin' through my mind
I can't believe true love I have found
My world, she's forever
My sunshine, my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
See, love is not about looks or material
But it's meant to heart felt the spirit
I like that girl, yeah
I like that girl
I like that girl, yeah
I like that girl
I like that girl
Aww yeah
