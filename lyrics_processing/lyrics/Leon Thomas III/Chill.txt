Mookie:
Dago, wop, guinea, garlic-breath
Pizza-slingin', spaghetti bending
Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti
Sole Mio, non-singing motherfucker
Pino:
You gold teeth gold chain wearing
Fried chicken and biscuit eating
Monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh
Fast running, high-jumpin', spear chucking
Three hundred and sixty degree basketball dunkin'
Titsun spade Moulan Yan
Take your fuckin' pizza-pizza
And go the fuck back to Africa
Mister Senor Love Daddy:
Yo! Hold up! Time out! TIME OUT!
Y'all take a chill!

I met her on the F train, how ironic
She laid eyes on me and I knew exactly what I wanted
Wanted, Italian maybe Sicilian
Body looking like she was Brazilian
I said what's up, that was enough
Called her name late went and picked her up (ay)
Ooh Ooh, Kill em' naw you ain't playin with em'
Pops looking like you ain't going with em
Naw not tonight

I just wanna chill with the one you love
Maybe one day me and her could fall in love
I just wanna chill with the one you love
Maybe one day me and her could fall in love
She ain't your little girl no more

I don't understand that shit
Can somebody please come and explain that shit
Cuz it blows my mind, all this was way before my time
Hit me with the slam, locked me out
But his baby girl met me at the backdoor
Oh well

I just wanna chill with the one you love
Maybe one day me and her could fall in love
I just wanna chill with the one you love
Maybe one day me and her could fall in love
She ain't your little girl no more

Just take it easy
Just slow down
Just take it easy
Just slow down
Just take it easy
Just slow down
Just take it easy
Just slow down
Just take it easy
