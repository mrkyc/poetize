Gonna be you and me
Gonna be everything you
You ever dreamed
Wanna be you with me
Want to be everything

I believe that if you want something
Bad enough it'll happen in the right time
Now you see baby all I did was pick you up
Now I can call you mine
You're mine, you're mine
Nobody elses nobody, nobody

We was marching on the front lines
When cupid went and chopped us down
Can't get your hands off me now
Hey, hey, hey yeah
Skin tight in a white dress
Looking something like a white flag
I surrender all my love to you now
I surrender

This heart to your hands
This heart to your hands oh
(This heart to your hands)
It's gonna be you and me
You and me till the end
This heart to your hands
This heart to your hands oh
(This heart to your hands)
It's gonna be you and me
You and me till the end
You and me till the end
You might also like
I don't believe everything to the binomial it will happen at the right time
No I don't believe in any you speak me of
Now I can call you mine
You're mine, you're mine, you're mine
Nobody Outs me, nobody, nobody, nobody

We was marching on the front lines
When cupid went and chopped us down
Can't get your hands off me now
Hey, hey, hey yeah
Skin tight in a white dress
Looking something like a white flag
I surrender all my love to you now
I surrender

This heart to your hands
This heart to your hands oh
(This heart to your hands)
It's gonna be you and me
You and me till the end
This heart to your hands
This heart to your hands oh
(This heart to your hands)
It's gonna be you and me
You and me till the end
You and me till the end
No I didn't believe, what I saw
Everything I needed right there
Everything I needed right here
Heart to your hands, this heart to your hands, Oh
