Tuesday, I sing you this song
Wednesday, I bring you a red, red rose
Take you to your favorite spot
Seven days a week, every hour of the month
Gotta let you know where my heart Is coming from
Gotta find a way just to make you see
Gotta find a way just to let you know
I will try everything
To make you come closer to me
And baby till you believe
It's not just a phase
How can I get it through
I'm the one you can't lose
I'll try 365 days, 365 ways
To get to you, oh, oh
To get to you, oh, oh
You say you got me all figured out
Think you can read my mind
Think I'm the type to play around
But baby you've seen the type
Seven days a week, every hour of the month
You're the only one that I really want
Gotta find a way just to make you see
Gotta find a way just to let you know
You might also likeI will try everything
To make you come closer to me
And baby till you believe
It's not just a phase
How can I get it through
I'm the one you can't lose
I'll try 365 days, 365 ways
To get to you, to get to you
Every second, every tick tick of the clock
I want you all to myself
Every single second until my heart stops
I swear there ain't nobody else
Every second, every tick tick of the clock
I want you all to myself
Every single second until my heart stops
I swear there ain't nobody else, oh yeah
I will try everything
To make you come closer to me
Baby till you believe
It's not just a phase
How can I get it through
I'm the one you can't lose
I'll try 365 days, 365 ways
To get to you, to get to you
To get to you, to get to you, yeah, yeah
To get to you, to get to you
