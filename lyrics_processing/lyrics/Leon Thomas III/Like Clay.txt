I wanna be more than those others
I hope that you can call me your friend
Never judge a book by it's cover
Cause I'm stil learning how to be a man

To many toys to play there
To many california barbie dolls
I used to play with em all
So pretty but they fake like plastic
So baby all I'm asking
Is for you to take a chance
Take a chance on me

Girl I'm begging you hoo to mold me
Cause I'm ready and I'm willing girl I'm like clay
Won't you mold me baby
All I want is you hoo to mold me
Cause I'm ready and I'm willing girl I'm like clay
Mold me baby

When it comes to us theres no question
Everything I do revolves around you round you round ya
Girl if your the teacher I need a lesson
Send me heart in the right direction
