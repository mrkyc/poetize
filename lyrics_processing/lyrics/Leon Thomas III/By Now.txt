See, I fell off in September
Let me see what I remember
Fell in love with a shawty, spent it all in October
Turned it up in November
Mated back in December
We made love till the summer, love till the summer
I took off like a rocket, the paper all i was chasing
Started leaving the city
Cashing checks i was making
Stayed up late after ten
Met a girl on vacation
We burn gas like hummer
And that made me wonder, oh oh
I made my mistakes, oh
I knew I should've wait, oh
Left without a warning
Haunted till the morning

I bet he treats her better than I ever did
She always used to talk about a life and kids
I always used to hit her with uninterested
But it kills me to know that she started life with him
Oh, oh ,oh
