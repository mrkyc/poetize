Imma put you on tonight
Got a driver no D.U.I
Got gone in the escalade
Text her "Doors here we on our way"(on our way)
Walk right to the front, No checking I.D
I could do what I want, cuz they all know me
You could do what you want
You could do what you want
Since you wanna hit the floor
Since you wanna hit the floor

I can't tell if you just wanna dance
I can't tell if you just wanna dance
Or do you wanna go home with me
Or do you wanna go home with me
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home

(Flume "Holdin On")
Can tame you lose, no, no!
Cause I need all the joy you bring, oh!
Hey, I can't let you go with nobody
Cause I love you baby, yes I do!
You might also like
We better skip the after party
Cuz you can't keep your hands off of me,me,me
So keep on dancin like you ain't got nothing on
And imma put you right where you supposed to be
Where you supposed to be, where you supposed to be
Where you supposed to be, where you supposed to be
Where you supposed to be, where you supposed to be
Where you supposed to be, where you supposed to be

I can't tell if you just wanna dance
I can't tell if you just wanna dance
Or do you wanna go home with me
Or do you wanna go home with me
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
She dancin' on me like she wanna go home
