Aye, what you, what you sayin'?
Girl, why you, why you playin'?
Uh, you know, I plan on staying
Skip work in the morning
Aye, you're the only one I see now
Aye, you the only one I take out
I've been focused on this check
Getting all that I can get
But I found my way to you somehow

Don't you go to far from me
Every fiction you draw got me feelin' complete

Never felt this kind of love
I'm addicted to your touch
Just a little's not enough
Cause you're my, you're my, you're my favorite
Uh, favorite place to be, I'm for you, you're just for me
And I say just what I mean
Cause you're my, you're my, you're my favorite

Girl, you know your body is amazing
Everything I need, I'm not complaining
Girl, you got the thing that I've been chasing, waiting for
Aye, give me more, give me more of that good good
Every night, every night on that doorstep
Aye, say tryna hit and lick, tryna get a fix, ooh, ooh
You might also like
So, don't you go too far from me
Every fiction you draw got me feelin' complete

Never felt this kind of love
I'm addicted to your touch
Just a little's not enough
Cause you're my, you're my, you're my favorite
Favorite place to be, I'm for you, you're just for me
And I say just what I mean
Cause you're my, you're my, you're my favorite

Girl, you know you've got me, girl, you know you've got me
Double-tapping every picture you've been posting lately
Girl your love's explosive and it got me losing focus
You're my favorite type of drug and I've been overdosing
Every time that you callin', girl, you know you've got me falling
Ain't no time to be frontin', go and knock it off
Yeah, I know you love me, you're the one and
Only woman that I want, if it ain't you then I'll be all alone

So don't you go too far from me, no, no, no, no
Now we rolling and rolling and smoking on weed
Never felt this kind of love
I'm addicted to your touch
Just a little's not enough
Cause you're my, you're my, you're my favorite
Favorite place to be, I'm for you, you're just for me
And I say just what I mean
