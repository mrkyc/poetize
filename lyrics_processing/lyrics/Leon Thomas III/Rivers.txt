Babe, you know I love you more
Babe, Babe

Never thought I'd say this
But i'm glad you made me wait
On a desert walking one wish
To bath in a pool you promised babe

At first I thought it was a mirage
So close I could touch
Your breath was on my skin
My blood beginning to rush
I don't wanna talk too much
Let my body sing to you

I say, river I want to taste all of you
I want to drink it all
I want to slam right into your, into your
River, I want to taste all of you
I want to drink it all
I want to slam into your, into your
You might also like
So deep I had to dive in
Drowned right in the moment
You know how bad I wanted it
And no i'm not afraid to show it, show it

At first I thought it was a mirage
So close I could touch
Your breath was on my skin
My blood beginning to rush
I don't wanna talk too much
Let my body sing to you

I say, river I want to taste all of you
I want to drink it all
I want to slam right into your, into your
River, I want to taste all of you
I want to drink it all
I want to slam into your, into your

Wandering through city streets
The hustle of nomadic discoveries
And subway stops, I hear saxophones
Crying rivers blues
And broken souls, beggars hats once fit suits
Dressed in all black at funerals
Where eulogy reads and Brooklyn boys reason for living
I journey to you, vagabond missions
Suitcased in windy nights, and early mornings
I wander to wonder, and I fell asleep by you
And everything I was hoping to discover I heard your tears
