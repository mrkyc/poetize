Here's a letter to my ex
I wish you the best
And there's alotta things I gotta get up off my chest
I'm movin to the next
Life with no regrets
Cause when I'm with you girl , I'm not at my best

I know I should have called
But I didn't wana make it hard
I know how you get when you mad
So I painted how I feel on this pen and pad

Baby by the time you get this ill already be gone , I
Be gone
Couldn't say it to ya face so I had to write it down in
This song
Ooo I'm movin' on , I'm movin' on
Without you
I'm movin' on , I'm movin' on
Without you

I know how you get when you mad
So I painted how I feel on this pen and pad

Baby by the time you get this ill already be gone , I

Couldn't say it to ya face so I had to write it down in
This song
Ooo I'm movin' on , I'm movin' on
Without you
I'm movin' on , I'm movin' on
Without you

No part of me wants to say good-bye in the beginning of
This sentence
(No part of me wants to say good-bye in the beginning
Of this sentence)

This song
