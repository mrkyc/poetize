Forewarned, my audience leaves the stage
Floating ahead perfumed shift
Within the stammering silence
The face that launched a thousand frames
Betrayed by a porcelain tear, a stained career
You've played this scene before, you've played this scene before
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye
A misplaced reaction, reaction
The darkroom unleashes imagination in pornographic images
In which you will always be the star
Untouchable, unapproachable, constant in the darkness
Nursing an erection, a misplaced reaction
With no flower to place before this gravestone
And the walls become enticingly newspaper thin
But that would only be developing the negative view
And you have to be exposed in voyeuristic colour
The public act, let you model your shame
On the mannequin catwalk, catwalk
Let the cats walk, and the cat walks
I've played this scene before, I've played this scene before
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye
A misplaced reaction, satisfaction
You might also like(A debilitating speck of doubt that came from absolutely nowhere)
You can't brush me under the carpet
You can't hide me under the stairs
The custodian of your private fears
Your leading actor of yesteryear
Who as you crawled out of the alleys of obscurity
Sentenced to rejection in the morass of anonymity
You who I directed with a lover's will
You who I let hypnotise the lens
You who I let bathe in the spotlight's glare
You who wiped me from your memory like a greasepaint mask
Just like a greasepaint mask
But now I'm the snake in the grass
The ghost of film reels past
I'm the producer of your nightmare
And the performance has just begun
It's just begun
Your perimeter of courtiers jerk like celluloid puppets
As you stutter, paralysed, with rabbit's eyes
Searing the shadows, flooding the wings
To pluck elusive salvation from the understudy's lips
Retrieve the soliloquy, maintain the obituary
My cue line in the last act
And you wait in silent solitude
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt
Waiting for the prompt
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt
Waiting for the prompt
