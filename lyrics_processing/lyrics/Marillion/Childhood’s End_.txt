And I found myself mourning for a childhood
That I thought had disappeared
I looked out the window
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow
The rain had gone
I'm not alone, I turned to the mirror
I saw you, the child, that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart that I believed was lost
Hey you, surprised? More than surprised
To find the answers to the questions
Were always in your own eyes
Do you realise that you could have gone back to her?
But that would only be retracing all the problems that you ever knew
So untrue
For she's got to carry on with her life
And you've got to carry on with yours
So I see it's me, I can do anything
And I'm still the child
'Cause the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found direction
There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
You are my childhood friend
'Cause you are my childhood friend
Oh, lead me on
You might also likeHey you, you've survived
Now you've arrived
To be reborn in the shadow of the magpie
Now you realise, that you've got to get out of here
You've found the leading light of destiny, burning in the ashes of your memory
You want to change the world
You'd resigned yourself to die a broken rebel
But that was looking backward
Now you've found the light
You, the child that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart that I believed was lost
So it's me I see
I can do anything, I'm still the child
'Cause the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found direction
There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
I am your childhood friend
