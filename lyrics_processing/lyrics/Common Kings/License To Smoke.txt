What a wonderful feeling
Headed to the doctor with a smile on my face
Please believe that I've been waiting half a lifetime
To see my name on that card
Yeah, we struggled so hard
Police they wanna lock us up, eh eh eh
Maybe just a week ago, not today-eh-eh
Don't mind standing in the line
Now is just about the nick of time
'Til I can ease my mind, burning legally
Feels so good to say
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke, ohh eh eh
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Roll it up and light it, pass it to my people
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody 'cause I'm legal
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Everybody say yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Ooh la la la
Yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Eyes are closed when you see my picture
What a wonderful feeling
Speeding up the block to the local dispenser
Please believe that I've been waiting half a lifetime
To see my name on this card
Yeah, we struggled so hard
Police they wanna lock us up, eh eh eh
Maybe just a week ago, not today-eh-eh
It feels good to say
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke, ohh eh eh
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Roll it up and light it, pass it to my people
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody 'cause I'm legal
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Everybody say yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Ooh la la la
Yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Don't mind standing in the line
Certain that it's worth my time
Gonna ease my mind, burning legally
Feels so good to say
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke, ohh eh eh
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Roll it up and light it, pass it to my people
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody 'cause I'm legal
I got my license to smoke
Yeah, I got my license to smoke
Everybody say yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Ooh la la la
Yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Everybody say yeah-eh eh-eh-eh
Ooh la la la
