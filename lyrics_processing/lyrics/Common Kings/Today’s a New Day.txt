When it feels like
All you had was yesterday
Don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout today
Might not believe me
But trust me when I say
Today's a new day, new day
New day

It's a new day, and a new way
Don't let the past control the path that's here today
No more problems, need more solutions
Take your guidance, let the righteous lead the way
Ohhh yeah yaaah
Oh, I was lost but now I'm found
Oh, cause every king deserves a crown
Oh, no they're not gon' bring us down, down, down, no

When it feels like
All you had was yesterday
Don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout today
Might not believe me
But trust me when I say
Today's a new day, throw your broken crown away
Today's a new day
A new day, new day, new day

Baby it's a new day
Lets go make a movie
But before when we gon' turn up
Lets take a moment to tune in
Yesterday was rough and i woke up needing a mood change
So lets change the sun and end the night we'll do a moon dance
See I got the blueprints they just got a few twists
I could take you there but first we might just need a few drinks
Probably be crazy not to go ahead and lose pace
By the time its over you'll be sipping on a cool aid
(Lets go)
Feeling its a new day, new dawn, new horizon, sun shining
They be tryna find me I was stuck out on that island
But I started smoking signals with my people and the shaman
Walking on the clouds looking for that silver lining
I just want to fast forward, yesterday was frightening
Today is gon' be all mine, the other guys forgotten
We just keep on rocking, cause ain't no other option
When you roll with kings and queens better days are quite common

When it feels like
All you had was yesterday (yesterday)
But don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout today ('bout today)
Might not believe me
But trust me when I say
Today's a new day, throw your broken crown away
When it feels like
All you had was yesterday (yesterday)
Don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout today ('bout today)
Might not believe me
But trust me when I say
Today's a new day, throw your broken crown away
Today's a new day, a new day
New day, new day (new day)

I was lost but now I'm found
Cause every king deserves a crown
No they're not gon' bring us down no way
Today's a new day, a new day, new day (new day)
Today's a new day so throw your broken crown away (new day)
