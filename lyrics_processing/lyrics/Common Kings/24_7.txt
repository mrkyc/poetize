I wanna take you home
But I find you at home
And nobody needs to know
I'll give you all my love

No one can deny your flavor
Baby girl you taste so good to me
I know you love it when I go harder
You tell me what you want
You beg me not to slow down
Bring me back up
I'll go downtown
Come back around, ay
But no one does it quite like you, babe
Yeah, you're like an animal night and day
Your lovin' gets me oh so crazy
You tell me what you want
You beg me not to slow down
Bring you back up
When you go down come back around
You get me so high, never feel tired
And I love what you doin' to me

I wanna be with you twenty-four seven
Your love is like my heaven
The birds and the bees ain't got nothin' on your lovin', ooh-woah
You make me wanna, ooh-woah
I wanna be with you twenty-four seven
Your love is like my heaven
The birds and the bees ain't got nothin' on your lovin', ooh-woah
You make me wanna, ooh-woah

Never come down, and I love what you doin' to me

Your love is like my heaven
The birds and the bees ain't got nothin' on your lovin', ooh-woah
