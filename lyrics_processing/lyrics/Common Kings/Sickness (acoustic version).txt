I get the sniffles when I'm with you
My nose drips down it's a pretty ugly picture
Mucinex ain't the best but I'll take it
Listen to my chest, mama knows I can't fake it, no
I've never felt like this before
Somebody call the doctor 'cause my throat is getting sore
You're just a tissue for my issues
But I love the way I feel when I'm with you
So I say

Doctor doctor help me see
Is she really good for me
Would she make it hard to breathe
Or clear my chest completely
When she holds me I feel fine
I'm too scared to call her mine
I'd love to love her
All the time

But she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
I said she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
You might also like
Somebody go and call for help
This lovin' might be good but it may affect my health
I ain't got time for no drugs
So give it to me straight
Girl is this really love, love?
She got me wrapped around her finger
Feelin' apathetic 'cause I know I'm gonna linger
And I'm a mess it's true
But I could blame it all on you
So I say

Doctor doctor help me see
Is she really good for me
Would she make it hard to breathe
Or clear my chest completely
When she holds me I feel fine
But I'm too scared to call her mine
I'd love to love her
All the time

But she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
I said she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
But she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
I said she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
I said she kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
Aye aye aye aye aye
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
