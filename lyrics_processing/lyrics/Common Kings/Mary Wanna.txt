Up in the clouds I got you on my mind
Roll down the windows with you by my side
Floating like Lucy's diamond in the sky
Way up, way up
Don't let me down you're the cure for my pain
You're my prescription when I see your face
You got me dreaming when I'm wide awake
Way up, way up

I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling all my life
I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling every night

Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna make you fall in love tonight
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna show you how to dance tonight
Feels so good when you're around
I wanna show the world what you're all about
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna make you fall in love tonight
You might also like
When I got you with me through the highs and lows
All of my problems they go up in smoke
There ain't no way that I'm letting you go
Oh no, oh no

I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling all my life
I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling every night

Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna make you fall in love tonight
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna show you how to dance tonight
Feels so good when you're around
I wanna show the world what you're all about
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna make you fall in love tonight

I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling all my life
I've been waiting for this feeling
I've been waiting for this feeling every night
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna make you fall in love tonight
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
Mary wanna show you how to dance tonight
Feels so good when you're around
I wanna show the world what you're all about
Ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya...
