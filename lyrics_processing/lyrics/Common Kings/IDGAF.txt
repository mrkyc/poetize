Yeah man

Spacin out of class, I knew it wouldn't last
I'm so over this damn day
Want to quit my job cause I hate my fuckin boss
I know it's five o'clock someplace
Yeah, someday, when I'm a little sober
I think of all the things that I'ma be when I get older
But now I do what I want
And if you think I care, I'm tellin you

I don't give a fuck anymore (I don't give a fuck)
How could I care that much about it, girl? (I just don't give a fuck)
I'm not begging for your love, so I throw my deuces up
Cause I don't give a fuck anymore, no
Ladadeedadadadada Ladadeedadadada
Ladadeedadadadada Ladadeedada

Rollin out of bed and weavin, askin for my head
When my girl wakes up and says, "I'm into chicks now (yes)
I'm leavin you for your ex." (Oh, what? Can I watch? No. Bitch.)
Speedin down the road, bumpin Justin Bieber, laughing to myself
Cause I really didn't need her (singing baby, baby)
I do what I want, and if you think I care, I'm tellin' you

Cause I don't give a fuck anymore, no
