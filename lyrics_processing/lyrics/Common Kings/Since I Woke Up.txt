You've been living on my mind since I woke up, yeay
Ay what's the matter with me, man
I've been thinking about what to do
Like you've put voodoo on me, man
'Bout to make me break all my rules
Like calling you
Never call a person more than one time
How can you?
Never want to let you out of my sight
It's driving me mad now
You're such a distraction now
That's a good problem now
I say
Now you left here just a few hours ago
And it's crazy but I'm wanting you some more
'Cause you put it down like a professional, yeah
I've been wanting you since I woke up, yeah
You've been living on my mind since I woke up, yeay
Yeah like when the sun rise, I rise
I need you by my side
Darling when I wake up
Yeah ever since I woke up
I've been missing you since I woke up up up, ooieoo
You might also likeYou've got a whole lot of nerve
Yeah coming round here, turning up
It's like I slept in the gate yard
Still sweating, got me burning up, hey
Already sound down, when I used to be on my balance
Turned down, ready for any challenge
It's driving me mad now
You're such a distraction now
That's a good problem now
I say
Now you left here just a few hours ago
And it's crazy but I'm wanting you some more
'Cause you put it down like a professional, yeah
I've been wanting you since I woke up, yeah
You've been living on my mind since I woke up, yeay
Yeah like when the sun rise, I rise
I need you by my side
Darling when I wake up
Yeah ever since I woke up
I've been missing you since I woke up up up, ooeioo
Woke up, up, up, ooeioo
