Speaking my language
Reading each others lips don't need a sound
Two hearts together beating loud
Never lost in translation
Like we're on a vacation
Understand each other so clearly now
You're speaking my language hear me out
Don't no need no Rosetta Stone no
No need no interpreter no
Ain't nothing you can show me
I read your mind, you live on mine
No need to spell it out oh no
No need to yell it out oh no
Yeah you already know me
You read my mind, don't take no time
It's like you were made for me
It's like you're a dream that came true
When you're up under me
I can't get over what you do
Speaking my language
Speaking my language
Reading each others lips don't need a sound
Two hearts together beating loud
Never lost in translation
Like we're on a vacation
Understand each other so clearly now
You're speaking my language hear me out
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Don't need no GPS map no
You know just where to go oh
Like the sun knows the morning
Like the moon knows your yawning
Never need no rehearsal
We stay on a commercial
Ain't no too many warning
Don't matter where we performing
It's like you were made for me
It's like you're a dream that came true
When you're up under me
I can't get over what you do
Speaking my language
Speaking my language
Reading each others lips don't need a sound
Two hearts together beating loud
Never lost in translation
Like we're on a vacation
Understand each other so clearly now
You're speaking my language hear me out
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
Oh wee ooh
