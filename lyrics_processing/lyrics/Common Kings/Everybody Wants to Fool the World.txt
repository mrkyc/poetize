I have these visions inside my head
Late night leading to no regrets
Electrical eating up my chest
Can't get no rest
Can't get no rest
No

I've been through lovers and liars
I want them
Jump into the water
My blue blood racing like fire
Like fire
Oh

Everybody wants to fool the world
Sell yourself short for a taste of fame
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
I just want real love
I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
You might also like
I stand alone underneath the night
All these sirens and city lights
I dream of you when I close my eyes
When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes
No

I've been all over searching for someone
And you are the one
I'll do what it takes
Drop of a dime
Be my summer tum
I've been all over searching for someone
And you are the one
I'll do what it takes
Drop of a dime
Be my summer tum

Everybody wants to fool the world
Sell yourself short for a taste of fame
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
I just want real love
I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
I've been all over searching for someone
And you are the one
I'll do what it takes
Drop of a dime
Be my summer tum
I've been all over searching for someone
And you are the one
I'll do what it takes
Drop of a dime
Be my summer tum
I just wanna be loved
I want that real love

Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
Everybody wants to fool the world
But I just wanna be loved
I want that real love
I just real love
I just wanna be loved
