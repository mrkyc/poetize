Want you to love me before you leave
Let me hold you before you go
Just remember the time we shared
And remember you touched my soul
We don't know where life will take us
I'll hold my breath and be patient
So won't you love me before you leave

Every moment with you
Pretty perfect for me
And baby you're telling me that we could never be
And now I'm like
Cool it down, cool it down, take a minute
You say you have to go
But yesterday your heart was in it
My love
Oh woah
Let me say what I need to say

Want you to love me before you leave
Let me hold you before you go
Just remember the times we shared
And remember you touched my soul
We don't know where life will take us
I'll hold my breath and be patient
So won't you love me before you leave
And let me hold you before you
Go oh woah, oh woah
Let me hold you before you
Go oh woah, oh woah
You might also like
Don't forget what we got
No it can't be replaced
One moment we're holding hands
And you leave without a trace
It's got me like
Cool it down, cool it down
Take a minute

But yesterday your heart was in it
My love
Oh woah oh
Let me say what I need to say

Want you to love me before you leave
Let me hold you before you go
Just remember the times we shared
And remember you touched my soul

I'll never get over your baby blue eyes
