Got that rope-a-dope, undisputed half a pound
Everywhere you turn up yeah you shut it down
Ain't no competition, you stand out the crowd
You keep 'em coming now, got 'em goin' crazy
You try to run the game, you like "no way, no "
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Everybody sweating, feeding off your energy
Just givin' compliments and tryin' to patronize
It's like you heaven sent, angel in disguise
Pop them presidents, you an enterpriser
Put my right hand on the bible, I'ma testify ya
You give the baddest one a run for their money
Ay ay, whoa oh oh
Independent, always run for that money
Ay ay, whoa oh
You're so cold, but the temperature rise
Got your head on high
Oh my, you're still winning now
Give the baddest one a run for their money
Ay ay, whoa oh oh
Got your own bread, don't need nobody
It's  in the building and it ain't a party
A beast in them streets like you on a Harley
Stay burning on the spliffs like you Bob Marley
