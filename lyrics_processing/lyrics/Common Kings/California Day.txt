Just another California Day
Out here on the West Coast
We got all these High Hopes
Rollin up a new one, Purple Haze
Floating out the window
On Pacific Time tho
3 Little Birds
On the radio
All of them worries
Gotta let 'em go
Just another California Day
Ay ay ay ay, ay ay ay ay

Woke up and I roll a little something
Day in the life of the King of the Summer
Can't forget that I came from nothing
Baby got back but she always frontin
Cruisin down PCH
Till I hit the promenade
Hit the dispensary
These prerolls got me feelin alright
Ain't no hijacking my vibe
Cali girls all on my mind
Cuties all in my DMs
They love my flow like the tide
Palms trees and the weed not soso
Type a scene make a beggar go loco
Skinny jeans crop top cuz she solo
Shwayze Common Kings in your Sonos
You might also like
Sand in my shoes
What's the meaning of life
High as a kite
Oh yeah we'll be alright

Ay ay ay ay, ay ay ay ay

Yeah!
Cali days
Cali babes
I'm in my Cali ways
Imma catch some Cali rays in my Calvin Ks
Yoga posin
Namaste
Hell no Satan
Not today
She surf n turf
I wake n bake
She all up in the Shwayze days
Bring it back
Boomerang
Girl you know you bad
Braid my hair
In the trap
She look like Doja Cat
High hopes for a living
Ass so fat need a first place ribbon
Life's so good so I ain't really trippin
I smoke weed and make tunes for a livin
Sand in my shoes
What's the meaning of life
High as a kite
Oh yeah we'll be alright
