Your love's a game
There's no control
You show me things
I can't ignore
Focus to the point that I just
See only you
We mix and we match
So back and forth
You play it tough
I play it cool
Love the way you look at me when
I'm fussing with you

I get helpless when you act like that
When you act like that
Turns me on when you fight back, yeah
When you act like that
You push me to the point I can't help but keep my hands off you
And now I

I want it all
And I can't help that
Can't take it off
Keep me coming back
I want it all
Like a maniac
Let's get crazy
We'll be dancing with our clothes off
You might also likeI want it all
Won't you shake like that?
Just take it off
Watch how I'll react
I want it all
Way to make you wet
Let me get it, get it
I can't get enough of you

Ooh I'm a boss
You see the joes
I like the 
You know the rules
Oh don't make me put up on ya
And read you your rights
Take off your mask
I know the truth
You  the flag
I'll give you the move
I know you want it
Ain't that the truth?

I get helpless when you act like that
When you act like that
Turns me on when you fight back, yeah
When you act like that
You push me to the point I can't help but keep my hands off you
And now I
 x2
I want it all
And I can't help that
Can't take it off
Keep me coming back
I want it all
Like a maniac
Let's get crazy
We'll be dancing with our clothes off
I want it all
Won't you shake like that?
Just take it off
Watch how I'll react
I want it all
Way to make you wet
Let me get it, get it
