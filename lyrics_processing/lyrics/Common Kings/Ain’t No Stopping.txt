Woke up in the morning
Finding the glory might slip away
Cause I'm on the horizon
Spending my life in the passing lane
Driving down this road can take its toll, take its toll, yeah
There's no slowing down once you get into this zone

So talk to me, talk to me
Walk with me, walk with me
We ain't picking up this pace
Talk to me, talk to me
Walk with me, walk with me
Listen to me say

We're going in
Not going out
Yeah getting loud
Yeah cause there ain't no stopping now
We're going up
Not going down
Yeah cause there ain't no stopping
Woah-oh
Straight through the sunrise
Never see a brake light
Woah-oh, yeah
There ain't no stopping now
