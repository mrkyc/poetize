Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah, you got that one-two punch
Knockin' me out, I'm done
Nothin' else that I'm wantin'
When it's you that I'm touchin'
I've been layin' in my bed
With nothin' but you in my head
Singin', "Isn't she lovely?" (Isn't she lovely?)
Rollin' in my sheets

Thinkin', oh, it's easy to decide
'Cause you treat me, treat me right
More than afternoon delight

Yeah, you got me here ignorin'
My phone ringin' in the mornin'
There's just no leavin' your boom-boom-boom-bop
Hittin' the spot
Yeah, you got me burnin' all my sick days up
Say my throat hurts
Cough when I call in, never felt worse
Really, I'm feelin' the boom-boom-boom-bop
Hittin' the spot
Yeah, you got me burnin' all my sick days up

Never wanna hit the road
Even if I know I gotta go
I'm stayin' in all day
Ridin' on your waves
Why you gotta make it so hard?
Ain't no stoppin' once we start
Holdin' in my breath
Yeah, you go straight to my head

Thinkin', oh, it's easy to decide
'Cause you treat me, treat me right
More than afternoon delight

Yeah, you got me here ignorin'
My phone ringin' in the mornin'
There's just no leavin' your boom-boom-boom-bop
Hittin' the spot
Yeah, you got me burnin' all my sick days up
Say my throat hurts
Cough when I call in, never felt worse
Really, I'm feelin' the boom-boom-boom-bop
Hittin' the spot
Yeah, you got me burnin' all my sick days up
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
