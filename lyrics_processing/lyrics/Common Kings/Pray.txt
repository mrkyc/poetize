Send your blessing down to this block
Coming from the bottom
Just tryna make my way to the top
Many men try but
Many few triumph
Many do riot
Stay close to my enemy every chance I pray
See me through trial
With the eye of a lion
Beautiful Zion
Put my hands together so I can
Pray for a better day
Hope for a better way
Come soon find a better place
I pray
When it's all good they be all around
When it goes bad they're nowhere to be found
Looking for your faith, they don't miss a doubt
Oh I pray
Yeah I pray
Yeah... I pray
Yeah... I pray
Through the fire
Will you guard my soul
Through the wire
Keep my on my toes
Yeah I'm willing to make a sacrifice
(Oh Lord)
Whatever it takes to pray upon my life (yeah)
And I pray for a better day
Hope for a better way
Come soon find a better place
I pray
When it's all good they be all around
When it goes bad they're nowhere to be found
Looking for your faith, they don't miss a doubt
Oh I pray
Yeah I pray
Yeah... I pray
Yeah...
