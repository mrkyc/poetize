Something about flipping out of the radar and I'm gone, whoa oh oh oh
Cause I need a break from the days that are tripping at my soul, whoa oh oh oh
And I don't need a reason to tell you why I'm leaving
Take me to paradise
So put me on a jet plane
And pack up my bags, ain't no turning back
Grab a quick pair of cheap shades
I'm losing the sight what goes in my head
If you need me I'll be gone
Left my phone plugged in at home
Said I'm higher than the sun
You ain't got to be alone
I'll be staying poolside
Sipping on that good life
Smoking up the good vibes
In the summer time
If you need me I'll be gone
Lost in paradise
Para dah ah ah ah ise
Dah ah ah ah ise
Palm tree sway, while Alabama stress away, I'm feeling gold, whoa oh oh oh oh
And I don't need a reason to tell you why I'm leaving
Find me in paradise
Changed my ticket to a one way
And pack up my bags, ain't no turning back
Grab a quick pair of cheap shades
I'm losing the sight what goes in my head
If you need me I'll be gone
Left my phone plugged in at home
Said I'm higher than the sun
You ain't got to be alone
I'll be staying poolside
Sipping on that good life
Smoking up the good vibes
In the summer time
If you need me I'll be gone
Lost in paradise
Para dah ah ah ah ise
Dah ah ah ah ise
Para dah ah ah ah ise
Dah ah ah ah ise
Changed my ticket to a one way
And pack up my bags, ain't no turning back
Grab a quick pair of cheap shades
I'm losing the sight what goes in my head
If you need me I'll be gone
Left my phone plugged in at home
Said I'm higher than the sun
You ain't got to be alone
I'll be staying poolside
Sipping on that good life
Smoking up the good vibes
In the summer time
If you need me I'll be gone
Lost in paradise
Para dah ah ah ah ise
Dah ah ah ah ise
Para dah ah ah ah ise
