I can say I love you about a thousand times
Tell me, what does that mean
If I'm not here when you need me, yeah
I can say I miss you about a thousand times
Tell me, what does that mean
If I don't answer your calls at night, yeah
And I could be with anybody else, babe
But I wanna make this moment last with you

And I don't wanna be just another lover in your life
No significance and you could have been with anybody else right now
Am I just another lover in your life
Cause I don't wanna be, baby I just wanna be here at the end of the ride, alright (ohhh)

I could lay and kiss you until the end of time
Baby, what does that mean if I'm kissin' somebody else
I could stay right her and talk to you all night
Baby, what does that mean if I'm not listening, yeah
And I could be with anybody else babe
But I wanna make this moment last with you

No significance and you could have been with anybody else right now
Am I just another lover in your life
Cause I don't wanna be, baby I just wanna be here at the end of the ride, alright (ohhh, ohhh)
