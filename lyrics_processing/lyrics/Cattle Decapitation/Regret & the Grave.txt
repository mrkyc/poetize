What have you done?
Of all the things we've learned from ripping off this earth
The quantities were met and indirectly led to death
In the factories
Teeming with ripe disease
And on your bended knees you took it like a man!
Regret rears its despicable head
All those years of ingesting the dead
Living your life with your hands painted red
Gross remorse
In this the final hour
Now that you see what you've done
The cancelled check of life and its bitter taste of dung
The stress of consciousness
In distress and blessing yourself with death
Wolves use their cunning and stalk in the night
We use machinery to exhibit destructive might
They've only the skills adapt for taking their kill
We hide behind the steel and are slaves to our will

And by your product your insides eaten!
Quite ironic, don't you think?
What have we done?
We've let the foolish taint the air and land!
Of all the things we've learned from ripping off this earth
Plastic and mass created sewer spewing humanure
In the factories
Teeming with ripe disease
And on your bended knees you took it like a man!
Gross remorse
In this the final hour
Now that we see what we've done
The cancelled check of life and its bitter taste of dung
The stress of consciousness
Death obsessed and making a mess
Wolves use their cunning and stalk in the night
We hide like cowards, with machines to magnify our sight
They've only the skills ever evolving to kill
We hide behind the steel and are slaves to our will
You, the consumer now consumed
And by your product you will wither away!
And I don't remember us starving to death
And I can't recall suffering through it all
They've shown me some things that I'll never forget
And I'll remind you when you're on your death bed
This is the grave, this is regret (this is the grave, this is regret)
This is the grave, this is regret
Look at this hell!
Look what you've done!
In this the final hour
Now that you see what you've done
The cancelled check of life and its bitter taste of dung
In the factories
Amidst the rats and fleas
