That weekend Shenanigans
That's that we spending time not money
It's that weekend shenanigans
Err - err so-somebody bring me a drink
Shenanigans, it's that weekend
Turn me up

I just wanna
Sip Bombay with this bomb bae
Then get laid
I just wanna
Take shots of the Smirnoff, just to get thirst off
Cause we ain't, so say you wanna turn up liquor
Tryna break you off kit-kat no snickers
So I can put you on somethin' new
Oh this how I do

Ooo girl I'm tellin you something
You're never ever ever gonna wanna let go
Only thing you'll ever really wanna do is me
I've tapped onto me
All these girls
But you're the one I'm messing with tonight
It's going up
But dowwwwnn
You might also like
Can I lick you up and down till you say stop
And let me
Play with your body baby make you real hot
Can I show you all the things I wanna show ya
It's your choice to the stage baby
Your bet is so full, oh yeah
That weekend shenanigans
That weekend shenanigans
It's that weekend shenanigans
That weekend shenanigans

Oh yeah
I came through stunning with a bad bitch
Bad bitches staying with it, nah they average
She don't broke up with a man on a weekday
So I told her hit me up on a weekend
Tell me what you want are you liking what you see
Three answers she told me it was me
And you feel me
You wanna get it on no stress, no shame
If you feel the same way

We could hit it till the morning
That's what I can yeah I don't second guess
Say it then I'm on it
My egos at an all time high doing more than getting fly
I just spent two month in Europe
Now I'm fuckin with them euros
That I made a little bank and I brought it all back
Took it to the exchange and I doubled up my stacks
Think I'm in a good lane and I tell my baby
Can I lick you up and down
Till you say stop (bring it back now)
Let me play with your body baby make you real hot
Can I show you all the things I wanna show ya
It's your choice to the stage baby
Your bet is so full
Oh yeah
That weekend shenanigans
That weekend shenanigans
It's that weekend shenanigans
That weekend shenanigans

We can go all night till we see the sunlight
Oh we can go all night till we see the sunlight
Oh we can go all night till we see the sunlight
