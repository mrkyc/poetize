Do you believe in me?
When I tell you I don't love these hoes because you're the one I need
And you can be thousand miles away, but that's just how it's gon' be
All the money on this Earth couldn't matter nahh
But so I gotta know baby and I'm like girl
Do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me?
Girl,do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me?

Imma hood me down when shit hits the fan
And all these other hoes be mad that they can't do what you can
And that's on me, and that's on my life, even if I do wrong, you always do right, and that's on me, and that's on everything
You the type I'd give a wedding ring
And I ain't worried bout these hoes
Because they be acting usual
I'll guess you they basic that's why they can't say shit
I said ride with me she gon' do it
All my bullshit mahn she been through it
All my (?) Mahn she seen through it
So I got one question I gotta ask

Do you believe in me?
When I tell you I don't love these hoes because you're the one that I need
And you can be thousand miles away but that's just how it's gon'be
All the money on this Earth couldn't matter nahh
But so I gotta know baby and I'm girl
Do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me?
Girl, do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me?
What's love without trust, what's trust without love?
You trust when I turn way up in the club?
When I'm on tour, girls lustin for us, but I never let hoes come between us
If I fell off tomorrow,would you still love me?
Goin world tour, would you still trust me?
I need me a girl who one a bad as me
A trap queen whip workin baggin up with me
Who grinds without sleep, who ride when this heat, who's down when I'm low, n up when I need, a girl in them streets, a freak in them sheets,
Who ain't with them lames, Horizon on me now,
If I had to go would you leave with me?
Set life goals and achieve with me?
And try to be a man that you need for me
I just need to know one thing girl

Do you believe in me?
When I tell you I don't love these hoes because you're the one that I need?
And you can be thousand miles away but that's just how's it gon' be
All the money on this Earth couldn't matter nahh
But so I gotta know baby and I'm like girl
Do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me girl?
Do you trust me when I'm not around?
On tour and out of town, and now, would you still have love for me?
