When I came, home last night
My lady try start a fight
Soon as I stepped inside
She said where the fuck you been all night
She called 5 times
But I never heard the phone ring I
Don't know oh why
You be on me like the police
(Pre-Chorus)
So I lay my baby down (down)
She said who I been around ('round)
You lookin' at me all crazy
But I bet I can make you smile
(Chorus)
She Mad
She Angry
And she hate me
Until she got that lovin' girl
And she need me
And she want me
Cos' I got that lovin'

When we get that lovin'
And when we get that touchin'
When she get that lovin'
