I see he don't say
What you working with?
You got that forsake
You got perks and shit
You stay on your job
You's a working bitch
Nine to five you work hard for it
He buy you purses
But you I just want some of this time
So it's just worthless
And they probably thinking that it's fine
But his time is up and it's stuck and it's over now
So if you come my way I will show you how

I can treat you better, keep me in your pocket like a beretta
Man down you got me shot, shot
All of the above
'Cause I never thought that I would be in love
I can treat you better, keep me in your pocket like a beretta
All of the above
'Cause I never thought that I would be in love

Got painted a perfect picture and nothing less with you
Getting checks with you baby sex with you is all we do

I left the game and that's when you came in
Gotta make a confession
Damn I don't know what to do but to sing about you
Cause hell yeah my baby you's a blessing
So if I'm bout to say it then I better say all
I'mma be the one to catch you whenever you fall
'Cause this time is over now
So if you come my way I will show you how

Man down you got me shot, shot
