It's time to surrender, I'm tryin' to remember
'Cause it's been forever since we felt good
And now it's a new day, it's gonna go my way
We're free on the freeway, it sure feels good

'Cause I wanna go back to the days of the past
When everything was easy
But I'm holdin' you close and I'm lettin' her go
'Cause, baby, you're the reason

I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'

And the old me wouldn't believe it
'Cause my messed up head says I blew it
I don't care, 'cause I'm never gon' quit, not today
'Cause I've found the road and I lost it
Seen the edge, I been hangin' off it
Ain't no river too wide to cross it, on the way

'Cause I wanna go back to the days of the past
When everything was easy
But I'm holdin' you close and I'm lettin' her go
'Cause, baby, you're the reason

When everything was easy
