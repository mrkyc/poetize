Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this
Jump to the beat, then J-U-M-P
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day

Let the games begin, if you wanna come fuck with me
You can't disturb the course of T and P, and C, and D, and me
I'm on a mission to set straight
The vice, the curse, the date, the gate relate
To this, I insist B it's weak to dis, see?
I'm runnin' up so suckers stick to your forty
How could I give a damn, give a damn
If you approve what it's about?
I just freak out

Get up, get up, get up and rock this beat
Get up, get up, get up and rock this beat
Get up, get up, get up, freak out
Get up, get up, get up and rock this beat
Get up, get up, get up and rock this
Just guess y'all c'mon come back slipped
Outta whack as the master laid out the music
See 311 LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like
Death, I just say fuck you (Fuck you)
The void unknown we're thrown through
While lost in life's psychedelic trip we take
There's another more bizarre we have to make
World we have, nowhere beyond
Take out the earth, the bass is gone
At life's end, we'll feel the calm
How strange we should be here at all

If you don't have someone to
Do it with it's not worth doin'
To all my friends, it's not the end
The earth has not swallowed me yet

Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day

Into whose womb were you woven?
What kin of your skin dropped you then? Body's cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me, each death it brings
Reminding me we are rumbling in this
Cursed universe where death is birth
Think not, but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse, the curse, occurs a thirst
To burst, first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow
So jam to the bum-rush single
Long ago has been become now
When you find out there's no break in the rhythm
Black anima makes my stamina
Stand alone, disown the cinema
Farewell to posing decades dozing
Comin' up the steps of the new screen rising
Scenes from the lost world, shapes hard to tell
Which is which as if drawn by a child, holmes
If you don't have someone to
Do it with, it's not worth doin'
To all my friends, it's not the end
The earth has not swallowed me yet
If you don't have someone to
Do it with, it's not worth doin'

This is the heat to flush your face, brother
This is the heat to flush your face, come on
This is the heat to flush your face, brother
This is the heat to flush your face
