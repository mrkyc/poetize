Why do I stay inside?
I should be livin' life
Instead of watchin' through the window
No use in playin' safe
Not gonna hesitate
I know the storm is only mental

I'm letting go, givin' up the control
Yeah, I'm ready to go wherever the wind blows
I wanna see where the road's gonna lead
Time is tickin' and the world is not waitin' on me

I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long
These clouds over my head, they won't move on
I've been dodgin raindrops, tryin' not to get wet
I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long

Dodgin' raindrops
But they're all in my head, all in my head
But they're all in my head, all in my head

Sooner or later, it comes
As quick as it comes, it'll go
Whatever is blockin' the sun
Only for a moment
Running away from my past
It's pushin' me out of my zone
Pullin' me under the gun, into the unknown

Dodgin' raindrops
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
(I've been dodgin' raindrops)
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
(I've been dodgin' raindrops)
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head

Ready to go outside
And to be livin' life
Instead of watching out the window
I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long
These clouds over my head, they won't move on
I've been dodgin raindrops, tryin' not to get wet
I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long

But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
(I've been dodgin' raindrops)
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
(I've been dodgin' raindrops)
