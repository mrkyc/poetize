Back again I'm holed up
In the waiting room again
Focused on the empty
Getting underneath my skin

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

Look at how the time flies
Burning daylight to the ground
Wash away the ashes
Gonna quiet my head down

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

Illuminate the shadows
And try to keep the light within (keep the light within)
Avoid another battle
And forget what might have been

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
I've had too much to think
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up, but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world, every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?

'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low)
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

Oh, oh, oh (woah)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (woah)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (woah-oh)
