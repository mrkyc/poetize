Passin' the kind buds
Kickin' back in the sand in the sun
To be alive is lovin', where the shore meets the sea
Man I'm hummin', I'm hummin'

I'm free as I stare at the sea
And I'm not comin' down
The world is yours once you have found
The good is to share
Which is elsewhere

The beauty of green is where light is now broken
By what it touches
Remembering what you once had told me hit home
And hasn't it always been so?

I'm free as I stare at the sea
And I'm not comin' down
The world is yours once you have found
The good is to share
Which is elsewhere

Like I said before, I'll say it once more
Knew you would make me feel so good
Wanna do you right
Can't get enough, this is the stuff
Life's about and it trips me out
Gonna do you right (I'ma do you right)

Bright mornings, days when I want so much
I want nothing, just this life and no more
I'll come within this world, there's only one for me
She's waiting, I'll soon come

I'm free as I stare at the sea
And I'm not comin' down
The world is yours once you have found
The good is to share
Which is elsewhere

Like I said before I'll say it once more
Knew you would make me feel so good
Wanna do you right
Can't get enough, this is the stuff
Life's about and it trips me out
Gonna do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Free from the burn, the burnin' of spite and
Free from the burn, the burnin' of surprise
No buzz hack, no buzz hack, no buzz hack, no buzz hack
Swing the thing you bring and check it out
How could you be so good to me? How could you be so good to me?
I want to free, want to be free
Buzz, hack, hack, hack, buzz
Yes swing to the thing you bring and check it out

Like I said before I'll say it once more
Knew you would make me feel so good
Wanna do you right
Can't get enough, this is the stuff
Life's about and it trips me out
