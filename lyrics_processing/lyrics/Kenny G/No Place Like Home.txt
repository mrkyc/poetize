I can remember the day we met
I still remember our first French kiss
The moment when I knew that you would make sweet love to me
The moment that I knew you'd always be the one
One I'd be dreaming of

Twas a long time ago when we fell in love
And even longer ago when we both were young
But it's nice to know that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold

Baby, I can remember the way (Way we laughed)
The way that we laughed
And you, you were my lover and girl (My best friend)
My best friend
And it's crazy I would go through the ups and downs
Our feelings never change
Knowing in my heart, you'll always be the one
One I'll be dreaming of

Twas was a long time ago when we fell in love
Even longer ago when we both were young (Oh baby)
But it's nice to know, that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold
There just ain't no place like home
