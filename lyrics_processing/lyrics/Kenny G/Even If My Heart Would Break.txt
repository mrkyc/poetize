I've been a lot of places
Seen a million faces
In a thousand towns
But when I looked into your eyes
I knew I found Heaven
And I've been wantin' to tell you
I never wanna let you go
It may be winter and heat on
But what I'm feeling is summer in my heart
Is it too familiar to say "I love you"
Would you be suspicious if I asked your name
Tell me, what would it take
To really convince you
That I'm gonna love you
Even if my heart would break
I see a better day
I can feel it coming
I can hear it calling
In the winter night
Could you turn this man
Into a true believer
When you left your traces
On that moonlit night

But when I'm with you, with you
It's summer in my heart
Is it too familiar to say "I love you"
Would you be suspicious if I asked your name
Tell me, what would it take
To really convince you
That I'm gonna love you
Even if my heart would break
It may be winter and heat on
But when I'm with you, with you
It's always summer in my heart
So let the mountains tumble
Tumble to the sea
Let the rivers overflow
It won't bother me
Let the stars go out tonight
Cuz I can see them in your eyes
And I wanna love you
Even if my heart would break
(Even if my heart would break)
Is it too familiar to say "I love you"
Would you be suspicious if I asked your name
Tell me, what would it take
To really convince you
That I'm gonna love you
Even if my heart would break
Even if my heart would break
I'm gonna love you
Even if my heart would break
I'm gonna love you
Let the stars go out tonight
Cuz I can see them in your eyes
And I'm gonna love you
Even if my heart would break

Yeah, yeah
(Even if my heart would break)
