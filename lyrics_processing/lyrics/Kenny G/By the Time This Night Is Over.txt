Oh
Oh-oh

Silence takes over
Saying all we need to say
There's endless possibilities
In the moves we can make
Your kiss is giving every indication
If this heart of mine is right

By the time this night is over
The stars are gonna shine on two lovers in love
And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that's just begun
By the time this night is over
Two hearts are gonna fly to the heavens above
And we'll get closer and closer, and closer
By the time this night is over

Let's take a slow and easy ride
Just lay back and love take us over
There's magic here with you and I
And it's gonna take us all the way
Lets find some kind of deeper conversation
And darling, if it's right

And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that's just begun
By the time this night is over
Two hearts are gonna fly to the heavens above
And we'll get closer and closer, and closer
By the time this night is over

A night like this may never come again
And you won't want this night to end
Oh, baby, we can have it all
By the time this night is over (Ooh, ooh)

By the time this night is over
The stars are gonna shine on two lovers in love
And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that's just begun
By the time this night is over
Two hearts are gonna fly to the heavens above
And we'll get closer and closer, and closer
By the time this night is over
Over
Gonna wrap my lovin' arms around you
By the time this night is over
Heaven's gonna smile, gonna smile on two lovers
By the time this night is over
Oh, oh (By the time this night is over)
