I realize ain't no second chance
You've got to hold on to romance, don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you
Spendin' ev'ry dime to keep you talkin' on the line that's how it was
And all those walks together out in any kind of weather
Just because, just because there's a brand-new way of looking at your life
And when you know that love'll be standing by your side
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you
The nights can be cold
There's a chill to ev'ry evenin' when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm, keep you warm
