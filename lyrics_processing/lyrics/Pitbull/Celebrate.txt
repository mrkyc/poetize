Mr. Worldwide, let's celebrate

I just wanna celebrate

Tonight we makin' history

We've been around the world, same song
Work hard, play harder, all day long
All the continents get jealous over me
You can see me, 3D overseas
If you know me then you know where to find me
Off in the Bahamas with a bad one behind me
Now live it up, live it up, live it up
Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

I've been patiently waitin' for you to shake it and shake it
Make it or take it, the point is we made it
Quarterback the game, call us Tom Brady
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies
But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator
All around the globe, matter fact, see you later
They're great, we're great and we're world dominators
And we're also some smooth operators

And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

Live it up, don't let life live you
It's a good time, that's what we're givin' you
Now live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up
Live it up, live it up.... what you wanna do?

I just wanna celebrate

Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

Turn it up, let's celebrate
