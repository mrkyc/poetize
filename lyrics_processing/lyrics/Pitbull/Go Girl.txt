Young Bo$$, Miss Trina, Pitbull
Let's show them how we keep down

I party like a rockstar, look like a movie star
Play like an all star, fuck like a pornstar
Baby, I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar, always with couple boss
Maybe I'm just that that raw, dawg, check your resume
I hit something everyday, ask about me and they say
That chico run MIA, Pitbull and Young Bo$$, that's fire
Go girl work it out 'til you tire, just tryin' to pay your tuition, liar
My corner is like HBO's wire, so please don't play no games
And baby, don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time, you can bring your friends

So get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of MySpace

Girl, I wanna know your name
Girl, who you be?
Don't care with who you came
