To these rappers, I apologize, I know it ain't fair
Only ball I drop, New Year's, Times Square
The world is mine, sixth sense, I see the seven signs
Now baby, let's get started for life

Every time I look into your eyes (Mr. Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started
You know it feels right

(Woo!)
Big news, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai
I lit up their December nights like the Fourth of July, vanilla sky
Thrilla in Manila, knocking them out like Pacquiao
No Ali, no Frazier, but for now it's off to Malaysia
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started
You know it feels right

I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything, you name it, name it
I went from eviction to food stamps
To baggin' work, wet and damp
To a passport, flooded with stamps
Now it's Voli everywhere I land
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

'Cause if it feels right (You know it feels right)
We shouldn't waste any more time
Let's get it started (Let's get it started)
Don't think about it (Let's get it started)
You know I'm gonna make it alright, alright (Let's go)
'Cause if it feels right (You know it feels right)
You know I've made up my mind
Let's get it started (Let's get it started)
Don't think about it (Let's get it started)
I know that we can make it alright, alright

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started
Don't start what you can't finish
You know it feels right
Let's go
You know it feels right
