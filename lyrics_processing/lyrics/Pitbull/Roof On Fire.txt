Uh

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Independent like a motherfucker, time to own it all
Build another twenty schools, let's show 'em how we ball
I ride for my city, I ride for my dawgs
Like the mayor at the show, New Year's Eve, boy, it's on
I'm in the zone, in the vibe, it's the 3-0-5
Mr. Took Over the World, Mr. Stay On Fire
Mr. Fuckboy Free, Mr. Fuckboy, please
Mr. Got the Whole Game On Its Knees, that's right

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Baby, I got A-D-D, a delicious dick
And I'm ready, act a fool in this bitch
This chico stay slick, this chico stay lit
I'ma change my name to Mr. Stay Rich
Been gettin' loose, been gettin' paid
3-0-5 representer, been reppin' Dade
I'm a chico in the game that spit that flame
That spit that fire, now let's get off the chain, let's ride
See Pitbull LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

No pare, sigue, sigue, no pare, sigue, sigue

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
