Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
You said, "I'm going"
I said, "don't lie"
It feels so lonely
At home at night
But if you go and I got the time
I hope you know it
You gotta try

Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout us
I think about all the things we take a chance on
Like love
Just like trust

Just like every time you go away
I want nothing more than for you to stay
And baby I know you gotta go
And it's all okay
Cause every time you go away

It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
You might also like
We'll do it right babe
We're doing fine
If you're going my way
Well I got the time, yeah

Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout us
I think about all the things we take a chance on
Like love
Just like trust

Just like every time you go away
I want nothing more than for you to stay
And baby I know you gotta go
And it's all okay
Cause every time you go away

It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout us
I think about all the things we take a chance on
Like love
Just like trust

Just like every time you go away
I want nothing more than for you to stay
And baby I know you gotta go
And it's all okay
Cause every time you go away

It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
It's like you're coming home to me
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
It's like you're coming home
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
It's like you're coming home
For the very very very first time
For the very first time
