No bones, I'm a ticking, ticking time bomb
Filling up the bottle with a range of emotions
Oh, staring at a face with a smile
Can't see your runaway child hiding an explosion
I can't go home but I want it bad
Pray for a soul that I never had
Like step, I know I drag it, drag it down
Like a handful of bullets in the middle of the ocean

Your love can't save me now
Summers fading out
Burning up inside us
It's no surprise

That I don't need you, I can fall apart myself
It's not your problem (It's not your problem)
I'm so fall inside, in solitary places
No need spotlight in the cage
There's no handle in the safe
I still say that I'm okay if I'm on fire

Eyes closed, no lights, hitting highway, top city
Speed limits and your body's disappearing
Both hands full of matches and a can full of
Gasoline saturating every little feeling
I lost control, I set it off
You call that cold, I call it sabotage
No running back into a burning house
Trying to sweat it off, fight until you're barely fucking breathing
You might also like
Your love can't save me now
Summers fading out
Burning up inside us
It's no surprise

That I don't need you, I can fall apart myself
It's not your problem (It's not your problem)
I'm so fall inside, in solitary places
No need spotlight in the cage
There's no handle in the safe
I still say that I'm okay if I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh I'm on fire

I still say that I'm okay if I'm on fire
If I'm on fire
I still say that I'm okay if I'm on fire
If I'm on fire

I don't need you, I can fall apart myself
It's not your problem (It's not your problem)
I'm so fall inside, in solitary places
No need spotlight in the cage
There's no handle in the safe
I still say that I'm okay if I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh I'm on fire
