Red lips
Big eyes
No vanilla
Make you wanna cry
Sweet little surprise
She's a killer
Telling no lies
Pretty like a lemonade and a smile and a 45
If you fuck with my girl, you could lose your life
I don't gotta lift a finger
Cause I got me a ringer
Well if you mix with my girl, it's fine
You can get a dose
And if you want a trip to the barbershop, fine
She can cut close
And if you'd like a lemonade and a smile and a 45
You can fuck with my girl, you could lose your life
I don't gotta lift a finger
It's just me and my ringer

She's a man
She's a man
She's a man killer
She's a bam bam that'd take you down if you mess with her
But it's alright
Cause she's on my side
She's a
She's a man
She's a man
She's a man killer
When she's all mine
You might also like(When she's all mine)

Cold like a stone in the winter
Make you feel alive
But if you take a swing at the thriller
Bet you're gonna die
Pretty with a new Gucci bag and an old switchblade
You can wake up in the middle of a hurricane
Better run for your life, boy
And you run like a white boy

She's a man
She's a man
She's a man killer
She's a bam bam that'd take you down if you mess with her
But it's alright
Cause she's on my side
She's a
She's a man
She's a man
She's a man killer
When she's all mine

But it's alright
