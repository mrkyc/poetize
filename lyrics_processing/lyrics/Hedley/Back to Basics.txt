It's been awhile
I can't remember since I been home
Probably December
I miss my girl and my friends
I got that message you sent
I'm thinking maybe we could try this again

Sorry baby girl, I think I missed your birthday
I promise I can make it up when I get back
We can kick it on the block, grab a drink if you're thirsty
You're still the best I ever had
I know I haven't been around in a minute
And the clock on the wall is just tick, tick, ticking
But I don't wanna die before I start living
So there's some things I gotta change
(Hi Jakey, I just got back from the brunch
And I just got your message
I wanna say that I love you)
There's some things I gotta change
(And I hope you have a very nice day
Call me when you can)

It's been awhile
All the faces, people, and the places
Bout time I get back to the basics
(It's been awhile)
Sunshine and the money I've been chasing
Bout time I get back to the basics

Back to catching up with Jordan on the east side
Swinging hammers, banging nails just to get by
Looking back, man those were some good times
The best we ever had
Now we're picking it up where we left off
Drinking after church
Funny till the last drop
Even though you gotta get off when the ride stops
Some things will never change
(Jake, there's no way that you check your voicemail, but if you do, Kevin and I are together right now)
Some things will never change
(We're going for a ride)

(Hi Jakey, it's nona
I just wanted to check if you home
If you said
Wonder how much time you'll call, okay?
Love you, bye)
