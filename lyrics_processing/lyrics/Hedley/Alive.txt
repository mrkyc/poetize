Kinda feel like a miracle
I can be so cynical, no more
Life can seem too typical, too digital
Lord I don't wanna be so invisible

Staying alive
Hey, whatever it takes
Whenever it feels alright
Staying alive
Oh, wherever I go
Whatever I do tonight
Staying alive
Hey, whatever it takes
Whenever it feels alright
Staying alive
Oh, wherever I go

Like it's do or die
Like you just can't wait
Like a big blue sky on a summer day
Take me up so high where I wanna stay
Staying alive
Hey, whatever it takes
Whenever it feels alright
Like a first romance on an ocean wave
It's your very last chance
It's a leap of faith
Take me up so high when I wanna stay
Staying alive
Oh, wherever I go
Whatever I do tonight
