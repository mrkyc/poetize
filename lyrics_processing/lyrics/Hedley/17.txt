When we were 17
And on cheap wine and stolen weed
And we'd get kicked outta' every place
We go, we call it home

Then we were 23
And you told me you'd marry me
And I thought I'd never be alone
But you know you never know

Sleeping in, waking up, staring at me
But your gone now look around, I can barely breathe
Still sleeping in, waking up, mattress on the floor
But we're not 17 no more

Where do I go? Where do I go?
Where do I go when you're gone?
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home
Where do I go? Where do I go?
I didn't know you'd be gone
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home. yeah

Fast forward 26
And all this sex is meaningless
And I still wonder where'd you go
But I know I'll never know

Now I can't tell myself apart
I lost my mind and broke my heart
It cost me something beautiful
And I know you'll never know

Sleeping in, waking up, staring at me
But your gone now look around, I can barely breathe
Still sleeping in, waking up, mattress on the floor
But we're not 17 no more

Where do I go? Where do I go?
Where do I go when you're gone?
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home
Where do I go? Where do I go?
I didn't know you'd be gone
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home, yeah

(Go when you're)
(Go when you're gone)
(Go when you're)
(Go when you're gone)

(How to get back home)

Looking back 17
Was all that it was supposed to be
You know it's something beautiful
To know you'll never know

Where do I go? Where do I go?
Where do I go when you're gone?
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home
Where do I go? Where do I go?
I didn't know you'd be gone
Tell me how to get back
Tell me how to get back home

Get back home (Go when you're)
(Go when you're gone)
Get back home (Go when you're)
(Go when you're gone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Go when you're)
(Go when you're gone)

Tell me how to get back
