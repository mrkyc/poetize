Yeah, yeah
If I can love again

Lovers in a gunfight
Caught up in the crossfire
Dark side of the moonlight
Could you let me go?
Is this how it plays out?
Battle scars, and breakdowns
Is there anything left to save now?
Could you let me know?

If you're for sure
And if I'm strong enough
If you wait long enough

Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
If I could love again
Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
Oh, if I could love again
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You might also like
Love is better conscious
Another broken promise
Why can't I be honest?
Could you let me go?
God, I feel like screaming
Two lonely hearts bleeding
Fighting for a feeling
Could you let me know?

If you're for sure
And if I'm strong enough
If you wait long enough

Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
If I could love again
Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
Oh, if I could love again
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo, ooh
If I could love again
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I could break the silence

Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
If I could love again
Tell me would you stay?
If I could love again
If I could love again
Oh, if I could love again
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

If I could break the silence
If I could love again, yeah
If I could love again, yeah
Tell me would you stay?
If I could break the silence
If I could love again, yeah
Oh, if I could love again, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I could love again
If I could love again
Oh, if I could love again
(Yeah, yeah)
