Can I make a little toast?
Can we get a little close?
Can I get an amen? Can I get a hell yeah?
Can I get a holy ghost?
Somebody give me a beat
Let me see you on your feet
Somebody save your man
I don't give a god damn, I wanna be a freak

Catch me if you can
I don't think you understand where we're going
(Where we're going)
When you feel it and you know
When this shit's about to blow
And it hits you
Ooh it hits you like

In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
You might also like
Like a shot to the face
Now you got a little taste
Baby never give a fuck, get up
Stand up, shake your buns to the bass
When you break it down
They're gonna love the sound
Everybody just stop
And bring it back around like

Catch me if you can
I don't think you understand where we're going
(Where we're going)
When you feel it and you know
When this shit's about to blow
And it hits you
Ooh it hits you like

In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
Oh my god, I lose control
Oh my god, I lose control
Catch me if you can
I don't think you understand where we're going
When you feel it and you know
When this shit's about to blow
When it hits you
Hits you like

In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
In my body, in my bones
Drop the beat and free my soul
When I hear that rock and roll
Oh my god, I lose control
La la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la, oh oh oh
I had to let it go
Oh my god, I lose control
Oh my god, I lose control
