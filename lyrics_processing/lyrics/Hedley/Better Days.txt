I've been down, I've been down
Burning up like fever
Better days, better days
Are not so far away

I don't wanna waste a minute
But if I gotta waste a minute
I'd spend the time tryna' get my vibe on track
And if I'm on a star, don't wanna spin it
My life's up in flames, and I lit it
I wonder if I'll ever get that good shit back

And I'll keep praying I make it
Like someone worth saving
I still got some fight left inside me

I've been down, I've been down
Burning up like fever
Better days, better days
Are not so far away
I've been lost, I've been found
Now I believe in
Better days, better days
Are not so far away

Better days, better days
Are not so far away
Better days, better days
Are not so far away

Guess I didn't break it, but I bent it
I know I didn't say it, but I meant it
I shoulda' had a little more heart and soul
Oh, oh, fuck the rearview mirror
Our future looks a little bit clearer
I'm turning every second into solid gold

And I'll keep praying I make it
Like someone worth saving
I still got some fight left inside me

I've been down, I've been down
Burning up like fever
Better days, better days
Are not so far away
I've been lost, I've been found
Now I believe in
Better days, better days
Are not so far away
Better days, better days
Are not so far away
Better days, better days
Are not so far away

And I'll keep praying I make it
Like someone worth saving
I still got some fight left inside me

I've been down, I've been down
Burning up like fever
Better days, better days
Are not so far away
I've been lost, I've been found
Now I believe in
Better days, better days
Are not so far away

Better days, better days
Are not so far away
Better days, better days
