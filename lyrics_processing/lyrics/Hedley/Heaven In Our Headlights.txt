You can take me all the way
We're like, Bonnie and Clyde
Making off with Mary Jane
Even God don't know where we're goin'
And I sure as hell don't care
Cause if you and I can stay this high with heaven in our headlights
I swear that we can make it anywhere
I'm up for pushing our luck;
We could do it our way (we could do it our way)
So light up show me some love, you crazy little runaway
Even God don't know where we're goin'
And I sure as hell don't care
Cause if you and I can stay this high with heaven in our headlights
I swear that we can make it anywhere
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you're missing in the morning, M.I.A
Raise your empties to the memories that we made
We are on our way (hey)
I think its safe to say (hey)
