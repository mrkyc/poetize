A Bone shatters, fall apart and hit the floor
If it doesn't thrill you it doesn't matter any more
Bones shatter, maybe don't go out this time
No matter where you've been or who you are
If it doesn't kill you it's sure to leave a horrible scar
Bones shatter, baby don't go out this time

So what's another Stan who's not a fan a million miles away?
And what's he gonna do to me that I haven't already seen?
You'll never stop me; you know it's everything to me

We'll never stop
'Cause we're only getting better
We're not making this up
So just write another letter
I'll be fine
Alive again, another day, I'm not afraid to get over
We'll never stop
'Cause we're only getting better, I'll be fine

I've been better seen a brighter side of life
But any friend of the failure's a friend of mine
Bones shatter, baby don't go out this time

Another day
A way to get over
