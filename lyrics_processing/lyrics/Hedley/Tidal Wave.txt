I'm a crack in the sidewalk
I'm a ghost in the low light
You got my heart in a head lock
You saw though me like the middle of the night

I let you down about a thousand times
You pick me up about a thousand and one
I'm not afraid to feel alive
You save me from the person I've become

So afraid
The moment I let you go, felt so alone
I should've stayed
Living without you, sinking like a stone

I walked away you let me go
You watched me break, you took me home
Now I'm awake
You hit me like a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
You might also like
Now I'm a diamond in the bright lights
Or an island in the summer sun
Clear your eyes and it feels right
I was running and you stopped me like a gun

So afraid
The moment I let you go, felt so alone
I should've stayed
Living without you, sinking like a stone

I walked away you let me go
You watched me break, you took me home
Now I'm awake
You hit me like a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
I walked away you let me go
You watched me break, you took me home
Now I'm awake
You hit me like a tidal wave
I'm a crack in the sidewalk
I'm a ghost in the low light

Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
I walked away you let me go
You watched me break, you took me home
Now I'm awake
You hit me like a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
Ah-yeah
You hit me like (you hit me like) a tidal wave
I walked away you let me go
You watched me break, you took me home
Now I'm awake
