Oh travel be kind?
I'm searching for some peace of mind
A home that you know
A home left behind
Oh trouble don't trouble tonight
Baby don't look back
I won't crack I won't make a sound without you
Baby odds don't stack
I won't crack I won't tumble down without you
And even if it sounds crazy darling I won't let you go
And even if it stops raining darling I won't let you go
And even if the whole world starts burning I won't let you go
Even if it sounds crazy darling I won't let you go
I know way down your music, your town
You never are walking alone
A storm that won't wait, a stone that won't break
No mountains ain't made out of stone
And baby don't look back odds don't stack
They just crumble down around you
Oh you got to go away if you want to come back
I won't crack I can't make a sound without you

Baby don't look back
I won't crack I won't make a sound without you
Baby odds don't stack
I won't crack I won't tumble down without youLong steady road
