A hot tube full of hot girls
Grinding every frat boy and freak
Line up all the Idols
Who paint on phony smiles
Trying to ride the fast track for free

And all the sole survivors
Still stranded on the island
Lying through their teeth for money
So everybody dance and everybody sing
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Yeah, we can swing it, cha-ching
When you take off all your clothes
When you strike a Playboy pose
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Then you gotta bring it, cha-ching
Everybody stop and stare
Kardashian's ass is everywhere
If you missed it, watch TMZ
