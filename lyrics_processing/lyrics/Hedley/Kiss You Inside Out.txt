I don't know if you're ready to go
Where I'm willing to take you, girl
I will feel every inch of your skin
And you know I can rock your world
Imma be the calm in the storm you're lookin' for
I'll be the shipwreck that takes you down
I don't mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now

Ooh ooh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo
Ooh ooh
Give up the fight
I'm in control
Why don't you let it go?

Yeah
I wanna know you inside out
I'll spend my life tryna figure out
Just close your eyes and shut you mouth
And let me kiss you inside out
You might also like
I don't care if you steal all my air
We can breathe in together as one
It's all right if you're here every night
Waking up with you in the sun
We start with an hour and we find we waste the day
Kicking back with the love we found
I don't mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now

Ooh ooh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo
Ooh ooh
Give up the fight
I'm in control
Why don't you let it go?

Yeah
I wanna know you inside out
I'll spend my life tryna figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, babe
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, babe
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, babe
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, babe
I don't mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now

Ooh ooh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo
Ooh ooh
Give up the fight
I'm in control
Why don't you let it go?

Yeah
I wanna know you inside out
I'll spend my life tryna figure out
Just close your eyes and shut you mouth
And let me kiss you inside out
I wanna know you inside out
I'll spend my life tryna figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
