Don't believe everything happiness says
Nothing feels better than hiding these days
We bury our fears in the drinks and these tears
For the days we believed we could fly

Call up your brothers and sisters and friends
We'll go back to the place where the night never ends
We'll remember the fires, the burning car tires
Boy, how in the hell did we get here?

So, why don't you meet me down behind our old school?
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how
Cavalier we used to be, that beautiful insanity
The apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade away

Over and over and over again
We sat down for a minute, grew up into men
Now we're putting out fires and changing car tires
Man, how in the hell did we get here?

So, why don't you meet me down behind our old school?
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how
Cavalier we used to be, that beautiful insanity
The apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade away this time
And we'll never get back what we gave away
When we still have that fire in our eyes
You might also like
Don't believe everything happiness says
Nothings as real as our old, reckless ways
When we'd drink by the fires, the burning car tires
Bad girls and good liars, the dreams we'd conspire
The days we went crazy, the nights wild and hazy
Man, how in the hell did we get here?

So, why don't you meet me down behind our old school?
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how
Cavalier we used to be, that beautiful insanity
The apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade away, away, away

So, why don't you meet me down behind our old school?
We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how
Cavalier we used to be, that beautiful insanity
The apathy surrounding me
