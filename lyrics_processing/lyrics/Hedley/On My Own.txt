Now my blood shot eyes are burnin'
Workin' out why this ain't workin'
Fight after fight after fight
And now it's killin' me
You were too busy to believe in
All the run away dreams I was dreamin'
Time to pack up and go I'm leavin'
Fight after fight after fight
And now I gotta be
On my own
And living in a world alone
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
I'm gonna make it on my own
I'll always take the harder road
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
How'd you end up oh so jaded?
Cynical and so sedated
Can't live in this world you created
Day after day after day
And now I gotta be
On my own
And living in a world alone
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
I'm gonna make it on my own
I'll always take the harder road
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
You might also likeYou will always be the lonely one
You always try to swallow the Sun
Just remember you could never make it rain on everyone
On my own
And living in a world alone
Gets better every day
Cause I don't have to say
And now you're killin' me
On my own
And living in a world alone
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
I'm gonna make it on my own
I'll always take the harder road
Gets better every day
That I don't have to say I'm sorry I'm coming home
I'll make it on my own
I'm sorry I won't be coming home
I'll make it on my own
I'm sorry I won't be coming home
I'll make it on my own
I'm sorry I won't be coming home
I'll make it on my own
