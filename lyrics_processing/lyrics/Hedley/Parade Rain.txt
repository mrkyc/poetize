You can't tell me what I'm never gonna be
You can't hold me down if I wanna be free
Who said you're allowed to rain
On my parade?

You can't tell me not to fly cause I gotta
Every time they put you down, you get up stronger
Don't bring around the clouds to rain
On my parade

The stars could fall out of the sky but I keep standing

I can't be stopped, no, we won't be shaken
Hearts like a drum, beating not breaking
We're never gonna stop, and if it keeps on raining
We'll march until the sun comes out and say so long

Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain

Anywhere you live, there's negativity
It's what you give, the negatives will never live with me
Come and hear me shine so loud
Right through the clouds

The stars, could fall, out of the sky but I keep standing

I can't be stopped, no, we won't be shaken
Hearts like a drum, beating not breaking
We're never gonna stop, and if it keeps on raining
We'll march until the sun comes out and say so long

Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain

Ain't no way they're putting out this fire
Every jab, cut, burn, we burn brighter
Ever heard somebody shine so loud
And stand up so proud
Right through these clouds
Ain't no way we're putting out this fire
Every jab, cut, burn, we burn brighter
Ever heard somebody shine so loud

I can't be stopped, no, we won't be shaken
Hearts like a drum, beating not breaking
We're never gonna stop, and if it keeps on raining
We'll march until the sun comes out and say so long

Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
Parade rain, so long, so long, so long
