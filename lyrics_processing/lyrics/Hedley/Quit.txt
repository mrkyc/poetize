Everybody is talking about it
I can't believe you tore us apart
Down and dirty
I can live without it
Surprise I know who you are

Staying out all night
Never acting right
Waking up to lies
And saying sorry till it's sundown
Jealousy
Vicious instantly
All this misery
Tell me, are we having fun now?

That's the shit that makes me quit
Too many problems
No love will solve them
That was it, no
That's the shit that makes me quit
All out of patience
You got what it takes to me split
You might also like
Rising up
So dramatic
I love to watch you watch me walking away
I've had enough
This shit is tragic
So goodbye bye bye to the mess that you made

Staying out all night
Never acting right
Waking up to lies
And saying sorry till it's sundown
Jealousy
Vicious instantly
All this misery
Tell me, are we having fun now?

That's the shit that makes me quit
Too many problems
No love will solve them
That was it, no
That's the shit that makes me quit
All out of patience
You got what it takes to me split
That's the shit that makes me quit
Oh I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me

That's the shit that makes me quit
Too many problems
No love will solve them
That was it, no
That's the shit that makes me quit
All out of patience
You got what it takes to me split
That's the shit that makes me quit
Too many problems
No love will solve them
That was it, no
That's the shit that makes me quit
All out of patience
You got what it takes to me split
Oh I ain't ever been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
Cause a girl's no trouble for me
No I ain't never been in trouble with a girl
