We started out okay, but you through it all away
My god what's going on in your head?
For all we could've found just to let it hit the ground
But I'm good and done, we're over and dead

And yes I'm leaving you it's obvious (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
So wipe that stupid look right off of your face

Get out of my way, what did she say she's so, so sorry
So get out of my way, what did she say she's so, so sorry
She said i wanna start over today take me back again
Get out of my way, what did she say she's so, so sorry
She was

You try to shift the blame, my god are you insane
And I'm sorry babe is all you can say
You've made a mess before I kept coming back for more
'Cause I never thought you'd end it this way

And yes I'm leaving you it's obvious (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
So wipe that stupid look right off of your face

Get out of my way what did she say she's so, so sorry
So get out of my way what did she say she's so, so sorry
She said I wanna start over today take me back again
Get out of my way what did she, say she's so, so sorry

And that's all that I can say if you've never been let down
Then this story's far from over, everything comes back around
So be careful what you say what goes up has gotta come down
Don't be taken back it's all because of you

Get out of my way what did she say she's so, so sorry
So get out of my way what did she say, she's so, so sorry
She said I wanna start over today take me back again
Get out of my way what did she say, she's so, so sorry

Never again
Never again

What she say? Out of my way!
What did I tell her? What I tell her?
What she say? Out of my way!
What did I tell her? What I tell her!
