She had her 7's on
When I think about it now
Just a cougar on the prowl
She was hotter than hell
Had me under a spell
Got that ass doing yoga
Didn't care that she's older
Got off the stage
Ended up at her place
We were burning up the bed
Fire needed to be fed
Morning sun hit her face
Maggie May showed her age
And I remember what my Mama said
Don't talk to strangers
Don't do all your thinking with your little head
Like mama said, just like mama said
My mama said
Don't talk to strangers
Just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead
Like mama said, just like Mama said
My mama said
You might also likeShe likes 'em nice and young
She likes 'em fresh and hungry
With fire in her eyes
Let's you try her on for size
Show you a trick or two
To teach you something new
Full of bacardi and botox
She's forty and so hot
The light of the day
Had something different to say
My head started to spin
When I saw her son walking in
I'll bet he felt like a fool
Cause I knew him from school
And I remember what my mama said
Don't talk to strangers
Don't do all your thinking with your little head
Like mama said, just like mama said
My mama said
Don't talk to strangers
Just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead
Like mama said, just like Mama said
My mama said
(x4)
Hey pretty lady it's crazy
You're almost twice my age
I wanna dance on your body
The way I shake it on stage
Don't talk to strangers
Don't do all your thinking with your little head
Like mama said, just like mama said
My mama said
Don't talk to strangers
Just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead
Like mama said, just like Mama said
