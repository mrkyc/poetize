Beautiful girl, beautiful girl, you don't wanna fuck with me
Beautiful girl, stay in my world, nothing but a tragedy
Wasting your time, out of your mind, don't be delusional
Leave me be, yeah, you'll be just fine, baby, just carry on

Beautiful girl, beautiful girl, don't know why you rescued me
Beautiful girl, stay in my world, swear that you're the best for me
All of my life, couldn't get it right, everything felt so wrong
I have brighter days, you get all my praise, you saved me

How can I stand next to you all alone and do nothing at all?
It starts in my hands, straight to my bones, head spinning when you fall
With my heart safe and sound, I stay
And my feet on the ground, I say
I've never been higher
Let the world catch fire
Living, loving, I stay

Beautiful girl, beautiful girl, couldn't do it on my own
Beautiful girl, this is our world, never have to be alone
All of my heart, every part, I can't stop thanking you
I got brighter days, you get all my praise
I will always love you, you saved me
You might also like
How can I stand next to you all alone and do nothing at all?
It starts in my hands, straight to my bones, head spinning when you fall
With my heart safe and sound, I stay
And my feet on the ground, I say
I've never been higher
Let the world catch fire
Living, loving, I stay

You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
I just know you saved my life, you saved me
You, ooh
I'ma be alright, you saved me
You saved my life, you saved me (Saved me)
I'ma be alright, you saved me (Saved me)

How can I stand next to you all alone and do nothing at all?
It starts in my hands, straight to my bones, head spinning when you fall
With my heart safe and sound, I stay
And my feet on the ground, I say
I've never been higher
Let the world catch fire
