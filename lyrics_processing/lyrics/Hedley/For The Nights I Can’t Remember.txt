I see it in the way you would do
When no one else could ever get through
Holding back till I come around
Time and time again you wait for me to comin'
And did you really look my way?
Cause no one could've seen this coming
I would never let you down
If I was running backwards in full time

So I can and I will and you'll see your hero come running
Over and over tonight

And I do wanna love you
If you see me running back
And I do wanna try
Because if falling for you girl is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time

Me, I'm used to being tired and bloody
But you believed that I could be somebody
You put your world on hold for me
Gave away to follow failure through the fire
I need you to know I will
Believe me girl I'm so tired of running
I just wanna hold your hand
Stare at you like you've got everything I need
You might also like
And I can so I will and you'll see your hero come running
Over and over tonight

And I do wanna love you
If you see me running back
And I do wanna try
Because if falling for you girl is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time

And what if I never said to you I was dynamite
And what if I never told you I'm afraid to cry
What if I never let you down
And said I'm sorry for the nights I can't remember
What if I never said to you I would try
Yeah Yeah Yeah

And I do wanna love you
(If you see me running back)
And I do wanna try
Because if falling for you girl is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time
Hold back your tears this time
