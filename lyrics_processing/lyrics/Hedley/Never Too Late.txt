Hoping I can run today
And get away faster than ever from here
Another night
And who can say if leaving is better
Than living in fear?

Heres to all the broken hearts tonight
Heres to all the fall-aparts tonight
Heres to every girl and boy who lost their joy
They let it get away

You know it's never too late
Get up and start all over again
You know it's never too late
Theres gotta be a better way
Don't settle for the cold and rain
It's not too late to start again
Find a way to smile
And never let it get away

It's been too long
And we've been down and out without laughter
No smiling, just tears
We're tired of falling down and being such a disaster
We've been here for years
You might also like
Heres to all the broken hearts tonight
Heres to all the fall-aparts tonight
Heres to every girl and boy who lost their joy
They let it get away

You know it's never too late
Get up and start all over again
You know it's never too late
Theres gotta be a better way
Don't settle for the cold and rain
It's not too late to start again
Find a way to smile
And never let it get away

I'm gone, I'm gone
Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone
You know it's never too late
(I'm gone, I'm gone)
You know it's never too late
(Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone)
You know it's never too late
(I'm gone, I'm gone)
You know it's never too late
(Theres gotta be a better way, I'm gone)

You know it's never too late (I'm gone, I'm gone)
Get up and start all over again
You know it's never too late (I'm gone, I'm gone)
