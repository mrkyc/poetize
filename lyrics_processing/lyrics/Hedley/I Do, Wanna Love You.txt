When no one else could ever get through
Holding back 'til I come around
Time and time again you wait for me to come in
And did you really look my way?
There's not a lot of love these days
I would never, ever let you down
If I was running backwards in full time
So I can, and I will
And you'll see your hero come running
Over and over tonight
And I do wanna love you
(See me running back and)
And I do wanna try
(Never wanna see you cry)
If falling for you, girl, is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time
Me, I'm used to being tired and bloody
But you believed that I could be somebody
You put your world on hold for me
Gave away to follow failure through the fire
You might also likeSo I can, and I will
And you'll see your hero come running
Over and over tonight
And I do wanna love you
(See me running back and)
And I do wanna try
(Never wanna see you cry)
If falling for you, girl, is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time
Oh
What if I never let you down
And said sorry for the nights I can't remember ?
What if I never said to you I would try?
And I do wanna love you
(See me running back and)
And I do wanna try
If falling for you, girl, is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time, yeah
And I do wanna love you
(See me running back and)
And I do wanna try
(Never wanna see you cry)
If falling for you, girl, is crazy
Then I'm going out of my mind
So hold back your tears this time, time, time, time, time, time, time
This time, time, time, time, time, time, time
