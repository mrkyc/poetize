Is anybody listening now?
Does anybody miss me now?
What can I do to get through to you?
Cutting through the static and noise
I really wanna hear your voice
Need you tonight
I hate how we fight

Thinking of the last time I saw you smiling
Get it off my chest, I know it's been a while
And I could use a little face time
The face to face kind
We never break through, you're afraid of falling
I'm afraid too, it's murder in the morning
I don't want to be alone

So just pick up the phone
And say hello (Hello)
It's okay (It's okay)
You know (You know)
What they say (What they say)
If bad things happen on good TV
They could make a movie out of you and me
Don't be sad, don't let go
Don't say goodbye, just say hello (Hello)
It's okay (It's okay)
I don't care (I don't care)
What they say (What they say)
It gets better don't ever lose hope
Never giving up, not the end of the show
I'm not scared, don't let go
Don't say goodbye, just say hello

And this is how we stay alive
Do or die we gotta survive
Never too late
Whatever it takes
If love is just a battlefield
Then what we have's gotta be real
Day after day
It's all I can say

Thinking of the last time I saw you smiling
Get it off my chest, I know it's been a while
And I could use a little face time (A little face time)
The face to face kind (The face to face kind)
We never break through, you're afraid of falling
I'm afraid too, it's murder in the morning
I don't want to be alone

So just pick up the phone
And say hello (Hello)
It's okay (It's okay)
You know (You know)
What they say (What they say)
If bad things happen on good TV
They could make a movie out of you and me
Don't be sad, don't let go
Don't say goodbye, just say hello (Hello)
It's okay (It's okay)
I don't care (I don't care)
What they say (What they say)
It gets better don't ever lose hope
Never giving up, not the end of the show
I'm not scared, don't let go
Don't say goodbye, just say hello
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
No, I don't wanna be
No, you don't wanna be
Nobody wants to be alone

So just pick up the phone
And say hello (Hello)
It's okay (It's okay)
You know (You know)
What they say (What they say)

They could make a movie out of you and me (You and me, baby)
Don't be sad, don't let go
