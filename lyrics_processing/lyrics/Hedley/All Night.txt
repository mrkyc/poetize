How many ways can I say I'm sorry?
How many days can I wake up wishing I was back in your bedsheets?
Counting the tattoos on your body
Counting the ways that I could make it up to you if you let me

I know that it's bad
I know you don't understand
Broken phone, Peter Pan
Tryna grow up but I can't
Now you're probably getting stoned
And you wanna be alone
Leave a message at the tone
Why don't you come back home?

Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
I know I let you down
Girl I'm all yours now
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long

All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
All night

What if I needed you like oxygen?
What if I told you I still feel this way when I'm not wasted?
I wish we were running from the cops again
I guess I've been running my whole life
I think I'm ready to face it

I know that it's bad
I know you don't understand
Broken phone, Peter Pan
Tryna grow up but I can't
Now you're probably getting stoned
And you wanna be alone
Leave a message at the tone
Why don't you come back home?

Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
I know I let you down
Girl I'm all yours now
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long

All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
All night
Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
I know I let you down
Girl I'm all yours now
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long

All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
All night
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it up to you
Give me one more night
Let me love you right
I'm gonna make it up to you all night long
