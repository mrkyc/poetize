Falling a thousand feet per second, you still take me by surprise
I just know we can't be over, I can see it in your eyes
Making every kind of silence, takes a lot to realize
It's worse to finish than to start all over and never let it lie

And as long as I can feel you holding on
I won't fall, even if you said I was wrong

I'm not perfect
But I keep trying
'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start
I'm not alive if I'm lonely
So please, don't leave
Was it something I said or just my personality?

I know that I'm not perfect

Was it something I said or just my personality?

When you're caught in a lie, and you've got nothing to hide
When you've got nowhere to run, and you've got nothing inside
It tears right through me, you thought that you knew me
You thought that you knew

I'm not perfect
But I keep trying
'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start
I'm not alive if I'm lonely
So please, don't leave
Was it something I said or just my personality
I'm not perfect
But I keep trying
'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start
I'm not alive if I'm lonely
So please, don't leave
Was it something I said or just my, just myself?
Just myself
Myself
Just myself
