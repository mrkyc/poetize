My last cigarette lost the cherry
Reminds me of fallen idols
Their hearts on their sleeves when they're buried
And freedom don't come easy
Just show me the way and I'll meet you there
You're the one thing that I needed
I'm caught in the crossfire and I don't care
'Cause I try so hard
I never thought I'd fall so far
And everytime I do, I scar
But now I'm wide awake
So say, say, say you love me
Don't take, take, take too long, I'm falling
I'm way, way, way too lonely
The same great thing you always wanted
You're not alone
I'll never care how far you go
You'll always know it
Say, say, say you love me
'Cause I need to colour outside the lines
I'll cry on the inside
But nobody else can hear anything
You're an upside to my downfall
All of the sweetness without the sting
You might also likeAnd I try so hard
I never thought I'd fall so far
And everytime I do, I scar
But now I'm wide awake
So say, say, say you love me
Don't take, take, take too long, I'm falling
I'm way, way, way too lonely
The same great thing you always wanted
You're not alone
I'll never care how far you go
You'll always know it
Say, say, say you love me
'Cause I need to colour outside the lines
You can fall from grace and land on your feet
But if I'm gonna be anybody, I gotta be me
You can save some face and find room to breathe
And if I wanted, would you give it away?
So say, say, say you love me
Don't take, take, take too long, I'm falling
I'm way, way, way too lonely
The same great thing you always wanted
So say, say, say you love me
Don't take, take, take too long, I'm falling
I'm way, way, way too lonely
So lonely, so lonely
You can fall from grace and land on your feet
But if I'm gonna be anybody, I gotta be me
You can save some face and find room to breathe
And if I wanted, would you give it away?
You're not alone
I'll never care how far you go
You'll always know it
Say, say, say you love me
