Dreaming, staring out that window let your wings go
Keeping, secrets from yourself like is this the right life
Restless, breathing
Fake a smile you need it
Cageless, no ceiling
Baby run away screaming

Won't somebody save me
Sinking in a silent night
Talking to myself like
Am I going crazy
Like the animal inside of me

Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be crazy, oh-oh
Like the animal inside of me
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild

Forces, feeding on explosion but you're closed in
Choices, running from the sun down but you're free now
Restless, breathing
Fake a smile you need it
Faithless, no feeling
Baby run away screaming
You might also like
Won't somebody save me
Sinking in a silent night
Talking to myself like
Am I going crazy
Like the animal inside of me

Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be crazy, oh-oh
Like the animal inside of me
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be (born to be)

(Oh)
(Baby we were born, baby we were born)
(Babe)
(Hey, yeah)
Restless, breathing
Fake a smile you need it
Cageless, no ceiling
Baby run away screaming
Won't somebody save me (somebody save me)
Sinking in a silent night
Talking to myself like
Am I going crazy
Like the animal inside of me

Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be crazy, oh-oh
Like the animal inside of me
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
Wild wild wild wild
Baby we were born to be
