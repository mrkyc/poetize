Flying on a big jet plane
Gonna make it in the land of milk and honey
Oh when you called and said you're on your way
Gonna stake your claim
Make your money
I'm picturing you
With Manolos on your feet
Strutting cool down Carnaby Street
What a body
What a woman
Putty in your hand
All your one night stands
You just
You gotta keep them coming

Cause she's in fashion
She's chic
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
She's in fashion
Le freak
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
And she's my queen

There's more to life than sex appeal
But sometimes it takes an angel to remember
Oh and this lady she's the real deal
On the cover from December to December
Though her eyes - reveal her vanity
She's got soul, she's got class - and originality
She's got style and a personality
And she wears it on her sleeve

Cause she's in fashion
She's chic
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
She's in fashion
Le freak
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
And she's my queen

When I pull up on the scene
My tuxedo too clean
Red nails red lips 5 rings
And I keep my cuffs thicker than a bold magazine
Car like a felon in the back looking clean
We taking off like a dirty limousine
You ever met a girl with her pedals in the sand
Or wear a suit and tie way better than a man
Kansas to Atlanta,  from London to Copacabana
Electric Ladies, take a ride in my Mercedes

Cause she's in fashion
She's chic
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
She's in fashion
Le freak
She's the belle nouvelle on Boogie Street
And she's my queen
She's my queen
Lady is my queen
She's my queen
