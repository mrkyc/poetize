Building a house so we can fall at the first brick
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told
That it only gets harder from there!
Hmm, now that I'm young I just do what I do
I don't second guess too much
Shed my ties and I'm not that wise
I'm all grown up as such
But all the talk about the ring and the baby
Gets me every time
Am I big enough, strong enough to walk along your line?
Yeah, baby
Building a house so we can fall at the first brick
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told
That it only gets harder from there!
You see, I'm always on the hustle
That I don't know just how good I get it
That it's plenty of men out there with money and muscle
Look at these hips, baby, don't you forget them
Oh, but the curls will go, the money will spend
What we left within the end?
She's more than happy, she's taken her play
I'm saying, 'who's that bitch with my second name? '

Yeah, baby, truth be told
I'm only trying to keep my head above the water
Responsibility, turn on monogamy
I'm not a father, child
Are you a mother, are you?
Uh, my pride and joy
Yeah, you, you are my pride and joy!
