Oh, the phone, you know it never stops
It's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning
And as I let it start to burn my head
You slowly creep into bed
And I'm done with all the talking

You say you know how I'm feeling
I just need to try to settle down

Though a million faces pass my way
Oh, they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Though who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

Tired as hell and falling up the stairs
Filled with a thousand cares
As you walk out from the bedroom
And though it feels like all my fire has gone
Girl, you just turn me on
Can't believe how much I want you

You say you know how I'm feeling
I just need to try to settle down

Though one million faces pass my way
Oh, they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Though who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

We're distracted by the hard times
And the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean
Let it wash our cares away

Oh the phone you know it never stops
It's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning

Though a million faces pass my way
Oh, they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Though who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you
We're distracted by the hard times
And the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean
Let it wash our cares away
Though we're distracted by the hard times
And the troubles that we make, yeah
Let us throw them in the ocean
Let it wash our cares away
Let it wash our all cares away
