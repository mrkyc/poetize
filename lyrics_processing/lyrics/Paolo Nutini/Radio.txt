You put your faith in somethin' beautiful
Sell your reflection to the travellin' show
We leave ourselves a lot to answer for
I've left myself and now I wanna go home
And up there in your treehouse
Pigs and politicians go bump in the night
It'll take more than a superman (Oh)
To make us think that everything's alright

And there's nothin' on the radio
They're all talkin' like they're fallin' in love
Oh, there's nothin' on the radio
And then it hits me like a fist from above
I'm singin'
I, I, I, I want love, I want love
I, I, I, I want love, I want love

I, I, I
I, I, I

We half-remember all the promises we make
But they're like white noise to us now
We light our match and walk away, beside ourselves
And it's easy, hmm
These days are written on our face
And in the faith that we can change the script tonight
You know me better than I'll ever know myself
If you see me, take it easy on me

There's nothin' on the radio
