Another day is washed away
And all alibis are out
And the hand that used to heal me only cursed me now
The echoes of a woman so kind
Rain like waterfalls and ice-cream on my worried mind
I lay there in the puddle of myself
Fishing from a brand new wish from that bucket down the well
And in her colors I find my faith
Cause I remember every word that lady used to say

She said that hearts can't break themselves
Looking for something, leaving with nothing
But souls can't save themselves
Learning to fly, sweet mother of mine
Be a long way home without you
It's just a long way home without you
Yeah, yeah

That's my mother, like no other
Made me human, made me brother
And it's swelling with blister for my sake and my sisters
The guardian of my karma, keep my feet on terrain firmer
And then release me like a  to the sky

She said that hearts can't break themselves
Looking for something, leaving with nothing

Learning to fly, sweet mother of mine
Be a long home without you
It's just a long way home without you
Yeah, yeah

Sister, you have some hungry eyes
And by back you're hypnotized
Smiling faces in disguise
By back you're hypnotized
Keep going against the grain
And soon that's all, soon that's all you'll know
And soon that's all you'll know
And let's get this straight
Sometimes you'll rise, and there's time you'll fall
After all, you're just blood and bones
And you don't owe no one, oh
No, you don't owe no one
So don't live like one price is right
Cause there is some things in your life that you can't fight

She said that hearts can't break themselves
Looking for something, leaving with nothing
But souls can't save themselves
Learning to fly, sweet mother of mine
Be a long home without you
It's just a long way home without you
Yeah, yeah
She said that hearts can't break themselves
Looking for something, leaving with nothing
But souls can't save themselves
Learning to fly, learning to fly
She said that souls can't save themselves
Learning to fly, learning to fly
Oh souls can't save themselves
Learning to fly, learning to fly
Oh momma, how I love you
Learning to fly, learning to fly
No momma, how I love you
Learning to fly, sweet mother of mine
