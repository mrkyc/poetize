You say you want a lover and you need them now
Someone other from the lost and found
You're dancing with the Devil with your long dark hair
How are you? Let's dance like there's no one here
You say you want a lover and you need them now
Under the cover of the lost, you're found
You're dancing with the Devil with your perfect smile
How are you? Let's dance, baby, oh, let's dance, baby, oh, let's dance, baby

On your own, are you feeling so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light
On your own, are you dreaming so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light

You say you want somebody who can hear you scream
Heal your heart and baby, dream, dream, dream
You're dancing with the Devil with your heart like stone
Together, you're not gone, you're not gone, no, you're not gone, you're not

On your own, are you feeling so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light
On your own, are you dreaming so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light

Tonight, as I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore
As I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore
Tonight, as I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore
As I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore

On your own, are you feeling so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light
On your own, are you dreaming so alone?
Shine a light
Shine a light

Tonight, as I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore
As I lay in your arms
I don't know what to do or say anymore
Woah
Shine a light
Shine a light
