Yeah, mmm
Yeah, mmm

And back off loneliness and hello tenderness
I've been waiting for your call for so long
And it must've been hard just to follow your soul
To stick to the road that your heart wants you to go
And as you slide through the door with your morals on your sleeve
And I think it's time for all those morals to leave

So let's get down and freaky baby, let's get restless baby
C'mon get crazy with me, and I said

When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you and that's when we've got it goin' on

Oh, so many people think we've got it wrong
They all try to break us but we won't play along

So let's get down and dirty baby, let's get restless baby
C'mon get crazy with me, and I said

When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you and that's when we've got it goin' on

Oh going on and I was so distracted I was lost and abandoned
Ay, and I needed another home and you flew in my arms
You just flew right into my arms

And when you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you and that's when we've got it goin' on
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in all the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me I'm loving you and that's when we've got it goin' on

On and on
On
It's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
