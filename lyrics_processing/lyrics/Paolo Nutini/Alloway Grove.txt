Woah
La da da

Coming home again to see a girl thats prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Oh what fun
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I wonder if she's said to them as she said to me before

However much you use me baby, come on use me more
However much you use me baby, come on use me more

Then, then

Oh, getting off the train to see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
Oh, glory be
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And said to all those men as she has said to me before

However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more
However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more And more
And more, and more, and more

Arriving at the door just to be told the girl I'm missing's been in London for a while
No more northern skies for her
An' they say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see an' it says

However much I loved you, you will always love me more
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
And I guess it's true
However much she loves me I will always love her more

Part II

I have returned to the Northern skies
Where the summer had not touched the clouds that pass above
Oh, and I have returned to the somber greens
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay
And I have left a million stars
An' an ocean so lightly, so clearly blue
And I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures not yet begun
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing... through

Oh, for once there was beauty here for me
Under these white Northern skies
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again
Heartache and poetry
Under these Northern skies

The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing... through
Part III / Hidden Track: Last Request Acoustic Reprise

Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Oh, lay down beside me

And I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one-way road
Oh, and I realised all about your lies
And I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, no
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside...
