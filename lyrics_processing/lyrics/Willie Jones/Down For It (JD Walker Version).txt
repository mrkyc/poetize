I'm down for it
I'm open like a book, you can read me
Just tell me what ya needs be
Yeah, you know I got you (Know I got you)
Yeah, you know I got you (Know I got you)
Tell me what you want and I'll come through (Skrrt, skrrt)
And I ain't ever gonna front you
Yeah, you know I got you (Know I got you)
Yeah, you know I got you
I don't know what you're thinkin' about
But I'm here right now
Hope you know I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
I'm down for it
You know you can count on it
Baby, you know I'll stick around for this, 'round for this
We can do whatever you like (We can do whatever you like)
I'm down for it
Tell me what you want and we can plan on it
Baby, you know I'm the man for it, stick around for this
We can do whatever you like (We can do whatever you like)
I'm down for it
You might also likeSip Sauvignon Blanc in the colony
Ask "Can you ever learn to love a troubled man?"
And if you can you get Amazon stock with the new drop
Stuntin' make them bitches ask you what those shoes are
Got her, hot girl
That shit ain't expensive and it's not hers
Top floor at the Four Seasons
Think about you, start cheesin' for no reason
Ride with me, catch a vibe with me
And if we get pulled over will you lie for me?
And when I'm hard to forgive will you try for me?
And will you still love a nigga when you're tired of me?
I'm down for it
You know you can count on it
Baby, you know I'll stick around for this, 'round for this (I'll stick around)
We can do whatever you like (We can do whatever you like)
I'm down for it
Tell me what you want and we can plan on it (We can plan on it)
Baby, you know I'm the man for this, stick around for this (I'm the man)
We can do whatever you like (We can do whatever you like)
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you don't need nobody
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you don't need nobody
I'm down for it
