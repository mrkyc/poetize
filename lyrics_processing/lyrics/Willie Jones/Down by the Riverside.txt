Man, who is this?
Parlay, you know who this man is?
Tub, do you know? (I don't know him)
He not from around here
But let me tell him what we do around here (Yeah, yeah)
Listen up

Down by the riverside, hanky panky
Where them girls bad, yes, ma'am, please and thank you (Appreciate it)
Where them boys ride slow 'cause them roads is dangerous
It's a real thin line 'tween snakes and angels
Sun makin' me sweat (Sweat), cognac on my breath
Crawfish with the cornbread, yeah, this as real as it gets (Oh)
Knick knack, patty whack, give a dog a bone
Bitch, I'm Willie Jones, you already know

You can find me out where the corn and the cotton grow
Way down south crackin' bones, slammin' dominoes
Welcome to the ratchet, black zydeco rodeo
Boss hog, I'm a dog, I'm a billy goat
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (Yeah)
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (You can catch me)
Down by the riverside, by the riverside
This is how we throw it down, down by the riverside

Get (Get) that (That) mud off my tires
Dirty south in the house, comin' straight out the bayou (Bayou)
We got that catfish fryin', comin' fresh off the bottom
I got a bad bitch with a buckshot ridin' shotty
Met her down in Tulane ('Lane)
So you know she got good brain (Brain)
That's super dome, I'm super gone
Lord knows I ain't no saint (Oh)

You can find me out where the corn and the cotton grow
Way down south crackin' bones, slammin' dominoes
Welcome to the ratchet, black zydeco rodeo
Boss hog, I'm a dog, I'm a billy goat
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (Yeah)
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (You can catch me)
Down by the riverside, by the riverside
This is how we throw it down, down by the riverside

Do-si-do to the left (Left)
Do your one-two step (Step)
Spin around, then drop it down
Then slide and catch your breath
Now boot scoot to the right, huh
Tip your drink to the sky
Now act a fool, go on, ride the bull
'Cause that's the way that we ride, huh
You can find me out where the corn and the cotton grow
Way down south crackin' bones, slammin' dominoes
Welcome to the ratchet, black zydeco rodeo
Boss hog, I'm a dog, I'm a billy goat
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (Yeah)
Down by the riverside, by the riverside (You can catch me)
Down by the riverside, by-by the riverside
This is how we throw it down, down by the riverside

Do-si-do to the left (Left)
Do your one-two step (Two step)
Spin around, then drop it down
Then slide and catch your breath (By the riverside)
Now boot scoot to the right, huh
Tip your drink to the sky (By-by the riverside)
