Sip Sauvignon Blanc in the colony
Ask "Can you ever learn to love a troubled man?"
And if you can, you get Amazon stock with the new drop
Stuntin' make them bitches ask you what those shoes are
Got her, hot girl
That shit ain't expensive and it's not hers
Top floor at the Four Seasons
Think about you, start cheesin' for no reason, come on
Ride with me, catch a vibe with me
And if we get pulled over will you lie for me?
And when I'm hard to forgive will you try for me?
And will you still love a nigga when you're tired of me?

Champagne, diamonds and a Bentley truck
Ain't got nothing on my love
