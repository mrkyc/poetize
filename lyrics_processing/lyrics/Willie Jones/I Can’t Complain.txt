Air condition don't work
It's hot as shit
Car runnin' low on gas
Down to my last stash
Even though I bust my ass
I bust my ass
'Bout time for a penny for my thoughts to pay up
Wish the damn Dow Jones stock would stay up
Oh, why do I care?
I only got one shirt (What?)
And I got one life to live, I'ma live it
I'ma live it
I got one shot to show, I'ma sip it
I'ma sip it
And I'm here for the ride, with you by my side
I know that I'ma be alright
Yeah, I can't complain
I can't complain, no
I can't complain, I'ma do my thang
I can't complain
I can't complain, no
I can't complain, yeah, I got it made
'Cause I got you
You might also likeI can't complain
I can't complain
Got plans with my lady
With my baby, yeah
Traffic lookin' crazy (Skrt, skrt)
But I won't let it kill my vibe
Pull the car to the side
Party on the 405
Let's get it, yeah
Tossin' back drinks on the edge of the tailgate
Every breath you breathe should be a reason to celebrate
Watch the sun fall from the sky
'Cause it's about to be a good night
And I got one life to live, I'ma live it
I'ma live it
I got one shot to show, I'ma sip it
I'ma sip it
And I'm here for the ride, with you by my side
I know that I'ma be alright
Yeah, I can't complain
I can't complain, no
I can't complain, I'ma do my thang
I can't complain
