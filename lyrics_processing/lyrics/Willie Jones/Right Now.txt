A couple of nights I'd wish we'd go back
But all we got is the moment
So baby there's no slowin' down
Melodies turn to memories
And we'll sing so loud till our voice goes out
Let the sun go down in this ol' ghost town
I want your friend, there's no backin' out
You call your friends and I'll call mine
I'm wastin' my drink, I ain't wastin' no time
Gettin' wasted all night
What's nine to five when I'm with you?
All good things, they come to an end
And so do the bad, so let the good again
Grab a drink, grab a friend
And drown away your sins
Sippin' Bombay and lemonade
Bring it over my way
About to be a damn good night right now
Drinkin' out the bottle, hope to see you tomorrow
I ain't worried about my life right now
So shut your mouth and pull me closer
We'll dance until the night is over
But I ain't keepin' count
It's summer time on someone's time right now

A couple of days
A couple of ways I'm tryin' to get paid
But all I got is the moment
So, baby, there's no slowing down
Memories turn to melodies
And we'll sing so loud till our voice goes out
Let the sun go down in this ol' ghost town
I want your friend, there's no backin' out
You call your friends and I'll call mine
I'm wastin' my drink, I ain't wastin' no time
Gettin' wasted all night
What's nine to five when I'm with you

Grab a drink, grab a friend
And drown away your sins
Yeah, baby
Sippin' Bombay and lemonade
