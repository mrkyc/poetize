Yeah, yeah

Now them girls do a Tito's and cran splashin' in their hand
Swingin' their hips to a cover band
On the front row, huh
Ain't a word that they don't know
Them girls do a pair of KC's and Fendi jeans
Lookin' like they walked up out a magazine
Off a runway, uh
Super fly like a runway, uh

Got they midriff showin' and the pretty hair flowin' on down

Them girls do everything wrong at the right time
Raised right, but they sure got a wild side
A little Sunday mornin' and a little Friday night
Got the devil on her shoulder and a angel in her eyes
I'm just a sucker for the pretty smile
With them white toes tippin' and her finger on the dial
Nothin' really gets me, nothin' really makes my heart break into two
Like them girls do, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like
Them girls turn closin' time into a sunrise
And the next day, you can't get 'em off your mind
You wanna hit her up
Make you think about fallin' in love, yeah

Them girls do everything wrong at the right time
Raised right, but they sure got a wild side
A little Sunday mornin' and a little Friday night
Got the devil on her shoulder and a angel in her eyes
I'm just a sucker for the pretty smile
With them white toes tippin' and her finger on the dial
Nothin' really gets me, nothin' really makes my heart break into two
Like them girls do, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Like them girls do, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ain't my fault, wish I could love 'em all
Can't lie, I think I do

Them girls do everything wrong at the right time
Raised right, but they sure got a wild side
A little Sunday mornin' and a little Friday night
Got the devil on her shoulder and a angel in her eyes
I'm just a sucker for the pretty smile
With them white toes tippin' and her finger on the dial
Nothin' really gets me, nothin' really makes my heart break into two
Like them girls do, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
