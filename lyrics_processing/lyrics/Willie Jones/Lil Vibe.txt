Some country tunes and the best weed
That's all I need
We'll post up in your backyard
Talking shit till it gets dark

I ain't go no type
We can pop a couple bottles
Go on, tell me what you like

I really reckon that we connect on it, yeah
All I need is you, a lil' wine, a lil' time
And we can catch a lil' vibe
Catch a lil' vibe
I ain't gotta spend the night
Let's catch a lil' vibe
