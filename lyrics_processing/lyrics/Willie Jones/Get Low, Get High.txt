You gotta get low so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singin' la-da-da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine
(La-da-da-da) To get by
You gotta get down so you can get up
All you really need is a little bit of love
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low so you can get high

I woke up on the floor and the sky is pourin'
I'm gettin' tired of feelin' like this every mornin'
I looked into the mirror and I can't ignore it
I'm feelin' the weight, hey
There ain't no brushin' off the world on your shoulder
I figured out that you go under to get over
So if you're someone out there lookin' for some closure
Well, I gotta say

You gotta get low so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singin' la-da-da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine
(La-da-da-da) To get by
You gotta get down so you can get up
All you really need is a little bit of love
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low so you can get high

You gotta get low so you can get high
You gotta scrub the ground if you wanna touch the sky
Singin' la-da-da-da, you need the rain before the sunshine
(La-da-da-da) To get by
You gotta get down so you can get up
All you really need is a little bit of love
So lean your seat back, buckle up, it's a long ride
You gotta get low so you can get high, yeah

Uh, get high
