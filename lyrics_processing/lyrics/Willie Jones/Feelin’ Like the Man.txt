Nothin' stays the same
I ripped my shirt and lost my shoes
Don't remember anything
You live and learn, that's what they say
Forget 'bout yesterday
'Cause I'm cool if you cool
So we cool, we can do what we wanna do
So if you wanna roll tonight, let's roll tonight
Tryna get up high tonight, high tonight
We can live forever young and never die
We can do what we wanna do, baby
I feel it in my bones, don't wanna let it go
'Cause I'm feelin' like the man right now
Feelin' like the, feelin' like the man right now
It ain't no backin' out, tonight I'm blackin' out
'Cause I'm feelin' like the man right now
Feelin' like the, feelin' like the man right now
I'm feelin' like the man, I'm feelin' like the man right now, right now
I'm feelin' like the man, I'm feelin' like the man right now
Remind me of the things I said
I probably really meant it
My mind is drunk, my heart is sober
My feelings, I get in 'em
