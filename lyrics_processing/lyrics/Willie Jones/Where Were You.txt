I thought you'd be around
But somethin' switched up when the road got rough
I thought you'd always hold me down
You said you were a real one
You said you'd always be by my side
You said you were a real one
I thought you were my ride or die
Where were you when the sun went down
When the sun went down, down?
Where were you when the lightnin' struck
And the thunder began to roll?
Where were you when the sun went down
And the warm weather turned to cold?
Where were you when the curtain closed?
I know you was puttin' on a show
Thought we was rollin', all along you was strollin'
Ha, but when it got low
You went ghost, let you get close
You saw the clothes, you wanted the dough
You was doin' the most and I shoulda known
You showed your colors, it wasn't long
I knew that somethin' was goin' on
Honey bee when my name was buzzin'
Then flipped and told me I'm good for nothin'
You might also likeI hit your line just to see what's up
After that you weren't showin' no love
Don't you come around with your hand out
'Cause I'm the man now, chick, you should stand down
Where were you when the lightnin' struck
And the thunder began to roll?
Where were you when the sun went down
And the warm weather turned to cold?
Where were you when the curtain closed?
I know you was puttin' on a show
Thought we was rollin', all along you was strollin'
Ha, but when it got low
You went ghost, let you get close
You saw the clothes, you wanted the dough
You was doin' the most and I shoulda known (You was doin' the most)
Listen
Where your ass was at when I needed you?
And when you wasn't eatin' I was feedin' you
I couldn't find you daytime with binoculars
And now you poppin' up just 'cause I'm popular
That's awkward, yeah, just stop it, yeah
Said, "Move around, move around 'cause you let me down"
'Cause I'm goin' out, so move around
(I'm goin' out, so move around)
Girl, move around 'cause you let me down
Where were you when the lightnin' struck
And the thunder began to roll?
Where were you when the sun went down
And the warm weather turned to cold?
Where were you when the curtain closed?
I know you was puttin' on a show
Thought we was rollin', all along you was strollin'
Ha, but when it got low (Said, "I thought we was rollin'")
(But you went ghost) You went ghost, let you get close
You saw the clothes, you wanted the dough
You was doin' the most and I shoulda known (You was doin' the most)
