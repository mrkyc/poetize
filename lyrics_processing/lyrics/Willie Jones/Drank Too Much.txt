Lights low, Jim Beam
I saw you, you saw me
I'm bossed up 'cause I had a couple drinks
We talked
We danced
Slipped off from my friends now
We're gettin close in the back of ya Jeep
Girl, you're way out of my league
Good thing that I drank too much
Took a shot, went and got it off my chest
Glad I didn't think too much
Getting shot down wasn't running through my head
It was that black dress, brown eyes
Red lips, blue light
Girl, I gotta get me a kiss
Lucky me, I tipped my cup 'fore you showed up
Good thing that I drank too much
Good thing that I drank too much
Wake up
Head's hurting
But she's lookin' so perfect
Good lovin', no I don't deserve it
Makin' this hangover worth it

Took a shot, went and got it off my chest
Glad I didn't think too much
Getting shot down wasn't running through my head
It was that black dress, brown eyes
Red lips, blue light
Girl, I gotta get me a kiss
Lucky me, I tipped my cup 'fore you showed up
Good thing that I drank too much
Good thing they were pouring them drinks too strong
Now my heart's like my head, just a little bit gone
Good thing that I drank too much
I took a shot went and got it off my chest
Glad I didn't think too much
Getting shot down wasn't running through my head
It was that black dress, brown eyes
Red lips, blue light
Girl, I gotta get me a kiss
Lucky me, I tipped my cup 'fore you showed up
Good thing that I drank too much
Good thing that I drank too much
Oh, oh, oh
