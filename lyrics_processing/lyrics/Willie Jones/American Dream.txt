Young man, young man
Got the heart of a lion and the drive of a wild horse
Young man, young man
Better watch how you step when you step off the front porch
Your granddad done went through hell
Don't take for granted what he built
Young man, young man
If you don't know your roots
Then you don't know what you stand for

Proud to be a Black man
Livin' in the land of the brave and the free
Yeah, I'm all-American
And that American dream ain't cheap
We've come a long way
Still got a long way to go
When you're livin' as a Black man
It's a different kinda 'merican dream
It's a different kinda 'merican dream

One man, one man
Put his life on the line for the folks tryna break chains
One man, one man
Rode in deep in the streets with a dream just to make change
One man, one man
Still in the field, had to kneel for the same thing
Run, man, run, man
You know we ain't done yet
You might also like
Proud to be a Black man
Livin' in the land of the brave and the free
Yeah I'm all-American
And that American dream ain't cheap
We've come a long way
Still got a long way to go
When you're livin' as a Black man
It's a different kinda 'merican dream
It's a different kinda 'merican dream

A lot of people die for the flag
A lot of people lie for the flag
Seen a lot of songs for the flag
Do a lot of wrong for the flag
Some people can't breathe for the flag
Had to take a knee for the flag
I really wanna ride for the flag
But I gotta keep an eye on the flag

With skin black as night
A Black boy runs for his life
Faced down by the hounds of a checkered past
Objectified, commodified, and scrutinized by blue eyes
And blue and white lights dancing off his skin
As he dances in the wind
Fists raised, Black saves, Black blood
Black love, Black blood, Black love
Black love, Black love, Black love, Black love
White man, white man
Could you spare a little change
'Cause it's change at the front door
White man, white man
Can you do it right, man

Proud to be a Black man
Livin' in the land of the brave and the free
Yeah I'm all-American
And that American dream ain't cheap
We've come a long way
Still got a long way to go
When you're livin' as a Black man
It's a different kinda 'merican dream
We've come a long way (We pledge allegiance)
Still got a long way to go (Look at how they treat us)
(They turn around and beat us)
It's a different kind of 'merican dream (I guess we all fight the demons)
We've come a long way (We've come a long way)
Still got a long way to go (But we've got a long way to go)
When you're livin' as a Black man (Oh oh oh)
