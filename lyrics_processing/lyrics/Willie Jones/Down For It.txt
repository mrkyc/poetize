I'm open like a book, you can read me
Just tell me what your needs be
Yeah, you know I got you
Yeah, you know I got you
Tell me what you want and I'll come through (Skrrt skrrt)
And I ain't ever gonna front you

But I'm here right now (Here right now)
Hope you know I'll never let you down

Baby, you know I'll stick around for this, 'round for this
We can do whatever you like
'Cause I'm down for it
Tell me what you want and we can plan on it
Baby, you know I'm the man for it, stick around for this
