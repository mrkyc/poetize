She's about the prettiest thing in the state
So I went down to the DMV
Was gonna get me some vanity plates
I told 'em: "She's my everything; she's my dream come true:
"If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
"It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
"I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L."
So I called up Dave, formerly a jet-fighter;
Currently a sky-writer, when you pay him cash
I told him what I wanted him to give me:
He said: "I'll get so dizzy, I'll prob'ly crash."
I told him: "She's my everything; she's my dream come true:
"If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
"It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
"I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L."
(That girl.)
(C'mon baby.)
So I went down to the emporium:
I'm gonna get me some epidermal art
I'm savin' up every penny 'cause
It'll cost me plenty, man, an' it's gonna smart
