Well, we're two country singers, we got golden fingers and we're loved everywhere we go
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth at ten thousand dollars a show
We take all kinds of pills, that give us all kind of thrills but the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll get you when you get your picture on the cover of The Rolling Stone
Rolling Stone, wanna see my picture on the cover
Rolling Stone, wanna buy five copies for my mother
Rolling Stone, wanna see my smilin' face, on the cover of The Rolling Stone
I got a freaky old lady name o' Cocaine Kitty who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor ol' grey haired daddy, drivin' my limousine
Now it's all designed to blow our minds but our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll getcha when you get your picture on the cover of The Rolling Stone
Rolling Stone, wanna see my picture on the cover
Rolling Stone, wanna buy five copies for my mother
Rolling Stone, wanna see my smilin' face, on the cover of The Rolling Stone
We got a lot of little teenage blue eyed groupies who'll do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru, who's teachin' us a better way
We got all the friends, that money can buy, so we'll never have to be alone
And we keep gettin' richer but we can't get our picture on the cover of The Rolling Stone
