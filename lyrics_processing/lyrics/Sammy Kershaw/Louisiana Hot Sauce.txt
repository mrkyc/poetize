Little Susanna, down in Louisiana
Pretty as she can be
All the boys want her, they even say she's gonna
But she don't want nobody but me
Now I'm a lucky fellow, 'cause they all try to tell her
Girl you better leave him alone
But none of them can see, what she sees in me
She loves me way down to the bone
She'll sit around and tease 'em
Tell 'em she can please 'em
But I know that she's taking me home
Well well well
She's Louisiana Hot Sauce
Hotter than a fireball
Smoother than strawberry wine
She's lookin' good as I've seen
Strollin' in her tight jeans
Drivin' me out of my mind
Believe me there's no other
That comes in up above her
She knocks me right down to my knees
You might also likeWell I know I could never have it any better
She spins me like a washing machine
And every time I hold her, man I start to smolder
When she pours her lovin' on me
She's Louisiana Hot Sauce
Well well well
She's Louisiana Hot Sauce
Hotter than a fireball
Smoother than strawberry wine
She's lookin' good as I've seen
Strollin' in her tight jeans
Drivin' me out of my mind
Believe me there's no other
That comes in up above her
She knocks me right down to my knees
I know I could never have it any better
She spins me like a washing machine
And every time I hold her, man I start to smolder
When she pours her lovin' on me
Well well well
She's Louisiana Hot Sauce
Hotter than a fireball
Smoother than strawberry wine
She's lookin' good as I've seen
Strollin' in her tight jeans
Drivin' me out of my mind
Believe me there's no other
That comes in up above her
She knocks me right down to my knees
I know I could never have it any better
She spins me like a washing machine
And every time I hold her, man I start to smolder
When she pours her lovin' on me
She's Louisiana Hot Sauce
