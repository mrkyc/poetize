And the sweat, it burns my eyes
Day in, day out, it's all the same
On this hot assembly line
I watch the hours of my life
Get chewed up by that clock
I'm gonna lose my mind if I don't find
A way out of this box
Stuck in a rut
Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud
It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck
I'm gonna take every dollar that I made
Out of that farmer's bank
Make one last stop at the Tiger mart
Gonna fill up that thirsty tank
Gonna find a road to a new zip code
They can kiss my hotel lights
It's never too late to start again
I've wasted too much time

Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud
It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck
I'm a little burned out
A little ticked off
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, sometimes Sunday
Stuck in a rut
Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud
It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck, no, no
