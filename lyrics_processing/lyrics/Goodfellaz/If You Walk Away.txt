And touch me like you do
But still the girl ain't you to me
The world will turn the way it does
But I won't be in love
The way that I am now, you see
I was caught up in your words
Goodbye was all I heard
All I heard
Chorus:
I would cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
What are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
Cause you take my heart with you
If you walk away
So girl, if there was something wrong
You held it in too long
Cause now this fool belongs to you
Oh girl, won't you give me one more day
I'll find something new to say
Some sweet lie to make you stay with me
Now I know, you've been tied up in your doubts
Oh girl, but I still believe that we can work it out
You might also likeChorus:
I would cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
What are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
Cause you take my heart with you
If you walk away
Stay
Baby don't walk
Baby don't walk
Walk away from me
Now I know you are
Tied up in your doubts
But I still believe
That we can work it out
Chorus:
I would cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
What are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
Cause you take my heart with you
If you walk away
The girl, may smile the way you do
Touch me like you do
