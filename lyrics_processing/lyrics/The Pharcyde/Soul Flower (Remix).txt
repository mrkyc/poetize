Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah

People hear and wonder and they wanna know how and why
But let me first introduce myself, I'm tagging name Romye
I'm twenty years of age, I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries, but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that's I, hi, I better get by because my ally
About to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some Thai

I need some Zig-Zag, Zig-Zag
I need some Zig-Zag, Zig-Zag
I need some Zig-Zag, Zig-Zag
How I love to get high

Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah
Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah

Oh, what the heck?
Niggas just wanna get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a Chevy and in fact
The Pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point, there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In '92, we take cash, '93, we take loot
'Cause the vinyl is delicious, I'm the nigga who's ambitious
Michael Ross is the genie, he's giving us our wishes
One, I wanna just jam with your band
(Two) You gotta play it all across the land
(Three) The plan is grab the ducats
And say fuck it to the critics, hey now
I was walkin' down the street, bellin' to the beat
Phat beats in my head, tennis shoes on my feet
Nigga tried to flex, but he had to be smoked
So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke, what?

Shot him in the ass on the downstroke (Yep)
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke (Shot him in the ass)
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke (On the downstroke)
Souped on the beat like a bowl of chicken noodles
I love Spanish dishes, but no, I'm not Menudo
I can dig kung fu, I flip hoes like judo
Never date a chick who has a mom named Bruno
Or Edna bonedna, bananafanafuno
Yet you know Shafino, met her in a trio
Souped up my glass jet, flew her ass to Rio
I'm somewhat Creole just like the man of steel
I'm not your carbon copy, but your first draft jalopy for real
I used to deal, but the fuzz popped me
I had the hydros, but they repoed my crops and steel
I chills like scotch on the rocks
'Cause I just gets paid for them hardcore props
You know?

How long can you freak the funk?
How long can you freak the funk?
I separate the good stuff from the junk (Freak the funk)
How long can you freak the funk?
Yeah (Freak the funk)
Alright (Freak the funk)
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
I want the farmer man (Farmer man)
I want the farmer man (You want the farmer man?)
Yeah, I want the farmer man (You don't want no farmer man)
Give me the farmer man (Once again, it's the farmer man)
I go from Skip Scott to hip-hop to be-bop to P-Funk
Cutting enough bullshit to turn a tree into a tree trunk
'Cause we've sunk ships from the Pacific to the Atlantic
I dig dips who've got the hips that are gigantic
'Cause I'm frantic, take you in a frenzy
Takin' you out is easier than pulling a pull-out out of a Benzie
Box when I rocks the orthodox styles to make you squirm
Yes, I come from Cali, no, I do not have a perm
I stand firm on the mic device when I gets nice
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
I got more flavor than 7-Eleven Slurpees
If Magic can admit he got AIDS, fuck it, I got herpes

Damn
Aw shit
An S,  an S
Sounds like an S to me
Ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah, ah
