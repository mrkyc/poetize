If I were president, if I were president
I'd make sure all the money spent
On good things (Good things)
I wouldn't have no lint in my pocket
I'd rock it, I'd rock it, I'd shock it
I would not jock the fact that there are
Rich people in the world because, yo, I got a girl
And she needs new clothes and I need new sneakers (New sneakers)
And that's all I know
If I were president, if I were president
If I were president, if I were president
If I was president (What would you do?)
I would not carry, oh, no spare change
I would just rearrange the whole government structure
'Cause there seems to be something that's messing with the flucture of the money (What?)
It's not coming to me
So now, it's time for me to tell my homie Jammer Dee
So I'm looking at my wallet and I do not have a buck
