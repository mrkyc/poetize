Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'll tell you what's up, I'll tell you, tell you, tell you what's up

When you sign across the line, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time (What?), it's jiggaboo time
When you're runnin' out of lyrics, it's jiggaboo time (What?)
It's jiggaboo time (What?), it's jiggaboo time
Yo, when you rappin' for the money, it's jiggaboo time (What?)
It's jiggaboo time (What?), it's jiggaboo time
When you don't have a plan, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
You're rappin' for the white man, it's jiggaboo time (What? What?)
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
When you don't have soul, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
Nigga, when there's pork in your bowl, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
Lots and lots of pork in your bowl, it's jiggaboo time
A real big bowl of fat, wait a minute, wait a minute
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time

Show me them teeth, baby
Okay, could you bug your eyes out just a little bit?
(Yeah, straighten that ass out)
I mean, you know, real ghetto
Okay, we'll shoot the video over here
We need, um, like a street area, you know
Wear some tees with some holes in it
Wear some gold chains, all that bullshit
Fuck all that bullshit
I ain't going out like no sucker
But we're all jiggaboos
Yeah, in our own way
