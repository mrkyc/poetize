One chance, one chance to, one chance

I'm no professional dancer (one chance)
Baby, I ain't no Michael Jackson (one chance)
But I would learn any move
Get with any groove
Just to dance with you
I'll let my feet do the talkin'
I met her out when I'm walkin'
Show you what I can do
And you know it's true
When I dance with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give me your hand
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll be who I am
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance

Give me one chance, one chance to, one chance, one chance, one chance, one chance to dance
Give me one chance, one chance to, one chance, one chance, one chance, one chance to dance
You might also like
I'm no professional dancer
Baby, give me your answer
I'll practice everyday
Don't care what record plays
When I dance with you
You take the lead and I'll follow
I'll take my pride and I'll swallow
May not have Jagger moves
But I ain't gonna lose
When I dance with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give me your hand, I'll be who I am
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance

Give me one chance, one chance to, one chance, one chance, one chance, one chance to dance
Give me one chance, one chance to, one chance, one chance, one chance, one chance to dance

And if I fall to my knees
I won't crumble and freeze
I'll pick myself up and I'll try it again, and again until you see
I'll take you by the hand
Just listen to me
Oh, baby, if you could just give me a half of a chance
To make you understand
I know exactly who I am
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
Give me one chance, one chance to dance
Give me one chance, one chance to dance
I ain't no Michael Jackson
But give me one chance, one chance to dance
One chance, one chance to dance
