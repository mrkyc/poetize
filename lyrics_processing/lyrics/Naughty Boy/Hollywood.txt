Cos I'm getting mine now
Everybody's following me
Golden girl, they come in for free
Fast friends and fast emotives
Than I ever had before this
I'm loving all the mirrors and smoke
I'm in shallow waters keeping afloat
I don't need no-one else
I will keep telling myself
That I'm a star
Yes you're a star
Yeah you're a star
If you can remember when we took the fall
Tell them that they love me that we had it all
Keep the stories and photographs
What we gon' do when Hollywood won't call us back?
If you can remember when we took the fall
Tell them that they love me that we had it all
Keep the stories and photographs
What we gon' do when Hollywood won't call us back?
Cracks start to show now
Lost my grip on things somehow
They're paying her more than me
Wind blew over my money tree
Crowds getting quiet, tell me if I dance for you would you buy it?
Taking too damn long to return my call
Whispers shout writing's on the wall
You might also likeI don't need no-one else
I will keep telling myself
That I'm a star
Yeah you're a star
Yeah you're a star
If you can remember when we took the fall
Tell them that they love me that we had it all
Keep the stories and photographs
What we gon' do when Hollywood won't call us back?
If you can remember when we took the fall
Tell them that they love me that we had it all
Keep the stories and photographs
What we gon' do when Hollywood won't call us back?
If you can remember when we took the fall
Tell them that they love me that we had it all
Keep the stories and photographs
What we gon' do when Hollywood won't call us back?
They won't call you anymore
You're not welcome at their door
