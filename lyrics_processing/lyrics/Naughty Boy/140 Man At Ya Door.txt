I got Z's, I need sleep
I got Z's, I need sleep
What the hell? That's your girl
Doing me and the team
Get a brick, get my scales
Answer the phone, what do you need?
Hit the strip, do the sale
My pockets filled up with the Queen
I'm the king, got the bling
See me flashing on the street
He got that and he got this and
But, none of them more than me
Take the mick, take the piss
You shouldn't do that on the street
Had the thingy in the basement
Put that brap brap on the street

Bigs and wait in his ride
Who's that brutro?
Get the hootie, let's slide
Or a beat, let me dump off
They bump Section everywhere
On their lappies and their iPods
Trap mode, yeah I hit the roads
With my trackie and my Nikes on
One-forty man at your door
So you better keep them lights off
In the studio, Naughty Boy
Smoking el , I'm high up
Ain't gotta jump out the car
When we pull up it's a write off
Book a full up at the Queen
Little man, you better size up
You might also like
I got G's, I need sleep
Had the dome blank kicking all week
Look at my swag, nigga, no it ain't cheap
Running through green, mans got a whole heap
Come to your door, one-forty man deep
Put the mask on, no trick or no treat
From a young boy, I been naughty, when the jakes caught me
Told them "No, I don't speak"
Is that your girl? Why's she looking at me?
Peng ting looking on fleek
Listen, it's peak, them niggas ain't got toys
Them man, they're telling stories
I got Queens in my jeans
Cause man will move Harry and Charlie
Same routine, I need C.R.E.A.M
Manna sky that, watch everyone scream

I'm with Wally, I'm with Nine
I'm with Lit, I'm with Stee
I'm with Dangro, I'm with Flip
I'm with Swift, they with me
I know hoes don't kiss, don't tell
Might tell a ho just in a hotel
I need clientele
Working the scales, then I do street
When man does road, man's raw, peak
1-4-0 at your door, peak
Meet and greet, been running Z's all day
Been getting puss all week
Mental case, teeth like a dental case
Man might give a man teefs
Dope like kicking like Lee, Naughty's spilling amnese
More money that a man see
Running through these bricks
With my phones
You know how it go
Better grab your ho
Got your bitch up in the sheets
Doing me, on her knees
I got money in my jeans
I get that from doing street
I got what you need
I got what you're seeking, boy
Manna don't fuck with police
I tell a man's function, void
Jump out, make the ting
La la la la, Naughty Boy
Tell a big man for my boy
I'm travelling sporty toys

Manna put it on the street
Man, it's looking kinda peak
Gyal ah do road
Wifey do street
Man, the trapping life good
But the rapping life's sweet
Man, I need me a mansion
And some oversea suites
I'll piss on 'em, flip on 'em
Shit on 'em, kick on this beat
I pick up and flip up
And piff up and switch up a week
I love this, I does this
We run this, the Section with me
He got it, he pop it
