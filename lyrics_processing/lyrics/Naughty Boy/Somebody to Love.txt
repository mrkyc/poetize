When the truth is found to be lies
And all of the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to somebody
You better find somebody to love

Look
We trying to find somebody
Look in my eyes
You'll see I'm somebody
Inside one's body, you're somebody
I'm seeing drug abusers in the A&E lobby
Could have been somebody
Should have seen one's body
Looking sorry like I just want to love somebody
Want to see, want to touch, want to hug somebody
Put the drugs down, be around somebody
All I see is sorrow so I down some voddy
And we walk around with a pocket full of pound signs
Ignore the beggar outside the offy
Got to smell some coffee
Got to help somebody
See a young girl go and sell one's body
And we ain't got the heart to go and tell somebody
It doesn't take a real man to kill somebody
But it takes a man of his word to heal somebody
When the economy collapses
And the world stops spinning on its axis
We're being dragged through hell, backwards
Mother Nature can't take the weight
The population inflates
Global warming's still a threat that we ignore because we ain't stressed
There's a war going on outside your doorstep
I wish these politicians would talk less
All we have is each other in the end
Keep in contact with your brothers and your friends
How can we praise a man's death
Put it on the front page of every paper
They're playing with our heads
I feel something coming in the wind
Just look at all the trouble that we're in
This Christmas love's the only gift
Make sure it's the one you're gonna give
