First of all
I don't know who y'all saw on this stage before me (Alright)
I don't know who y'all are gonna see on this stage after me (True)
But this is real hip-hop
Word up
I'm gonna find out tonight where the real hip-hop

The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here

Blaow-blaow, blaow-blaow
Clear 'em out, clear 'em out
Word
Yo, Nelly

You ain't for real and you ain't universal
Your whole style sounds like an N'Sync commercial
Ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challenging the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With this ugly look in the Billboard, you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my own top ten
You limited, like the speed of traffic
You bite my style off the radio, so when you speak it back, I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen-bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Got ya on your hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real emcees?

We on the hunt tonight
When you see me coming, I don't front, I fight
People say I'm contradictory
'Cause I'm all about peace, to say the least, with a violent history
It ain't no mystery, these rappers wanna get with me
My people don't see that all they hear is "Stop hittin' me!
Stop beatin' me, Kris!"
You want to help my career, Nelly? Well, you can help if you don't exist
I think it's 'bout time we stop these pop rappers
Fuck these pop rappers, hip-hop does matter to me
Does it matter to you, my crew?
If it does, you know what the hell to do
Throw your guns in the air, pump it like "Yeah"
Let these bitch-ass rappers know we in here
Go to the shows, huh, boo 'em off stage
Tell 'em KRS told you they're at the end of they days
Let me tell you, let's give hip-hop a lift
And don't buy Nelly's album on June 25th
That'll send a message back to all them sellouts
House nigga rapper, your bottom done fell out
You don't even know how
I told you I wasn't talking about you then, but I'm talking about you now
Blaow, one to the knees, blaow
One goes right through
