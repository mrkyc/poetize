This is not the regular, this is that boom-bap, bap, bap
Some, they call it secular, I just call it Black, Black, Black
Marcus Garvey, Boukman Dutty, bring that army back, back, back
Malcolm X and Kwame Ture, this is where I'm at, at, at
If you wanna talk to me, talk to me about Black, Black, Black
Haile Selassie The First, Negus Nagast, let's talk about that, that, that
Kaboom, Nanny Maroon and all the Maroons, let's talk about that, that, that
The real Underground Railroad, the first subway for Black, Black, Black
The freedom train begets what you bring, getting on track, track, track
Whether justice or injustice, how do you react-act-act?
Can you stand there laughing while they shoot us in the back, back, back?
This is what some rappers sound like every time they rap, rap, rap
I'm raising up the red and the green and the black, black, black
Even with no cops in the hood, we still hear, "Click-click, clack-clack-clack"
I cannot forget my ancestors just because I rap, rap, rap
Look at me from top to bottom, KRS is Black, Black, Black

Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what Black about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what I rap about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
Too many selling out
Get up, get out
Reach up, reach out
Lift up, lift out
Get out

Time to ask the question now, are you really Black, Black, Black?
It is not a mystery, we under attack-tack-tack
If you chatting fuckery, you hold our people back, back, back
Time to put aside the fantasy and deal with fact, fact, fact
This is not the time to be talking all that crap, crap, crap
Those that talk that crap, crap, crap are those that don't fight back, back, back
You can say what you like, but real skill, I never lack, lack, lack
Black is more a consciousness, the way you think and act, act, act (Yo)

Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what Black about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what I rap about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
Too many selling out
Get up, get out
Reach up, reach out
Lift up, lift out
