One, two, two, two, two
Public service announcement for all the people out there listening to this funky-ass boom bap album
Check it out
Take a second
Just, just take a second
Take a second
Just chill out for a minute, take a second
Check this out
Just some mad cool-out
And we just chillin' right here in D&D Studio
It's about 5 o'clock in the morning
We gonna talk about what you believe in
We gonna talk about how you've been trained
So we gonna come down like this, let me take you to another level

After seven years of rockin', how do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for theirs lately
Yo, mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See, it's funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life tryin' to be all you can be
In the Army, not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo, get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long overdue
So it become procrastination 'cause freedom is within you
For some reason, we think we're free
So we'll never be, because we haven't recognized slavery
You still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what master gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our oppressor's religion
So in the case of slavery, it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of their God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level

Title, take the title from the Bible, we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughin' and drinkin' and singin' and kissin' me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I'd like to ask these politicians, "Would Jesus vote?"
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture, same scripture that whipped you
Soon it'll hit you, religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker and sicker and sicker
Like liquor, we are God-intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same government tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measles
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education you get on God is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Believers of Jesus be denouncin' Satan on every level
But every Halloween, they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother, make them know that you're livin' within them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy, Mother, 'cause I know that you're mad at them
The white Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michelangelo
I know this happened in 1519, yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
