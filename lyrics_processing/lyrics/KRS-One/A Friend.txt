The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh!
I send this one out to my right hand man, or mens
Or womens, the whole crew, the real fam

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

If we can't have trust, then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond, we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys, we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin' toys
It ain't about your Benz, I hope it ain't about mine
My man, I be dissin' in my freestyle rhyme
Gettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl, my man
We chillin' at the jam, what's the plan?
I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin', I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in? True friends are quick to sit in the beginning of all trouble
And when your bankroll doubles
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble
Still, I got my own space like Hubble

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot, then they all wanna crowd us
And wanna shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin' large, I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace, there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus, we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo, the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get what they can get
Sit quickly backstabbin' the clique
I roll thick, but only some are friends really down to the end
My right hand men and women
Mutual support, from the beginnin'
Been in, exactly what I've been in
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

Back to back, we attack corporate America
Gettin' fees that amount to G's in every area
You my man, I ain't gotta drag you along
You pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin' on
I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bumpin' car system thumpin'
Between the crew, we always got somethin'
But if we had nothin', no frontin' whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together
Word, fake people ain't worth a turd
They only want to be your friend because of what they overheard
I send this record to the well respected
Friends that I've collected
I hope I am what you expected

So check it, so check it
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
