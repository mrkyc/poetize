Uh, yeah, hey

Walking 'round middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
'Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'ma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular or sick freak, girl, I say okay
So come on and leave me 'cause the deeper you take me, the better, better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I will be down and throw it at that level

Ooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Ooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...
See Justin Timberlake LiveGet tickets as low as $10You might also like
You dancing 'round, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all of that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder
Maybe you need to watch out, something might go down
Girl, your body's gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular or freak chic
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl, don't be stingy, the more that you give me, the better, better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want The bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
