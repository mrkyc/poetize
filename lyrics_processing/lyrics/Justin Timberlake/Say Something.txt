Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still, in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony for you and me tonight
(Ooh, whoa) I hear them call my name

Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin' at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin' at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin'

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)

Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin' at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin' at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
