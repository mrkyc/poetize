Hey, pretty lady
This goes out to you (This goes out to you, you, you, yeah)
I know I said it, like, a thousand times
But every day still feels like the first day (This goes out to you, you, you, yeah)
This is dedicated to you, you, you, yeah
Dedicated to you, you, you, yeah
Dedicated to you, you, you, yeah
Dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk by
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by (When you walk by, huh), when you walk
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow mellow, mellow, mellow day
Listen

I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye, eye
Then somethin' strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my "Do Not Disturb" sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your lovin', it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothin'
That I'd ever seen before
And baby, please don't change nothin'
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Smackin' that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Poppin' that strawberry bubblegum
(Go 'head, girl)
This goes out to you
(Yeah)
This goes out to you

So tell me why we're makin' love like professionals on the first time
Actin' unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don't wanna work here anyway
And baby, I, girl, I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me, that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothin' but clothes in the way
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your lovin', it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothin'
That I'd ever seen before
And baby, please don't change nothin'
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Smackin' that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Poppin' that strawberry bubblegum

Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want, now, my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door
Girl, before they pick up your scent, ah
