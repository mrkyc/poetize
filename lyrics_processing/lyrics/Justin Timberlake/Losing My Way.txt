Hi, my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-some dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Havin' fun, I was livin' the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See, I can't put down the pipe

And it is breakin' me down, watchin' the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breakin' me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losin' my way (Oh)
Keep losin' my way (Oh)
Keep losin' my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losin' my way (Oh)
Keep losin' my way (Oh)
Keep losin' my way
Can you help me find my way?

Now, you gotta understand I was a family man
I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my newfound itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See, I thought I was livin' the life
And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know
The colour of my daughter's eyes

And it is breakin' me down, watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breakin' me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?

Can anybody out there see me?
