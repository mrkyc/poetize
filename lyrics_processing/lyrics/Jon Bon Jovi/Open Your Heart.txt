Whole lot of love then it's out the door
And you swore you'd be used again no more, no more
Then you got on your feet again
It came to you like a long lost friend
Now they say you're wearing a bulletproof heart
Well I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Baby believe that I would never hurt you
Baby believe, cause my love will not desert you
Baby believe you know you got me begging and crying
I'm down on my knees
Open your heart and baby love again
Cause I won't let them take your love from me
You know that I've been hurt too
It's just your heart turns black and blue
There ain't no use in talking about it
You know all there is to say
I wanna love you girl
I wanna show you my world
Stop hiding the key to your heart
Baby let me in, let me in
