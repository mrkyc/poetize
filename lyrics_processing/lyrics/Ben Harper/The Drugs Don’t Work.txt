It's getting me down my love
Like a cat in a bag waiting to drown
This time I'm comin' down
And I know you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
Now the drugs don't work they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
But I know I'm on a losing streak
Cause I passed down by old street
And if you wanna show, just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again
Now the drugs don't work they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
So baby, ooooh, if Heaven calls, I'm coming too
Just like you said, if you leave my life I'm better off dead
All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown this time I'm comin' down

Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Oh, no
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Never coming down, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Never coming down, never coming down
No more, no more, no more
Oh, no
