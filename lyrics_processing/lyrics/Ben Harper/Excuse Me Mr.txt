Excuse me mister, do you have the time?
Or are you so important that it stands still for you?
Excuse me mister, won't you lend me your ears?
Or are you not only blind but do you not hear?
Excuse me mister, but isn't that your oil in the sea?
And the pollution in the air mister, who's could that be?
So excuse me mister, but I'm a mister too
And you're giving mister a bad name, mister like you
So I'm taking the Mr. from out in front of your name
Cuz it's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame
It's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame

And I, I've seen enough
I've seen enough to know
That I've seen too much

Excuse me mister, can't you see the children dying?
You say that you can help them mister, you're not even trying
Excuse me mister, just take a look around
Oh mister, just look up and you will, you will see it coming down
Excuse me mister but I'm a- I'm a mister too
Your giving mister a bad name, mister like you
So I'm taking the Mr. from out in front of your name
Cuz it's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame
It's the mister like you putting the rest of us to shame

And I, I've seen enough, I've seen and I've seen and
I've seen enough to know that I've seen too much

See cuz mister when you're rattling on heaven's gate
By then it's too late
Cuz mister when you get there, they don't ask, they don't ask
What you saved
All they wanna know, mister, is what you gave
So excuse me mister, but I'm a mister too
And you're giving mister a bad name, mister like you
So I'm taking the Mr. from out in front of your name
Cuz it's the mister, mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame
