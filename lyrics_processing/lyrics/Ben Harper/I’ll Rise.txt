You may write me down in history
With your bitter twisted lies
You may tread me down in the very dirt
And still like the dust I'll rise
Does my happiness upset you
Why are you beset with gloom
'Cause I laugh like I've got an oil well
Pumping in my living room

So you may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
And I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
Out of the shacks of history's shame
Up from a past rooted in pain
I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise

Now did you want to see me broken
Bowed head and lowered eyes
Shoulders fallen down like tear drops
Weakened by my soulful cries
Does my confidence upset you
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I walk like I've got a diamond mine
Breaking up in my front yard
You might also like
So you may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
And I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
Out of the shacks of history's shame
Up from a past rooted in pain
I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise

So you may write me down in history
With your bitter twisted lies
You may tread me down in the very dirt
And still like the dust I'll rise
Does my happiness upset you
Why are you beset with gloom
'Cause I laugh like I've got a goldmine
Digging up in my living room

Now, you may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
And I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
Out of the shacks of history's shame
Up from a past rooted in pain
I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise
Yes, I'll rise
You may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
And I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
Out of the shacks of history's shame
Up from a past rooted in pain
I'll rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
I'm gonna rise, I'll rise, I'll rise, rise, rise
