If she says she wanna go backstage, well, that ain't a problem
Hell, that girl can hold up a bank and they'd let her rob 'em
No, I've never seen nothin' like her before
Tonight, she the star of the show and she knows it
She knows it

No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
All night on all the attention
Yeah, I should know better, but I just might let her
Go on with her bad intentions
She's got best friends fightin' each other over her number
Like, "Brother, I saw her first"
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band
She could break up a band, baby

She's got every other girl dirty lookin' over their shoulders
Like the mountains on her Coors Light, her blue eyes couldn't be colder
No, I've never seen nothin' like her before
Tonight, she the star of the show and she knows it
She knows it

No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
All night on all the attention
Yeah, I should know better, but I just might let her
Go on with her bad intentions
She's got best friends fightin' each other over her number
Like, "Brother, I saw her first"
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band
