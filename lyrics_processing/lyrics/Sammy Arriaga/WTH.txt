It's like walkin' out your house in mid-December
With a T-shirt and no jacket on
Just because you can
Just to be a man
It's your fifth shot of Tequila on a Sunday
Even though you gotta work at eight
'Cause you're with your friends
And you never see them

It's all the things I shouldn't do
But I still do

'Cause I know she's gonna leave me lonely
Like all the other guys before me
She's left a trail of broken hearts all over this town
She ain't showin' any signs of slowin' it down
My buddies gonna call me stupid
No, I ain't ever been no Cupid
I could see it from the start that this ain't gonna end well
But what the hell
What the hell

Guess I got a little ego
'Cause I never know when I'm in over my head
She's forbidden fruit
But what did Adam do?
Can't help reachin' for her body
Can't help thinkin' that I might be the exception
But she's a wrecking ball
And I'm bound to fall

'Cause I know she's gonna leave me lonely (Lonely)
Like all the other guys before me (Before me)
She's left a trail of broken hearts all over this town
She ain't showin' any signs of slowin' it down
My buddies gonna call me stupid (Stupid)
No, I ain't ever been no Cupid (Cupid)
I could see it from the start that this ain't gonna end well
But what the hell
What the hell

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Hell, I know that I'm gonna do
Exactly what I shouldn't do

'Cause I know she's gonna leave me lonely (Lonely)
Like all the other guys before me (Before me)
She's left a trail of broken hearts all over this town
She ain't showin' any signs of slowin' it down
My buddies gonna call me stupid (Stupid)
No, I ain't ever been no Cupid (Cupid)
I could see it from the start that this ain't gonna end well
But what the hell (Oh, oh, oh)
What the hell, uh-huh
