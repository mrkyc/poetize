Maria, Maria, so smooth through the speakers
Gold sun and a silver chain
Bronze skin, sweat drops running like they're in a race
Rosary on the rearview
That's pointing right at you
I don't wan to to look away
Rolling hot down 2 lane A1A

You don't need no stage girl
You got this car
Front seats start rocking
On your air guitar

Just strumming, strumming like it's in your hands
When there's nothing in them but the wind
Just watching you, doing what you do
Four on the floor baby it's showtime
If you want an encore, I can hit rewind
Come on let's go
Yeah it's solo
In nothing but a bikini and a bandana
You play me like Santana
Play me like Santana
You might also like
Baby just play on
And when you're all done
We could hop in my backstage backseat
Show me what it's like to be V.I.P

You don't need no stage girl
You got this car
Front seats start rocking
On your air guitar

Just strumming, strumming like it's in your hands
When there's nothing in them but the wind
Just watching you, doing what you do
Four on the floor baby it's showtime
If you want an encore, I can hit rewind
Come on let's go
Yeah it's solo
In nothing but a bikini and a bandana
You play me like Santana
Play me like Santana

You're picking at my heart strings
You're singing to my soul
Strumming, strumming like it's in your hands
When there's nothing in them but the wind
Just watching you, doing what you do
Four on the floor baby it's showtime
If you want an encore, I can hit rewind
Come on let's go
Yeah it's solo
In nothing but a bikini and a bandana
Damn baby I swear you never looked better
Play me like Santana
Play me like Santana
Damn baby you never looked better
In a bikini and a bandana
