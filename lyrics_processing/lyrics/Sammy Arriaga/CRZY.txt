Why you crazy 'bout him if he ain't crazy 'bout you?
Why you let him back in when you know you gon' lose?
Baby, you deserve much better
You could trade the hell for heaven

Mascara runnin' and your mind keeps racin'
Tequila ain't the only thing you're chasin
Nah, that won't patch a heart that's broke
It's a Band-Aid on a bullet hole

A girl like you should be the center of attention
Not cryin' 'bout a boy to your bestfriend
Nah, you ain't even on his mind
But he's all that's on yours tonight

Why you crazy 'bout him if he ain't crazy 'bout you?
Why you let him back in when you know you gon' lose?
Baby, you deserve much better
You could trade the hell for heaven
Why you crazy 'bout him if he ain't crazy 'bout you?
Why you let him back in when you know you gon' lose?
Baby, you deserve much better
You could trade the hell for heaven
You might also like
So why you crazy 'bout him?

What if for once the love wasn't toxic?
And if you saw the good, would you knock it?
Seein' you like this is drivin' me insane
All I wanna do is take away the pain

A girl like you should be the center of attention
Not cryin' 'bout a boy to your bestfriend
Nah, you ain't even on his mind
But he's all that's on yours tonight

Why you crazy 'bout him if he ain't crazy 'bout you?
Why you let him back in when you know you gon' lose?
Baby, you deserve much better
You could trade the hell for heaven
Why you crazy 'bout him if he ain't crazy 'bout you?
Why you let him back in when you know you gon' lose?
Baby, you deserve much better
You could trade the hell for heaven

So why you crazy 'bout him?
