Your smile
Hidden in my head
First kiss, last call
Word's about to spread
This town gets drunk on news 'bout
Who's hooking up with who
But what we got going on
I'll leave it up to you girl

We could start a rumor
Get everybody talking
Let 'em snap a picture
Let 'em see us walking
Out the bar after 3 AM
Let 'em wonder if we're more than friends
Baby let 'em whisper, what's a little gossip?
We could start a fire, no way they could stop it
Go ahead let the word get around
While we in my bed burning it down
We could start a rumor, rumor, rumor, yeah
We could start a rumor, rumor, rumor, yeah

We could slip out the back
And keep it on the low
Or walk out the front door
And give them all a show
This town gets high on knowing
Where all the yellow cabs are going
Let's have a little fun with it
Go on girl, let's let 'em run with it
