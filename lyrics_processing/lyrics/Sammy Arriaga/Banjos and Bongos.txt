Baby you're a string of Christmas lights
On an old front porch in July
I'm a beach ball tryna bounce your way
What you say?
We find a spot we can let our heart strings ring
It's a yin yang kind of thing
Let's mix it up
And meet in the middle

You bring the banjo, I'll bring the bongos
You wear your boots, I'll wear the sandals
I'll bring the rum, you bring the sweet tea
It's cool with me
You be the "Al", I'll be the "oha"
I'll be the lime in your Coca Cola
Can't wait to see where the song goes
You bring the banjo, I'll be the bongos

Can't wait 'til me South of the border
It's a real southern daughter
We'll sing a Dixie lullaby
With a little spice
Your blue jean magic, my passion
We'll be gone with the wind dancing
Babe we're gonna be
A hard act to follow
You might also like
You bring the banjo, I'll bring the bongos
You wear your boots, I'll wear the sandals
I'll bring the rum, you bring the sweet tea
It's cool with me
You be the "Al", I'll be the "oha"
I'll be the lime in your Coca Cola
Can't wait to see where the song goes
You bring the banjo, I'll be the bongos
Whoa, whoa
You bring the banjos, I'll bring the bongos
Whoa, whoa


You bring the banjo, I'll bring the bongos
We'll put the palm tree right on your dirt road
You be Shania, I'll be Enrique
Hey it's cool girl
I'll bring the heat, you bring the cool breeze
You be Kentucky, I'll be Miami
Can't wait to see where the song goes

You bring the banjo, I'll bring the bongos
You wear your boots, I'll wear the sandals
I'll bring the rum, you bring the sweet tea
It's cool with me
You be the "Al", I'll be the "oha"
I'll be the lime in your Coca Cola
Can't wait to see where the song goes
You bring the banjo, I'll be the bongos
Whoa, whoa
You bring the banjos, I'll bring the bongos
Whoa, whoa
Lalalalala yea
Whoa, whoa
