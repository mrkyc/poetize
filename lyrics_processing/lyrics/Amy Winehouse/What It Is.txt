I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward-thinking
I'll tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinking
'Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is
Nowadays, we talk too much
Like you're forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong with me
I always used to let you say
But now I like to think out loud
You're running with some different crowd
We both know what it is

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, cry

Mister-ultra-sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up, you know
So, I'm sorry if I upset you
Tomorrow is another day so I'll call you cause that's okay
We both know what it is
You might also like
I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
I live my life and your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry
I can't even cry

Relationship, dust and remains
We resonate on different planes
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
I live my life
Your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry
I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
Oh, your attitude become a bore
