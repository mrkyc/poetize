Are you still livin' down in Birmingham
Funny how things didn't turn out like we thought they would
Now here we are standin' face-to-face again
Two old long lost friends
Laughin' 'bout when we'd sing
"Born in the USA"
And we'd scream it at the top of our lungs
Remember how you'd always say
You were gonna change the world
And yeah, I would always be your girl
And we dreamed about runnin' away
Just takin' off and chasin' the sun
Man, we really had it made
We were young, in love and free
And so naive, so naive
Where'd it go, all that crazy confidence
You and me, not afraid to face a thing
Wish we could go back and live again the hours spent
In your car cruisin' like we owned the town
Yeah, we'd turn that song up loud
And we'd drown Bruce out singin'
"Born in the USA"
And we'd scream it at the top of our lungs
Remember how you'd always say
You were gonna change the world
And yeah, I would always be your girl
And we dreamed about runnin' away
Just takin' off and chasin' the sun
Man, we really had it made
We were young, in love and free
And so naive, so naive

We were tender, we were green, so much we hadn't seen
We were wide-eyed and innocent and so naive singin'
"Born in the USA"
And we'd scream it at the top of our lungs
Remember how you'd always say
You were gonna change the world
And yeah, I would always be your girl
And we dreamed about runnin' away
Just takin' off and chasin' the sun
Man, we really had it made
We were young, in love and free
And so naive, so naive
Oh man, we really had it made
We were so naive
