Around here I'm treated like I'm just some damn machine
I punch in
I tune out
Nobody cares what I'm all about
But at five that ends
They're waitin' for me
My girlfriends
Yeah yeah yeah
We're gonna get loud
No doubt
We're gonna get crazy
Yeah yeah yeah
Who cares if we do some damage to our reputation
Guys can come and go
Life can turn around
And let you down
So fast
But if you need that one sure thing that's gonna last
Girlfriends kick ass
(See the thing about a girlfriend is)
It doesn't even matter if I show up in a bad mood
They're gonna make me laugh and change my attitude
Here's to one more
And me and my girls out on the floor
We'll dance all night long
So come on mister DJ play our song

Who cares if we do some damage to our reputation
Guys can come and go
Life can turn around
And let you down
So fast
But if you need that one sure thing that's gonna last
Girlfriends kick ass
When we're together I can't help feelin' fine
Oh yeah everything's all right
Tomorrow's comin'
It'll be here soon enough
But nothin's buggin' us tonight
Yeah yeah yeah
We're gonna get loud
No doubt
We're gonna get crazy
Yeah yeah yeah
Who cares if we do some damage to our reputation
Guys can come and go
Life can turn around
