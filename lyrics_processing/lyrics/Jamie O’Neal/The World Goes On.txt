Where you beg the pain to just go away
And your heart weighs a thousand pounds
You can't get up so you lay back down
And you cry
Feel like you could die
One day there'll be no more tears
You fight like hell and get over the fear
'Cause you realize that you can't hide
So you take a chance and you step outside
And you breathe in
Yeah, you start livin' again
'Cause the world goes on
And the sun keeps comin' up
People keep fallin' in love
And the radio keeps playing your song
So you turn it up, roll the windows down
Sing along and make it loud
And the world goes on
Can't stop he rain and wind
But you can get back up and you can build again, and
When you get the worst kinda news
You can roll up ina ball or you can choose
To go on
Try to be strong

And that bad news
Turns back to good again
You fly, you fall
You lose it all
Doesn't mean that it's the end
'Cause the world goes on
And the sun keeps comin' up
People keep fallin' in love
And the radio keeps playing your song
So you turn it up, roll the windows down
Sing along and make it loud
And the world goes on
Till the sky turns blue
And that bad news
Turns back to good again
You fly, you fall
You lose it all
Doesn't mean that it's the end
Oh, the radio keeps playing your song
So you turn it up, roll the windows down
Sing along and make it loud
And the world goes on
It's a matter of faith, it's a matter of time
Something's gonna happen and change your life
So just hold on, yeah
Things will get better, you're on your way
Sun's comin' up, it's a beautiful day
To sing your sound
