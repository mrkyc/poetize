It's a liquid pill that puts you to sleep
It's a cherry on top of a forty-hour week
It's a stop at the bar with your buddies on your way home
I-I-It's a hell of a buzz when you're seventeen
It's the courage to talk to the girl of your dreams
It'll tell you, "Yes", when everything else says, "No"
It's another round, and 'round we go

And you drink it for thirst
And you drink it to drown
Drink it to sing, hah
Just a little bit louder
It's a burning libation
For a southern hangover
It's a self-medication you're taking
When he says it's over, it's over
It don't really matter why you tip it back and swallow
It all depends on how you spin the bottle

Make you ten feet tall on a Saturday night
It'll talk you into a losing fight
It'll shine a different light on the situation
It'll pull the truth out of a lie
Make you confess, make you justify
It's all the time or only on vacation
You might also like
And you drink it for thirst
And you drink it to drown
Drink it to sing
Just a little bit louder
It's a burning libation
For a southern hangover
It's a self-medication you're taking
When he says it's over, it's over
It don't really matter why you tip it back and swallow
Yeah, it all depends on how you spin the bottle

It's a vice
Oh, and it's a friend
Some things start
Some things end

And you drink it for thirst
And you drink it to drown
Drink it to sing, ha
Just a little bit louder
It's a burning libation
For a southern hangover
It's a self-medication you're taking
When he says it's over, it's over
It don't really matter why you tip it back and swallow
Yeah, it all depends on how you spin the bottle
Yeah, tip it back
Spin the bottle
Yeah, spin the bottle, hey

It's a liquid pill that puts you to sleep
It's a cherry on top of a forty hour week
