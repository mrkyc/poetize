I was a traveler
Travelling alone
Crossing that desert they call the unknown
Lost in a valley of shadows and sinking sand
Hopeless was circling over my head
Patiently waiting for my last step
I was a desperate woman in no man's land
Like an angel of mercy
Emotional saviour
You took me in your arms and out of danger

You rescued me in the nick of time
I was right on the edge of going out of my mind
I was running on empty down to a crawl
Facing a future with no one at all
And just before I found out
How life without love could be
You rescued me

The mind can play tricks
When you're wandering out there
Making up visions out of thin air
That's why I thought I was dreaming
When you appeared
You might also likeBut your touch had feeling
Your kisses were real
Your voice echoed like a song on a hill
Somehow you knew what my heart needed to hear
Like an angel of mercy
Emotional savior
You took me in your arms and out of danger

You rescued me in the nick of time
I was right on the edge of going out of my mind
I was running on empty down to a crawl
Facing a future with no one at all
And just before I found out
How life without love could be
You rescued me
You rescued me in the nick of time
I was right on the edge of going out of my mind
I was running on empty down to a crawl
Facing a future with no one at all
And just before I found out
How life without love could be
You rescued me
You rescued me in the nick of time
I was right on the edge of going out of my mind
I was running on empty down to a crawl
Facing a future with no one at all
And just before I found out
How life without love could be
