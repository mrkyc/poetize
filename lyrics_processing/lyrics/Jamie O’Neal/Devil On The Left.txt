With a black and white picture hangin' on the wall
Oh, oh of a stripper
The men are still talkin' 'bout the rainy night she walked in
Took off her shirt like it was nothin' at all
Oh, oh what a picture
Everyone assumed she'd been drinkin'
When she pointed to her shoulders
And said, boys, here's what I'm thinkin'
Put a devil on the left, an angel on the right
I'm already livin' in the middle of the fight
And round and round and round and round it goes
Part of me's in heaven, part of me's in hell
Part of me is strugglin' tryin' to find my way through life
With a devil on the left and an angel on the right
Down in the Delta there's a rundown chapel
With a worn out floor where a preacher used to pray
Oh, oh for the stripper
While right across the street they were packed in tight
Just a-pushin' and a-shovin', sweatin' by the stage
Oh, oh to tip her
She brought a lot of men to their knees
But only one of them was thinkin'
Lord, won't you help her please

They've got her dancin' in the middle of the fight
And round and round and round and round she goes
Part of her's in heaven, part of her's in hell
Part of her is strugglin' trying to find her way through life
With a devil on the left and an angel on the right
In a cornfield in Kansas there's a little yellow house
With a white picket fence going all the way around
Oh, oh mama what's that on your shoulders
No, no, no child, maybe when you're older
Now there's an angel on the left, an angel on the right
Ring around the rosie underneath the open sky
And round and round and round and round
