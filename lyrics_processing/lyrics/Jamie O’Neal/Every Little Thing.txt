I try to play it cool but I'm a fool
Each time you look at me that way
Your way, what can I say
Boy you turn me on
Whoo
Smile
You got the kind of smile thats so perfectly indescribable
Eyes bluer than the bluest bluebird flying up in the bluest sky
No lie, that I am falling for

Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you
Every little thing
Yeah-
Touch me and suddenly
I'm on a roller coaster ride a thrill a minute
Hang on to every word that ever rolls
So soft and sweetly from your lips
That kiss Your tenderness
You might also like
Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you
Every little thing
Its just like someone looked down at me, and they
Knew every little thing about me
Needed every little thing about you
Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing
Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la Love someone
Just the way that heaven made it (Oh)
I just wanna celebrate it (Yeah I do)
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
