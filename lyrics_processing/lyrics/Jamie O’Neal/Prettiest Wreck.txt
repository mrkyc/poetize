Feels like my world turned upside down
If I fell in a whole it might swallow me up
Yeah, I musta hit the button said "self-destruct"
Got a black cloud forming right above my head
But someway, somehow I still get outta bed
Paint my nails, paint my face, dress hair to toe
Just so everybody in this town will know
I'm the prettiest wreck they've ever seen
A one-car pileup in the middle of the street
A beautiful mess, they can't help but stare
Gonna make them all wonder who does my hair
They know I'm on the verge of breaking into tears
Loving right there on the courthouse square
But I wear it like a crown on a beauty queen
Be the prettiest wreck they've ever seen
I picked out the long white dress
Booked the room, booked the band, booked the reverend
Now he's got the church praying, singing Lesser Heart
We saw the man that I love in our wedding car
Run away with my dreams and my maid of honor
With her hand out the window and my ring on her
Whole town's wondering when my breakdown will happen
But I'm not gonna give 'em that satisfaction
You might also likeI'm the prettiest wreck they've ever seen

A beautiful mess, they can't help but stare
Gonna make them all wonder who does my hair
They know I'm on the verge of breaking into tears
Loving right there on the courthouse square
But I wear it like a crown on a beauty queen
Be the prettiest wreck they've ever seen, yeah
Might be my darkest hour
But I'll do my cry in the shower
Cover the with lipstick and powder
Walk out the door and take back my power
'Cause I'm the prettiest wreck they've ever seen
A one-car pileup in the middle of the street
A beautiful mess, they can't help but stare
Gonna make them all wonder who does my hair
They know I'm on the verge of breaking into tears
Loving right there on the courthouse square
But I wear it like a crown on a beauty queen
Be the prettiest wreck they've ever seen, yeah
(The prettiest wreck) oh
(The prettiest wreck) they've ever seen
(The prettiest wreck) I'm gonna be the
