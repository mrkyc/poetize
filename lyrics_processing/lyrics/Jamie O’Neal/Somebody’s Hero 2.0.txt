Ah-ha

She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park to a half a million fans
Screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride
Around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl, but

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
Woah, woah
She's somebody's hero

Oh woah
She didn't get a check every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's moving on and she'll
Soon be missing her, but not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
You might also like
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by, looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
Woah, woah
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at all the photographs
Of her mother, and she wishes she could be like that
Oh, but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Woah, woah
Her mother's smile lets her know
Woah, woah
