There wasn't even a cloud up in the sky
After thirteen years at the factory they sorry mam but we're downsizin
That's the way life is, good luck with the rest of it
She looked me in the eye and said this ain't the first time I've taken the fall
But let me tell you girl what's gotten me through is keepin faith through it all
Cause there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes
Everybody said you gotta give it up
You can't keep that child, It's just too tough at seventeen, You're just a baby
Well she cried and she prayed, made up her mind
Said this beautiful life that's growin inside needs a chance to have a hand in God's plan
Everyone told her they'd never by, well he just turned sixteen
Made it straight to the top of his class, the captain of the football team
Yeah, there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes
