Why the hell are you everywhere?
I walk in and you're already there
Didn't I say it slow enough?
Weeks ago you and I'd broken up, oh oh

So freaking banished, you'd better vanish
Or else I'm gonna oh oh oh
This isn't cute, it's a mess of stupid
You make me wanna oh oh oh

We're like a hundred different kinds of done
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Your chance of tapping this again is none
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!

On the floor, when I'm with a guy
You're around trynna give me the eye
What's the point? You and me are through
Push your luck, you won't like what I'll do
You might also like
So freaking banished, you'd better vanish
Or else I'm gonna oh oh oh
This isn't cute, it's a mess of stupid
You make me wanna oh oh oh

We're like a hundred different kinds of done
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Your chance of tapping this again is none
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!

No second chance
Let me see you walking, see you walking
Choose someone new
For your loser stalking, loser stalking

We're like a hundred different kinds of done
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Your chance of tapping this again is none
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
We're like a hundred different kinds of done
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Your chance of tapping this again is none
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
Comprende, it's over! Comprende, it's over!
Nana nanana, nana nanana
