Open up on a girl who's dreaming of the world
Never got much in her back but she's gonna rule the world
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
What you gonna do When it comes your way? Uh-uh-hah
Living everyday like it is the last
Looking to the front, never to the past, oh-ooh

Open up your eyes
It's your time to shine

Light me up, I'm ready to go!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
Shoot me into indigo!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
Light me up, I'm ready to go!

Late night sofa sleeping she don't care 'cause she's still breathing air
Everybody's nobody until somebody steps it up and cares
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
What you gonna do when it comes your way? Uh-ah-ah
Living everyday like it is the last
Looking to the front, never to the past, oh-mmm
You might also like
It's your time to shine

Light me up, I'm ready to go!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
Shoot me into indigo!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oh-oh
Light me up, I'm ready to go!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
Shoot me into indigo!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oh-oh
Light me up, I'm ready to go!

Never jaded all that wainting
Paying your dues getting low
Those who've made it
It's over rated
I am, I am

Light me up, I'm ready to go! (Here we go, oh-oah)
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
Shoot me into indigo!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oh-oh
Light me up, I'm ready to go!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oah, oh
(What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
What you gonna do when it comes your way? Uh-hmm)
Shoot me into indigo!
Oh, oh-oah, oh, oh-oh-oh
(What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
What you gonna do when it comes your way? Oh-hmm)
