Lets me crank up 80's Madonna
Treating me like everyda is my birthday
And when I'm down he makes it okay
Coming home to flowers in my doorstep
It's not even Valentine'S Day yet
He doesn't check out any other girls
Makes me feel like I'm his world
He's every girl's dream
Crushing like we're thirteen
You know what I mean
I take my shot
I give him all I've got
But he was in my blindspot
It's not me, It's him
He's playing for the other team
Gave him and easy homerun
I can't believed he missed that one
He swings the other way
Now I realize he's playing for the other team
He cries at movies I don't even cry at
Always asking me if he looks fat in that
Knows what's up with with the latest fashion
Singing songs from Cats is his passion
He's every girl's dream
Crushing like we're thirteen
You know what I mean
I take my shot
I gave him all I got
But he was in my blindspot
It's not me, it's him
He's playing for the other team
Gave him an easy homerun
I can't believed he missed that one
He swings the other way
Now I realize he's playing for the other team
Houston, I guess we have some problems
But I don't wanna really solve them
I'd miss his friendship if I broke his trust
Tell me is it wrong to like him this much
I take my shot
I gave him all I've got
But he was in my blindspot
It's not me, it's him
He's playing for the other team
Gave him an easy homerun
I can't believed he missed that one
He swings the other way
Now I realize he's playing for the other team
He's playing for the other team
He's playing for the other team
He's playing
