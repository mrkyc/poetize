I met a guy on Friday night
A geezer in a suit and tie
Well, he was slick and self-assured
Never cared that I was bored
I met a guy on Friday night
(I hear you sing)
I went "Alright!"
When he told me I could be
"I'm serious, a celebrity!"
I asked him "Are you joking?"
I asked him "Are you high?"
"What kinda smack you smoke in that old professor pipe?"
And then I saw the devil, then I saw the truth
He goes "I'm on the level"
And I went through the roof

I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
You may-a got a weaker woman in your hold
But your home is gonna freeze before I sell my soul
You might also like
Of course I wouldn't buy the hype
He promised me the world and got a fight
He wanted me to join him for a drink
And go to bed before my mind could think
He told me I was funny, told me he was sure
That once I tasted money, I would beg for more
And then I saw right through him
Then I saw the trap
He really though I'd do him
Until he felt a slap

I told him "Hell!"
"Hell to the hell to the no!"
I told him "Hell!"
"Hell to the hell to the no!"
You may-a got a weaker woman in your hold
But your home is gonna freeze before I sell my soul

I met a guy on Friday night
He offered me the stars to take a ride
Told me if I only treat him good
I would get a limo right outta the hood
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Guess what I told that no-account sumbitch

I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
You may-a got a weaker woman in your hold
But your home is gonna freeze before I sell my soul
I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
I told him "Hell"
"Hell to the hell to the no"
You may-a got a weaker woman in your hold
But your home is gonna freeze before I sell my soul
