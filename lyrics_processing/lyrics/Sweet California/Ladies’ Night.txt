Come on girls

It's just me and my girls cruising the streets and playing our favorite songs
You know I feel so right, jump in this ride, nobody can deny
We're gonna paint the town, living our lives, nobody can stop us
Were gonna rock the world, playing with boys like we're the superstars
You took our loving for granted, baby
You lost your chance to roll with me, even in my hood
Leaving when you could, disappear you should
'Cause I know that you're not worth it

Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to the floor

Let's scream
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man to tell us what's right
You might also like
I'm not your boo to play games with, baby
You want these sweets? You gotta work it, got just what you need
Baby, follow me, let me take the lead
'Cause you know I'm so worth it

Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to
Right here, right now
Move your body right to, body right to the floor

Let's scream
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man to tell us what's right

Come on girls
Let's dance
Alright
So funky
Don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
Let's scream
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
We don't need a man, we're gonna have fun
We don't need no one 'cause it's ladies' night
