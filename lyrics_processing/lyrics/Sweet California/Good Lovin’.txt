Let's get the room buzzin', let's make it hot
We get the party rockin' whether you like it or not
Let's get the room buzzin', let's make it hot
We get the party rockin' weather you...
1, 2, 3, 4

Feel like I got roadrage
Locked in a birdcage
Late-night butterflies
Spotlight, stage-fright
Can't seem to get a break
Tryna find a better way
Worst-case scenario
Here we go again, go
Do-do-yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh
Do-do-yeah-yeah-yeah
Standing on a center-stage
Burnin' like a fireplace
Hot to trot, don't stop
If you could see your face
Screamin' like you're outta place
Lost like you in a maze
Get-get on the night train
Hurry up and up again

Oh, cause your love, your love

Yeah, it's pullin' me in
When you come, I come
Got me gaspin' for air
When you're touchin' me there
You gimme good-good lovin'
Kisses sweeter than honey
Can't you see what you're doin' to me, now boy?
Cause your love, cause your love
Cause your love

Pull me like a quarter-back
Take me to your love-shack
Get my pump a-workin'
Like I think I got a heart attack
Move your hands upon my thighs
Kiss me in the twilight
Can't stop, won't stop
Baby gotta do me right
Yeah, uh-huh, so do me right

Oh, cause your love, your love
Is all that I need
Yeah, it's pullin' me in
When you come, I come
Got me gaspin' for air
When you're touchin' me there
You gimme good-good lovin'
Kisses sweeter than honey
