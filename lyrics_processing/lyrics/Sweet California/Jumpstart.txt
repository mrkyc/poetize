I said I'll never let go again
But I was like something 'bout to change my mind
So baby just drive
Is this really happening?
I think I've been waiting for tonight my whole life
'Cause you make me feel like my heart is on fire
And you make me feel like I could never get higher
Yesterday I was numb
You could be my jumpstart
I'll be your sweetheart
Just take me anywhere
I give it all the way
Never leaving this car
I'm falling so hard
Feel like I'm leaving even if I die today
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
I wanna get lost
So I can get find with you
Watching you take control tonight feel so right
Top down, I got the perfect view
I'm thinking that this is where you say
That you're mine
'Cause you make me feel like my heart is on fire
And you make me feel like I could never get higher
Yesterday I was numb
You could be my jumpstart
I'll be your sweetheart
Just take me anywhere
I give it all the way
Never leaving this car
I'm falling so hard
Feel like I'm leaving even if I die today
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
Hair stick, sticking to my lips
Red light stop, fixed it with a kiss
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Something sick on he radio
Take a pic, I'll post a video
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Yesterday I was numb
You could be my jumpstart
I'll be your sweetheart
Just take me anywhere
I give it all the way
Never leaving this car
I'm falling so hard
Feel like I'm leaving even if I die today
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
Baby you can be my jumpstart, oh oh oh
(You could be my jumpstart)
Baby you could be my jumpstart, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
