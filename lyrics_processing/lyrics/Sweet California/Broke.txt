It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke, broke, broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke

I don't know your name boy, don't act like I should
I know those girls go crazy but I don't fall in love
Oh no, not that easy, you don't have to front
Show me what your mama taught you, baby
Don't need to be driving your Mercedes

Don't mean a thing to me if you can last the night
Stop talking your shh and show me you can hold me right

It don't matter if you're broke, don't worry, it's the finer things
Just make me laugh and be funny, all I'm asking for is
Some romance, no money, I'll take care of myself
Just give me loyalty 'cause boy, no, it don't matter if you're broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke, broke, broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke

It's not a race now, baby, or how fast you can go
Don't want a diamond ring, no platinum or gold
Please just show me you got a lot of heart, right from the start
And maybe we can get together sometime
And I can make you mine if you play your cards right

Don't mean a thing to me if you can last the night
Stop talking your shh and show me you can hold me right

It don't matter if you're broke, don't worry, it's the finer things
Just make me laugh and be funny, all I'm asking for is
Some romance, no money, I'll take care of myself
Just give me loyalty 'cause boy, no, it don't matter if you're broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke, broke, broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke, broke, broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke

It's not about your money, baby, you can keep it all
It's not about your money, baby, you can keep it all
It's not about your money, baby, you can keep it all
It's not about your money, baby, you can keep it all
It don't matter if you're broke, don't worry, it's the finer things
Just make me laugh and be funny, all I'm asking for is
Some romance, no money, I'll take care of myself
Just give me loyalty 'cause boy, no, it don't matter if you're broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
If don't matter if you're broke, broke, broke
It don't matter if you're broke now, baby
