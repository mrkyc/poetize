Put my make up on and I say I'm alright, I'm okay
And I'm hanging out with my friends every night, every day
Been pretending to myself that I'm not here missing you
And I'm building up a wall so my heart can't get to you

But nobody knows, no

Sometimes
There's tears on my pillow 'cause I can't forget you
Sometimes
I lie to myself but my heart still remembers
I fool myself and I fight it
I push it away and deny it
But sometimes
There's tears on my pillow, tears on my pillow
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows

No one ever could love me good, hurt me bad like you did, oh no
I don't wanna know where you go, who you are or who you're with
But when i hear your name, all the walls fall around me
'Cause it brings back all the pain and the waves nearly drown me
You might also like
But nobody knows, no

Sometimes
There's tears on my pillow 'cause I can't forget you
Sometimes
I lie to myself but my heart still remembers
I fool myself and I fight it
I push it away and deny it
But sometimes
There's tears on my pillow, tears on my pillow
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, nobody knows

Sometimes there's tears on my pillow 'cause I can't forget you
Sometimes I lie to myself but my heart still remembers

Sometimes
There's tears on my pillow 'cause I can't forget you
Sometimes
I lie to myself but my heart still remembers
I fool myself and I fight it
I push it away and deny it
But sometimes
