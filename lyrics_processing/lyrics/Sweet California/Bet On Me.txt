Bet on me
Quit thinking that my love is free
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me

You got a velvet touch
So why you dropping the ball?
Uh, I gave you, oh, so much
So I was hoping you'd call

You've been playing with your eyes closed, eyes closed
Stand up and focus, oh, act in control
I'm so sick of you running cold
Like it's enough

Bet on me
Quit thinking that my love is free
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me
Oh, baby, honestly
You can win the lottery
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me
You might also like
You better realize
Your true colours show
But this is black and white
I'll either stay or go

You've been playing with your eyes closed, eyes closed
Stand up and focus, oh, act in control
I'm so sick of you running cold
Like it's enough

Bet on me
Quit thinking that my love is free
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me
Oh, baby, honestly
You can win the lottery
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me

Bet it all on me
Bet it on me
Bet it on me
(Bet it all on me)
Bet on me
Quit thinking that my love is free
If you want me you better go all in
Bet it all on me
Oh, baby, honestly (Bet on me)
You can win the lottery (Bet on me)
If you want me you better go all in (Yeah-eh)
Bet it all on me

Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
(Bet it on me)
(Just let it go)
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
