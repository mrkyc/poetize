Running red lights, blowing stop signs
Crossing over double white lines
And even though I see his brown eyes
Swerving down the 405
Driving me crazy like I'm doing 180
And I know I shouldn't be high
Talking to this guy at night

Imma be right here, right here
Imma be right there, right there
If you're gonna be right here
Gotta let you know
(she said)

If you wanna love me tomorrow
And you wanna hold me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
If you wanna hold me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
Like an empire
You might also like
My tanks no longer run empty
Now that you're with me
Just tryin' to stay inside of my lane
But you got me drifting
Hoping we'll go the distance
I'll see you at the finish
Who'm I kiss
I'll see you at the finish, I ain't trippin'
Cause baby I can tell
You're complimenting me well
Your soul's one of a kind
Your body's one in a mil
I swear that I've never felt
The way you're making me feel
You're driving me crazy
Should never let you take the wheel
For real

Imma be right here, right
Imma be right there, right there
If you're gonna be right here
Gotta let you know
(she said)
If you wanna love me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
If you wanna love me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
Like an empire

(Instrumental)
Gotta build me up like an empire
Like an empire
If you wanna hold me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta build me up like an empire
Gotta build me up like an empire

If you wanna hold me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
If you wanna hold me tomorrow
And you wanna love me tonight
Gotta light my world, be my sunrise
Gotta build me up like an empire
