Oh, you see me flexing, flexing, flexing, on the grind and now you want me, want me
Every second, second, second you'll be hitting up my homies, homies
Telling 'em to tell me that you really miss me, got you crawling right back
Now you're on a mission 'cause you're really wishing you could take it all back

Now you say you're sorry, honey
But you never listened to the warning
Should've known you'd pull this on me
When I walk out the door, oh you give give give me all of your

Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your, your
Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your

You hate to, hate to, hate to hear me calling him my baby, baby
But take a, take a, take a look at how to treat a lady, lady
Telling 'em to tell me that you really miss me, got you crawling right back
Now you're on a mission 'cause you're really wishing you could take it all back

Now you say you're sorry, honey
But you never listened to the warning
Should've known you'd pull this on me
When I walk out the door, oh you give give give me all of your
You might also like
Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your, your
Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your

Should've known you'd pull this on me
When I walk out the door, oh you give give give me all of your

Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your, your
Attention, a-a-attention
Attention, now you give me, give me all of your
All of your, now you give me, give me all of your
All of your, now you give me, give me all of your
All of your, now you give me, give me all of your
All of your, now you give me, give me all of your
