Baby I'm scared and unprepared for this
You'll never know, you'll never know
Been keeping my cool layerin' my chapstick on
Ready to go, ready to go

'Cause I can feel we're getting so close, so close
It's awkward but it's beautiful, uh-oh
Who will be the one to say go and let go?

Take a breath, take a breath before the kiss
And nothing feels better than this
I can see me in your eyes
We're going in for the kill
As we open the cage of fire and rain
Ignite the butterflies, yeah
Nothing feels better than this
The breath before the kiss

Sketching my face with your fingertips
Yeah, you're taking your aim, makin' me wait
Drive full speed into my lips baby
Crash into me, crash into me
You might also like
'Cause I can feel we're getting so close, so close
It's awkward but it's beautiful, uh-oh
Who will be the one to say go and let go?

Take a breath, take a breath before the kiss
And nothing feels better than this
I can see me in your eyes
We're going in for the kill
As we open the cage of fire and rain
Ignite the butterflies, yeah
Nothing feels better than this
The breath before the kiss

I can feel the sparks, I can feel the sparks
I can feel the sparks, I can feel the sparks
Nothing feels better than this
I can feel the sparks, I can feel the sparks
I can feel the sparks, I can feel the sparks
Nothing feels better than this (Ooh)

Take a breath, take a breath before the kiss (Woah-oah)
And nothing feels better than this
I can see me in your eyes
We're going in for the kill (Woah-uh-oah)
As we open the cage of fire and rain
Ignite the butterflies, yeah (Yeah, eah)
Nothing feels better than this
