When I caught you lookin at me wit' your big blue eyes
Black leather never looked so fine
Cool walk smooth talk and croocked smile
Never fallen for a dude like you
But you're clever did it better than boys I knew
Just a player with a pick up line
Same pitch 'nother chick on a different night
I could see in your eyes you were dangerous
Kinda guy that I shouldn't trust
I'm to blame cuz I knew yeah I knew
From the start you were bad bad news
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew, I knew, I knew better
Mama warned me all about your type
Kinda cocky when you're walking thinking you're so fly
Yeah it's all becoming black and white
Rewind play it back now I can't deny
You're another womanizer waste of time
Casanova with a quota and an alibi
Boy you played me like a perfect crime
So slick with your tricks and your twisted lies
You might also likeI could see in your eyes you were dangerous
Kinda guy that I shouldn't trust
I'm to blame cuz I knew yeah I knew
From the start you were bad bad news
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew, I knew, I knew better
I could see in your eyes you were dangerous
You were dangerous!
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew, I knew, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better, I knew better
I knew better, I knew, I knew, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better
I knew, I knew, I knew better
I knew better, I knew better
