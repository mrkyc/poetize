The walking terror is unleashed
Your slow death is just what I'll reap
The cuts begin to bleed
Zombie blood curse
These are events that can't be stopped
They have been stalking you for years
The blood that runs through my dead corpse is black as night
From the grave
The shadow of death
The peril inside
Alive and decayed
The rotten now will rise
The dead come to life
All your desperate thoughts
All your helpless pleas
All your dying screams
All your fucking pain
With all my inner hate
You will die
This is a curse that can't be stopped
It has been haunting you for years
The blood that runs through my dead bones is black as night Black as night
The shadow of death
The devil inside
Black as night
The rotten now will rise
The dead come to life

With all my inner hate

You will die
You can't kill what has no heartbeat left inside
A severed dream now fades away
Black as night now dead in the bright of daylight
I am alive and now undead
The walking terror is unleashed
Your slow death is just what I'll reap
Zombie blood curse
I am the curse that can't be stopped
I have been warning you for years
The blood that runs through my dead heart is black as night

All your helpless pleas
All your dying screams
All your fucking pain
All I really crave
With all my inner hate
