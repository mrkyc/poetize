I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now

We are the unborn, a child in the womb
Sheltered from the storm

I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
