The knife invades your genitals
The pleasure from your pain I'm feeling imprinted in my memory
Slowly choked then released
I plunge my knife in you
Once alive now deceased
I blew a load in you
After death her crotch did bleed
I kept a souvenir
From your life, from your death
Your bloody underwear
Slowly choked, then released, I plunge my knife in you
Once alive, now deceased
I blew a load in you
After death her crotch did bleed
I kept a souvenir
From your life, from your death
Your bloody underwear
Bloody underwear
I smell your rotting hole
Smells better now that you're dead
Your broken legs spread wide open
Permanently in rigor mortis

I kept a souvenir
From your life, from your death
Your bloody underwear
This knife stuck up in deep as I can carve
A butchering of your inside
Gets my cock so hard
The blood poured from your eye sockets
Stare out those empty eyes
Like your soul and skull
A dead brain in your head
And now there's nothing left
You're just a memory
