I gotta find my way alone
I see myself dead by suicide
By a knife, gun, blade or hanging high
Will I be safe or will I die
Can I stop the voices deep inside
My mind, my mind, my mind, my fucking mind!!
Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead to me
You're dead to me
Oh my fucking god!!
Im a victim, I've lived through disaster
Pushed too far, this is the reaction
I hate your lies
I hate my life
Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead to me
Dead to me, you're dead to me
Dead to me, all dead

Im a victim, I've lived through disaster
Pushed too far, this is the reaction, to you!!
I hate your lies
I hate my life
Hoping I'll find a way
A way to live dead together
A way to hide my fears, a way to disappear
I can't fake it, I won't make it
I'll just hate it, I can't take it
I won't make it, I just hate it
I can't take it
I can't change it
I can't take it
I can't take it!
I won't make it, no!!
Dead to me, you're dead to me
Youre dead to me, all dead to me
Youre dead to me, all dead to me
Youre dead to me
Dead, dead, you're soon to be dead
I put a 12 gauge under my chin
Dead, dead, you're soon to be dead
I put a 12 gauge under my chin
Dead to me, you're dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead to me
You're dead to me, all dead
Oh my fucking god!!!

Died a thousand times again
In my mind I have died
I have slowly withered
I have slowly withered
Died a thousand times again
In my mind I have died
I have slowly withered

Died a thousand times again
In my mind I have died
I have slowly withered
I have slowly withered
Died a thousand times again
In my mind I have died
