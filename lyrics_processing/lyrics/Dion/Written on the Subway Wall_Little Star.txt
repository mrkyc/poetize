Choosing sides for kick the can
Peal the years back, see it all
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway wall
It's just a frozen yesterday
To make It more would take away
Remember the wonder of It all
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway wall
Girl you can't go beck
No I can't go beck
Stayin' here right here with you
Cuban heels and pin striped cars
Takin' Suzy to the church bazaar
Singin' desire in the hall
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway wall
Basement lights and gangway fights
Hydrants flooding August nights
Those tender years I can recall
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway wall
You might also likeI feel so close and yet so far girl
Where are you little star?
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
High above the clouds - high
Like a diamond In the sky
Pool halls in the afternoons
Translators playing Elvis tunes
Sunday morning out playing stickball
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway well
Makin' out at matinees
We slowly went our separate ways
Friday night dance at Bronx Park Hell
Written on the subway wall
Written on the subway well
Girl you can't go back
No you can't go back
Girl I'm stayin' here with you
Where are you, little star?
(Where are you?)
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
Wish I may, wish I might
Make this wish come true tonight
Searched all over for a love
You're the one I'm thinkin' of
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
High above the clouds somewhere
Send me down a love to share
Oh there you are, high above
Oh dear God, send me a love
Oh there you are, you're lighting up the sky
I need a love, a real real, my
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
Wish I may, wish I might
Make this wish come true tonight
