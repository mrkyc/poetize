Ever seen a better dead rebel man?
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
I've been up and down that road before
I've been kicking up dust before you were born
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
September of 1955
It was 24 years 'til the day I die
You know my face
From the Hollywood silver screen
I was just looking for another fast ride
I didn't think I wouldn't make it back alive
And now you know me as the ghost of Jimmy Dean
I'm the baddest boy that your eyes have ever seen
The original rebel without a cause
I was raised in hell, I was breaking laws
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
I was living fast and I was dying young
You're never gonna meet another one
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?
Hey, little boy, don't you know my name?

Look me in the eye if you think you can
