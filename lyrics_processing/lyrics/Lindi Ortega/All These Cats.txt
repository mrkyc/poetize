All my life I'm paying my dues
Only 'cause I gamble with so much to lose
Who am I to say if I'm gonna get away
Trying to make a living not making any pay
Gotta do what I can to survive
The music is the only thing keeping me alive

All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
I ain't gonna look, I ain't gonna listen
I'm just gonna continue on my mission
Hey, I'm here to stay

You can go ahead and intimidate me
All you gonna do is really just make me
Try to prove you wrong, try if I must
Sing a little song, leave you in the dust
We coulda been in harmony
You're just looking for an enemy

All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
I ain't gonna look, I ain't gonna listen
I'm just gonna continue on my mission
Hey, I'm here to stay

All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
I ain't gonna look, I ain't gonna listen
I'm just gonna continue on my mission
Hey, I'm here to stay

All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town
All these cats keep staring me down
Trying to run my ass right out of this town

I'm just gonna continue on my mission
Hey, I'm here to stay

I'm here to stay
