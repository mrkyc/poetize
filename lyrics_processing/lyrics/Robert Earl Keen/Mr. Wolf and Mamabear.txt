Mr. Wolf and Mama Bear
Were banging on the door
I told 'em once, I told 'em twice
Don't come 'round here no more
They've stolen all our chickens
They killed our neighbor's cat
Last night I saw 'em talking to
Big Weasel and his rat
It's such a cozy neighborhood
We love our little town
Lately things ain't been so good
There's something goin' down

It happened just a year ago
Someone hired a band
They had a dog and pony show
That got clean out of hand
There was fur and feathers flyin'
The son of the old goat
Said Coon-boy pulled a shotgun
From his worn out overcoat
Bobcat killed Miss Peacock
Coon-boy shot the Mare
While Mr. Wolf smoked opium
And grinned at Mama Bear

Two dead ducks lay there
Beside Miss Peacock on the floor
The fat goose grabbed the telephone
And called the Dogs of War
The guineas begged for mercy
The pigs began to squeal
Coon-boy took the kitty
Jumped in his automobile
Bobcat and the wheelman
The famous Wolverine
Shot out the light
And in the night they faded from the scene

Chief Detective Rambouillet
Did not work for free
And Sheriff Hog was called away
Unexpectedly
The sheriff's re-election
The murder of the Mare
Might get Hog implicated
With the Wolf and Mama Bear
So Rambouillet took up the case
Then shut it down for good
He bought a house in southern France
But lives in Hollywood
The bodies of the bobcat
And the famous Wolverine
Were found inside a motel room
Outside of San Joaquin
The city council voted
The insurance board to pay
The victims of that heinous crime
Upon that dreadful day
And I watch from the shadows
Where beneath a frosty moon
Mr. Wolf and Mama Bear
