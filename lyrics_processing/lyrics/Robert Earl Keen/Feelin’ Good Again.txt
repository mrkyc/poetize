Standin' there on Main Street across from Mr. Blues
My faded leather jacket, my weathered brogan shoes
A chill north wind was blowing but the spring was comin' on
As I wondered to myself just how long I had been gone
So I strolled across old Main Street, walked down a flight of stairs
Stepped into the hall and saw all my friends were there
A neon sign was flashing "Welcome, come on in"
It feels so good feelin' good again

My favorite band was playin' an Otis Redding song
When they sang the chorus everybody sang along
Dan and Margarita were swayin' side-by-side
I heard they were divorcing but I guess they let it slide
And I wished I had some money with which to buy a round
I wished I cashed my paycheck before I came to town
But I reached into my pocket, found three twenties and a ten
It feels so good feelin' good again

There was old man Perkins sittin' on his stool
Watching Butch and Jimmy John talkin' loud and playin' pool
The boys from Silver City were standin' by the fire
Singing like they thought they were the Tabernacle Choir
And I wanted you to see 'em all, I wished that you were there
I looked across the room and saw you standing on the stair
And when I caught your eye I saw you break into a grin
It feels so good feelin' good again
