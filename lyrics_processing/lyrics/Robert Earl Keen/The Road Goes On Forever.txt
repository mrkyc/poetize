She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight, brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hangin' from her lips, a beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river and meet with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
Sonny was a loner, older than the rest
He was goin' in the Navy but couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town, he sold a little pot
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
Sonny's playing eight-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken out-of-towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue, laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, walked on out the door
She's runnin' right behind him, reaching for his hand
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
They jumped into his pickup, Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry, said "Let's get on outta here"
The stars were high above 'em, the moon was in the east
The sun was settin' on 'em when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water and a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Who knew some Cuban refugees that dealt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when The Law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
The Cubans grabbed the goodies, Sonny grabbed the Jack
He broke a bathroom window and climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was readin' him his rights
She stepped out in the alley with a single-shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
They left the lawman lyin' and they made their getaway
Got back to the motel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money and he blew a little kiss
"If they ask you how this happened, say I forced you into this"
She watched him as his tail lights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
It's Main Street after midnight just like it was before
Twenty-one months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper and a cold six-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny is goin' to the chair
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz
