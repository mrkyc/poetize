He cuts and trims the grass for me, he makes the flowers bloom
He says that he comes from a place not far from Guanajuato
That's two days on a bus from here, a lifetime from this room
I fix his meals and talk to him in my old broken Spanish
He points at things and tells me names of things I can't recall
But sometimes I just can't but help from wonderin' who this man is
And if when he is gone will he remember me at all
I watch him close, he works just like a piston in an engine
He only stops to take a drink and smoke a cigarette
When the day is ended I look outside my window
There on the horizon, Mariano's silhouette
He sits upon a stone in the south-easterly direction
I know my charts, I know that he is thinking of his home
I've never been the sort to say I'm into intuition
But I swear, I see the faces of the ones he calls his own
Their skin is brown as potter's clay, their eyes void of expression
Their hair is black as widows' dreams, their dreams are all but gone
They're ancient as a vision of a sacrificial virgin
Innocent as crying from a baby being born
They hover 'round a dying flame and pray for his protection
Their prayers are often answered by his letters in the mail
He sends them colored figures he cuts from strips of paper
And all his weekly wages, saving nothing for himself

The border guards, they came one day and took him far away
I hope that he is safe down there at home in Guanajuato
