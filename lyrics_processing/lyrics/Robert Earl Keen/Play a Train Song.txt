A smokin', long black Cadillac. the engine's winding down
He parked it up on the sidewalk like he owned the whole damn town
I saw him talking to some chick through a thick ghost of smoke
Through a thicker haze of Southern Comfort and Coke
"Say girl you're hotter than the hinges hanging off the gates of hell
Don't be afraid to turn to me babe if he don't treat you well."
And by he, he meant me, so I laughed and I shook his hand
He laughed a little bit louder as he yelled up at the band

Play a train song, pour me one more round
Make 'em leave my boots on; on the day they lay me down
I am a runaway locomotive, out of my one-track mind
Play a train song, play a train song

I got this old black leather jacket, got this pack of Marlboro reds
Got this stash here in my pocket, got these thoughts in my own head
I'm gonna run until I have to walk, until I have to crawl
Got this moment that I'm living in and nothing else at all

Play a train song, pour me one more round
Make 'em leave my boots on; on the day they lay me down
I am a runaway locomotive, out of my one-track mind
Play a train song, play a train song

In the television blizzard lights, we looked around his place
A little cold beer on his sofa, a little smile across his face
And though I tried with all of my sadness, somehow I just could not weep
For a man who looked to me like he died laughing in his sleep
Singing a train song, pour him one last round
Made 'em leave his boots on; on the day they laid him down
He was a runaway locomotive, out of his one-track mind
Play a train song, play a train song
