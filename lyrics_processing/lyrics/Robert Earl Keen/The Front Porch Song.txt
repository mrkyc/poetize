This old porch is a big ol' red-and-white Hereford bull
Standin' under a mesquite tree in Agua Dulce, Texas
He just keeps on playin' hide-and-seek with that hot August sun
He's sweatin' and a-pantin' 'cause his work is never done, oh no
He's got them cows and that red-top cane

This old porch is a steamin' greasy plate of enchiladas
With lots of cheese and onions and a guacamole salad
You can get them at the LaSalle Hotel in old downtown
With iced tea and a waitress who will smile every time, yeah she will
I left a quarter tip on my ten dollar bill

This old porch is a palace walk-in on a Main Street in Texas
It ain't never seen or heard the days of G's and R's and X's
With the '62 poster that's almost faded down
And a screen without a picture since Giant came to town, oh no
I love them Junior Mints and them Red Hots too, yes I do, aw yeah
And old moving pictures

This old porch is just a weathered, grey-haired seventy years of Texas
He's doin' all he can not to give in to the city
And he always takes the rent late so long as I run his cattle
He picks me up at dinner time, I listen to him rattle
See Robert Earl Keen LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also like
He says the Brazos still runs muddy like she's run all along
There ain't never been no cane to grind, the cotton's all but gone
And you know this Chevrolet pickup truck, she was somethin' back in '60
Now there ain't nobody to listen to him 'cause they all think he's crazy

This old porch is just a long time waiting and forgetting
And remembering the coming back, not crying 'bout the leaving
And remembering the falling down and the laughter of the curse of luck
From all those sons-of-bitches who said we'd never get back up

This old porch is just a big old red-and-white Hereford bull
Standing under a mesquite tree out in Agua Dulce
Just keeps on playing hide-and-seek with that hot August sun
He's sweating and a-panting 'cause his work is never done, oh no
