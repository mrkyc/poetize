We were standing on a mountain top
Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishing that the world would stop
When you said, "We'd better go"
We took a row boat across the Rio Grande
Captain Pablo was our guide
For two dollars in a weathered hand
He rowed us to the other side

We were dreaming like
The end was not in sight
And we dreamed all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

We stepped out onto the golden sand
The sun was high and burning down
Rented donkeys from an old blind man
Saddled up and rode to town
Tied our donkeys to an Ironwood tree
By the stream where children play
We went in the first place we could see
Serving cold beer in the shade

We were drinking like
The end was not in sight
And we drank all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

Met a cowboy who said that he
Was running from the DEA
He left his home, wife, and family
When he made his getaway
We followed him on down a street at dusk
To his run-down, one-room shack
He blew a smoke ring and he smiled at us
"I ain't never goin' back"

We were flyin' like
The end was not in sight
And we soared that afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
He said, "There's one last place that you should go"
He took us to the town's best bar
He knew a crusty caballero
Who played an old gut-string guitar
And he sang like Marty Robbins could
Played like no one I've known
For a while, we knew that life was good
It was ours to take back home

We were singing like
The end was not in sight
And we sang all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

We were standin' on a mountain top
Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishin' that the world would stop
