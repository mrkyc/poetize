No time to walk, no time to talk, no time for long goodbyes
The ticket's in your hand, you've made that final call
The hard words flying by like punches in a barroom brawl
We've made a mess of things
It makes no difference now let's chalk it all up to the blues
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Before you break in your walking shoes
I am just what I am, I won't apologize
So if you go you'll surely know you'll have to come to realize
Love don't walk away, only people do
So if you go or if you stay you know I'll keep on loving you
We've made a mess of things
It makes no difference now let's chalk it all up to the blues
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Before you break in your walking shoes
We've made the hard time sing, we've made the miles roll by
We've broken both our wings and still we've had the will to fly
It ain't the memories, that make me talk this way
It's more like someone pulled the plug before we ever saw the play

Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Before you break in your walking shoes
I've read a thousand books, I've been behind the wheel
I've known you all my life but still I can't feel how you feel
It's only you for me, just like that whooping crane
Who has one wife for all his life and if she dies, he'll do the same
We've made a mess of things
It makes no difference now let's chalk it all up to the blues
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
Little girl, think it over one time
