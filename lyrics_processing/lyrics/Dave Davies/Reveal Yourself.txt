Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Life on earth is so bizarre, we must find a way
To fulfill what we really are
Yes it's true, I love you
And there's nothing you do that's wrong
Find values of your own
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself on the living room floor
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself till there isn't anymore
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself for there are places even you don't know
Reveal yourself for life is nothing but a movie show
Or free yourself, your heart, your mind, your soul, your sanity
You've got to see it, smell it, know that it's reality
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself, doesn't matter anymore
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself, till there isn't anymore
There are no rules where life is concerned
Our past must be burned
For there's nothing we have learned
And it's true I believe
That we must all be free
Immortal, you and me

Reveal yourself on the living room floor
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself till there isn't anymore
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself and maybe you'll go down in history
Oh how much longer must your life remain a mystery ?
It doesn't matter if you're thick and fat or thin and long
You must find out exactly where it is that you belong
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself, doesn't matter anymore
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself on the living room floor
Reveal yourself for there are places even you don't know
Reveal yourself for life is nothing but a movie show
Reveal yourself, your mind, your soul, your sanity
Just got to see it, smell it, know that it's reality
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself, reveal yourself
Reveal yourself, reveal yourself, reveal yourself
