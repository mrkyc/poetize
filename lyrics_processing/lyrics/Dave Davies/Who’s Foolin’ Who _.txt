Whose foolin' who ? Well I can't believe my eyes
High wire, fire wide, stressed-in, denigrated
Bush whacked, side-tracked, tired of being manipulated
Brain dead, paranoid, the mutant factor's activated
Acting out this automated
Forked tongues everywhere, can't believe a word they're sayin'
In the news, on the net, channel hopping, mind popping
Trying hard to find solutions, constant media pollution
Mind control robot standing in their face?
Where do I look, where can I turn ?
Always conquering the world, is there nothing we have learned ?
I look in the mirror and what do I see ?
Is it really my reflection or a channel on TV ?
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ? Well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who ?
Electromagnetic vibrations fill the air
Contaminate my mind, confusion and despair
I can't tell what's going on most of the time
I'm full of desires and I don't even mind
You might also likePounded, grounded, frowned upon, isolated
Sensory overload, not what I anticipated
Totally drained, well I'm down on my knees
Existence in denial, I'm losing my mind
What do you see when nothing is real ?
Are you a dream or just a figment of my mind ?
Of a chemical reaction running around it inside ?
Truth is not what it used to be
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ? Well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ?
If you're fooling yourself, then whose foolin' who ?
Can you trust what you see ?
What you hear, what you read in the papers, on TV ?
CNN, CBS, UPN, TBN, when will it ever end ?
Always living in the red, are we the living dead ?
This is living hell, strange little world that's all in your head
What do you see when nothing is real ?
Are you a dream or just a figment of my mind ?
Of a chemical reaction running around it ?
Truth is not what it used to be
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ? Well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who ?
Whose foolin' who ? Well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who ?

If you're fooling yourself, then whose foolin' who ?
