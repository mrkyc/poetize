There's a bug in my mind of an alien kind
All the right is all wrong and the wrong is all right
Gotta act, get it back, I'm losing my track
The last will be first and the first will be last
I got a bug in my mind of an implant kind
Got a bug in my mind of an implant kind
I'll be the bug up your arse
I'll be the bug up your arse
I'll be the bug up your ass
I'll be the bug up your ass!
Believe it
Remove it
You can't see it
Before I die, open my eyes
Let me see the world in all its wonder
Let me see clear, life without fear
Realizing the oneness of all life
Believe it
You can't see it
Alien communication
Alien communication
Neuro-transmission, triggered by electronic magnetic impulse wave
Intrusion, infusion, confusion, delusion
Who can I turn to, to find a solution?

Electronic device, and I'm paying the price
I gotta fight back, I'm-a under attack
Got a bug in my mind that's driving me wild
Got a bug in my mind of an implant kind
I'll be the bug up your arse
I'll be the bug up your arse
I'll be the bug up your ass
I'll be the bug up your ass!
Believe it
Remove it
You can't see it
Before I die, open my eyes
Let me see the world in all its wonder
Let me see clear, life without fear
Realizing the oneness of all life
Not very nice, DNA splice
Doing not what they should
It would be good if they all could
Just leave us alone
It would be good if they all would
Just leave us alone
Believe it
