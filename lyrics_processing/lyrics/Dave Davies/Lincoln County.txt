I've gotta get a train, take me back home again
See my daddy, mama wants to see me too
I'm gonna see my mama looking through the window
At the station in the morning, been a few mornings since I've been home

I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on

'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County
Won't know which way to go, I'm gonna find all those pretty girls
I'm gonna find them all
'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell
Then I'm gonna shout for more

Well, I bought a new suit at the best pawn broker's shop
Bought my ticket from money that I saved in jail
I got a boot lace tie, I got for my Pa
I got a head scarf, fair, I got for my mama that she won't wear

I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on
