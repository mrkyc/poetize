And that the way I act seems often kind of foolish
But eyes can lie and sometimes words are oh so useless
Oh, you're a part of me, the rest is history
There is a light that shines above you when I'm near you
That somehow tells me all the things we never say
And in my heart I sense a love that lasts for always
Yes, our dreams were true, it's just we never knew
I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
Oh, I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
In your eyes I see a visionary dreamer
But all at once they say you're acting like a fool
The world may change but it can never really harm you
For there's a love that's true, that's deep inside of you
Soon the time will come for us to say goodbye
But all the visions of our friendship will remain
And every time I see a child look to the sky
I will remember you, we shared a love so true
You might also likeI love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
Oh, I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
Now as I gaze out of my window to the stars
It seems somehow our little lives are oh so strange
I close my eyes and feel the universe within me
And you're a part of me, and you will always be
I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
Oh, I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
I love you and there ain't no doubt about it
Oh, I love you
Yes, I do, there is no doubt
