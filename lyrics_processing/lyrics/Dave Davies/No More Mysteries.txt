But my love for you still remains
I see you as more than a friend
I know I still got a lot to learn but I'm glad I found you
In your eyes there is something real
I see you as more than a man
For history was born in Egypt, suffered by man's vanity
History's the rock of ages, made a fool out of you and me
No more mystery, no more fear or sorrow, all their lies won't satisfy me
No more mystery, no more fear or sorrow, only love gonna set us free
How many times you've come and gone to lend us a helping hand
Every line upon your face
Reminds me you're more than a man
Give me strength to carry on from the past that lingers dark
Break the sword and give us light
The future is out of our hands
For mystery was born in Egypt, suffered by man's power and greed
No more mysteries, the rock of ages, made a fool out of you and me
No more mystery, no more fear or sorrow, all the lies won't satisfy me
No more mystery, no more fear or sorrow, only love gonna set us free

Is this all we've got to live for ?
Look on a clear night far to the North Star
Open your heart
No more mystery, no more sorrow, all their lies won't satisfy me
No more mystery, the rock of ages, made a fool of you and me
No more mystery, no more fear or sorrow, all the lies won't satisfy me
No more mysteries, the rock of ages, made a fool out of you and me
No more mysteries
No more mysteries
