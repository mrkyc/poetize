(And another please)
I'm just sitting here wondering why?
Why are the stars , why are you here
I'm just sitting here wondering why?
Why, why, why why why
Why am I asking you?
Why, why, why is the sky
Black and then it's blue?
Well you got a new house
And you got a new car
But you can't buy everything
And you cry, cry, cry
'Cause you're not satisfied
And you're wound up like a spring
'Cause you can't have everything
And you're wound up like a spring
I'm just sitting here wondering why?
, straighten your tie
Oh, I'm just sitting here wondering why?
Rationality, punctuality
Analytical, so typical
Scientifical, 
So ordinary, extraordinary
 chemical, so logical
Octagonal, woo

Oh, I'm just sitting here wondering why?
Press me new suit, tuck in me shirt
Straighten my tie
Why, why, you try and you try
Still you pray for more
You don't understand why it didn't go as planned
And you think your reasoning's flawed
Why, why, why why why why
I really don't know it all
You see, reason  what your heart really knows
So there is no "why" after all
Why do think that you always need to think
Trying hard to justify
To achieve and achieve
Always greed, greed, greed
I really don't know why
Why, why, what is this 
What is this, question time?

I'm just sitting here wondering why?
