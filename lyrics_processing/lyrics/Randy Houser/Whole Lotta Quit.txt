Well I'm a go-to-bed-early, turn-the-alarm-clock-on
I'm a coffee-black-buzzing at the crack of dawn
I'm a walking-out-whistling-my-working-song
I'm a pick-it-up, pack-it-up, back-it-up, gone

Yeah I work a-work a-work a-like a dog all day
And then I take all I can take to get my take-home pay
I give it all I got until I give it away
But come Friday, high day, kiss-my-ass-goodbye day

I got a whole lotta quit in me
A lotta don't-give-a-shit in me
The clock's about to hit 4:20
And I'll be smoking in a red-hot minute
40 hours in a jailhouse
I need a cold beer bailout
I ain't got another shift in me
I got a whole lotta quit in me

Well I'm a-calling up my buddies, get the 411
We some lowfalutin' pool-shooting son-of-a-guns
If there's anything to get, we gonna get it, son
We'll be drink it up, drink it up, drink it up, drunk
If we do it like we do it like we usually do
Man, I'll be doin', you'll be doin', we'll be doin', too
Waking up? Hell, we'll be coming to
We'll be walking out, talking 'bout, "What the hell did we do?"

I ain't got another shift in me
I got a whole lotta quit in me

Well, it's Mississippi hot and I'm Tennessee tired
And I keep lookin' at my watch and I keep countin' down the hours
And I'm thankful for this job and everything that I got
'Bout 30 more minutes, this hammer's gonna drop

I got a whole lotta quit in me
A lotta don't-give-a-shit in me
The clock's about to hit 4:20, yeah
And I'll be smoking in a red-hot minute
40 hours in a jailhouse
I need a cold beer bailout
I ain't got another shift in me
I got a whole lotta quit in me
Don't come and get me if you ain't got plenty
