We don't turn out the lights
'Cause the party's never over
We stare down the sun
Make it rise a little slower
While everyone else is fast asleep
We'll crank it up, we'll feel the beat
We'll feel the heat, you and me

Somewhere in the shadows
In between the street lights
Runnin' with our eyes closed
Chasing down a good time
We ain't got forever
Living for the moment
Any way we want it
Take it like we own it

Somewhere in the shadows
In between the street lights
Baby this is our night our life
Chasing down a good time

I love to watch your lips
When they sing your favorite song
Then they turn into a kiss
And I can't help but sing along
Yeah
While everyone else is fast asleep
We'll crank it up, we'll feel the beat
We'll feel the heat, you and me
