I backed my Chevrolet out the driveway straight to the station
Filled it up with gas, grabbed a bag of ice, a Mountain Dew and a Slim Jim
Oh, and a couple of ice cold beers too
And I swung a little gravel rock burning out that parking lot
Found a long dirt road and the perfect river spot
And broke out them beach chairs
And we sat down right there and I pulled out my guitar
And started strumming on it

I wrote a song 'bout absolutely nothing
With my toes tapping in the sand
She sang along, just me and my baby humming
Nothing, nothing like just doing
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)

Well she was skipping rocks, grabbed my seat
And I was popping tops and I popped a string
Yeah man that sun must've been a hundred degrees
Oh but we had a cold river at our feet
And every now and then a cool, cool breeze
We were blowing smoke with our eyes closed
Neither one of us was saying a word
Nah, we weren't saying a word, we were just a-touching toes every now and then
And she gave me a smile
It was beer-thirty all day long, all day long

With my toes tapping in the sand
She sang along, just me and my baby humming
Nothing, nothing like just doing
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)

I wrote a song 'bout absolutely nothing
Singin' nah nah nah nah nah nah
She sang along, just me and my baby humming
Nothing, nothing like just doing
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)
Absolutely nothing (whoo hoo hoo)
