Starin' my life through a rolled down window
Reminiscin' those main streets nights with the radio loud
Just I like I did when I was a kid
I was cool as hell, bad to the bone, I knew it all
I remember that needle buzzin' ink, got that cross in my forearm
Hit it pretty good 'til that summer workin' on the farm
Talk about dad, talk about mad
Givin' me the talk about

Was I the kinda man
Who gave his word when he shook a hand
Did I get it so wrong, just to get it right
For once in my life and would I live it twice
Did I fill my boots with every step I made
Did I walk all over my daddy's good name
Am I gonna see the me I was born to be
From where I'm at
When I look back

To a right at the light steeple that I ran from
Feelin' one of those stained glass flashbacks comin' on
Ain't been inside since daddy died
Took the end of his own life to get me thinkin' 'bout mine

Was I the kinda man
Who gave his word when he shook a hand
Did I get it so wrong, just to get it right
For once in my life and would I live it twice
Did I fill my boots with every step I made
Did I walk all over my daddy's good name
Am I gonna see the me I was born to be
From where I'm at
When I look back
When I look back

Yeah when I stand before God at the end of my life
Will the tears turn to smiles that I leave behind
Did I use to all the good
Did I give all the love that I had inside

Was I the kinda man
Who gave his word when he shook a hand
Did I get it so wrong, just to get it right
For once in my life and would I live it twice
Did I fill my boots with every step I made
Did I walk all over my daddy's good name
Am I gonna see the me I was born to be
From where I'm at
When I look back
Hmm when I look back
Starin' my life through a rolled down window
Reminiscin' those main streets nights with the radio loud
