Sittin' out on the edge
Our legs hangin', look at God paintin'
The sunset from this truck-bed
It sure looks perfect
Yeah, everything about this is right
And everything about tonight
Baby don't it feel like we're the highway
Radio turned up and we're the song
That's on it and baby don't it
Feel like we're a mile high
Can't breathe, you can see everything
Moon, the stars, it's ours, it's like we own it
Baby don't it feel like
We're on top of the world, top of the world, yeah yeah
We're up on top of the world, top of the world, yeah yeah
Make a wish before that star burns out
That's a little bit harder now
When you got what you want, what you already wished for
This kiss, this moment
Yeah, I just wanna stay in it
Cause everything about this is right
Yeah, everything about tonight
