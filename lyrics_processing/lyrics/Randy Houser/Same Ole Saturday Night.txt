Just another big moon, big night
I got ya shotgun sittin'
We're ridin' on the main street
Heaven in the headlights
Little dashboard drummer
You're right on the money
Yeah you killin' me with them blue eyes
Like a bullet hole in a stop sign
Here we go
One mile, two turns
A little E.T.C. a little vern on the radio
Tyin' up your T-shirt
Just a little skin's turning me on
Ain't it funny how you still run away with my heart
Like we've never been up under these start

It might be the same ole Saturday night
Takin' the same old dirt road ride
Circle 'round the same town, the same sky
Same old meltin' me down oh with your lips on mine
The same old bed of my truck
Flyin' you home in a cloud of dust
Standin' on the same porch with the same lights
Same don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna say goodbye
We could go anywhere but right here's just fine
There ain't nothin' like
The same ole Saturday night
Woah
See Randy Houser LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like
We could have a big time in the big town
And get all caught up in the lights with the party crowd
But right here, right now
I'm all caught up in the way that you're lookin' out
Here in the middle of nowhere
With the wind messin' up your long hair

It might be the same ole Saturday night
Takin' the same old dirt road ride
Circle 'round the same town, the same sky
Same old meltin' me down oh with your lips on mine
The same old bed of my truck
Flyin' you home in a cloud of dust
Standin' on the same porch with the same lights
Same don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna say goodbye
We could go anywhere but right here's just fine
There ain't nothin' like
The same ole Saturday night
Woah, woah, woah
The same ole Saturday night
Runnin' away with my heart
Like we never been up under these stars
It might be the same ole Saturday night
Takin' the same old dirt road ride
Circle 'round the same town, the same sky
Same old meltin' me down oh with your lips on mine
The same old bed of my truck
Flyin' you home in a cloud of dust
Standin' on the same porch with the same lights
Same don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna say goodbye
We could go anywhere but right here's just fine
There ain't nothin' like
The same ole Saturday night
No, there ain't nothin' like
The same ole Saturday night
Woah, woah, woah
The same ole Saturday night
Woah, woah, woah
No, there ain't nothin' like
