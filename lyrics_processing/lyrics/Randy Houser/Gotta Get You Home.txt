Girl I know they just sat down your drink
And the band they just started to sing
Our friends will be here any minute now
We were supposed to party we were gonna hang out
That dress that kiss are drivin' me craz

So I just paid the tab off
Left a full beer, I can't stay here
Let's go somewhere all alone

Text your friends and say you're sorry
Blame it on me
Tell 'em we just had to go
'Cause girl you know
I got to get you home
Woah, woah
Fumbled on my keys unlockin' the door
Can't wait no more

It's gonna take every bit of strength I got
Just to make it out of this parking lot
It's a left and a left then we take a right
Aw come on girl we're just wasting time
