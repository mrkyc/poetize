Hungover
Sunburned
I get it Lord
Lesson almost learned
I'll get there
Gimmie one more night
Yeah I know, I know, I know, I've told you
Three hundred thousand and ninety-four times

This ain't no way for me to be livin'
I'm doin' more losin' than I am winnin'
It sure was fun back in the beginnin'
Now I'm over my head and knee deep in it
I lost myself somewhere in the party
It feels like hell, but you can't unstart it
Gonna change my ways, gimmie one more minute
It's hard to get away from
Hot beer and cold women

I'm hurtin'
Still wasted
But that bottle at the end of the tunnel
I can almost taste it
And I hate this place
But I'm wired to keep the hammer down
And I just can't find the brakes

Yeah

I need to get out of here
But it's hard to get out of here
There ain't nothin' else to do around here, but
Hot Beer and cold women

No this ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to be livin'
I lost myself somewhere in the party
It feels like hell, but you can't unstart it
Gonna change my ways, gimmie one more minute
It's hard to get away from
It's hard to get away from
Hot beer and cold women
Cold women
