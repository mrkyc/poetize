I got my licks just about right
Kinda likin' this part of the sky
I been flyin', flyin'
I been rollin', rollin' ain't had a wink of sleep
Goin' on damn near a week
Hopin' I can keep it all together

Got a new buzz on ever since I met you
Got a new buzz on, yeah, I'm feelin' good
Am I too far gone? Baby, you can bet ya
Ever since I met you, got a new buzz on

I been moonshine blind a couple times, and all I know is
When you put your fingers on me and hit me with a touch
It's too much, it's too much, it's too much

I got a new buzz on ever since I met you
Got a new buzz on, yeah, I'm feelin' good
Am I too far gone? Baby, you can bet ya
Ever since I met you, got a new buzz on
