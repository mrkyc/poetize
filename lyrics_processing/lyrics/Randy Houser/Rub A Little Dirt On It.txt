I heard it the first time I skinned my knee
Daddy said, "Don't be scared to bleed"
Years later from a football coach
Took a hit, couldn't quit
It was fourth and goal
We didn't win that game, but the lesson learned
You gotta shake off them scrapes and burns
When the world don't turn your way
Sometimes all you can say

Is rub a little dirt on it
Shake the dust right outta your mind
Let a cool breeze work on it
Ya feel the healing comin' on right on time
Crack a six-pack open
Somewhere under an open sky
When life gets a little hurt on it
Get in the middle of nowhere
And rub a little dirt on it

Nothing knocks the cobwebs off your soul
Like some spiderwire on a fishing pole
It'll take your breath
Takin' in a sunset from a flat bottom boat
That heavy load lyin' on your chest
Got your mind all twisted up in a mess
When life scatters all your stuff
Sometimes to clean it up

You gotta rub a little dirt on it
Shake the dust right outta your mind
Let a cool breeze work on it
Ya feel the healing comin' on right on time
Crack a six-pack open
Somewhere under an open sky
When life gets a little hurt on it
Get in the middle of nowhere
And rub a little dirt on it
Rub a little dirt on it
Crack a six-pack open
Somewhere under an open sky
When life gets a little hurt on it
Get in the middle of nowhere
And rub a little dirt on it
Yeah, rub a little dirt on it
