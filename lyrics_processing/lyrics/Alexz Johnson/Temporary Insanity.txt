What just happened?
Did you kiss me?
Cause that's a place we've never been until now
And I don't know how it's gonna be after this
Do we pretend these feelings don't exist at all
Or do we fall?
My confusion shows whenever you get so close
I stumble, I stutter, forget what to say
I'm nervous, I wonder why I'm acting this way
(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What's going on with you and me?
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Woah, oh, oh (insanity)
Woah, oh, oh
You made a moved and changed your mind
Too much to lose, you've crossed the line between friends
And something more
You might also likeWas it all a big mistake?
And if it was, it's much too late to undo
And I don't really want to
Let you go but I still don't know
How I feel about you
What this really means
It's crazy to want you
Is it meant to be?
(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What's going on with you and me?
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
It's temporary insanity
What's going on with you and me?
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Woah, oh, oh (insanity)
Woah, oh, oh
Oh, what you do to me?
What comes over me, oh?
If this is crazy there's nothing I'd rather be
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da
(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What's going on with you and me?
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
It's temporary insanity
What's going on with you and me?
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Losing my mind
Losing my mind
Losing my mind
Losing my mind
Losing my mind
Losing my mind
