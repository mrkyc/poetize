It keeps you on your feet
The faster it goes
It keeps you on your toes
It's told shillings
And keeping all these things
Will just weigh you down
Until you're underground
Nothing left to take it out on
Nothing left to take it out on
It's for show
I know
The farther that you go is feeling like work
Heart beating on your shirt
Nothing left to take it out on
Nothing left to take it out on
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Oh Lordy you will see
Come clean off on me
And maybe someday
I will come take your breath away

It won't matter at all how good you've been
Cause I can make you clean
Nothing left to take it out on
Nothing left to take it out on
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Come in come and put your weight on me
Oh Lordy you will see
Come clean off on me
And maybe someday
I will come take your breath away
I will come take your breath away
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why can't I
Do it to me

Oh Lordy is this meant to be?
My heart's beating faster than me
I'm watching him hold up the skies
Why can't I?
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why can't I
Oh Lordy you will see
Come clean off on me
And maybe someday
I will come take your breath away
