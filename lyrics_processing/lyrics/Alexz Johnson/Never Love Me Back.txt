Now I'm leaving all alone
And you're gone
This empty home is huge
My heart feels so misused
For so long
You can go and do, do
Do what you want, want
I'm just gonna love you from afar
You can go and be, be
Be who you want, want
I'm just gonna love you from afar
And love you like you'll never love me back
Ain't it crazy
Are we wicked and wild?
I can love you, I don't need to disguise
Ain't it stupid, useless
It's just the way it's supposed to be
I don't need you, just the memories
Don't have a heart attack
When I love you like you'll never love me back
When I love you like you'll never love me back
This is not me rolling dice
No, we can't go through it twice
We were wrong
There is no need to compromise
When I saw it in your eyes
It was done

Do what you want, want
I'm just gonna love you from afar
You can go and be, be
Be who you want, want
I'm just gonna love you from afar
And love you like you'll never love me back
Ain't it crazy
Are we wicked and wild?
I can love you, I don't need to disguise
Ain't it stupid, useless?
It's just the way it's supposed to be
I don't need you, just the memories
Don't have a heart attack
When I love you like you'll never love me back
When I love you like you'll never love me back
In a different life, land and sky
Different place and time, there was you and I
There was you and I
There's a bird inside, it doesn't wanna die
Yeah, live the life
Ain't it crazy
Are we wicked and wild? (Oh, yeah)
I can love you, I don't need to disguise
Ain't it stupid, useless?
It's just the way it's supposed to be
I don't need you, just the memories
Don't have a heart attack
When I love you like you'll never love me back
When I love you like you'll never love me back
Oh, never love, never love
Never love, never love me back
Love you like you'll never love me back
