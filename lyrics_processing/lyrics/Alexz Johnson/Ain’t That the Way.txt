Counting roofs and taking names
Knew every line to "Stand By Me"
A love so blind, we couldn't see
Loved you more than you loved me
If I had known then what I know
Certain places we can't go
But the demons in my mind
Came to tease me one last time
Doesn't matter who you know
I'm thirty-five, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause I feel the same
Oh, I'm caught in a hurricane
Someone show me some grace
I had a plan
Saw it played out up on a big movie screen
The ending was you and me
That film never played
But ain't that the way
I memorized every wall
Missing notes, unanswered calls
It's funny how some people change
Mostly we just stay the same
Same old dreams, we've had them all
You might also like'Cause inside everyone is young
They're counting stars and being dumb
The time that graced me with its hand
Shook it once, and not again
I'll love you right until the end
I'm forty-five, and I'm keeping in line
Like you always say
Oh, "The future's a day away"
But mine came wrapped up in lace
Had I known If I'd picked up the phone
It could be erased
Oh, I thank God in a million ways
For showing me grace
But ain't that way
(Ain't that the way)
Yeah!
(That it goes)
That it goes
(Like a bird in your hand)
Like a bird in your hand
(Ain't that the way)
Ain't that the way
(You can try)
You can try
(But you won't understand)
But you won't understand
(Ain't that the way)
Ain't that the way
(That it goes)
Oh, oh!
(Like a bird on the wind)
Like a bird on the wind
(Ain't that the way)
Ain't that the way
Ain't that the way
But ain't that the way
(Ain't that the way)
(Ain't that)
(That it goes)
Ain't that the way
(Like a bird in your hand)
Ain't that the way
(You can try)
That the way
(But you won't understand)
Ain't that the way
(That it goes)
That the way
(Like a bird on the wind)
(Ain't that the way)
Ain't that the way
Ain't that the way
