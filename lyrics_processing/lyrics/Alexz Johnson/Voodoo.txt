But I got places you can lay your head
I don't read books that I can lend you
But I can see your history's been read...
You know that I've been looking at you
And I can see that they have poisoned your head
I got no place that I can send you
Got holy water here instead...
It makes me stop and wonder
What spell have I been under
Who taught the voodoo that you do?
But I can see your glory
I wanna' write your story
Somebody's voodoo's got me binded to you...
I know you're looking at your shadow
And getting by by the kindest stranger
You got me wearing my stilettos
And now I'm looking out for any kind of danger...
You got the prowl of a tiger
Yeah, baby I can see your stripes
You got me hanging on your wire
At any moment you could strike...
You might also likeYou make me stop and wonder
What spell have I been under
Who taught the voodoo that you do?
But I can see your glory
I wanna' write your story
Somebody's voodoo's got me binded to you...
It makes me stop and wonder
What spell have I been under
Who taught the voodoo that you do?
But I can see your glory
I wanna' write your story
Somebody's voodoo's got me binded to you...
And even when it's eating me alive
Your power ties my spirit up inside
There's nothing I can do to make it right
I'll follow you forever through the night...
I'm part of you for the rest of my life
The spell upon my heart won't let me lie
I'll be here now until the day we die
That voodoo is the one that will decide...
(Somebody's voodoo...)
Can I make it through tonight...?
(Somebody's voodoo...)
Can I make it through...

It makes me stop and wonder

But I can see your glory

Somebody's voodoo's got me binded to you...
It makes me stop and wonder
What spell have I been under
Who taught the voodoo that you do?
