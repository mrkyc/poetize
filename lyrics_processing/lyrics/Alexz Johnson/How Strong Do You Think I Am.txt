If I look away, it doesn't mean I don't see
And just because I want someone when I'm alone
Doesn't mean I'm helpless
That I can't stand on my own
How far can we go before we break?
How long can I wait?
How strong do you think I am?
How much can I take of this?
Am I a rock, or a rose, or a fist?
Or the breath at the end of a kiss?
How deep do you want to go, becuase I'll go there if I can
You make it harder than it has to be
How strong how strong, how strong do you think I am?
It's so hard to tell
What's in your heart
What you keep to yourself
Is tearing me apart
And should I be afraid
To dream about you?
And if you feel the same
Whatch you going to do?

How deep do you want to go, becuase I'll go there if I can

How strong how strong, how strong do you think I am?
If I move in any closer
If you let go and give yourself away
And if we let this happen to us
Everything will change
