I figure out just what to say
Won't fall apart, you got my heart
You always have it anyway
I can't keep still when I'm with you
I never know quite what to do
I try my best but I'm a mess
I'm kind of hoping you are too
I'm up for the changes, oh
This feeling's contagious
How do you see right through me?
You're keeping my heartbeat moving
But you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
And the more I try to hide it
The more you see inside it
And you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
I'm up for it, I'm up for this
You seem to know my every wish
You take me there, I don't care
Honestly I'm cool with it
You might also likeKind of always been that way
Always knew just what I'd say
You understand, you take my hand
It really takes my breath away
You're tearing the pages
This feeling's contagious
How do you see right through me?
You're keeping my heartbeat moving
But you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
And the more I try to hide it
The more you see inside it
And you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
You should know
I can see your pages too
It's just something I can do
I just can't stop reading you
Yeah
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
How do you see right through me?
You're keeping my heartbeat moving
But you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
And the more I try to hide it
The more you see inside it
And you're reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like a book
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
Reading me like, reading me like
