Find a hand on his shoulder
Trying to find his way through the city
Crawling through an alley
On the floor, by your door
Needing help with the feeling that he's had before...
Never calling anyone
Feeling unloved, saying: "Goodbye"
Life is better when you're high
Never mind when you're there
'cause they never play fair
They never play fair... oh...
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Turn the clock around now
You think it's always better but it won't
Take you away, up out of here
Standing on the tracks
For someone to appear...
Running with the devil
Running with the devil
Running with the devil
Running with the devil
Running with the devil
Running with the devil instead...

Memories hurt even more when you burn
Like you're walking on a tightrope having no hope
Looking down for a face or a smile
You find it there, you fell...
Writing neat letters to yourself
Maybe this one will help
Throw it all away and hurt yourself
When you're done you'll see what it was all about
See the hurt didn't help...
Your heart's letting you down, feeling unfound
Like you're running in a race and no end in sight
Every day has a night
Every night has another fight...
Steal me, put me in your pocket
I'll be there, take me out
When you can't shout
Can't find a reason why you're here
Send you to a place where the brave win the race...
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Turn the clock around now
You think it's always better but it won't
Take you away, up out of here
Standing on the tracks
For someone to appear...
Running with the devil

Running with the devil instead... ha...
You'll find your way
You want to run
You want to run...
Give it all away
Give it all away
You give it all away, oh no...
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Turn the clock around now
You think it's always better but it won't
Take you away, up out of here
Standing on the tracks

It's OK, never really wanna' stay where you stay
When you really wanna' run, run away
When you really wanna' run...
It's OK, you don't really need to stay where you stay
