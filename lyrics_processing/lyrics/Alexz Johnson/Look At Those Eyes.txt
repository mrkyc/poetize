Look at the trouble that they hide inside
I see the flicker of the pain on the rise
Oh my, look at those eyes...
But maybe they're like mine
Things I wish I did not see
I push away all the dirt and debris
But what'll be left of me...?
No, tell me it's not so
That people will come and they'll go
We push away all the love that we know
No, tell me it's not so...
Like in the eye of a storm
You're changing form
You feel the pull of the time ticking by
Oh my, look at these times...
But look at who's right beside you
When you're alone barely holding on
You leave your worries behind you
You're not alone in the dark...
But look at who's right beside you
You're looking back thinking "Oh, my God"
That somebody's never left you
You're not alone in the dark
You're not alone in the dark...
You might also likeOh my, look at these skies
Look at the trouble that they hide inside
I see the flicker of the pain on the rise
Oh my, look at these skies...
Soothing like a lullaby
I don't wanna' fight this fight
You feel the weight of the world on your mind
We leave it all behind...
But look at who's right beside you
When you're alone barely holding on
You leave your worries behind you
You're not alone in the dark...
But look at who's right beside you
You're looking back thinking "Oh, my God"
That somebody's never left you
You're not alone in the dark...
(You're not, you're not
You're not, you're not
You're not, you're not
You're not, you're not alone...)
(You're not alone...)
It's been a long way, long way, long way home...
It's been a lonely, lonely, lonely road...
It's been a long time I can't find
So long I'm gonna' lose my mind
It's been a long way, long way, long way home...
But look at who's right beside you
When you're alone barely holding on
You leave your worries behind you
You're not alone in the dark...
But look at who's right beside you
You're looking back thinking "Oh, my God"
That somebody's never left you
You're not alone in the dark...
It's been a long
It's been a long way home
It's been a long way home
You're not alone in the dark...
Oh my, look at those eyes
Look at the trouble that they hide inside
I see the flicker of the pain on the rise
Oh my, look at those eyes...
Maybe they're like mine
Things I wish I did not see
I push away all the dirt and debris
