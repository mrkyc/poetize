Ooh, you're moving too fast and I don't think it's right
I'm not giving you my love tonight
Now, ooh, you're moving too fast
Better sit back, relax
I'm not giving up no love tonight

Made a sound, misunderstanding
Boy, I know what you're demanding
And it's time for me to let you know, mm, mm, mhm (Mm, mhm)
Never be without hope to play this game
Not too serious within the same
Stop it please, 'cause ain't no possibility
Won't you put your dirty hands, dirty hands on me
You might also like
Ooh, you're moving too fast and I don't think it's right
I'm not giving you my love tonight
Now, ooh, you're moving too fast
Better sit back, relax
I'm not giving up no love tonight

(Mm, mm-hmm)
I do not see no one to blind me
Not my kind, nothing does that lose me respect
Not only one night calls, oh, no, no
Never be without hope to play this game
Far too serious within the shame
Stop it please, 'cause ain't no possibility
Won't you put your dirty hands, dirty hands on me

Ooh, you're moving too fast and I don't think it's right
I'm not giving you my love tonight
Now, ooh, you're moving too fast
Better sit back, relax
I'm not giving up no love tonight
