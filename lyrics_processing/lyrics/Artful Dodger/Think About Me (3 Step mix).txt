You could turn away
From the love I gave
Did I really hear
You say it's over
Baby, you found
Another lady
After everything
I did for you
Did you think you
Found the same
In someone new
There's only one me
And you cannot replace me
So tell me who you run to
When times are hard
And you need
A love to turn to
Now you know
How it feels when
Young hearts break
Think about me
When you're lonely
Do you ever
Think about me
Think about me
I'm the only
Do you ever
Think about me
When you're feeling low
Do you wanna call
When you're on your own
Does it hurt at all
Do you ever
Think about me
Do you think about me
You might also likeHeard that she
Found another guy
Heard he made you cry
And you can't believe
How much it hurt you
You, thought she'd
Be true, for you
Now I hear that
You want me back
But you ain't really sure if
I'll be down with that
'Cause when you left me
It didn't matter that
You left me, lonely
Tell me, how
Does it feel
To be the one who's hurting
Now you know
How it feels when
Young hearts break
Think about me
When you're lonely
Do you ever
Think about me
Think about me
I'm the only
Do you ever
Think about me
When you're feeling low
Do you wanna call
When you're on your own
Does it hurt at all
Do you ever
Think about me
Do you think about me
When you're feeling low
Do you wanna call me
When you're on your own
Are you feeling lonely
When you're feeling low
Do you wanna call me
When you're on your own
Are you feeling low

When you're lonely
Do you ever
