24/7 love
If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
24/7 love you know, just what I need
It's what I need
If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
24/7 love you know, just what I need
It's what I need
In the morning, in the evening
In the winter spring or summer
Whether it's early or it's late
It doesn't matter any time
Tender loving sweet devotion
Every second minute hour
I'll be waiting for you
Come put your lovin' on the line
Take me in your arms and let me know
That it's all right
Look into my eyes and let me see you
Deep inside

I'll be praying, asking, saying
Send someone like you just for me
Someone special, I belong to
I could be yours and you could be mine
Quiet moments, filled with passion
In my heart you know I'm yearning
Long to please you, touch you
Send me your lovin' right on time
