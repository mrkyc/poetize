You've given up so easily
I'm wondering what
I'm supposed to do
Another dream
I know it's mine
I think about it all the time
But nothing ever
Takes the place of you
I can't give it up
I've got to look for you
Inside my love
Never gonna let it go
It's up to me
I can't give it up
I've got to look for you
Inside my love
Never gonna let it go
It's up to me
(It's always up to me)
What was it that
You said to me?
I heard you call
But never see
So good to me
I'd like to say
But I caught you out
On Saturday
What was it that
You said to me?
I heard you call
But never see
So good to me
I'd like to say
But I caught you
On a date today

To find out all the reasons why
I'm starting all the games
You used to play
You're in and out
My life so much
I'm waiting for that final touch
You know that
You can always count on me
I can't give it up
I've got to look for you
Inside my love
Never gonna let it go
It's up to me
(Yeah, yeah)
I can't give it up
I've got to look for you
