If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
24/7 love you know just what I need is what I need
In the morning, in the evening
In the Winter, Spring or Summer
What if its early, or it's late
It doesn't matter, any time
Tender loving, sweet devotion
Every second, minute, hour
I'll be waiting for you
Come put your loving on the line
Take me in your arms and let me know that it's alright
Look into my eyes and let me see you deep inside
24 hours a day, 7 days a week
I need to feel you here beside me
I need to hold and squeeze you tight
If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night

If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
