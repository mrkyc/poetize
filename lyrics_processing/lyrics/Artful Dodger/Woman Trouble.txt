I feel fantastic, bombastic
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly
Won your game, oh yeah
You might also likeYou said that I have
Been gone too long
Don't try to tell me
That I was wrong (re-e-ee-ee-e-e-mix)
You're totally wrong for me
God, the hurt in my face
Now I know the only thing to do
Is to give myself some space
I bet she never told you everything
That drifted through her mind
All the secret thoughts
Well, I bet you never caught
Her sliding with another man
Such as I did, no, no
I hate to see the way
The finger points at me
I'm at fault, I don't think so
After all is said and done, girl
You know you had your fun
Why don't you leave it there
I feel fantastic, bombastic
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly
Won your game, oh yeah
You said you had a girl
With problems, tell me
Did it lead to heartache
And confusion (re-remix)
Did you wake up in tears
Not knowing where you are
Did you get it in the ear
Like I did, like I did
You said that
I have been gone too long
Don't try to tell me
That I was wrong (re-remix)
You're totally wrong for me
God, the hurt in my face
Now I know the only thing to do
