I mean it (I mean it)
Don't say it, babe (don't say it, babe)
Hear me now now
Said ah, please don't turn me on
No, no listen, listen
Baby, won't you keep your distance
You're getting too close to me
I've been feeling my resistance
Melting away
But she said she wouldn't mind
If I spent a little time
Said you were a friend of mine
She could trust me out of sight
Now two bottles later on
And I think I stayed too long
I forget where I belong
Saying please don't turn me on
It's getting late I know I should be gone
Don't push me 'cos I'm not that strong (no, no, no, no)
You can never make it right from wrong (no, no, no, no)
Please don't touch me there
Stop playing with my mind it's not fair
When you know I've got another who cares
And she's waiting for me somewhere out there, yeah
You might also likeDon't say my love is too familiar (aaww)
'Cos she's everything to me
Don't say what she don't know won't kill her (ooh)
I'm playing away
Put your hands where I can see
Baby, you know what I mean
'Cos you're looking good to me
And you know I feel the heat
As you button up your dress
And I wake up in your bed
With a head full of regrets
Saying please don't turn me on
It's getting late I know I should be gone
Don't push me 'cos I'm not that strong (no, no, no, no)
You can never make it right from wrong (no, no, no, no)
Please don't touch me there
Stop playing with my mind it's not fair
When you know I've got another who cares
And she's waiting for me somewhere out there, yeah
Don't want to lose the love I have
'Cos once it's gone can't take it back
You know that I want to
Don't matter what I hear you say
I see the look that's in your eyes (no, no)
Please don't turn me on
It's getting late I know I should be gone (I should be gone)
Don't push me 'cos I'm not (I'm not) that strong
(I'm not that strong, baby)
You can never make it right from wrong (and oh)
Please don't touch me there
Stop playing with my mind it's not fair (oh no)
When you know I've got another who cares
(She cares about me)
And she's waiting for me (and she loves me)
Somewhere out there (and she needs me)
Please don't turn me on
It's getting late I know I should be gone
(You know I should be gone)
Don't push me 'cos I'm not that strong
(I'm not that strong)
You can never make it right from wrong (from wrong)
Please don't touch me there (touch me there)
