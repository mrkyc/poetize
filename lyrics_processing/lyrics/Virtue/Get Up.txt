I remember back when I was a little, young girl
I remember mama saying, ("get up")
"you can't sit there, (get up)"
"when it's time to give the Lord some praise"
Now evidently she knew exactly
Where the praise would get me
That's why (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)

Now I remember when situation's
Had me kind of hindered
But my spirit kept saying, (get up)
I can't sit there, (get up)
When it's time to give the Lord some praise
When the praise is over
The weight it really lifted off my shoulder, that's why
(when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)

Now it was kind of weekly
That on the job, the devil tried to get me
That's why you hear me keep saying (get up)
You can't sit there, (get up)
I told you, you slap the devil's face
You might also likeNow when I get that praise
On the job, it couldn't come my way
That's why (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)

Now the doctor told me, from day to day
I've got to take it easy
That was just like him saying, (get up)
You can't sit there (get up)
'cause it's time to give the Lord some praise
Now when my body was achin'
A something in my hand a got to shakin'
That's why (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
When the praise is going up
Get up from your seat now

Now if you want to go and tell
The person sittin' next to ya
Don't you hear what I say, (get up)
You shouldn't sit there (get up)
'cause it's time to give the Lord some praise
Now if I had it my way
These chairs wouldn't even be here no way
'cause (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)

Now if you think you lost it
And you're lookin' for some joy for it
First you got to (get up)
Don't site there (get up)
'cause it's time to give the Lord some praise
And before you know it
Something in your body starts to show it
That's why (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)


Now everybody just keep saying
You can praise without me
Sooner or later you gonna wish you (got up)
From sitting (got up)
'cause you need the Lord to come your way
And then you want to get
The elders to pray for you
But I told you (when the praise is going up)
(get up from your seat now)
