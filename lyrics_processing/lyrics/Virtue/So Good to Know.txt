And to know, You feel the way You do
Wanna tell everybody how You make me feel
Gotta let it show, said it's so good to know
Never had someone to love me
Love me quite the way You do
It means so much to share my joy
And my pain with someone as special as You
I won't ask why You're so faithful
When I'm doing wrong
Not like the rest, no other love could compare
You love me the best
So good to know that You love me
And to know, You feel the way You do
Wanna tell everybody how You make me feel
Gotta let it show, said it's so good to know
Oh Lord, You loved me when I didn't even love myself
Concealed my fears
Wouldn't share them with no one else
To You loving me comes so easily
The perfect love affair, is what will always be
So glad, You paid the price for my eternal life
Your grace You send, gives me strength
When I'm feelin' low and it feels so good to know
