Karima please pick up the phone, my God
Hello

Where you been sis, you ain't gonna believe this
Heather wait, what's goin' on
Seen it happen so fast and I think it's kinda bad
I'm gettin' scared girl what's wrong
Well I was drivin' through the light of 36 and main
Don't tell me
Hold on, then I saw this car out of control comin' my way
Before I knew it the car next to me had ran into it
And I can't stop thinkin' that it coulda been me
Thank you Jesus
I'm so shook up I can hardly breathe
But thank you Jesus
Heather that's why I pray the Lord keep his on us night and day
And that's exactly what he did
Know he had his hands on you so now say

(Thank you Jesus) He didn't have to do it
(Thank you Jesus) But he did
(Thank you Jesus) For covering us with your blood so now we say
(Thank you Jesus) For being around
(Thank you Jesus) And for workin' it out
There's so much to thank him for
Thank you Lord

Ebony, tell 'em

Well, after a concert we just did
We talkin' in the parkin' lot of that San Francisco Ritz
And out of no where a blue van pulled up to us
These guys in masks came to us
Had guns in hand and I didn't understand
(Wait a minute) One of 'em grabbed my arm
I thought for sure I was gone
Lord help me, save me, I said
He's got a gun to my head
Then there was a cop racin' to the scene
I thought had he know me
But Jesus was with me

(Never once have I)
Thougt you left me and it was over
If anything you gotten closer
That's why I give the highest praise
(Hallelujuah) You saved my life Lord
(Hallelujuah) I've got my hands raised high saying
(Thank you Jesus) He didn't have to do it
(Thank you Jesus) But he did
(Thank you Jesus) For covering us with your blood so now we say
(Thank you Jesus) For being around
(Thank you Jesus) And for workin' it out
There's so much to thank him for
Thank you Lord

Every single day I wake up
I lift my hands and jump up
Knowin' it was no good of mine
But it was Christ in my life
And even if i couldn't saw word
I just wave my hands
And even if I had a million tongues
That's not enough of them 

(Thank you Jesus) He didn't have to do it
(Thank you Jesus) But he did
(Thank you Jesus) For covering us with your blood so now we say
(Thank you Jesus) For being around
(Thank you Jesus) And for workin' it out
There's so much to thank him for
Thank you Lord
(Thank you Jesus) He didn't have to do it
(Thank you Jesus) But he did
(Thank you Jesus) For covering us with your blood so now we say
(Thank you Jesus) For being around
(Thank you Jesus) And for workin' it out
There's so much to thank him for
