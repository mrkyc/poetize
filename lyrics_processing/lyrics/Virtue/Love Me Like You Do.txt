I really need a friend, here I am again
Bringing You my mistakes
Make me something new
Look inside my heart
It's tearing me apart
No way I can make it up to You
(If I fall down), I feel a hand behind me pull me up
(If I turn around) and see You there again

When my world is crumblin'
When my feet is stumblin'
The very thought is humblin'
You love me like You do
How can I be worth it
I'm so far from perfect;
I know I don't deserve this
But You love me like I do
When You love me like You do

Hard for me to know why You love me so
Tell me when I act like this
Why You stick around?
You might also likeI'm in need of You
One thing Lord is true
I really never meant to let You down
(If I run away) I pray Your tender voice will call my name
(If I turn around) and see You smile again

When my world is crumblin'
When my feet is stumblin'
The very thought is humblin'
You love me like You do
How can I be worth it
I'm so far from perfect;
I know I don't deserve this
But You love me like I do
When You love me like You do
When You love me like You do

Ooh la, la, la, la
Ooh la, la, la
Ooh la, la, la, la
Ooh la, la, la, la
Ooh la, la, la
Ooh la, la, la, la
When my world is crumblin'
When my feet is stumblin'
The very thought is humblin'
You love me like You do
How can I be worth it
I'm so far from perfect;
I know I don't deserve this
But You love me like You do

When my world is crumblin'
When my feet is stumblin'
The very thought is humblin'
You love me like You do
How can I be worth it
I'm so far from perfect;
I know I don't deserve this
But You love me like I do
When You love me like You do
I know I don't deserve this
But You love me like I do
When You love me like You do
