Tell me now
Do you enjoy the vibe I'm giving out
Do you love me or you gone tell me what's this about
The way you are got me dreaming no doubt
Tell me now
Do you think we'll be together until time is due
I love the way you smile made me fall for you
Beautiful girl in my way shawty what a view
Verse:1
Mama don't like me
Daddy don't like me
Brother don't even like me
Risk all of my things just for you cause that shit does excite me
You tell me your sad I won't take it lightly
Hold you right beside me
I give you the love that most people play with
Don't get mad and strike me
A bunch of girls they ain't never treat me right
Shine on my day now I understand why you named after the light
Changing my ways cause I hate when we fight
Our love is like magic, special and bright
333 what's more to excite
Wait for me now I'll see you tonight

Verse:2
Hating and fighting
Don't turn around us
I'm still not good with hearts as our prowess
Facing mirages
I hate the vision that we done left cause of some dramas
Loving and smiling
No under pressure
We'll deal with all of our issues together
Changing the weather
Doesn't matter if it's raining I'm staying forever
I got the feelings that I've never felt with
Not even with my ex that I had dealt with
I never needed her fuck it up with that bitch
Then I meet you and it's under the bridge
Now it's so glamorous
The way the moon shines all over your face
And the pretty blues that sing for your grace
And the stuff I'll do just to see your okay
But for now don't lose what I gotta say
Bridge:
Never forget
That the ring that you wear
Is a reminder to you that I'll always be there
The rose on the ring
Makes our emotions sing
I guess that's the beauty of it
They'll never be another one like it
Chorus:
Tell me now
Do you enjoy the vibe I'm giving out
Do you love me or you gone tell me what's this about
The way you are got me dreaming no doubt
Tell me now
Do you think we'll be together until time is due
I love the way you smile made me fall for you
