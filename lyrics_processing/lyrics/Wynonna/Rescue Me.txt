When all of your feelings just seem to collide?
Emotions just seem to let go
All of your tears always follow
All of these things
That you're feeling deep down
And you realize
That you're calling out loud
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
Rescue me, rescue me
What do you do when the path leads nowhere
When you need someone to be there?
Now you're afraid of what's gonna come
And now there's nowhere to run
All of these things
That you're feeling deep down
Then you realize
That you're calling out loud
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
Rescue me, rescue me
Oh, it's love's sweet salvation
With Christ, the blessed Lamb
We can get through anything
As long as it's you and me
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love, sweet love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love, sweet love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light
Lead me home
