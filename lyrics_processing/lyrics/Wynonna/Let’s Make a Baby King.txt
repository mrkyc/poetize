Once upon a Christmas morning
There was a pretty little baby boy
It seems like I remember sadness
Mingling in the joy
For Mary saw the future
And the sadness it would bring
And that's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing

Let's make a baby king
(Let's make a baby king)
Let's make him Lord of all
(Let's make him Lord of all)
Let's give him everything
(Let's give him everything)
Let's make a baby king
(Let's make a baby king)

Now you remember little King David
He's the little baby's kin
He's cousin to a man named John
And I know you all remember him
And John said, "Let's get ready (Ready)
The Herald Angels sing (Oh yeah)
'Cause this old world sure needs to know
The good news that I bring"

Now we could use a revolution
The world is turned upside down
And we need a new direction
We've got to turn this whole thing around
And we need a Lord to guide us (Uh-huh)
To teach us wrong and right (Yeah)
And we need a lamb to lead us
Into the land of light
Let's make a baby king
(Let's make a baby king)
Let's make him Lord of all
(Let's make him Lord of all)
