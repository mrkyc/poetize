And many of our songs reflected a much sweeter
And simpler time
This is, perhaps, one of my favorite all-time Judd songs
That we ever recorded
She was sittin' cross legged on the hood of a Ford
Filin' down her nails with an emery board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do
When she said, "You see that guy in the baseball cap
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that"
Betty said, "I've see him at the hardware store
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure"
As they talked a little while, he passed by
She smiled at him, he just said, "Hi"
But he was thinking to himself as he walked away
"Man, I'd like to find a girl like her someday"
Young love, strong love, true love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties'll bind young love
Well, she just couldn't stop herself from thinkin' 'bout him
And at a store downtown, she saw him again
She had both hands full, he held open the door
He said, "My name is Billy, I've seen you before
"Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on Saturday night?"
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside
He could see the answer, shinin' in her eyes
Young love, strong love, true love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties'll bind young love
Well, from that day on, you couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side and heart to heart
Mama cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born, she was cryin' again
Well, he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
An' that night as he held her, he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave
Young love, strong love, true love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties'll bind young love
Well, she was sittin' cross legged on the hood of a Ford
Filin' down her nails with an emery board
