Is it not temptation makes you kiss and makes you tell?
There's a traveler on the airwaves and he's pleading for my heart
Light up all the candles, I'm still in the dark
Hurry operator, get redemption on the line
Pull back the curtains, I think I recognize those eyes
If love is so criminal, then my penance due
'Cause I'm still holdin' on to letters written straight to you
Oh, won't you save me, father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you father sun, father sun
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, please forgive me father sun, father sun
I said I needed you in the back of my mind
Laid the beads up on the table, right beside the wine
It seems that we say forever, but forever's just a word
"And we'll be coming back for you", is all I heard
Oh, won't you save me, father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you father sun, father sun
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, please forgive me father sun, father sun
Please don't forget me, father sun, father sun
I think I hear him whispering
"Put your hand in mine and you won't feel a thing!"
Oh, won't you save me, father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you father sun, father sun
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, please forgive me father sun, father sun
Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you that my life is on the run
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?
Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?
Oh, won't you save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me father sun?
