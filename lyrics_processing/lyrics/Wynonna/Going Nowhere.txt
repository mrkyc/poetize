That's where you and I were walking
I said, looking in your eyes
I'm feeling like the sky is falling
You said, you gotta be free
But love like this is everlasting
I said, I gotta be me
But I move my feet and nothing happens
True love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that've been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
Time, I've got a lot of that
Day and night baby, I been thinking
How soon do I want you back
Sooner than you can say, you need me
True love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that''ve been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
Oh, what you do to me
Now, I just can't get away from what used to be
Your love is all, I can dream about
Oh baby, you got my head spinning 'round, yeah
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that've been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that''ve been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
