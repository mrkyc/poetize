What a misery it turned out to be
Sorry for the time I doubted You
Can't seem to get nowhere 'less You're next to me
And everyday I wonder what it would be like
Just to see the one who's always by my side
Lookin' out for You and I
I do my best to do right, got to get to the way up high
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
Love the life I'm livin' though
I'm looking forward to the day I fly
I can't wait to meet You
So glad to have a love that's true
And I wanna thank you now for seeing me through
I'll never be the fool to go astray
Gonna stick with you always
And everyday I wonder what it would be like
Just to see the one who's always by my side
Lookin' out for You and I
I do my best to do right, got to get to the way up high
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
Love the life I'm livin' though
I'm looking forward to the day I fly
I can't wait to meet You
I'll never be enough to give what You give me
But I can sing my heart out for You and tell everybody
All that He asks of us is only to believe
Disappear your low, low, lows
And your woe, woe, woes
Just like that, it's a natural fact
I can't wait 'til He comes back
I do my best to do right, got to get to the way up high
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
Love the life I'm livin' though
I'm looking forward to the day I fly
I can't wait to meet You
I do my best to do right, got to get to the way up high
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
Love the life I'm livin' though
I'm looking forward to the day I fly
I can't wait to meet You
I do my best to do right, got to get to the way up high
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
Love the life I'm livin' though
I'm looking forward to the day I fly
I can't wait to meet You
Oh, my Lord I can't wait to meet You
