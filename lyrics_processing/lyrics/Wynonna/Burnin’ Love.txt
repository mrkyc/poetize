Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher and higher
It's burning through to my soul
Baby, baby, baby
You're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
And I don't know which way to go

'Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel my temperature rising, mmm
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
Nothing can cool me, mmm
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine (Burning, burning, burning)

The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me?

It's hard to breathe
And my chest is just a-heaving
Mmm, mmm

Burning a hole in me (Oh, oh yeah)
