I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over

I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

This mountain I must climb
Feels like the world's upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

Yeah

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me (Let's talk about love)
I wanna know what love is (Love that you feel inside)
I want you to show me (Show me love is real)
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel, I wanna feel love)
I know you can show me (Can show me, woah)
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know what love is)
I want you to show me (And I know, and I know, and I know, oh)
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel, I wanna feel)
I know you can show me (Oh, woah, woah, woah)
