Caught up in a motel room
My last night down in Mexico
Lost my mind, a couple pesos
And a piece of my heart I don't want back
You sang a song I'd never heard
Got high and watched the waves roll in
Slow danced, stole another kiss
While the ice melted in that glass
Wish the world didn't spin so fast

Baby, I'm caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
Tomorrow's hangover and a heartache
Nothin' I can do
It's gonna hurt me either way
Baby, I'm lost
In between leavin' and should I stay
I should get goin' 'fore it's too late
Damn girl, you got me caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
(Yeah)

Second guessin' at an airport bar
Got a one-way ticket on the two o'clock
Either way, that plane's takin' off
With or without me
No, girl, you don't make it easy
You might also like
'Cause baby, I'm caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
Tomorrow's hangover and a heartache
Nothin' I can do
It's gonna hurt me either way
Baby, I'm lost
In between leavin' and should I stay
I should get goin' 'fore it's too late
Damn girl, you got me caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
Yeah, girl, I'm in a hard place (Oh-oh-oh)

Well, they're callin' my name at gate 25
She's callin' me to say goodbye
One more time
Can't make up my mind

'Cause baby, I'm caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
Tomorrow's hangover and a heartache
Nothin' I can do
It's gonna hurt me either way
Baby, I'm lost
In between leavin' and should I stay
I should get goin' 'fore it's too late
Damn girl, you got me caught
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
Yeah, I'm in a hard place
Yes, I am
Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place
(Between tequila on the rocks and a hard place)
I miss you, baby
