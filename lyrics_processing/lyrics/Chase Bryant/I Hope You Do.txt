That house it ain't no home
Always in that room alone
Beat that guitar to the bone
Learned every song on the radio
I know you wanna run so bad
Hit that road, never look back
'Cause there was a time when I was you
And I never did but I hope you do

Hope you get the girl, hope you chase the dream
When life throws a curve, hope you hit your knees
Talk it out with God and tell him the truth
'Cause I never did but I hope you do
Hope you get to laugh, hope you learn to cry
Hope you have the best days of your life
Hope you find the man that I see in you
'Cause I never did but I hope you do
Yeah I hope you do

Eighteen will break your heart
Twenty-five feels like the end
You're gonna do some things
That I swear boy, you'll never wanna do again
Don't forget where you came from
But find your place out in the sun
Make some noise and make it loud
Don't stop 'til you make us proud yeah
You might also like
I hope you get the girl, hope you chase the dream
When life throws a curve, hope you hit your knees
Talk it out with God and tell him the truth
'Cause I never did but I hope you do
Hope you get to laugh, hope you learn to cry
Hope you have the best days of your life
Hope you find the man that I see in you
'Cause I never did but I hope you do

(I hope)
Yeah I hope you do
(I hope you do)

You'll figure it out, you'll find a way
Some day, somehow, you'll push through the pain
Take this mess and start brand new
Yeah I never did but I hope you do

Hope you get the girl, hope you chase the dream
When life throws a curve, hope you hit your knees
Talk it out with God and tell him the truth (I hope you do)
Yeah I hope you do
I hope you get to laugh, hope you learn to cry
Hope you have the best days of your life
Hope you find the man that I see in you
'Cause I never did but I hope you do
(I hope you do)
Oh I hope you do
Yeah I hope you do
(I hope you do)
I hope you do
