Everybody remembers the Friday nights
Six pack bars, neon lights, football games
And tailgates down by the river
Barefoot girls head light dancin'
Dogwood trees and what's on the hangin' on the branches
Sonic Cup full of mountain dew and liquor
Well, I wonder if she wonders if I remember

That Mellencamp shirt that she cut off
That wildflower tattoo she had on her shoulder
And how we did a lot first time things you can't take back
Those Mardi Gras beads hangin' from her rearview
Pat Green CD we knew all the words to
And that little pink house I drive by every time I come back
No, I never think about that
No, I never think about that

There's a lot of things that I don't regret
But a whole lot more that I wanna forget
Like her blue eyes, those midnights
Tryin' take the long way home
Some melodies, and memories
They won't leave me alone
You might also like
Like that Mellencamp shirt that she cut off
That wildflower tattoo she had on her shoulder
And how we did a lot first time things you can't take back
Those Mardi Gras beads hangin' from her rearview
Pat Green CD we knew all the words to
And that little pink house I drive by every time I come back
No, I never think about that

Yeah, I wonder, if she wonders, if I remember

That Mellencamp shirt that she cut off
That wildflower tattoo she had on her shoulder
And how we did a lot first time things you can't take back
Those Mardi Gras beads hangin' from her rearview
Pat Green CD we knew all the words to
And that little pink house I drive by every time I come back
No, I never think about that
No, I never
Girl, I never think about that
Yeah
Only every once in a while, yeah
