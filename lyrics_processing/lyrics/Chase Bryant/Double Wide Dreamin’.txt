Outside of town there's a little trailer park
A dog layin' underneath a beat up car
Waitin' on the sun to come up on our little piece of paradise
Mama works a diner seven days a week
Daddy's got a body shop down the street
There's a cutout picture on the 'fridgerator of a boat
And we pray one day that we'll get it
Don't sound like much but we're livin'

Just double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
Talkin' 'bout leavin' but you never get out
So you keep drivin' the same roads, fishin' the same holes
Find a girl, settle down, put some cinderblock roots in the ground
Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town

My brother went to college, tried to get a degree
But times got tough and rent ain't free
Got hooked on the cheapest stuff that money could buy (That's right)
He went to church and found the Lord
Married whar's her name that lived next door
Now they're raisin' up babies and livin' a pretty good life
Man, what a life
You might also like
Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
Talkin' 'bout leavin' but you never get out
So you keep drivin' the same roads, fishin' the same holes
Find a girl, settle down, put some cinderblock roots in the ground
Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town (Double wide dreamin')
Oh (Double wide dreamin')

Mama got fired, it all got sold
The good Lord called my daddy back home
Now I'm sittin' on the river in an old bass boat

Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
I talked about leavin' but I never got out
So I kept drivin' the same roads, fishin' the same holes
Found a girl, settled down, put some cinderblock roots in the ground
I'm double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
Double wide dreamin' in a single wide town
Hell, I'm double wide dreamin'

(Double wide dreamin')
