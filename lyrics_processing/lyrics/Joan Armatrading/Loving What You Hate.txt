Sometimes you look in the mirror
And point every flaw on your face
You say you need so many things to change
Need that beach body, that perfect shape

But as you walk away
I'm loving those things that you hate

I'm loving what you hate
Your brown eyes
I'm loving what you hate
You're too shy
I'm loving what you hate
How you trust everyone
I'm loving you
Yeah, I'm loving what you hate

In awkward moments you'd grab my hand for support
You hate how you look os innocent
How you laugh when you're embarrassed
You hate the way you talk
You might also like
Could I love you more?
I'm loving those things that you hate

I'm loving what you hate
Your brown eyes
I'm loving what you hate
You're too shy
I'm loving what you hate
How you trust everyone
I'm loving you
Yeah, I'm loving what you hate

As we walk around the neighbourhood
You talk to strangers
There is nothing I could hate about you now
Now for a moment
You are just what I'm looking for
Everything about you is what I want
You are just what I'm looking for
Everything about you
Early on as I got to know you
I noticed little things I love about you
The way you smile, how you cherish the simple things
Dance to no music and love the rain
I'm so in love with you
I love everything about you
I'm loving what you hate
Your brown eyes
I'm loving what you hate
You're too shy
I'm loving what you hate
How you trust everyone
I'm loving you
Yeah, I'm loving what you hate
I'm loving what you hate
Your brown eyes
I'm loving what you hate
You're too shy
I'm loving what you hate
How you trust everyone
I'm loving you
Yeah, I'm loving what you hate
I'm loving what you hate
Your brown eyes
I'm loving what you hate
You're too shy
I'm loving what you hate
How you trust everyone
I'm loving you
