The hours go slowly when you close the door
And you leave me here by myself
How do I fill my days when I feel so sad?
Bet your offer's gone away

I bite my lip to stop the tears
But the tears come anyway

I like it when we're together
I don't care if I'm selfish, I want you to stay
Everything, every single thing
Everything I do
I do because I love you

I'm not built to be alone you know?
I get anxious when I'm on my own
No need to be opposite sides of doors
No need to talk through walls

I hate that hollow stomach feeling
When you turn and walk away
You might also like
I like it when we're together
I don't care if I'm selfish, I want you to stay
Everything, every single thing
Everything I do
I do because I love you
I like it when we're together
I don't care if I'm selfish, I want you to stay
Everything, every single thing
Everything I do
I do because I love you

I know I make you feel the guilt
And my reasons are emotional
But we can deal with all demons
And our barriers
Let's remind ourselves how far we've come
Let us look at how we really feel
If we turn from each other
Would we ever fall in love again?
Ever fall in love again? Ever fall in love again?
I like it when we're together, I like it when we're together

I like it when we're together
I don't care if I'm selfish, I want you to stay
Everything, every single thing
Everything I do
I do because I love you
I like it when we're together
I don't care if I'm selfish, I want you to stay
Everything, every single thing
Everything I do
I do because I love you
I like it when we're together, I like it when we're together
