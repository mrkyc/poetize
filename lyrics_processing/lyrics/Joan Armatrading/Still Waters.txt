I can picture every detail of your face
As I close my eyes
And in that moment
In that liberating moment
I can wrap you in my arms
Without fears that this will end

But is it really just you and me?
And how deep still waters run
On the outside we seem ideal
But inside it's not much fun

Like a new born I try to hold you
Try to protect you
Scroll through the hours
Scroll through the days and
Scroll the years and
Let's choose the best times
Of this bittersweet love

I can see where we should part
And yet still inside my head
Is this illusion?
When you run across the room
And lift me up amongst the stars
In your arms we fly away
You might also like
But when we fall back to earth we see
How deep still waters run
On the outside we seem ideal
But inside it's not much fun

Like a new born I try to hold you
Try to protect you
Scroll through the hours
Scroll through the days and
Scroll the years and
Let's choose the best times
Of this bittersweet love

Oh, it's the silence that hurts more
More than the shouting and the times
When you walk out
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn back

Love never moves in straight lines
It bends, it winds
Seeds we planted
We must cultivate the soil
Not plow the surface of the roots
With our words that cause the hurt
That's how out of touch we are
And how deep still waters run
On the outside we seem ideal
But inside it's not much fun

Like a new born I try to hold you
Try to protect you
Scroll through the hours
Scroll through the days and
Scroll the years and
Let's choose the best times
Of this bittersweet love
