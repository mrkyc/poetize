My boyfriend said across the fields
And you're not too far away
Wish you were here instead of there
And not too far away

If I lie in the road will you rescue me?
If I run through the trees will you see me?
Keep me close in your atmosphere
Life intensifies when you're near

Put your head on my shoulder
For the rest of your life stay with me
In our cardboard mansion
We will lap up the rain
And run from the fire
Straight into the sea
And swim into the unknown
You and me

We're in a car, I'm in the back
And you seem so far away
Wish I could drive
I would have you nearest dear
And not so far away
You might also like
If I lie in the road will you rescue me?
If I run through the trees will you see me?
Keep me close in your atmosphere
Life intensifies when you're near

Put your head on my shoulder
For the rest of your life stay with me
In our cardboard mansion
We will lap up the rain
And run from the fire
Straight into the sea
And swim into the unknown
You and me

I wanna show you to all my friends
Don't go too far away
The day will come when you'll be mine
And that's not too far away

If I lie in the road will you rescue me?
If I run through the trees will you see me?
Keep me close in your atmosphere
Life intensifies when you're near
Put your head on my shoulder
For the rest of your life stay with me
In our cardboard mansion
We will lap up the rain
And run from the fire
Straight into the sea
And swim into the unknown
