I am not in love, but I'm open to persuasion
East or West, where's the best for romancin'?
With a friend, I can smile but with a lover, I could hold my head back
I could really laugh, really laugh
Thank you
You took me dancin' 'cross the floor cheek to cheek
But with a lover, I could really move, really move
I could really dance, really dance
Really dance, really dance
I could really move, really move
Really move, really move

Now if I can feel the sun in my eyes
And the rain on my face
Why can't I feel love, really love, really love?
Really love, really love, really love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Now I got all the friends that I want (lover, ooh-ooh)
I may need more
But I shall just stick to those that I have got (lover, ooh)

With friends, I still feel so insecure
Little darling I believe you could help me a lot
Just take my hand and lead me where you will
No conversation, no wave goodnight
You might also like
(We'll give you) (lover, ooh-ooh) just make love with affection
Sing me another love song but this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it (sing it, sing it)
You know that's what I like (we'll give you) (lover, ooh-ooh)

Once more with feeling, give me love
Give me love
Give me love
Love


(We'll give you love, ooh-ooh) make love with affection
Sing me another love song but this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it (sing it, sing it)
You know that's what I like (We'll give you love, ooh-ooh)
Once more with the feeling
Sing me another love song but this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it (sing it, sing it)
You know that's what I like (We'll give you love, ooh-ooh)
With affection, ooh
With a little dedication (We'll give you love, ooh-ooh)
Once more with the feeling
You know that's what I like, love ooh-ooh
