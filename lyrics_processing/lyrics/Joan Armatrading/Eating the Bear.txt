He had me down
But I put up a fight
I saw those teeth
And I groped for my knife
Big brown bear
With the juice from his mouth
He could taste my leg
And he thought he'd got me
But I, I'm eating the bear

He lurked around
'Cos he knew where I lived
I'm in the jungle
And he means to eat me
He means to eat me
He's a hungry bear
He touched my arm
And he thought he'd got me

But I, I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear

Some days the bear will eat you
(Some days you'll eat the bear)
Some days the bear will eat you

Some days the bear will eat you

And I, I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear

It's not just girls
He eats who he wants
He's big and strong
Fights dirty and mean
If you spill some blood
He'll smell you for miles
You better watch out
'Cos he's right behind you

And I, I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
Some days the bear will eat you
(Some days you'll eat the bear)
Some days the bear will eat you
(Some days you'll eat the bear)
Some days the bear will eat you
(Some days you'll eat the bear)
Some days the bear will eat you
(Some days you'll eat the bear)

And I, I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
I'm eating the bear
