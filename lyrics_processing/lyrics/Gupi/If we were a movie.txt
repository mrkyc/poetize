Uh-oh, there you go again, talkin' cinematic
Yeah, you, you're charming, got everybody starstruck
I know how you always seem to go
For the obvious, instead of me
But get a ticket and you'll see

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin', watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song

Yeah, yeah, when you call me, I can hear it in your voice
Oh, sure, wanna see me and tell me all about her
La-la, I'll be actin' through my tears
Guess you'll never know that I should win
An Oscar for this scene I'm in

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin', watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song
You might also like
Wish I could tell you there's a twist
Some kind of hero in disguise
And we're together, it's for real, now playing
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss
Like something more than in my mind
I see it, could be amazing

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin', watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin', watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin', watchin' the sunset
