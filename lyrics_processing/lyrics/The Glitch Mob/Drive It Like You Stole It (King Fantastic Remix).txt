Sometimes I feel so fucking gigantic
Like I could take a piss and drown the whole planet
My name is killer reese
And the crazy shit
I walk around kinda believing that crazy shit
I'm into metaphysics
I mean I'm really with it
I got a dentists tongue
And I can be acidic
I'm the giant killa
Bully brain spilla
Godzilla catpilla motherfucka real nigga
Catch me bellin in my dickies and my shades
Smellin like 200 bucks
I am motherfuckin' paid
I play this game for my family and my friends
So I play this game rough because I play this game to win
Don't nobody livin' till maurice get a order
Ask my nigga Jason how I get him 'cross the border
It ain't a second bone in my body my brotha
I'm a cold ass nigga, I'm gangsta mo'fucka

Put the pedal to the floor, we gonna roll this bitch
We flyin', we throwin' cars in to the wind
We might not get this chance again 
So we gonna drive this bitch like we stole this bitch
Put the pedal to the floor, we gonna roll this ish
We flyin', we throwin' cars in to the wind
Cause we might not get this chance again

I hang around with squares cause squares get bread
And they ain't gonna do some shit that gets you tossed in the feds
It'll beat them hood niggas that'll open their mouth
And had you in some shit that you can't get out
That shit is lame no doubt, but that's the game no doubt
And I'mma bring the pain not pout, cause I'm a g
Not like a nigga that you see on tv
But like a nigga that you see in the streets
Now walk with me
Southern california is the turf I stop
But in hoods around the earth I get cop
Because I always keep it subtle
Never been a bitch, never did some sucka shit
In the name of gettin' rich and on my momma
I'm so legit, you won't find a flyer nigga that is with this shit
The killer on the reese is a well earned tag
15 I be the murder cause the case went bad
