Why do I seem to be
Caught up inside a dream all my life
It's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder
There's always a voice somewhere
Saying I never should try to set my heart free

I wish that love would come
And take me in her arms
And show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone
And words like right and wrong
Would just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why
Won't even let me fall in love
Oh, oh, everywhere I go
Always by my side
Lonely won't let me fall in love
No
You might also like
I try to say I love you
But the words won't come through
In my eyes, see all the tears and sad memories
Why can't I start out new
And leave that old feeling too far behind
I guess that lonely needs company

Around each bend of road
I'm thinking that in time
There will be that rainbow's end
But when I follow those
Self illusions I find
That it's only lonely and me again, ooh

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why
Lonely just keeps my heart out of touch
Oh, oh, everywhere I go
Always by my side
Lonely won't let me fall in love

(Lonely won't leave me alone) Won't leave me alone
(Lonely won't leave me alone) Oh no
(Lonely) Won't even let me fall in love
(Lonely won't leave me alone) I wish that love would come
(Lonely won't leave me alone) Take me in her arms
(Lonely) Lonely won't let me fall in love
(Lonely won't leave me alone) Won't leave me alone
(Lonely won't leave me alone) Ooh, I know
