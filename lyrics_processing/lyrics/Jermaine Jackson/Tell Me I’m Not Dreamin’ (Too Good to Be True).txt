Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Moonlight took me by surprise
Light coming from your eyes
Are you with me?
Am I here with you?
Are we in paradise?
I (Tell me I'm not dreamin')
I know I've been here before
You go, then you come back for more
Oh, it's a mystery how you disappear (It's a mystery how you disappear)
Like a shadow in the night
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')

Are you too good to be true?
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Tell me, are you too good to be true? (Are you too good to be true)
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
You might also like
Midnight images of you
You slipped, slipped into my room
Could be magic, could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love?
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Ooh, your voice whispers in the dark
You talk, talking to my heart
Are you with me, yeah?
Am I here with you?
Are we in paradise?
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')

Are you too good to be true
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Tell me, are you, yeah, too good to be true
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')

When the morning comes
Wake me with your love
Let me know that I'm not dreamin', baby
Tell me this is real (Real)
Show me how you feel, yeah
Say it's what we both believe in
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
I'm not dreamin'
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
I'm dreamin', oh, no
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Are you too good to be true (You, you, you)
(Tell me I'm not dreamin')
Are you, ooh, baby, too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you (Are you) too good to be true?
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you too good to be true? (I'm not dreamin')
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
I'm not dreamin', baby
I'm not dreamin' (Baby)
