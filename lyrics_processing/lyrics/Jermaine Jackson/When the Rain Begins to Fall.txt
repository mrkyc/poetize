Like the sand can seep right through your fingers
So can all your days
As those days go by
You'll have me there to help you find the way
I feel with you, I know it's got to last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright

Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream to just hold on
All my dreams of love began with the reality of
You and I believe that all our dreams will last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright
You might also like
Though the sun may hide
We still can see
The light that shines for you and me
We'll be together
All that we can be

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright
And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
