Hmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmm, yeah, yeah

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand

I tried to cope, I really hoped that you would see
You were the only girl for me, baby
I tried to mend but you condemned a love affair
You destroyed it beyond repair (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
You absorb the talk of a friend, baby (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
She says project the heart of stone and never bend (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
And be free from me and the things I do (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
But can't you see she's trying to take me from you, no

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand
Why, why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand

The mental strain in my brain to great a price to pay
For the way you make me feel in bed, baby
And all our plans, these grains of sand
The waves washed away, oh, the book that I misread (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
You don't equate sex with love (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
But isn't the love we make worthy of (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
More than wishful thoughts and plastic smiles (ooouu, ooouu, ooouu)
And ecstasy that only last for a while

(Why) why, why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand
(Why, why) why do we build this castle of sand (never stand)
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand
Why, why do we build, castle of sand (never stand)
When we know very well, baby, it'll never stand

Ooh, ooh, castle of sand (never stand)
