I remember when we met
Your eyes I can't forget
They told me a lot about you
From the look upon your face
This feeling I could trace
Girl, a sign you needed love
Ooh, that smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

And the more I saw your face
You'd start to stare in space
Trying to find the place to go
Ooh, it took me by surprise
From the corner of your eyes
I catch you staring at me
Ooh, I just didn't know what to say
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna say it anyway

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?

When you put your hand in mine
(Put your hand in mine)
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
Ooh, I got butterflies
(I got butterflies)
Swimming 'round in my soul out of control
(Ooh yeah)
Ooh, your kiss was so warm and so pure
(Don't you like me, girl?)
Let's me know what I feel is for sure
You might also like
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
Don't you?

Girl, you gave me many signs
I knew it all the time
When you first looked at me, baby
Ooh, you like me, don't you? Ha
Girl, you like me, don't you?
Oh, I know what I feel is real
Girl, I wasn't sure what to say to you
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna say it anyway

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?


Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
My mind didn't play tricks on me
I'm sure as sure can be
Of what I saw in your eyes was for real
Ooh, that smile you gave from my hello
(Don't you like me, girl?)
Would light up my world all aglow

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo)
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I knew it all the time
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
One thing that's true
You like me and I like you
