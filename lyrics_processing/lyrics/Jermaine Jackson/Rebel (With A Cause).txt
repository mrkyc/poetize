Took a lot of balls to do it
I took a lot of heat from it
I had to watch my back, no matter where I was at
'Cause everybody's gunnin' for me

Family did not approve it
I broke a lot of rules to do this
Said they seen me change
I stuck to my decisions
On my own and on a mission
You won't forget my name

'Cause I'm a rebel with a cause
And I live my life backed up against the wall
Don't wanna live my life how it's supposed to be
I gotta live my life 'cause it's up to me
Rebel with a cause
Rebel

Got me where I'm at, I gotta tip my hat
But I ain't goin' out like that

There was a time that I could never let go
There was a day when I could have no control
There was a place I'd never been
Now with a cause, I've got to win
I gotta prove it, you better move it
Or I might just run you down

I'm a rebel with a cause
And I live my life backed up against the wall
Don't wanna live my life how it's supposed to be
I gotta live my life 'cause it's up to me
Rebel with a cause

Family did not approve it
I broke a lot of rules to do this
Said they seen me change
I stuck to my decisions
On my own and on a mission
You won't forget my name


You can call your police
'Cause I'm gon' bring on the noise
I'm a rebel with a cause with a pocket full of balls
And you don't leave me no choice
I'm a rebel with a cause
And I live my life backed up against the wall
Don't wanna live my life how it's supposed to be
I gotta live my life 'cause it's up to me
Rebel with a cause
