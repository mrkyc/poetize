Girl, you walk around
With your head up in the sky
Yes, you do now
'Cause you hurt so many before
And never had to cry, no
But you better stop, honey
And realize, yeah
That one day soon
You're gonna have to be penalized
Oh

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow
You can't let those tears run free
It'll happen to you like it happened to me, baby
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow
You can't let those tears run free
It's gonna happen to you
Just like it happened to me, girl

Because you made me cry
You think you're the baddest of them all
Yes, you do now
Well, I hope I'm around, my dear
When he sets you free and you fall, yeah
Then you'll find it's not such a laugh
When tears run 'til you can't see, no, no, no
Your heartaches are gonna come
And so is your misery, yeah
