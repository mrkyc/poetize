Close my eyes
And I see your face at night
Tossin', turnin'
Fall to sleep holding my pillow tight

All the time, I think of you
You're with me, no matter what I do

Walk around
With a smile upon my face
In my mind
You have taken up permanent space

Now my life is filled with nothing less
Than your sweet love, care, and tenderness

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
You might also like
Call my name
And I lose all self-control
Touch my hand
And I feel it deep down in my soul

I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

Let's get serious, ooh!
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

S.E.R.I.O.U.S
Baby, let's get serious
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

In your arms
Is the place I wanna be
With my love
In you, and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much we want to share

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Just the thought of us together (Serious)
Means a magic love forever (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Watch the , there'll be no quitting (Serious)
Just the love that we'll giving (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

S.E.R.I.O.U.S
Baby, let's get serious
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Aow!

Ooh!

Night is young
But not quite too young for you and me
Let's be one, be one!
Going places that we want to see

Let our bodies travel with our minds
To a place where love will always shine

Let's get serious, ooh!
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Both of us feel like exploding (Serious)
'Cause this stuff's too hot for holding (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Girl, you've got my body moaning (Serious)
Just believe it's made for cloning (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Serious, ooh!
Serious
