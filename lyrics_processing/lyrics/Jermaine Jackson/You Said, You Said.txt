You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

His girl and I laid from bed from time to time
Don't ask me why, I never was that kind of guy
She said in time I'd be hers and she'd be mine
I thought, my my, I soon found out it was a lie

Just like a fool, there I waited
A year or two, you delayed it
Why did you lie, while you led me
On and on and on and on

You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

Out went my pride, I kept whackin' on the side
I can't deny, I know my nose was open wide
Soon she'd be gone, love ain't happenin' in her home
She said bye-bye, but it was said to the wrong guy

You felt so good, drove me crazy
I fell for you, who could blame me
How could you lie, you just led me
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, on

You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

Never thought I'd be with a girl who wasn't free
Never planned to share in another man's love
Never thought I'd be the one taken for a ride
Taken for the ride of my li-i-i-ife
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Stop
You said, you said, be alright
You said, you said
You said, you said, be alright
You said, you said
Never thought I'd be with a girl who wasn't free
Never planned to share in another man's love
Never thought I'd be the one taken for a ride
Taken for the ride of my li-i-i-ife

You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

You said in time you would be mine
You told a lie, I took a ride
Out went my pride, my nose open wide
Wide, wide, wide, wide
You said it's good, I said it's wrong
You said you'd leave, but you're still at home
Just like a fool I played along
Why
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

You said, baby, you said, mama
(It'll be alright)
You said, baby, you told a lie, I don't know why
You said, baby, oh, you said mama
(It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife
You said, baby (You said, you said)
You said, mama, woo
You said, baby (You said, you said)
You told a lie, I don't know why
You said, baby (You said, you said)
You said, mama
I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Well, I don't need that kind of love in my li-i-i-ife

You said, you said (It'll be alright)
Oh, it'll be alright
You said, you said
Hold on, boy, and give it time
You said, you said (It'll be alright)
