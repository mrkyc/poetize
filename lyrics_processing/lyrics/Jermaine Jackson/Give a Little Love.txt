Both of us talking, ain't nobody giving an inch
Such a shame
The beat of our hearts, they're just so far apart
That we can't even feel the pain

So tell me how long can we go on this way?
Not another day
Well, you know, it's so sad
To watch a good love go so bad, just thrown away

(Give a little love)
Give a little love
Give a little love
(Give a little love)
Give a little love
Give a little love

Both of us talking, ain't nobody listening at all
It's such a sin
It's time we start facing this love we are wasting
Ain't never gonna come back again
You might also like
Ooh, just tell me how long can we go on this way? (This way)
Not another day (Not another day)
You know it's so sad (So sad)
To watch a good love go so bad, just thrown away
Ooh

(Give some love)
Ooh, got to let her know
(Take some time)
Ooh, you got to give her some time
Give a little love

(Give a little love)
Give a little love
(Just a little love)
Give a little love
(Give her some love)
Give a little love
(Just a little love)
Give a little love
(Ooh, give a little love) Ooh, ooh

Changing like the weather
It's so hard to stay together
It's hard to give that much all the time
We've got to stop and give back
We're on the wrong track
We're coming to the end of the line
Ooh, just tell me how long can we keep holding on?
Not another day (Not another day)
You know it's so wrong (So wrong)
To let a love that was so strong just slip away
Ooh, got to give a little love
To get a little love
We're gonna have to make up our minds, ooh
Take a little, make a little time
To put our hearts together tonight

(Give a little love)
Give a little love
(Just a little love)
Give a little love
(Give a little love)
Give a little love
Give a little love
(Ah, just give a little love)
Give a little love
Give a little love
(Oh, just a little love)
Give a little love
Give a little love
Ooh, you've got to give a little love
To get a little love
We're gonna have to make up our minds, ooh
Take a little, make a little time
