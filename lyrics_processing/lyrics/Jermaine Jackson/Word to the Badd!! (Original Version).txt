What up, yo
Word to the badd!

Reconstructed
Been abducted
Don't know who you are
Think they love you
They don't know you
Lonely superstar

Never think about who you love
Only think about number one
You forget about where you started from
You only care about what you want
Don't care about how it's done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong

It ain't about your world
It ain't about the things that you do
If you don't care, I don't care
'Cause you keep thinkin' 'bout you
It ain't about you takin' my pie
You been takin' for a long time
If you don't care, I don't care
If you keep
Well, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

Once you were made
You changed your shade
Was your color wrong?
Could not turn back
It's a known fact
You were too far gone

You know I tried to be there for you
Like a brother, I care for you
It didn't matter you always play me off
You only care about what you want
You don't care about how it's done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong

Oh no, no, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Oh no
What up, yo, word to the badd
Thinkin' about that pie that you've been takin' from me
From a brother to another brother hard to believe
Lost and don't know it yet you still show it
Givin' seems to be harder than it is to receive
The glass has gotten shady, time to make it clearer
Clean it up and let's start with the "Man in the Mirror"
It's sad, Mr. Bad, ain't no mistaken it
Get a grip 'cause you're not far from breakin' it
Thinkin' about the time when we used to be close
It shouldn't be past tense, 'cause nobody knows
What the future may hold, what tomorrow might bring
It's not guaranteed that you'll be spreading your wings
But meanwhile, I continue to smile, 'cause in the back of my head
I know you're still a child
You say that you're a man, but that will never be
Unless the day comes when you can lean on me

Gone too far, you better turn back
I know who you are
You know where I'm at
Sad but it's true, from me to you
Pick up the phone
Don't be alone
Step off your throne
Come back home
