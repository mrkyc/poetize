I'm gonna tell you something
I want you to hear
Don't stand me up now
If you can't be trusted
Let's get the signals clear
'Cause you may want to be confidential
And let your feelings show
But before I open up my heart
There's the thing you've got to know
Some things are private
Better off left unsaid
Some things are private
You've got to learn to keep your head
I'm gonna take you to all the right places
See the right faces
Show you things you've never seen
Take you uptown girl in your party dress
Introduce you to society
Just remember when they're asking questions
You've got to be discreet
Keep in mind I'm not the kind of guy
Who likes his business in the street
You might also likeSome things are private
Better off left unsaid
Some things are private
You gotta learn to keep your head
Some things are private
Sworn to secrecy
Some things are private
Just between you and me
I'm gonna take you to all the right places
See the right faces
Show you things you've never seen
Take you uptown girl in your party dress
Introduce you to society
Just remember when they're asking questions
You've got to be discreet
Keep in mind I put my trust in you
Just don't invade my privacy
Some things are private

Some things are private
Better off left unsaid
Some things are private
You gotta learn to keep your head
Some things are private
Sworn to secrecy
Some things are private
Just between you and me
Some things are private

Some things are private
Sworn to secrecy
