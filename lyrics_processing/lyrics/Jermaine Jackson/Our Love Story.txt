If you don't mind, can we pretend
We never met each other
Like the first time, start again
Keepin' it under cover
'Cause it feels so good to find it
Feels so good to know
Want to relive that day all over
Baby, play with me, play with me
Play with me, play with me, play with me

Dancin' in my heart
You're always there
(Always there)
Fire in my heart
The passion
(The heat of your love)
Dancin' in my heart
This true romance
Ooh, there's a fire in my heart
(Fire in my heart)

Our love story
Started up in paradise
Our love story
Burning in each other's eyes
You might also like
Put on the dress you wore that night
We put our dreams together
Play it again by candlelight
One that will last forever
'Cause it took so long to reach you
Took so long to show
'Cause I love you so, love you so
Love you so, love you so, love you so

Shadows on the wall, the two of us
(Two of us)
Shadows on the wall, the touch
(Oh, you've got that touch)
Shadows on the wall, the 
'Cause the shadows on the wall

Our love story
Started up in paradise
Our love story
Burning in each other's eyes
Our love story
Secrets that were never told
Our love story
Taken from a heart of gold


Healin'
It's the healin'
The healin'
It's the feelin'
It's the feelin'
The feelin'
It's the madness
It's the madness
The madness
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
For my love story

Love story
Started up in paradise
Our love story
Burning in each other's eyes
Our love story
Secrets that were never told
Our love story
Taken form a heart of gold

Love story
Secrets that were never told
