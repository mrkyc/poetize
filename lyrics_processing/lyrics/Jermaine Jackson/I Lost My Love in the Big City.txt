She's gotta go, she's gotta go, she's gotta go
(Jermaine)
She's gotta leave, she's gotta leave, she's gotta leave
(Jermaine)
To the big city (I want to go places)
To the big city (I want to be somebody)

She was a small town girl
In the big city, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I lost that girl
In the big city, oh yeah
All those bright lights
Got in her eyes
She turned her pretty head
Before I realized
We were holding hands
When one of those hip cats
Tried to talk my baby
Into a Cadillac

That's how I lost my love
In the big city, aww yeah
You know I lost my love
In the big city, aww, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Oh, that groovy tune
Comin' from that party room
We were only looking in
But, pretty soon
Somehow we strayed apart
And that place got dark
And I found somebody messin' around
With that young girl's heart

That's how I lost my love
In the big city, aww, yeah
You know I lost my love
In the big city, aww, yeah, yeah

She was oh so sweet
She knocked me off my feet
Just the kind of girl
Your mom would like to meet
Oh that girl was pure
You know a line to her
Was something just for catching fish
And that's for sure
So when this fancy dude
With a sexy point of view
Said "Cutie ..."
"... Hollywood would make a star of you"
Oh yeah, this kind of jive
Made her lose her cool
To compete, I need some lessons
From a lovin' school

That's how I lost my love
In the big city, aw yeah
You know I lost my love
In the big city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lost, I lost, I lost, I lost my love
In the big city
Oh, I lost, I lost, I lost my love
In the big city
Aww yeah, yeah
You know, I lost, I lost, I lost my love
In the big city
Aww yeah
Oh, I lost, I lost, I lost my love
