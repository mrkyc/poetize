Im coming for the top spot
Looking down from the height of a 24-second shot clock
I'm rolling smooth when I cop pot, get a green thumb
Write these cold raps quick, just to make your feet numb
Leftover single bills, gotta stash some
Put the bread in a safe, you know I don't grab none
Riff shit, eating at the same time like a picnic
My eyes low when I stay cool
And When I aim for a goal, im hitting it like I play pool
And the reward is just so much sweet
That's the motivation given when i'm rapping over so much beats
In the crib with the cashmere, i'm on the laptop
Movie scenes with the bad plot
The money coming but it take grind
So when I rap I kill niggas at once, so I could save time
I got the jacket that could break wind
You got the jacket of a fake pimp
I woke up from a dream of counting gold and I haven't been the same since
Hop out the bed with a a strange limp
Boss up, Riffs see the card, way before the hand dealt
I got some niggas coming through if I demand help
You might also likeAnd the plan worked, (got it)
And when I get paid big, celebration, but I give to the fam first
Jones...
Chorus:
We in the game now, so we trying to get the cake now
Money coming homie, what you got to say now?
We in the game now, so we trying to get the cake now
Money coming homie, what you got to say now?
Verse 2:
I take a seat when the game on
Killin' rappers, i'm the one to put the blame on
What a proud fact, I call the homie for the loud pack
Chris Jone$ a real king, you not, I got my crown back
Don't turn up, let the green burn up
Don't call me if it's bout' something that don't concern us
Riffs, move around city landmarks accordingly
Large number 8, with a coke is what you order me
Even though you niggas still huggin' the block
Jones still make moves with the hustle you knocked
Watching Chris Jone$ videos, thinking bout' the trouble$ you got
When im broke, i'm still in love with the guap
I'm on my own road, in the crib, I rock a gold robe
Seeing me alive is a stunner, just like i'm Stone Cold
When I went to the mall, she rolled too
Copped shit, when we left from the mall, she rolled two
Chorus:
We in the game now, so we trying to get the cake now
Money coming homie, what you got to say now?
We in the game now, so we trying to get the cake now
