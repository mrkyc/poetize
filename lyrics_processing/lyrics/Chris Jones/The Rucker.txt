Chris Jone$:
I never sleep, girls hit me up so I never creep
Im fucking chris jones and she say the same
Im super hot fire, she's tremendous repeat
Your going nowhere dog, I understand
Business class peep my cover plan
Black panther, high five the brother man
Jamaica this summer fly to motherland
Haha, im so courageous
Parties with the riffs and your chicks be amazing
Smelling like money and I always keep the fragrance
And I be in the cut, goin nuts, like a caveman
Stop all the hatin, nah keep it up
Pussy like my enemy so I'mma have to beat it up
Why fuck just me and you, I'mma have to three it some
Thats me, you, and her, damn what a vision
Kobe or durant? damn what a decision
But if I had to pick, I rather choose me
I ball so hard so I always shoot a 3
Yeah I said it dog, all I do is shoot 3s
You might also likeI get back on the defense and I tell em run the 2-3
We rolled up together like cheech and chong doobies
Dont believe the hype because all of them are groupies
No not you girl, you know you can roll
She be all on me like a stripper on a pole
Keep on gettin money till my children get old
When I turn 100 all my cash turn to gold
10 years later it'll all turn to mold
See me stuntin' wit a kicker on my chest
Always look fly everytime I leave the rest
Even at my worst, I be looking like my best
And I swear im a boss, knock before you touch my desk
You talking bout' me look at you my nigga
About my principles like a school my nigga
We the new wave like a pool my nigga
And the riffs on top like a stool my nigga
Fortune teller once said, "Dude your green!"
I was souped, who knew what the term mean
Cool people can't see what a nerd seen
Became a grown man at the age of thirteen
Stress, stress, who knew I would suffer
Im a walking movie, so who knew I would buffer
I regret telling tonya that I love her
But I was young dumb while we was at the rucker
But even at the rucker, I was no sucker
She always yelled chris like my last name tucker
My polo hat would make you think I was a trucker
She said the "im a riff, you dig?" I dug her
But now you see me, im doing my thing
Im talking that riff, im not talking that slang
You know what they say, never, ever stumble
Stay up in the jungle
And stay hungry and humble
