My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine

Whenever I need him, he's always around (Doo)
I don't have to go searching all over town (Doo, doo, doo)
He treats me nice and he loves me every day (Woo)
I'll tell the world that I'm proud to say

My man is a sweet man (My man is a sweet man)
My man is a kind man (My man is a kind man)
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine (Mine, mine)

He's home at night, I fix his food (Doo)
He's worked all day, he's in a tiring mood (Doo, doo, doo)
I cuddle him up
I give him a kiss or two (Woo)
I'm willing and able for whatever he wants to do because

My man is a sweet man (My man is a sweet man)
My man is a kind man (My man is a kind man)
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine (Mine, mine)
