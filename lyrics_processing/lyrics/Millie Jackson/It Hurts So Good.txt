First, you take my heart in the palm of your hands
And you squeeze it tight
Then you take my mind and play with it all night
You take my pride, and you throw it up against the wall
You take me in your arms, baby, and bounce me like a rubber ball
I'm not complaining what you're doing, you see
'Cause this hurting feeling is, ooh, so good to me

Don't you know that it (Hurts so good), hurts so good
Don't you know that it (Hurts so good), hurts so good

You take my name, scandalize it in the streets
Anything you wanna do or say is alright with me
Turn right around and make sweet love to me
Ooh-wee, baby, you're sho'nuff good to me
'Cause baby (Baby), these things you're doing to me
It hurts so bad, but it's worth all the misery

'Cause it (It hurts so good), hurts so good
Don't you know that it (Hurts so good), hurts so good
Ooh-hoo, baby, ooh-hoo, ooh baby
You might also like
Ooh boy, please don't ever take the hurt off me (Please)
'Cause it would hurt even worse if you would ever, ever leave
(Oh, yes, it would)
Even though sometimes it's hard for me to beg
(This hurt is killing me)
I make myself hold out, 'cause if it kills me, I don't care
'Cause baby (Baby), I don't want you to ever quit
It ain't no good 'til it hurts a little bit

'Cause it (it hurts so good), hurts so good
Don't you know that it (Hurts so good), hurts so good
Oh, baby (So go ahead and hurt me), it hurts so good
Don't you ever, don't you ever stop now, baby (Hurts so good)
Don't stop, baby (Go ahead and hurt me), ow, it hurts so good
