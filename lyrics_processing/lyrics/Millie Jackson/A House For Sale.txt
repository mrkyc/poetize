There's a house for sale
Ooh ooh ooh
Moving out today
Ooh ooh ooh
There's a house for sale
Yes there is
C'mon take it off my hands right now
Its got a spacious living room
Just right for a bride and groom
But since I've lost the one I love
All that's left now is gloom
Just wait until you see the den
All the comforts are built right in
But to me its just an empty shell
(?) everywhere
This old house is for sale
And you can move in right away
Oh there's a house for sale
I said move in right today
There's a house for sale
Move in oh today
There's a house for sale
You can move on in right this way
You might also likeThe bedroom is right this way
With unlimited closet space
A his and hers vanity
That still reflects his memory
See the kitchen, it'll blow your mind
Equipped with all the latest appliances
Conveinces for your fingertip
But not the one I used to love so dear
This old house
Is for sale
I got to move out of here today
Oh there's a house for sale
You can move in right away
There's a house for sale
And you can move in right away
Its located at 1679 Getwell Avenue
I gotta get out of here
There's a house for sale
There's a house for sale
Moving out today
There's a house for sale
Ooh I gotta find myself a new life
I can't take it no more
I got a feeling I'm gonna find it
As soon as I get rid of this house of mine
Oh help me
Somebody help me sell this house this evening
Get it real cheap
Did I hear somebody say two dollars?
