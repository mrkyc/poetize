And I said a whole lot of terrible things that I should be sorry for
But I'm not
I'm ashamed, but I'm not sorry simply because
I'm tired of having to sneak around
Everywhere we go
I wanna feel free, to be with you
I don't care who knows
How long do you think
That I can live this way?
Meeting you only at nighttime
And longing for you everyday
There's gotta be some changes made
Oh, right now, in your life
You gotta make up your mind
It's either me or your wife, because
I'm tired of hiding
Tired of those second-class places
I'm tired of hiding
From all familiar faces
I got to know right now
If it's ever gonna end
Or have all of my worries
Just begin?
You might also likeI'm tired of having to be
The one to understand
When she's got the papers on you
You're not even my man
I'm tired of having to spend
All my holidays alone
Whenever I want you here with me
She wants you at home
There's gotta be some changes made
Right now, in your life
You gotta make up your mind
It's either me or your wife, because
I'm tired of hiding
Tired of those second-class places
I'm tired of hiding
From all familiar faces
I got to know right now
If it's ever gonna end
Or have all of my worries
Just begin?
I'm tired of hiding
I'm tired, baby, I'm so tired
There's gotta be some changes made
Oh, right now, in your life
You gotta make up your mind
It's either me or your wife, because
I'm tired of hiding
Tired of those second-class places
Tired of hiding
From all familiar faces
I got to know right now
If it's ever gonna end
Or have all of my worries
Just begin?
I'm tired of hiding
