Ain't nothing around here but a bunch of women, nobody to dance with
Every man that looks like anything already taken
Sho' can't trust nobody to tell you where to go these days
Uh-oh
Mmmm.  Lord have mercy
There you are looking like a king but everything
There you are
If I spoke to you, would you smile and say hello
Or would you formally announce that you had somewhere else to go?
Oh, oh, oh, but there you are holding all my desires
I'm getting butterflies, 'cause there you are
Yeah
Don't move
Come here, anybody, I must be introduced
If I did it myself
The man just might think that I'm forward and loose
Oh, oh, oh, but there you are
There you are, baby, I'm looking at you
Hey!  Whoo!  Good God almighty, baby
Uh huh, sho' nuff
Hey Helen, the fella standing over there in the corner, do you know his name?
Oh, you do, Jimmy?  Would you introduce me to him?
See, that's why I don't like to go nowhere with you
What kind of friend are you?
That's alright
Wait 'til the next time you want somebody to hang out with you
You're gonna hang out by yourself, 'cause I'm gonna be with Jimmy
Ah, I'll do it myself, never mind, thank you
Ah, Jimmy, my name is Millie
I saw you standing over here by yourself like this
I thought if I could come over and have a few words with you
Yeah, Millie

Let's get out here on the floor and talk about it a little bit
I know it's gonna be alright, you and me, baby.  Lawd

Any way you wanna do it as long as you and I get together, baby
