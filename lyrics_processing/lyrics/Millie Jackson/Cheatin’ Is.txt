Well, I just had to tell her the way I felt about it

Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him, he blames her
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take a little ring
And break it into pieces that will never go together again

Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that start
When true love isn't what love is looking for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more

And lying at night when you're holding him tight
Something that a cheater's heart just has to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return
You might also like

The worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mama and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a thing where nobody wins
And the ones ain't big enough to play are the ones who lose

Cheatin' is a thing where nobody wins
And the ones ain't big enough to play are the ones to lose

Well, I've spoken to him, I've spoken to her
Maybe they'll stay together, maybe they won't
I've said all 'bout I know to say
I really think they should give it a try, though
They're so much alike
One is just as ridiculous as the other one
But in their own way I think they love each other
Or they wouldn't have been together this long
Besides, there's just too much at stake
They have the kids and they haven't bothered anyone
