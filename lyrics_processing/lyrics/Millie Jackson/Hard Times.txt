I had a man, he beat me every night
Twice in the morning time
To make sure he got it right
He killed my dog, said he bite too low
Put roller skates on old granny's crutches
'Cause she was moving too slow

I've had hard knocks, hard rocks
Hardships, it's been hard, you see
I've had hardware, hard livin'
And hard luck, hard after mean
I've had hard books, hard looks
And real collectors hard on my behind
But you ain't never had it hard
Do you have the harder hard times

One guy I had ran around with women
Gays are not so happy too 
He brought me home to her place
Said "this is a gift from me to you"
He liked his lovin' often
Where he came, it didn't matter
He made me get up on the table
Said he want his served up on a platter
You might also like
I've had it on hard rocks, hard seats
Hard beds and hardwood floors
I've had hard lovin', hard hairs
While havin' hardcore
I've had hard heart, heartaches
And right now I'm not doin' too fine
'Cause the hardest thing I'm getting right now
Is hard times

Girl, ain't getting nothing hard these days, y'all
That is, nothing but times

I've had hard knocks, hard rocks
Hardships, and it's been hard to see
I've had hardware, hard livin'
And hard luck, hard after mean
I've had hard books, hard looks
And real collectors hard on my behind
But the hardest thing I'm getting right now
Is hard times

I've had hard ducks, hard smacks
And right now, I'm gettin' a hard beating too
I've had hard ways, hard fouls
I'm not getting anything hard from you
I've had it hard all my life, ha ha ha ha...
I've had hard mattresses, hard taxes, yeah
I've had hard times, all the time
I've had hard time, most of the time
