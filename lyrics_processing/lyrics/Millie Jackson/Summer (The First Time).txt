The sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade
And the pavement was steaming
I told Ellie May in a red Chevrolet
I needed some time for thinking
I was just passin' by, when I caught your little eye
And I swore it was winkin'
You were thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothin' 'bout love, you knew everything
But I sat down beside you on a front porch swing
Wondering what the coming night would bring
What would it bring
Hey hey
Oh Lord
The sun closed your eyes as it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
The sweat trickled down the front of my gown
I thought it would melt me
I threw back my hair like you weren't there
And you sipped on your cold, cold beer
My shoulders were bare, you tried not to stare
But your look, it was so sincere
You might also likeYou looked at me, I heard you softly say
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the gal in you away
I'll chase it away
I'll chase the gal away
Then you smiled, we talked for a while
We walked for a mile, just you and me
We sat on the park, on the grass in the dark
And I saw the sunrise, I became a woman
Do you understand?
That ten years has gone by since I saw the look in your eyes
But the memory, oh, it still lingers
I go back in my mind to the very first time
I felt the touch of your fingers
I felt the touch of your fingers
Oh, I felt the touch, yes I did, now, mmm
There's also the bad times
That you and I both remember
And through it all, we both know that
Now is the time to say goodbye
Goodbye
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye (oh, goodbye, goddamn, gotta leave you now)
(Goodbye, baby, goodbye) now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye (oh, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye (goodbye, au revoir)
Goodbye (goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye) now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye (ooh-ooh)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye (hey, ay)
Now is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
