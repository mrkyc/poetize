Of this break-up
Cause I know I'm a lot responsible for it
But I didn't realize what was happening
Until it was much too late
I thought I was being a good wife
Since then there have been times that I've hated myself
For not being women enough to tell you what was really on my mind
Now I realize that was a mistake
A mistake I'd like to correct
Oh I'm through
Trying to prove my love to you
I'm through baby yeah
Oh babe I'm through
Sometimes I have to give up the right
What I did was wrong
But I believe that I can stand up here today babe and face you
On my very own
Cause I found someone
And I think he understands
That I know what it really means
What it really means, what it really means
To have a real man
His daily deeds
The things he doesn't say
He says I'm not trying to take your husband's place
But if I can't help ya, I swear
I swear I won't stand in your way
Tell him, tell him that you're through
Trying to prove your love to him
Go on girl tell the man that you're through right now
Trying to prove your love to him
And I gotta do it baby
You might also likeCause I'm through staying up all night
Waiting on you to return
I don't think there's a better lesson
I had better learn
But you'll find out
Further on down the road
You see I let you take my heart
And I just can't let you take my soul
Its always happening
In so many love affairs
Oh yes you're so in love today
Tomorrow, tomorrow you just don't care
One gets tired
Gives up on loving the other
Then the other one goes running in the strets, running in the streets
Trying to find, find it in another
Hey
Baby I'm through
Trying to prove my love to you
Baby I'm through
And I don't feel bad about it
And in fact I feel downright good about it
Cause I know
I've done the very best I could in this marriage
But I can't stand being around anything or involved in anything
Where my best ins't good enough
But I know what the problem was
I gave you too much love
I smothered you with love
Therefore I smothered the love
So that's just as much or even more
My mistake is yours
I say yours because you let me
You loved me cause I was loving
Yet turned away cause I had too much love to give
But that's beside the point
You found someone
And I think I'll be happy with the someone I've found
So that leaves nothing but the best for both of us
So let us not be upset about it
Cause we had some good times together
We had some loving times together
