I've spoken to her
Maybe they'll stay together, maybe they won't
I've said about all I came here to say
I really think they should give it a try though
They're so much alike
One is just as ridiculous as the other one
But in their own way, I think they love each other or they wouldn't have been together this long
Besides, there's just too much at stake
They have the kids and they haven't bothered anybody
So I just told them...
You can call Mrs. Johnson to keep the kids for a day or two
Take the early flight the Florida just the way you used to do
Have room service bring you breakfast
Make love all through the day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way
If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die
Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
And if you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way
You might also likeYou can find that little cafe with the funny sounding name
Get the corner by the window
Tell her you love her once again
If the disco DJ's still there
Go on, dance till the break of day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way
If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die.  Oh no
Go on, sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way
Then you go your separate way
