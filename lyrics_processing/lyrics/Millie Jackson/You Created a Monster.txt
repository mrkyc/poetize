She's just as childish, sit up on her butt all day long and do nothing
And he done spoiled the hell out of her trying to give her everything she want
So when he called up here talking to me about it, I told him exactly how I felt about it
You created a monster from a shy country girl
Built her up to high-class quality
Then she turned on thee
You created a monster, gave her too much freedom
She got a chance to run around
Now she's the talk of the town
Bright lights and the city life has gone to your baby's head:
Fast cars and after-hour bars
Now her love is dead
Created from the tree of life
But somewhere you lost the key
Can't find the answer no more
You lost the remedy.  Oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You created a monster from a shy country girl
Built her up to high-class quality
Then she turned on thee

Your baby changed right before your eyes
All of a sudden, your baby's left
She's like a vampire out for blood
Since the day you changed her
Your baby's been a stranger
You oughta tie her to your ball and chain
Don't take no more of this strange thing
It's your fault the knock offs the tombstone
You should've left well enough alone
Threw her back in the mixer
You forgot how to fix her.  Whoa!
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh
I told him you created a monster
Gave her a chance to run around
You created a monster, yeah
Now she's the talk of the town
(You created a monster.)
I don't wanna hear about it no more!
Just go ahead and leave me alone with this!
I don't wanna hear about no monsters, no bats, no nothing!
Don't even call me with this bullshit no more!
Call Miss Rudolph or somebody!
