If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a long due life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say

My friends tell me it's no future in loving a married man
If I can't see you when I wanna
I'll have to see you when I can
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right
If loving you is so wrong, baby
I don't want to be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing you have a wife and two little children depending on you, too?
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you have someone else at home who needs you just as much?

And am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right, baby

No, baby, uh-uh
Tell me, na-na

Am I wrong to give my love to a married man?
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong, baby
I just can't be right

I don't wanna be right, no, baby
I don't wanna be right, oh, baby
Oh, I've been loving you a little bit too long
I can't give up on your loving now
I love you, want you, need you, got to have ya
Hey, good god almighty, baby
I love it, mm-mm-mmh
I need you, let me have ya
