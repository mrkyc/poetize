Yuh

Is your life worth more than your life savings?
Got a hundred racks stacked in the basement
Lately, it make everybody hate me
Why you think I keep it off safety?
They look at me strange, they say that I changed
'Cause I don't look back down and act sideways
I keep to myself, that's the key to my wealth
Number two; never fuck with the 12, ayy

She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
Yeah, she weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me (Yuh, ayy)

You come and you go
You left me, I needed some more, I need you to grow
I can't do a thing without you
Go insane without you
The holes in my pants is from chasin' you up late night
Makin' sure that the flow still tight
Keep it in the bank, I don't need no ice
Turn to stone when you look in my eyes

She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
Yeah, she weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me

Ayy, you never sleep so I never sleep
You are the remedy, you are the end of me
You are the one for me, you are the one that look out for me
Already dead for you, already there for you
Ridin' in the whip that I would kill for, real slow
Never turning back to when my ends was low
You did turn me to an animal
Who would've known that you was so valuable

She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
Yeah, she weighin' on me, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me, yeah, she weighin' on me
She weighin' on me
(She weighin' on me) She weighin' on me
(She weighin' on me) She weighin' on me
(She weighin' on me) She weighin' on me
