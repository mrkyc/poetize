Ready to pop, drop top, fuck cops
And I'm never gon' stop, cough drop in my mouth
'Cause I'm sick with the shit that I spit out the lip
Rip-n-dip with the click, the whole team gotta hit
Real quick; talk shit, get hit, man, the clock gon' tick
So I gotta get rich, we all gonna die (Yuh)
These haters gon' test me but all of them pie (Yuh)
I know you want it, why you actin' shy?
This one's for the homies that really do know me
You claimin' you hard, well, then show me
It's double-S, bitch, and we murkin' this shit (Yuh)
We workin' for certain, she jerkin' the dick (Yuh)
Spread the booty hole and put the fingers in the clit
Real shit, take it out, she gon' lick that shit
Then spit on the dick, exit then she clean that shit
With her own damn lips, now picture that shit (Yuh)
Damn, I am the man
Blueprint shit, yeah, I got the plan
Local rap can't take over the land
So I figured it's time to get bigger, for the cheese I'm a fiend
Know what I mean, I'm on the scene with the team
Lil' Pou, what it do? Like a fat ho, I don't fuck with you (Nah)
You my dawg then I take out the you (Yeah)
Yo, my homies will always come through
Better duck when they buck, press your luck
Ain't nobody give a fuck, in my city every man for themselves
So I stay to myself for the wealth
Lowkey, I'm on stealth mode, feelin' like silhouettes in the dark, ho (Yuh)
You can see but you really don't know
What's inside, take flight on a bitch
She was talkin' too much, gotta ride (Yeah), get wet like the tide (Yeah)
Don't be a lil' pussy, don't hide when I slide right by
With the guys, stay fly up over the sky
You a liar if you say that I ain't goin' in
Put your sword against my pen, bet I win
Smart Stunnas up in this shit, don't trip
Hit a lick for the liq' for the bitch
She sip on the drink to the point she can't think (Yuh)
Brainless, famous for the head she giving
No paying, hear what I'm sayin'
Lil' Pouya, I'm layin' these rappers straight down
Don't fuck with me never, don't fuck with me now
You a clown, wear the lipstick, got you on the hit list
All around the world, I got bitches
And you know this Double-S, focused
On the guwop like Gucci, I'm posted
With my dawgs like Vick, caught the pic on your bitch
Pogo shit when she jump on the stick equipped with the clip
Amd I don't kiss lips unless they pussy
Fuck these haters they ain't really talking to me
Can't see 'em or hear 'em, Helen Keller
I will never let a hater put me down no never ever let 'em (No)
Get the pussy wetter and it's leaking like a faucet (Yuh)
Sell the ho to get the profit
Stuff the money in my pocket
Tell the ho to get walking, I'm young so I gotta stay flossin', bossin'
All these rappers mocking my style
So, I flip the bird and walk it out
Doin' my thing, what you talking 'bout?
Stay in your place like a parking spot
Don't get out of line
Homies notorious committing crimes
Like Johnny Layton, I stay on my grind
Bitch, you is basic so get out my life (Yuh)
I'm a young motherfucker so I pull up to the scene (Yuh)
Girls love my style 'cause they said it was mean (Yuh)
Something like Lysol, the flow is so clean (Yuh)
Takin' it back to the city, Miami is where I be (Yuh)
1994 style, ho
Stickin' and trickin' a bitch, drop a load down in her throat
Bet making her wet she need a mothafuckin' raincoat
Baby Bone Pouya, sit down, take a toast
'Cause the kid don't slack, my pack got my back
So don't try me you know where to find me, no more acting kindly
It's time to go in for the win, if I got to, I'll sin
You haters is trash, where is the bin?
Hear them boys talking shit, so I hit up the juice, mane (Yeah)
Hit a lick for the drug slang
White bitch like cocaine
You can keep your pants on, I'ma slide through the G-string
Well, I'm just dippin', ain't got time for women
Ballin' Scottie Pippen, I'm born to get with it, no trippin'
I'm slippin' the Vans on my feet
Just feelin' like a million bucks
Give it up for the kid with a plan
You know that I roll with a team on-demand
I know you know that I'm the man (Yuh)
And fuck rap, I wanna see the cash
Start with a play for today to get paid
Like the first of the month, don't be lazy, this shit gettin' crazy
I hate being copied, your raps ain't original (Yuh)
Straight up, no subliminal
Nobody hearing you (No), they sleepin' on me
So, I wake they ass up with the lyrical (Bitch)
I'm a motherfuckin' G, don't you see?
