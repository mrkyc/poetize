Bitch, I been a scrub since day one
Scrub another toilet 'til the pay come
Poppin' ten pills 'til the pain's numb
I can feel all the hate from my day ones
Claimin' they clique like they into it
Really wishing I fail, you my enemies
I ain't pay for no ho, I'm just feelin' it
Where in the fuck were you at at my sentencing?
"What the sentence is?" said the judge as he sentenced me
To the pen where he 'ready sent many men
First time offender to felony, can't feel resentment for crimes
I'm just puttin' in work for the set that I'm reppin' in
But what happens when sets start to cavin' in?
I pray the fuck boy don't get popped
They get picked up, picked on 'til they speak to the cops
I can hear squealin' like some pigs in a pot
So I'm still prayin' that the case get dropped
Ayo, Pouya (Yuh), I've been praying a lot
But I don't know who's talking back, is it Satan or God?
Could be the voices in my head since I been kickin' the ox
All I really need is beats so Getter passed me the aux
Wrap the cable around my neck and then I stand up on top
Kick the chair from under my feet, now that should tighten the knot, damn
My verse snappin' harder than a noose did
Sorry shorty, can't fuck with you, you got them loose lips
Funny thing about loose lips is how they shake shake
Catch me on the western and franklin I got the deuce lit
Doublin' up my cup, but no Quali', I got the deuce red
Cooling at the crib with some groupies they really cool with
No shame when I claim it or rep it, I got a rude clip
Pimping hoes in no ho, I'm shameless to get my crew fed
You might also like
Yuh, ayy, yuh

Keep my mind preoccupied, work on myself
Can't let nobody get into my mind or get intimate with me
I enter my stealth, playing dip down the block
Glock cocked way back (Yuh)
Bloodstains drippin' all around the face mask (Yuh)
Throw it in the river, now where your case at? (Yuh)
Devil in my eyes telling me to face that (Yuh)
I cannot comply to the feds
Laid back, fucked up in the head and I bust in her legs
So sick to my stomach, laying down in my bed (Bitch)
Contemplating the suicide, thinking like, "Who am I?"
You from the gutter, bitch I'm from the sewer side
Got a lifetime in a hard drive
A hundred racks and it's all mine, can't go for the minimum
(Yuh, yuh, yuh) Whippin' the maximum, maxi pad pussy
You drippin' blood out of your ovaries
Tell your ho please to get over me
Know it's me when I pull up in the Caddy and hoes wanna photo me
Follow me, I can show you what you 'posed to be
I run my coat, never ride on no coattail
Hoes sell pussy on wholesale (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
The cost go low when you desperate
The cops ride slow like they creepin' on yo' necklace
I got the block together with no Tetris
Bump this ho right here when you feeling real helpless
Keep the Glock somewhere near my pelvis
In case I gotta get my vengeance, yuh
