MTM, hit 'em with the heat

Been below the average, still, I walk tall
'96 DeVille, feelin' like the hero of the hood
I never meant to be what I became
I'm a Florida boy that couldn't afford a Ford
At the corner store with five of my homies
With the Glock inside my jacket, make a racket, tryna sell a sack
So I can get a hatchback, coppa pulled me over, that's a setback
It ain't nothing I can't bounce back from
They love my style, they love the way that I been using my tongue
But, hey, how you hate somebody puttin' on for your city?
I got a thousand enemies and yet they all wanna rip me
But even if you kill me, I will never die, my words will live forever
I thought this money was supposed to make my life lil' better
But now this money got me dancin', dancin' with the devil
Heavy metal, got my pants saggin' like a '90s rebel
I can never settle, I need my settlements lately
Been around the world but Miami is where my grave be

Take my life away and let me die where I reside
I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized
Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh
Watch me drop the top like an aftershock, yuh
Take my life away and let me die where I reside
I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized
Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh
Watch me drop the top like an aftershock

Shake hands with the right but on the left, I got the nina
Serena couldn't serve you rappers better than me either
Took a gamble with my life, I spent my money on a chain
Threw it all away to run away from all the pain
You was a rat from the beginnin', tryna play me like a bitch
I guess that come with the game, the pros and cons of gettin' rich
Real recognize fake, see it in yo' face
You hangin' around my nuts to get a taste
Baby, let me tell you somethin'
Most these rappers got they mans in their pocket
Locked up to a 360
Sold your soul for an all gold rope wrapped around your throat
And now you walkin' around the city like you runnin' the show
But I know you got yourself into somethin' hard to get out
Especially when half the world got your name in their mouth
You feel the pressure on your spine, cripple up your mind
Diamond in the rough, waiting to be mined, ayy

Take my life away and let me die where I reside
I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized
Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh
Watch me drop the top like an aftershock, yuh
Take my life away and let me die where I reside
I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized
Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh
