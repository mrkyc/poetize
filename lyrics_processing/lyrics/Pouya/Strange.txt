Maybe I'm strange to you, but I'm okay to me
There's a cure for AIDS, but they wanna clear the streets
Your opinion is invalid, please don't even speak
But you can drop it, bust it open 'til it's obsolete

I got myself too much, but then I think about it
These rappers suck, you hear my shit, you turnin' up the volume
You at the club getting drunk and I'm sitting in my room
Chillin' like a wine cooler, one word to define Pouya
I fuck with me, I love myself
I hate you hoes, I hate your attitude
But I love the way you fuck behind them closed doors
Come closer to me, get comfortable
I ain't Dr. Huxtable, I know it's hard to trust me though
You're so cold you make my nuts shrivel up
Morons taking Oxy till their body pretty ugly
I can't stand them, selectin' randoms at my show
But sometimes it's just for show, I think this year, I'll let you know

Maybe I'm strange to you, but I'm okay to me
There's a cure for AIDS, but they wanna clear the streets

Face cocaine white, pussy panther pink
Fuck the sink, I'm 'bout to lay you on that mink, what you think?

I'ma put you on that bed and lay your head down
You gotta pay your bills or it's man down
There's seven billion more like you
And a good percentage of them don't even have no clue

Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
Fuck you, I don't know what to do
