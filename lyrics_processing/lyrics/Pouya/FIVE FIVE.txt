MTM, hit 'em with the heat

I can be the one they hate, I don't got time to be liked
I'm that down south 5'5 Florida boy, still rolling them dice
Better pay yo' dues, better stay low-key, bitch, don't mind me
Ain't going back, put it on me, I'ma live lavishly
I can be the one they hate, I don't got time to be liked
I'm that down south 5'5 Florida boy, still rolling them dice
Better pay yo' dues, better stay low-key, bitch, don't mind me
Ain't going back, put it on me, I'ma live lavishly

Welcome to the South Side where them cute hoes do you dirty
In my city, we don't fist bump, we dap up and get to swervin'
In that '06 Vogue, money on overload
Momma, we never going back to poverty
Fuck that, hoes on the floor like a rug rat, crawling at my feet
Rappers been mumblin', talking about nothing
They got the kids stumblin' off of the xannies
Now killin' themselves so slowly and I feel like Mick Foley
When I'm in your bitch raw, can't hold me back
I'm feeling myself, still rocking a shoelace for a belt
Only thing changing is my lanes and payments rates
I raise the stakes, I raise these rappers from the grave
So put some respect on my name
My flame is reigning with no label
Momma said, "Get that bread and lay low"
While you sippin' on your Faygo 45, blow off your halo
