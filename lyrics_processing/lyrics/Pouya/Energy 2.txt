My mind don't sleep, my body weak
I can't compete, I bought a Caddy
I copped a Porsche so I could sleep, don't wanna wake
You never leave my mind, I'm anxious, I'm waiting
I'm patient, you basic, you taking up my time don't play me
I went from mopping floors to billboards
From picking up plates to fucking hoes in the back door
Two-door coupe, never thought I could afford
Never going back to the Honda Accord
I do as I please, with no sense in my ears
Triple up my profit from last year
Still fuck you, never sign no deal
You can kiss the ass of my automobile

Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me
Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me

Runnin 'round the city with the Glock tucked
They scream my name when I pop up
Underground Underdog, I turn myself to a legend
Industry mad cause I'm getting mentioned
Rappers they control creatively
Labels really never favor me
I took my words and made an absurd
Amount of money, now they hating me
UU made me who I am today
That booty make me wanna masturbate
That bitch pussy I'ma dive in it
I'm confident, prominent, dominant
My fans go hard for me
So fuck what you thinking
I made my decision that I'mma go in 'till my body end up missing
Now the po-po got me down in my kitchen
Until then I gotta stay consistent

Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me
Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me
Fascist faggots, counting cabbage up
Run up in they spot and blast 'em with a pump
Smoking dirty blunts with a dirty slut
See me in the streets with them dirty bums
I been getting up 'til they lock me up
Now they kiss my drugs so I'm acting up
Whipping stolen Lexus, kudos in the cut
And a dirty thot, for the eighth of skunk
Keep the .38 if they acting up
 be pulling up for a stolen gun
And I need a stack then I wipe the slug
Cause this chopper stolen, I ain't slipping up
I pour'd a four in my litre
Speakers bumping, riding 'round with my nina
Smoking, hoping that you don't ever meet her
Tweaking on Molly, I'm dumping the litre

Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me
Take two steps away from me
I know you feel the energy
I'mma fuck my enemies
Can't fuck with my entity
I got two whips now
I got two hoes now
Still got my fans with me
Still got my bands with me
Back at it, bad vibes
Energy running through my veins
I powered up when I'm drugging and fucked up, duck boy
Buck shots, fuck boy
No slack from the K
You get wacked if you lack off rip
Running through poppers to fondle your bitch
You feel me, see me, wanna be me
Gun in broad day, it's fuckboy seas'
And I'm with that DUI, when I ride
Please don't speak our names out your backside
Sci-fi bitch, you see this lick
My chick get tips in dola bags
They strapped up the perky
Fuck it, I love it, molly started flooding, wrist looking stupid Yellow hoe clueless, boy I really do this
Flip my wrist, whip a brick
Smash the whip, love my enemies
You dead to me just feel my energy
Bad shit, still the set
Break the law, been a vet
Been a boss, I played the cards
