I'm losing my patience with you, girl
Still got me fucked up 'round the whole world
Don't make it a scene when I leave this time
Wake up, break up, then it's sex at night
Back to the same routine we go
This feels like a bad TV show
Can't see the big picture to help myself
I'm drowning in pain that I've dealt myself
Sunrise come and I'm back to the same old me
Don't wanna hold you back from being the best version that you can be
And it's not with me, no, it's not with I
Well, at least I tried, couldn't be that guy
Only was myself this time
Now I gotta let this die, yeah

Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
But I can stay forever waiting for you at my window
Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
But I can stay forever waiting for you at my window

Big house, a Porsche and three dogs
Not enough to get a phone call
This clout don't mean a thing at all
This bread will numb the pain, but won't break your fall
I do my best with my back on the wall
The pressure take time to make diamonds
I'm bleeding, these leeches don't leave me no room for no breathing
No reason to relax, just relapse
So sick of the hands they reaching out for dap
You never been on that
And I been known that
So I been slowly showin' I'm loyal
Are you thinkin' about me? Well, I hope that you are
If you leave me tonight, baby, please don't go too far
I'm lookin' up at the moonlight like, was I wrong to think you was into me?
Little symphonies in my head telling me differently, had an epiphany
Think I was right this time, maybe
It's hard to tell from the position I'm in
But it felt like what we had was real
When you had me hooked on a reel, yeah

Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
But I can stay forever waiting for you at my window
Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
But I can stay forever waiting for you at my window
Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
But I can stay forever waiting for you at my window
Visions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night
Close my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine
Breathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo
