Cut my neck, the blood fresh
Got a check, still depressed
Been a mess, fuck stress
What next? Take a guess
Cyanide on my breath
On my breath, on my breath
Cut my neck, the blood fresh
Got a check, still depressed
Been a mess, fuck stress
What next? Take a guess
Cyanide on my breath, on my breath

Throw your set up, I know you fed up
Release the lead from the nine, Columbine, don't get up
I got a vendetta
I got depressed and I never got better
You ain't on my level
Don't be pushing me, pressing me
I got a Big Mac and it's next to me
And I got a fat bitch on the ecstasy
On top of the bread like a sesame
They want the recipe for success
And now they after me 'cause I got a masterpiece
Used to, used to laugh at me and now they gassin' me, dappin' me
Up in front of my family
Make 'em say ugh, no Master P

I think I'm next up in the 27 Club
I've been too fucked up, serotonin 'bout done
Every night been ending with me biting on my gun
I know you say you love me but you make me wanna jump
Off of the ledge
I'm eleven stories up and thinking about how my mother would feel if I jumped
But now it's not enough for me to stop, how I feel about ending it all, I'ma jump (Jump)
Jump (Jump)
Ready to die but Wavy saved me
I guess I'll see another day, not splattering all over pavement
(Let me in)

Cut my neck, the blood fresh
Got a check, still depressed
Been a mess, fuck stress
What next? Take a guess
Cyanide on my breath
On my breath, on my breath
Cut my neck, the blood fresh
Got a check, still depressed
Been a mess, fuck stress
What next? Take a guess
