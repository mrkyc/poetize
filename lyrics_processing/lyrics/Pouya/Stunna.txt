Baby Bone, on my own
Got these rappers on they toes
Asking me 'bout my flow
Like a magician, I can't let you know
'Bout my tricks, 'bout my bitch
Lately, been on some savage shit
I know you mad 'cause I won't commit
Baby girl, don't trip, just bounce on the dick

Stunna, always rollin' with a hundred (Yuh)
Dudes by my side and they ready to die (Bitch)

To rest in my grave, I'm not a bad guy, I just don't behave (Yuh)

Hit up 2phonez shawty like, "What's the play?" (Brr, brr)
He said, "Let's get it," I said "Let's go" (Let's go)
Plus me and Braddy been fuckin' the same ho (Bitch)
And me and Fat Nick, we live in the same crib (Yuh)

Bitch, don't tell me, "Tone down the cussin'" (Bitch)
Kick it to the curb with your bitchass cuffin' (Bitch)

The game is over (Yuh), press your luck like a four-leaf clover
