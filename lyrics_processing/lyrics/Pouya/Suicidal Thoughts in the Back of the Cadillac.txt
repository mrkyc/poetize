How could you tell me I'm not the one?
Fuck that, bust back, put the Bible down
Devil in my soul, mind runnin' around
I might blast on your ass, get down when I say so
Go around the corner, pick me up when I'm done
Three blocks I'ma run, open the door when I arrive
Say bye to your God, hands rise to the sky if you feel me

You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you your peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back
Every time you turn your back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you your peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back
Every time you turn your back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac (Yuh, yuh, yuh)

I'm wired with desire, throw the water in the fire
Engulfed with hoes, clothes, money, foes, but it all goes
Eventually, I'll pack a nine and a simile
For the fake smiles in my eyes
Yeah, they took my eye, so I took their eye
Now we all blind to the truth
Clap on your wack ass, then it's back to the booth, yuh

Don't be a bitch, I want to watch you do it
Don't stop, cock it back and pop the bullet
Glock big enough to blow off the mullet
On Joe Dirt, when it hits your brain it won't hurt no more
Just know when I go, play "Chop Suey" at my funeral
Don't cry, just vibe with my dead body
This is what I wanted, hope I don't regret it
This is what you wanted, lil' bitch, right? Yuh
