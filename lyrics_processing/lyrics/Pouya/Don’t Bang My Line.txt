MTM, hit 'em with the heat

Gotta go get it, go jump out the couch
Grip on the .9 and run me a route
FLA banging out my mouth
Down south boy never been in no drought
Get wet, sit back, baby, don't be loud
Don't bang my line, never been my style
Guess we 'bout to find out
Will the money and the hoes make it all worthwhile?

Swervin', bendin' corners with no purpose to my life
I got no permit but I'm workin' on my new mixtape tonight
Now that my chain hang low, now that my neck so froze
Baby, I can be your Savage, you can be my Rose, yuh
Most of the underground rappers you fuck with today gotta pay they respect to me
Lately been feelin' like I was vital aspect
A reason that these rappers breathin'
Leave 'em on the cement leakin' at my leisure
Baby Bone, I ain't never been a ho
Pussyboy, you ain't got nine lives
5'5, got a .9, gotta let 'em hoes fly

Alison, Valerie, all my bitches know
Tryna kill for the set, I got stitches now
Watch me walk, do your kindness, you can't track me down
Leave your life up on the floor, no, we don't make a sound (Sweet)
I can't do this shit, my mind is losin' all its presence
Don't leave my crib to be surrounded by these peasants
I don't got no frame (Ayy, ayy)
White bitch sniff cocaine (Ayy, ayy)
Thirteen diamond chains
