Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy when you get next to me
I am the man now, I got a plan now, I got some bands now
I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now
Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy when you get next to me

I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now

Well, if you don't comply then you cannot ride with a real ass guy like me
Nikes on the feet, simplicity is key
Keep your distance when you talk to me' cause I can't trust a soul
Nonetheless my own judgment (Bitch)
There's no antidote for being this dope
I woke up like this, feeling myself
Fuck your 360, I'm signing to Radio Disney
Feeling gorgeous when I'm recording
Got the show jumping like I'm Jordan
Stupid foreign fuck, what you saying, bitch? I need a manual
Can't understand you, can't even stand you I am an animal
I am so valuable, look at my capital (Bitch, look at my capital)

Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy when you get next to me
I am the man now, I got a plan now, I got some bands now
I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now

Speak my mind, never hold my tongue
Stay in line, boy, take your number
I've been hungry, I've been under
Slowly coming over with the Rover
My boys seen me at my lowest so they coming up with me
You ain't with us but you can witness this greatness
Like a bum with a blunt, just face it, boy
I've been on the rise
I've been on the side, I've been on the track
My hoes weigh more than me
Still, I put the whole city on my back
Back to back, grab the mac, attack anyone who lack
I'm still gon' fuck your ho, fuckboy

Got your hood up my shit, now like I'm still on the road
