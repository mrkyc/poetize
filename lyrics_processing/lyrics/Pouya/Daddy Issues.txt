MTM, hit 'em with the heat

Sometimes I can't fuck with your bitchin', wanna buy you a flight
Send your ass back to your daddy house so you can think twice
But then I switch up my emotions, rather be with you than forgotten
I can't have this crib to myself, without you I get too cautious
And now I'm back to bein' alone, thinkin' about who you fuckin' with
Never wanted to catch no feelings, not too good with apologies
I was used to being a lone wolf, rollin' with a few homies
Who had my back and wanted the best for me
Now I see clearly, it ain't enough for me

She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah, I know that you got some daddy issues
She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah, I know that you got some daddy issues

Pull up in a Chevy, now I'm ready to go
I got my nina by my side, you know she ready to blow
From side to side we got it jumping every function we go
I can't pay no mind to no ho that put a lump in my throat
5'5, take a lot to get a rise from me
Bendin' corners in my coupe, I know they eyeing me
Baby girl, you know I love it when you lie to me
Dead inside, feel alive when you lie with me
