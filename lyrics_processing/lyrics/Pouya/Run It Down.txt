But it's like this, though
I'm tired of folks, you know I'm sayin'?
Them close minded folks, you know I'm sayin'?
It's like we got a demo tape, but don't nobody wanna hear it
But it's like this, the South got something to say
That's all I got to say

Got your money, got your paper
We can run it down tonight
Ooh, everybody else a hater
I don't give a damn, you're right
Got your money, got your paper
We can run it down tonight
Ooh, everybody else a hater
I don't give a damn, you're right

I need four forty-fives and a MAC by my side
When I go out of town and I roll them dice
You, you went by the Pittsburgh
So I gotta intern, hopin' that the test go right
I've been tossin' and turnin', knowin' that you perfect
Baby, you've been on my mind
Now I'm all alone with a cracked iPhone
Sittin' down sideways, stayin' up all night
So I gotta fill a void, now I'm back in a Porsche
Mikey tellin' me to slow down
Hands in the field, now I'm back in the show
Damn mic in my hand, guess I'm back in a showdown, yeah
Backend, hit it, sold out, did it
Guess I'm back on the road, gotta tend to business
Came a long way from pickin' up plates, gettin' no tips
Havin' to mop and wash dishes

I don't give a damn, you're right

Simmer down, it's summer now
Baby, I don't really wanna hear the run-around
I read your mind, but I didn't mind that you wanna minimize
My enterprise and fuck my bag up, back up
Backed up with the thoughts in my mind
When are we seeing this wedding ring?
Will you become a better man?
When will you swallow the medicine?
Swallow your pride for my ego
I need a guy that hide his emotions like Tony Soprano
See fifteen therapists, really, it's really embarrassing
None of them bitches have bettered me
My temperament still out of whack
But at least my paper's still intact
I got two full bags in the backseat
And four real homies that'll back me, yeah
Got your money, got your paper
We can run it down tonight
Ooh, everybody else a hater
I don't give a damn, you're right
Got your money, got your paper
We can run it down tonight
Ooh, everybody else a hater
