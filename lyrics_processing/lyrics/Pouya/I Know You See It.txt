Ayy, ayy, let's go!
Nothing was the same when I was 17
I would take a giant huff, just like aubrey
Inky and Blinky pull up, get ghost
That's red and blue lights in Pacman of Atari
What would you do if you felt that most of these niggas was lying just to be king
Then when it's yo turn to be a young Simba
They wanna play Scar in the ring
Fuck all that Hakuna Matata and peace for the stronger
I'll blueprint the game like I'm Shawn Corey Carter
That means I'm O-U-T but dead fucking presidents represent me
Me and my ninjas are smoking on Donatello
Everything's moving in turtle time
But that's an inception of what you can dream
When you elevated and extending your mind
So if a nigga wanna play games I'll treat this shit like Smash Bros
Hit his ass with the C right arrow
A Samus with a flame throw
In the pot is that sugar and spice with everything nice so I'm taking the Powerpuff
My eyes will be blossom when inside the bubble
You know I'm in love with that buttercup, nigga

In the bando doin' numbers, worth some figures now

All alone in the dark thinkin' bout fetti
Pockets all flat like no bubbles in the Remy
Talkin' semi incase a nigga wanna act out
Blow his back out like Bill Clinton did Lewinsky
Clock tickin', talkin' shit to my old ho
Gettin' deep throat, smokin' dope in my dojo
Everything spinnin' as I take a push up the street
80 ounces deep, drunk swervin' cussin' at police
Ridin' round town in a stolen Lamborghini
My bitch ass is fat and she look like Tahiri
Sippin' on Henny, I'm loose off the Bourbon
I'm swervin' Suburbans I might leave you worthless
I'm Beer Can Dan off a two xans in a wasted daze, wastin days
Broad day with da K
I'm out da window like I'm James Earl Ray
From a rainbow you're talkin' like you're Martin Luther King, l'il bitch, it's lit

Quick to Columbine some shit
I'm loaded up & strapped up
And I want my bottom bitch
Man I love my bottom bitch

Before I put the D in your sister
You can lick the tip but no picture
I'll put that pussy on Insta
I'm a hustler, baby, so I'm even accepting them nickles, pennies and all
Won't see me they dropping they drawls
You snitch and get teared up like Jaws
Get down to the river, we droppin' you off
Takin' yo wallet then stop to the mall
Mama said time to go get it and ball
Get away clean, there was really no flaws
Florida boy, I rep that
Sippin' lean, she get bent back (Bent back)
Talkin' crazy get bitch slapped (Yeah)
Pouya ho I still pull ya ho
