She think she need me, girl, you gon' make it
Drink got me leaning, trap got me faded
I can't believe it, rap got me famous
Racks got me jaded, all of these stacks in my stash house
I made it, feel like the greatest
She think she need me, girl, you gon' make it
Drink got me leaning, trap got me faded
I can't believe it, rap got me famous
Racks got me jaded, all of these these stacks in my stash house
I made it, came from the basement

Rubbing bodies, thotties, I love 'em
I'm digging in darkness, Slick Slothin' I'm slossing
Wrist look like I ball off, been causing problems
Molotov tossing, dirty drink got me noddin'
Ride with my bitch, that's my side, don't forget
Four finger ring, now I look like a pimp
Back to the pimp got me stay like a bitch
Cooling with some hoe from the valley, boy it's lit
Bitches all thick and I'm loving it
Cuffing, never discussed cause I'm not into relationships
Fuck all the fake shit, they not painting shit
Hoe tell me I don't like Vincent Van Gogh
Ran through the door with the world on my mind
Racks got me jaded, rap got me famous
Finessing tickets, tell my mama I made it
Stepped in the pavement

Racks got me jaded, all of these stacks in my stash house
I made it, came from the basement

I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T, baby I know that you don't need me
Still, I can never see you without a G
Mama, I'm famous, still, I gotta ride with a stainless
Got a rack for every man that said I wouldn't make it
From the basement to the pavement
From a broke me to a rich man
Caddy's swerving and I'm driving in your pit, man
Swinging like Tarzan, on Xans, crazy, unstable, I'm losing it
Spent all my money on Vegas booty, bitches
Now I'm doing dishes just to come back up
Got my rap tats back up
Like Wesley, now my life fucked up
Fuck it, I'ma get drugged up
Pick up a gun and light the damn club up, yeah
She think she need me, girl, you gon' make it
Drink got me leaning, trap got me faded
I can't believe it, rap got me famous
Racks got me jaded, all of these stacks in my stash house
I made it, feel like the greatest
She think she need me, girl, you gon' make it
Drink got me leaning, trap got me faded
I can't believe it, rap got me famous
Racks got me jaded, all of these stacks in my stash house
