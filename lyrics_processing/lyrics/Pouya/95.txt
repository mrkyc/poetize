You must be tired, baby, 'cause you've been runnin' through my mind
I can't keep quiet, baby, 'cause I've been burnin' deep inside
I'm runnin' out of time, maybe you can fill my void
If not, keep tryin', baby, and never leave me alone

I just wanna go ninety-five, I don't wanna have a nine-to-five
I don't wanna hear the his and byes, I really want a ride or die
I need you by my side, baby, you keep me alive
Never thought you would be so divine, but you caught me by surprise

From the day that I met you, I knew I was never gonna let you go
Goin' crazy in my bedroom, thinkin' about what we could've been
The world we livin' in got me sick to my stomach
I'm comin' to an intersection in my life
Twenty-four, confused and bruised from my past
I really need somebody to bring me back

You must be tired, baby, 'cause you've been runnin' through my mind
I can't keep quiet, baby, 'cause I've been burnin' deep inside
I'm runnin' out of time, maybe you can fill my void
If not, keep tryin', baby, and never leave me alone

I just wanna go ninety-five, I don't wanna have a nine-to-five
I don't wanna hear the his and byes, I really want a ride or die
I need you by my side, baby, you keep me alive
Never thought you would be so divine, but you caught me by surprise

I knew you'd be the one I would be after
Don't you deprive me and make me act up
Thought you was real but you was an actor
Don't know what you after, the money or the laughter
Fuck with a real one 'cause I don't see none
I see fuckboys and I can never be one
Baby Bone, gotta keep it real 'til my last meal
Can't be still poppin' pills like an Advil

You must be tired, baby, 'cause you've been runnin' through my mind
I can't keep quiet, baby, 'cause I've been burnin' deep inside
I'm runnin' out of time, maybe you can fill my void
If not, keep tryin', baby, and never leave me alone

I just wanna go ninety-five, I don't wanna have a nine-to-five
I don't wanna hear the his and byes, I really want a ride or die
I need you by my side, baby, you keep me alive
