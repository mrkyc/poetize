Oh man, oh man, I'ma
I'ma kill this bitch, man
Where the fuck you at?
Where the fuck you at, bitch?
Yuh, ayy

We sharin' Sharon at the Sheraton 'cause sharin' is carin'
And Karen is starin' at me, I know she feelin' embarrassed
Grab her by the neck, say, "Bitch, don't ever disrespect me"
Pop the MAC-11 if your soul is feelin' empty
Not so much my enemies but more so my fans I do envy
Yuh, these hoes startin' a frenzy
My dick is feelin' so flimsy, I can barely keep up with a B cup
See, I ain't bring my A-game, can you keep up?
Fuck what you heard, piss on your dirt
Put in that work like private school girls in the first grade
Dade County, born and raised out the 305
Where hookers stick and jive with pocket knives, win the battle lose your life
Fuck your wife in my rusty pickup truck
The same kids you hangin' with the same ones yellin', "Stick em up"
I can resurrect you, I can pick you up out the mud, put you on to somethin'
Show you all the ropes, show you how that money grow

I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go
Never listen to your parents, trust me, they don't fucking know what's best for you like I do, yuh, ayy
You think I give a fuck about your IQ?
You might also like
Your mama thinkin' you stupid because you bringin' in Fs
Givin' her stress and a couple knots in her chest
Nobody appreciate that you've been tryin' your best
I can show you how to give up and just hang from your neck
Your stepdaddy lookin' for your respect
I say fuck that, don't give it to him, fuck him and his rep
I know he getting on your nerves comin' home drunk as fuck
Beatin' on you and your mama
I say put one that in that llama and spit on him while he's sleepin'
Put a needle in his veins so the police think he was tweakin'
Tell your mama you was gone the whole weekend
Throw away the pistol, make sure nobody could reach it
Your life is better, ain't it? Told you that you need me
I can show you how to be the man
I can show you how to make your body count expand
I can show you how to multiply
Your profits, your pockets, your hoes, follow me and I promise

I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go
Never listen to your parents, trust me, they don't fucking know what's best for you like I do, yuh, ayy
You think I give a fuck about your IQ?
I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go
Never listen to your parents, trust me, they don't fucking know what's best for you like I do
