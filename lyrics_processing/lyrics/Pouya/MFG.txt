I stuck to myself and it worked out
Middle finger to you rappers in the dirt now
Stop callin' my phone, I don't wanna get booked
Sheryl should've put the pussy out from the jump
These ghetto type rappers need to let go
Can't even match the man's tempo, nonetheless the style
Got her sweating out the pussy, looking like she ran a mile
A hundred miles for a hoe to get dick
White trash from Connecticut
She even let everyone in the sprinter hit
Gotta hope that the condom on my dick don't slip
Pull up with a Glock and a flock, ready to pop off for nothin'
The old man be working, the young man be stuntin'
Get from my face I don't want a discussion
I already know that my music disgustin'

Ayy, fall in love with the pussy, man, you got the game fucked up
Every bitch in this world just another slut
Get my dick sucked and kick 'em out the door
Cold-hearted Ramirez, I'll never love a fucking hoe
G*59 'til the day I fucking die
Suicidal thoughts runnin' inside of my fucking mind
Membrane lobe on the cocaine
Swervin' in another motherfucking six-lane (Hold up)
Bitch, I be pimpin', I'm fucking these women
I'm raw-doggin' hoes in the back of the building
I feel like a villain, I twist and then smoke the prescription
There's no competition, you feel me?
Bitch, I'm a goddamn pimp, no love for a hoe when I look for a trick
The game is too thick, I soft it up quick
When I say it's all over with, you better believe that shit

I done told you, don't sleep on me
(Yo, yo, straight up, man, fuck everybody in this bitch)
