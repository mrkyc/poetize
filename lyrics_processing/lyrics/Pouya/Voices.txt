MTM, hit 'em with the heat

I'm a young man, I don't romance, no slow dance, my emotions
Bottled up to never be let out, floatin' deep in the ocean
You got me feelin' like I wasn't dead inside
With the way you jumpin' out of that two-piece
Groupies think it's a movie, but no, they cannot move me
I never had a role model, my best friends turn into my rivals
Pistol grippin', never slippin', got it on me, ducking from the 5-0
You yellin' in the void of voices
No one hears you cryin', dyin', talkin' to yourself
What else do you need? You feel incomplete
Got nothing else in your reach

Out with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today
Every time I try to break out, I get weighed down
Maybe no more hiding today
And I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did
And I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did
Out with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today
Every time I try to break out, I get weighed down
Maybe no more hiding today
And I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did
And I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did

My mama warned me said, "The money gon' change your friends
You gon' take handshakes from fake fucks
That won't get near your grave when you die"
No surprise, euthanize, you and I
You were the one that said I was the one
But when the time come, you were nowhere to find
Now everybody wanna be around me
I got the formula for the come-up
Everybody get the fuck from 'round me
Where was you when I was on the ground?
I'm raid to you roaches so when you approachin', be certain to show me respect
The Underground Underdog only get stronger the deeper I get

Out with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today
Every time I try to break out, I get weighed down
Maybe no more hiding today
And I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did
And I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did
Out with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today
Every time I try to break out, I get weighed down
Maybe no more hiding today
And I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did
