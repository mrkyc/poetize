Yuh, yuh, yuh

I ain't got no gas in the whip, no cash in my wallet
No one on my dick, no missed call from your bitch
What's goin' on with me? I used to be the man
Nobody's pullin' up to my show no more
They sick and tired of the same old
But I spit that flame though, you know my name, ho
Suicidal, you know how that thing go
I used to ride around and bang it in my four-door
Couldn't step outside without somebody askin' me for photos
Now it seem like nobody know me
I haven't heard a word from none my homies
My bitch left me, I'm lonely, somebody set me up
Tried to wet me up, bullets in the windshield of my Acura
Luckily, they wasn't accurate, I wish they took my life
Twenty-one was fun but forty-one ain't right
I hate my kids, hate my wife
What to do? Where to go?
My SoundCloud don't pay no more
I gotta get it on the low
I hope they don't knock on my door
What to do? Where to go?
My SoundCloud don't pay no more
I hope they don't knock on my door

Yuh, yuh, the bills due and the walls got some mildew (Bitch)
I been looking at this bottle, wonderin' what these pills do
My dog died in the hallway (Damn)
I been lookin' at the ceiling, cryin' all day (All day, yuh)
My life sucks, my job sucks, my kids sucks, my bitch sucks
Haven't even got my dick sucked
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' outta luck (Outta luck, yuh)
I'm gunnin', gunnin', gunnin' for them bucks (For them bucks, ayy)

I used to be a veteran, now I'm feelin' like a rookie
My bitch don't give out the cookie, I'ma have to call a hooker
Get the quarters out the Acura and pay this ho
I've been savin' up my change for a rainy day
I should've listened to them things my mama had to say
I put myself in this predicament
My life is nothin', man, I wish that I could finish it
I'm workin' for a man that's workin' for a man who's workin' for a middleman
Get me out of here, sick of sheddin' tears
I thought I was 'bout to be a millionaire
But now I'm strugglin' muggin' these motherfuckers with a .44
Do I have to mention I'm desperate?
Might just pawn the Double S necklace
I can't deal with all this pressure
What to do with all of these records?
Tryna rebuild an empire, can't even put myself together (Yuh)
