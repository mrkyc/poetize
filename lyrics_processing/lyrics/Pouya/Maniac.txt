You fucking with realer
We reap all pretenders no need for a pistol
I'm swinging the K
Kill a man day
Murder Miami
Bring fear to your family, let bodies decay
Coming with static, that MAC automatic
I'm wrapping a corpse, with that duct tape and plastic
I come through with gadgets
That turn you to ashes
Right before you die, throw his ass in the lake
Triple six ritual, within' the set
Three six it spin to his head is ahead
That haunted his nesting
The black silhouette, that shadow the soul
Into nothin' but X
New era underdog, never neglect
Run up, get done up by a loaded tech
Living more, killing more
Money percentages, play with my paper, I cut off your neck

Yuh, yuh
My hell is never ending
I been living with the devil on my shoulder
Ain't a human that's colder than me
Hotter than me, you can't reach my degrees
I don't read, but I do release magazines
I got a chapter for all of you maggots
I'm an underground colonel
Life is eternal, death is inferno
We don't fuck with you
You don't fuck with us
Please don't cross the line
Still walk around with a fat lip hoe
She bust out the pussy, she make it explode
She jump on the dick, put a strain on my back
I hold that strap, I never lack
My momma think I'm a maniac
I cannot slack
Putting rappers in body bags
You might also like
I hold that strap, I never lack
My momma think I'm a maniac
I cannot slack

Let bodies decay
I hold that strap, I never lack
My momma think I'm a maniac
I cannot slack
Word to Miami

Let bodies decay
I hold that strap, I never lack
My momma think I'm a maniac
I cannot slack
Word to Miami

I cannot slack
