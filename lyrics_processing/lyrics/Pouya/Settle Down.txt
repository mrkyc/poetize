Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?
Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?

I tell lies to keep you by my side, I know that
Feeling right, when my style, bring this life in and out
Watch a teardrop running down your face
I broke your love but here is where your heart stays and it goes
Forgotten soul with no place to go
You left me 'lone with an empty home, staring at my phone
I'm standing in the rain, the pain don't show
And now I know how I crushed your soul
So now I don't feel whole

I slip here in my lair, your set fades, wastin' days
I'm okay, we part ways, love don't stay in no lane
I slip here in my lair, your set fades, wastin' days
I'm okay, we part ways, love don't stay in no lane

Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?
Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?
You might also like
I need your love tonight
Even if it's artificial love from you
I need you one more night
Nothing matters long as I'm next to you
They tell me you're using me
Well, maybe I just like to be used
You can hide the truth from me (You can hide the truth from me)
Nothing matters long as I'm next to you, girl

Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?
Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?

Feelings feeling like seasons
Too many changes, not too many reasons
Did you wanna fight? You don't want a reason
Locking up the doors, I'm close to leavin', yeah
Change my mind, double back
Fell in love in the back of my 'Lac
Where you think the suicidal thoughts came from?
You playin' with my head got me stuck in a trance
Evil bitch, now I know what you're made of
I need to swallow half of my pride
Can't deal with all of these lies
Only two seats in my ride
Well, one of them be for you
I know you wanna live that life
Just give me a green light
I could change it all in one night
If you really wanted me to, yeah
Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
What is love? Does love ever die?
Settle down, my darling, I'll be fine
