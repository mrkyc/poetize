MTM, hit 'em with the heat

One time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
Gotta get up and get right 'cause tonight's the night we die
One time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
Gotta get up and get right 'cause tonight's the night we die

Top shelf pussy got me disappointed in myself
Bitch, you got me singin', got me swimmin' like I'm Michael Phelps
Stuck inside in a hole and I don't know if I can help myself
Swervin' in my 718 while I'm duckin' 12
Stick in the middle of the whip, baby, don't slip, can't catch me slackin', no
Dick in the middle of a fat bitch, no lips, can't catch up to me, no
I'm ridin', slidin' through your hood, twenty K around my neck
I ran into a check, you really thought I wasn't about to flex?

One time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
Gotta get up and get right 'cause tonight's the night we die
One time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
Gotta get up and get right 'cause tonight's the night we die

I just did a kamikaze in a Maserati
'Cause I hate myself and I hate everybody
You love me then you hate me, wanna fuck me then you rape me Out my money like I never been nobody
Hit 'em up with that shotgun, makin' sure that that clock run
Outta time, outta my mind, better run for life and your safety
Back inside that Cadillac, I'm never goin' back to bein' broke
One time for all the hoes that thought I was a joke

Ayy, one time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
Gotta get up and get right 'cause tonight's the night we die
Ayy, one time for my bitches, two times for my guys

Bye-bye, baby, you ain't never comin' back
Drop the top and pop the Glock right out the window of the 'Lac
I'm feelin' myself tonight, I'm alive, so many emotions
I'ma dive into the ocean, then rise like I was Moses, split your wig in bits
Chicken and biscuits with your bitch, your boy gon' have a fit
FUCKTHEPOPULATION, you can label me degenerate
My generation dyin', I'ma have to save these kids
They doin' lean, they poppin' pills, they off the sedatives

One time for my bitches, two times for my guys
Three times for my .45, gotta keep it by my side
Six deep when we ride, seven in the morning
