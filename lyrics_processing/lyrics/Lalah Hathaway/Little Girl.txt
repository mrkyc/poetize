Bling, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Um, um, um, um
Flash back to a mid-west town
In a time of renaissance, an innocent child
Saturdays and soul train
Music feeds a budding mind
Pain and glory on your FM dial
Just a little girl in a big world (big world)
Hiding in the shadow of the light
Just a little girl in a big world (big world)
Oh listen to the voice of your divine
Moma, in that big o' Lincoln
Fryin' fish good to the bone
Two baby girls ouu ouu she did it alone
Did it alone, did it alone
Daddy in that big o'sky, ran fast
Maybe too fast sometimes
Always there right here yea
Pain and glory on my FM dial
Just a little girl in a big world
Hiding in the shadow of the light
Just a little girl in a big world
Oh listen to the voice of your divine
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, whatchu wanna know, yea
Oh yea
Just a little girl in a big world (in a big world)
Whatchu wanna know
Whatchu wanna know
Whatchu wanna know, hm, hm

You know the good, the bad
The positive, simply entitled life
The negative, the dull
The exciting, the whole thing
Attention, the conflict, little girl
Just a little girl in a big world
Hiding in the shadow of the light
Yea, yea, yea
