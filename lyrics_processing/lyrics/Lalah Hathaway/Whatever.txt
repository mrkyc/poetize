It was you
All I ever wanted was you
Thought that what we had was bulletproof
But everything that I thought I knew... wasn't true
Tell me why
Does it always end this way
I'm left to clean up your mistakes
Laying in the bed you made
It's OK
Cause when you play with fire, you gon' get burned
And when you lay with liars, then it's your turn
It's whatever

Once you've had enough
And you don't want him no more
And when he say he really love you
When he wanna come home
I don't love you, I don't want you, don't need you no more
Everything that you tried, I done seen it before
Whatever

Love is blind
That's why I couldn't read the signs
I was taking shots to this heart of mine
Left me here to do the time
For your crime
But I'm fine
I don't need you to explain
So you can walk away with the memory
'Cause I don't even feel the pain
It's OK
