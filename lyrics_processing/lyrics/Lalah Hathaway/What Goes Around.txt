I am over you its okay
But then again I never thought
I would make it to this day
After everything we've been through
I finally know the truth
What goes around, comes around
And will come back to you
And how you treat your brother man
Will pay you back in full
And for every seed you will sow
I just thought that you should know
Hm hm hey yeah
Life ain't always fair I know
But I'm over that it's okay
With all the goodness and all the grace
Could not lead me to this day
And I wish you love and life my friend
Because I know in the end that
What goes around, comes around
And will come back to you
And how you treat your sister friend
Will pay you back in full
And for every seed that you must
I just thought that you should know
