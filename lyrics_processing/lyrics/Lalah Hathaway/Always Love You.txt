I'm hurting you, you're hurting me
And I don't wanna fight no more, it's too much pressure
Walking on egg shell 'cause I'm afraid of messing
Up again, I'm at my wits end
Inside I'm torn, what's happening?
Why can't we agree to disagree, yeah
It will make life so much easier, baby
Loved you, I will always love you
Down to the end of time
You'll be in my heart, you'll stay on my mind
I will always love you, can't love no one but you, baby
Gotta get up off this road
Only thing it leads to is more tension between me and you
And it's time we both got a hold of our emotions
And be more open
What each of us is feelin'
Instead of making something out of nothing
Can't see why we can't agree to disagree
It will make life so much easier, easier my baby
Loved you, I will always love you
Down to the end of time
You'll be in my heart, you'll stay on my mind
I will always love you, can't love no one but you, baby
