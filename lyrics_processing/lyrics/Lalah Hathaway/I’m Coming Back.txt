Never dreamed that it would be like this
Never knew that I could ever miss
I've been thinking 'bout the way it was
How we used to share each other's love
I can feel you calling out to me
I can sense the love you really need
Don't know how we got to be this way
But I do know something's got to change

I wanna be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me
I'm gonna be by your side day and night
Through the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
I'm coming back for you

I'm coming back just to give you my love
(Just to give you my love)
There's a part of me that lives in you (In you, oh)
I'm coming back just to give you my love
Loving you's the best thing I can do

Was a time when loving used to be
All the subtleness of you and me
Now with every passing day I find
It was a fool's mistake to run and hide
I can feel you in the air I breathe
You're the center of each thought I think
Now there's only one thing left to do
And that's to find my way back to you

I wanna be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me
I'm gonna be by your side day and night
Through the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
I'm coming back for you

I'm coming back just to give you my love
(Just to give you my love)
There's a part of me that lives in you (In you, oh)
I'm coming back just to give you my love
(I'm coming back for you, baby)
Loving you's the best thing I can do
I'm coming back just to give you my love
(I'm coming back just to give you my love)
There's a part of me that lives in you (In you, oh)
I'm coming back just to give you my love
(I'm coming back for you, baby)
Loving you's the best thing I can do
(I'm coming back)
I'm coming back to give you all of my love
(I'm coming back, I'm coming back, I'm coming back)
I'm coming back
(I'm coming back)
Loving you is the best thing that I can ever do
