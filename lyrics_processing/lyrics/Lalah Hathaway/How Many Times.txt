Back in the days when we started
Forever were we
I never believed you'd break my heart
And leave me here like this
You promised your love ever after
Said you'd always be there
Then I gave you all that really mattered
And that wasn't the first time that I

How many times have you broken my heart
(You broken my heart)
And I let you back in?
Maybe it's time we both go our separate ways

Now all that's left to say is nothing
And we're not even friends no more
I was once afraid of starting over
But you leave me no other choice, no, no

How many times have you broken my heart
And I let you back in?
(I let you back in, yeah)
Maybe it's time we both go our separate ways
(Both go our separate ways, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How many times have you played with my mind
(How many times)
And I run back to you?
(I'll run back to you, yeah)
Maybe it's time we both go our separate ways
(Both go our separate ways, yeah, yeah, yeah)
