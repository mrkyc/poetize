Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm

Telling me what you gon' do
Pointless 'cause you don't come through
Wasted breath and words on you
I've done all I can do
It's true one time I let you under my skin
But you overstayed your welcome
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Play your tricks. you scandalize
You make your moves, you try to hide
But I began to realize all of your cynical ways
It's true I've made up my mind
Your wrong for me by your side
The love I know but you'll find
That I'm not in your picture

Let go, baby (Let go)
Gotta let it go (Let it go)
Don't you let it slow your roll
Hold on to the word (I gotta)
Let go, baby
Don't you cry no more (Can't cry no more)
For you remain in control
Baby, let go
Let go, woosah, shine (Shine)
Let go, woosah
