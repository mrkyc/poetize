Smile, I like your smile
Your eyes, they smile
I like your smile
(You know I like your smile)
Oh baby
Your eyes
I like your eyes
Your eyes, they smile
I like your eyes
(You know I like your eyes)

Nothing makes me happy like you do
Fresh air that flows right through
You soothe this tired old soul
It's a blessing that I sing
It's gold

It's in your smile
(It's in your smile)
When sitting here in front of me
You have a certain personality
(It's in your smile)
And if I wait a while
I know I'll fall in love with your smile
