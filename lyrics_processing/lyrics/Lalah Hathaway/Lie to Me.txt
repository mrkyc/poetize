Prefer if you don't say a word, words never get us anywhere
Remember the girl you used to desire, spark turned into a wildfire
It's burning our love down, now I'm aware
I can't be mad at you
'Cause nothing lasts forever
But I beg of you to play along
Hold me till I'm strong
Baby, lie to me tonight, oh
Give me till at least till tomorrow before you walk out of my life
Could you lie to me tonight, oh
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow then I'll give it back to you
Lie to me tonight, baby, lie
Baby, lie with me tonight, baby lie
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow
Then I'll give it back
Say you only have eyes for me, I'm the prettiest girl in the whole world
Let my hair down, for me please, worship my body like a temple
Act surprised like the first time, I'll consider it all little white lies
I just wanna feel your love, baby, for the record
I can't be mad at you
'Cause nothing lasts forever
But I beg of you to play along
This time I'll be strong

Baby, lie with me tonight, baby lie

I'm so scared to open my eyes, don't wanna see the truth on your face
Too much pressure, the love I'm giving you you won't reciprocate
Can you kiss away the pain tonight?
Fighting hard all the tears inside, just make my body cry
Could you lie to me tonight, oh
Give me at least until the morning, hold me till I'm strong
Could you lie to me tonight, oh
Give me at least till tomorrow before you walk out of my life
Lie to me tonight, let me borrow your heart
Until tomorrow, then I'll give it back to you
Lie to me tonight baby, lie, baby, lie with me tonight, baby lie
