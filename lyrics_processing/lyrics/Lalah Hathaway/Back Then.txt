Never knew that I could ever miss
I've been thinkin' bout the way it was
How we used to share each other's love
I can feel you callin' out to me
I can sense the love you really need
Don't know how we got to be this way
But I do know something's got to change
I wanna be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me
I'm gonna' be by your side, day and night
Through the rest of my life
So open up your heart for me
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back just to give you my love
There's a part of me that lives in you
I'm coming back just to give you my love
Loving you's the best thing I can do
Was a time when lovin' used to be
All the subtleness of you and me
Now with every passing day I find
It was a fool's mistake to run and hide

You're the center of each thought I think
Now there's only one thing left to do
And that's to find my way back to you
I wanna' be there for you through the thick and thin

So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me
