More, more, yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't know what you do to me
For your love I'd do anything
You have shown me what true love can be
By giving me more
It's funny how your feelings change
The more you know, the more things stay the same
And I love you in so many ways
I couldn't love you more, no

More and more
Oh, more and more, oh, oh yeah

All this love I have for you, yeah

Keep giving me more and more
I don't think that I could love you more if I tried

Darling I, I need you to know
I'll be by your side wherever you go
(Wherever you go)
And never question this love I have for you
I couldn't love you more
It's funny how your feelings change
The more you know, the more things stay the same
I love you so many ways (So many ways)
I couldn't love you more, oh no
