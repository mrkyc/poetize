If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing with you
'Cause I fell in love with my best friend
How'd I get so lucky?
That's the way it goes
Even though every now and then
Starts spinning fast and we gotta hold on
My heart is in it 'til the end
So if you start feeling like I'm taking you for granted
You know

Have no illusions about what you mean to me (Yeah, yeah)
You are my everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sunshine, my moonlight, promise of every spring
You are my everything (My everything)
So don't you let nobody try to pull us apart
'Cause you are ('Cause you are) my everything (My everything)
Beginning and ending, all that is in between
You are my everything

They say that you got it 'til it's gone
But this love keeps going on and on
Can't even remember my before
My heart belongs to you for forevermore
I'm just a reflection of your love
My heart skips a beat when you're smiling at me
So like I always tell you, you're the one (You're the one)
So if you start feeling I'm taking you for granted
You know
