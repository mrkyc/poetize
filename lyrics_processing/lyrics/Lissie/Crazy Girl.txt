What does anyone know about you and I?
When I'm feeling low and you're getting high
And the lights come on but I'm too damn tired
Everybody knows about you and I

'Cause I've been talking shit all over town
Them other girls you've been messing around with
Hearing things wherever I go
You're fooling around, and everyone knows

They say "you're crazy, girl"
"You gotta leave that boy behind"
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, girl)
Can't 'cause I love that man
Put a spell upon my mind
(Crazy, crazy, crazy girl)

What does anyone know about me and you?
When you're getting your red and I'm turning blue
And the music stops and I wanna hide
Everybody knows about you and I
You might also like
'Cause I've been talking shit all over town
Tell them other girls you've been fooling around

They say "you're crazy, girl"
"You gotta leave that boy behind"
(What are we doing, what am I doing?
What are we doing it for?)
Can't 'cause I love that man
He put a spell upon my mind
(What are we doing, what am I doing?
What are we doing it for?)

Shadows in your bed and I am a constant wreck
Both sick in the head
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
What am I doing it for?

They say "you're crazy, girl"
"You gotta leave that boy behind"
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy girl)
Can't 'cause I love that man
He put a spell upon my mind
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy girl)
They say "you're crazy, girl"
"You gotta leave that boy behind"
(What are we doing, what am I doing?
What are we doing it for?)
Can't 'cause I love that man
He put a spell upon my mind
(What are we doing, what am I doing?
What are we doing it for?)
They say I'm a crazy girl
He put a spell upon my mind
He put a spell upon my mind
