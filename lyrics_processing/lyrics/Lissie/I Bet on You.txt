The only thing you've ever done
Well look right here, I'm such a tiny crumb
Though the peers, I have become numb
You never ask me what I think
You never ask me what I want, well I am here
And I deserve a chance to speak before you walk
You gonna break this happy home
You say you need time on your own
Well who is she, and what she want?
Ooh I bet on you, with everything I have
I'll bet that fool's say that someday I'll find somebody else
No I don't want it that way, want you back all to myself
Oh you, you started new, untrue
And I I hope that she leaves you
I know you lied you weren't traveling
And with our lives, you've been gambling
Did you ever stop to think, the way the cost of what you want
Well can't you see that I am hurt
And you are not the man I thought
You gonna break this happy home
For some girl your heart leaned on
Well who is she, and what she want?
You might also likeOoh I bet on you, with everything I have
I'll bet that fool's say that someday I'll find somebody else
No I don't want it that way, want you back and all to myself
Oh you, you start a new, untrue
And I hope that she leaves you
Like you did me, like you did me
And I ask myself. How could you did this to me?
All the hope I had for our lives together
All the plans we'd made. Maybe I only have myself to blame
For betting everything on you
Ooh I bet on you, with everything I have
I'll bet that fool's say that someday I'll find somebody else
No I don't want it that way, want you back all to myself
Oh you, you started new, untrue
And I I hope that she leaves you
