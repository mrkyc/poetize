Mouth dry... I need a glass of water
All I have, I have borrowed
But I'll delay my sorrow
'Cause we are having such a bright time
I'm in, like, such a great state of mind
I'll regret it tomorrow
But tonight, pass the bottle
'Cause I Don't Wanna Go to Work
You don't pay me what I'm worth
Can't make me go home now and go to bed (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I Don't Wanna Go to Work
Where all my dreams just turn to dirt
'Cause pretty soon, there won't be none left (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It goes straight to my head
And now you feel the goodwill kick in
And all your old friends are wonderful slim pickin's
I suspend this illusion
Even though I know it's just 'cause I've been boozing
I Don't Wanna Go to Work
You don't pay me what I'm worth
Can't make me go home now and go to bed, ah! (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I Don't Wanna Go to Work
Where all my dreams just turned to dirt
'Cause pretty soon, there won't be none left (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It goes straight to my head

(Hey!)
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I Don't Wanna Go to Work
You don't pay me what I'm worth
Can't make me go home now and go to bed, ah! (oh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I just wanna go berserk
And I don't care what anybody says (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't want to hear about
(Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah)
Don't even want to think about
(Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah!)
All the things I could have been instead (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I Don't Wanna Go to Work (ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah)
I Don't Wanna Go to Work (ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah)
I Don't Wanna Go to Work
