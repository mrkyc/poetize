I-I'll refuse... to let you... get to me
Now secondly
I-I'm amused... at your desperation, frankly
Oh, man in eager times
It's your ego and mine, and you slither slide
You can't eat what you can't catch
You just steal yourself a Cold Fish
You might have think that you've won
But we've only just begun
And I'll always be a step ahead
Yeah
And furthermore... What now? We're keeping score?
And lastly... it must get taxing, trying to surpass me
Your wings get waxy
Hot damn, I do what I can
I focus on the things, in life, I like
And I let it slide
You can't eat what you can't catch
You just stare, you're such a Cold Fish
You might have think that you've won
But we've only just begun
And I'll always be a step ahead
Yeah!
You can't rely on what you don't have
You're all style and no substance
Well, you got it backwards
And you don't care who you hurt
You're a poser and a problem
You might also likeWe are born and raised in a heartbeat
If it's lonely and down, would you stick with me?
And I hitch my ride into the rising sun
I thank God that I've been allowed
To get up and do something with my life
And I'm not backing down
No-oh!
You can't eat what you can't catch
You just stare, you're such a Cold Fish
You might have think that you've won
But we've only just begun
And I'll always be a step ahead
Hyah!
You can't rely on what you don't have
You're all style and no substance
Well, you got it backwards
And you don't care who you hurt
You're a poser and a problem
I said it, I said it
So sorry to hear it
Oh, I am
Oh-wha-a-a, oh-wha-a-ah
Oh-wha-a-a, oh-wha-a-ah
Oh-wha-a-a, oh-wha-a-ah-ah!
Hey-ah
Oh-whoa-o-o-, oh whoa-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-o-o-, oh whoa-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-o-o-, oh whoa-oh-oh (Whoo!)
You might think that you have won
But we've only just begun
