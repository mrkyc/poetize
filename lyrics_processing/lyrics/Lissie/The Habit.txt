If you're rubbing sticks together you'll be getting a spark
Inevitably I'll be in your arms after dark
Each and every time I see you
It's just as hard to leave you as the last time
So we come to a decision, draw a line in the sand
And stand on different sides yet I reach out for your hand
Oh baby I miss you
If only I could kiss you just this last time

But I can't finish
What we've started
The heart breaks
Way before the habit
And if you don't quit
You'll never get over
If you don't quit
You'll never get out
And you're always
Gonna be an addict
The heart breaks
Way before the habit
You might also like
Once it hits your lips you know you're gonna have more
Coursing through the blood and coming out of your pores
There's no use in fighting
Almost as inviting as the first time

But I can't finish
What we've started
The heart breaks
Way before the habit
And if you don't quit
You'll never get over
If you don't quit
You'll never get out
And you're always
Gonna be an addict
The heart breaks
Way before the habit

And I don't think that we should see each other anymore
You keep on going 'round in circles
Back to where we've been before
And now you're standing at my door
I'm not so sure

That if you don't quit
You'll never get over
If you don't quit
You'll never get out
If you don't quit
You'll never get over
If you don't quit
You'll never get out

'Til you finish
What we've started
The heart breaks
Way before the habit
And if you don't quit
You'll never get over
If you don't quit
You'll never get out
And you're always
Gonna be an addict
The heart breaks
