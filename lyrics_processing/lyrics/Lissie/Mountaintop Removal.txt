Ah, ah-ah, uh, ah-ah, uh, ah-ah
My darling, my dear, I'll tell you what is wrong
I went to the mountain, but the mountaintop was gone
Remember those trees where as kids we dreamed?
They tore 'em down years ago, and built a factory
And when that plant closed, the workers all left town
I read in the paper that some kids were killed when it burnt down
Now I stare at that field like a circle in the earth
And nothing will grow now, that's not soil, it's just dirt
And I can't stand it, what's the use in making something new
If all that made us must be ruined?
I can't demand it, I got nothing but mounting debt and fear
I scratch my head wondering how we got here
America, Americans
What are we doing?
America, I am American
Please, can we start again?
America (ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh), American (ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh)
Mountaintop Removal shames our name

Money, soon it will be gone
