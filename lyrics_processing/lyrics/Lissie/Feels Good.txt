You just do what feels good
You just do what feels good
You just do what feels good 'til it doesn't

And then you call me crying
Pulling me back in
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me

'Cause every time I look in your eyes
(Every time I look in your eyes)
Something inside of me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Oh, you don't do what you should
(Don't do what you should)
You just do what feels good
(Just do what feels good)
And anytime it gets too hard
(Anytime it gets too hard)
You hit the boulevard
(You hit the boulevard)
Bet you say you're misunderstood
(Bet you say you're misunderstood)
But you just do what feels good
(Just do what feels good)
You might also like
You're talking to the ghosts that live inside your head
Can't you tune them out and talk to me instead?

'Cause every time I look in your eyes
(Every time I look in your eyes)
Something inside of me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Oh, you don't do what you should
(Don't do what you should)
You just do what feels good
(Just do what feels good)
And you say you don't know how
(You say you don't know how)
To promise more than just straight out
You just say you're misunderstood
(You're misunderstood)
But you just do what feels good
(Just do what feels good)

Feels good, it feels good
It feels good, it feels good
It feels good
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me
'Cause every time I look in your eyes
Something inside of me dies
You don't do what you should
You just do what feels good
And anytime it gets too hard
(Anytime it gets too hard)
You hit the boulevard
(You hit the boulevard)
You're so misunderstood
(Bet you say you're misunderstood)
You just do what feels good
(Just do what feels good)

You just do what feels good
What feels good 'cause it feels good
