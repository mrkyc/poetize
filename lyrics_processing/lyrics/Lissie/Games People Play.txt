La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
La-da-da, da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da

Oh, the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
And they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine, woah

La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Oh, we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame, oh
Neither one will give in
So we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinking 'bout the things that might have been
It's a dirty rotten shame, oh
You might also like
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play (Hey)


People walking up to you
Singing Glory Hallelujah
And they're trying to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope, cheat your faith
And further more to hell with hate
Come on and get on board

La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Look around tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To remember who I am
'Cause You've given up Your sanity
For Your pride and your vanity
Turns You sad on humanity
And you don't give a da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da (La-da-da)
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-de
Oh, I'm talking 'bout you and me
