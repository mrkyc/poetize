When a greenhorn driver came in off of the road
I heard him tell that foreman get my little pink slip
This run's too tough and I'm gonna quit
Now the foreman that day happened to be old Joe man he was older than time
He said son how long you been drivin' this rig
You know I drove all shapes forms fashions and kinds
Here you are worried about this one little trip
Why I drove a million miles and then some
He looked that greenhorn right in the eye and he said
"Boy there ain't no easy run"
I drove for Roadway, Interstate, Hopewell, Great Lakes
Overnight and Time, Mayflower and Freight Line
Specter, Yellow Transit, Western, and Gillete

Dixie, Ohio, and Trans American Some
East Texas, Mason Dixon, Watkin and Transcon
Wilson Associate got all that drivin' done
And I'll tell you boy there ain't no easy runs
Now if you got a gal in Texas they'll send you up to Maine
If you got a gal in New York they'll send you out to the plains
I know what your problem is you got woman trouble son
Well like I said there ain't no easy run
