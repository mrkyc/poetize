So put me on speakerphone
I know you're not alone
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
Got my heart on my sleeve again
I played your silly games
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk

Baby, it's me again
I'm calling my only friend
You do remember me, don't you?
You're falling in love again
And I could try to pretend that I don't think about you

I go out every night
I'm finding it hard to let you go
You left me behind, we said our goodbyes
Now I need you to pick up, pick up, baby
(Pick up, pick up)

So put me on speakerphone
I know you're not alone
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
Got my heart on my sleeve again
I played your silly games
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
You might also like
And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control, oh-oh
And I know better than to call back again
So pick up, pick up, baby
I only call when I'm drunk

The sun brings another day
I'm slurring my words away
So many things that I never said
It's breaking my heart when I pick up the phone again, but I gotta explain that

I go out every night
I'm finding it hard to let you go (hard to let you go)
You left me behind, we said our goodbyes
Now I need you to pick up, pick up, baby
(Pick up, pick up)

So put me on speakerphone
I know you're not alone
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
Got my heart on my sleeve again
I played your silly games
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control, oh-oh
And I know better than to call back again
So pick up, pick up, baby
I only call when I'm drunk

Pick up, pick up
(Pick up, pick up)
Pick up, pick up, baby
(Pick up, pick up, baby)
Pick up, pick up
(Pick up, pick up)
Pick up, pick up, baby
(Pick up, pick up, baby)

So put me on speakerphone
I know you're not alone
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
Got my heart on my sleeve again
I played your silly games
Enough is enough
I only call when I'm drunk
And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control, oh-oh (I lose all self-control, ay!)
And I know better than to call back again
So pick up, pick up, baby
