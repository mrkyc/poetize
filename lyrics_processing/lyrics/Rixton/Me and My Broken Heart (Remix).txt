Me and my broken, me and my broken, me and my broken heart

You said you never felt like this before
You told me that you love me more and more
You know I need you more than anything else
I try my best, girl, hold on to what we have left
I knew you way before the fame, I knew you (knew you, knew you)
Know you not the girl I met, OK, I'm seeing through you
You can't be wasting all my quality time
Like i'ma let you lie to me, ain't gon' pay it no mind
I'm just being honest
What it do?

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart

Maybe
Some part of you just hates me
You pick me up and play me
How do we call this love? (whoa, oh oh oh)
You might also like
One time
Tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love (whoa, oh oh oh)

It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody, tell me I'm not alone
When I say

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Me and my broken heart
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Me and my broken
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and my broken, broken heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah
How do we call this?
It's just me
It's just me
It's just me
Me and my broken heart

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
