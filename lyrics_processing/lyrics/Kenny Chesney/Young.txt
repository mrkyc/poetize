Looking back now, well, it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cuttin' class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch 'em burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear

And man, I don't know
Where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that

We were wannabe rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young

Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Yeah, wishing we were older
Young
Hey, I wish it wasn't over

And man, I don't know
Where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
