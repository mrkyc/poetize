I ran into a buddy used to be all hypertensive
His stocks were always tankin' and his girlfriends were expensive
But he looked like a poster for a permanent vacation
I asked him what he did to change his orientation
He bought a shot and dropped this little information

I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your b-b-b-b-bucket list

You know he got me thinking 'bout the way that I've been livin'
Seems like I'm always going but I don't know where I'm gettin'
I was overexistentializing my redneck
But the answer is as simple as simple can get
I just rearrange some letters In the alphabet

I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your bucket list

I took the U out of Hugh and I added an I, I
I bet you can guess what I did next
I took my cheating, lying lover and I added an S
