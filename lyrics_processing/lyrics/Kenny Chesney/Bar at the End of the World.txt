There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called "Make Me Disappear"

There ain't no empty glasses
They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill

To the bar at the end of the world
(We'll set sail)
At the end of the world
