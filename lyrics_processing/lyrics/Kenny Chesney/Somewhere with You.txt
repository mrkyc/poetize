If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me
I'm getting drunk, but I'd much rather be

Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, "Pick me up at three a.m."
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up that ex to rescue me
Climb in their bed when I'd much rather sleep

Somewhere with you, like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear
"I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go"

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always

Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, "Pick me up at three a.m."
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
