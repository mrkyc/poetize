I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd've gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd've went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to
But I didn't

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

I wish I'd've spent more time with my dad when he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
And I wish I'd've told my brother how much I loved him before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
I wish I'd've gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said, "Boy, you're gonna wish you hadn't"
But I wouldn't

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would

There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
And I should have bought it, but I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't've hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched
But I didn't do it, not nearly enough
And if I'd've known that dance was gonna be our last dance I'd've asked that band to play
On and on, on and on

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would
Oh, oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things
