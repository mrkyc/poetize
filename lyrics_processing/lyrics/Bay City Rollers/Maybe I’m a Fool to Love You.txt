Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
If love is just a game, for fools to play
Then in the end, love will be mine
My heart will shine
I am just a clown, who wears a painted face to hide a frown
Baby please don't bring me down
I know that
Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care
Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Cause I thought you might like to know
Maybe I'm a fool to love you, but I do
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
If dreams are what they say
Just nothing more than wishing
Then one day you will be mine
My heart will shine
I'm just a clown, when the circus leaves I'll still be round
Knocking on your door
Can I love you any more

Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Cause I thought you might like to know
Maybe I'm a fool to love you, but I do
Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care
Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Cause I thought you might like to know
Maybe I'm a fool to love you, but I do
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
