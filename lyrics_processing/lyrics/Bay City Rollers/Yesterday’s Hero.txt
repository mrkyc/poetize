When we walk down the street
See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago?
When we walk down the street
See the stranger who says, "Why, Hi,"
With a, "How you going, Buddy
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hello."
They say
Haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television ev'ry night
Haven't I seen you round?
We don't wanna be
A yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero
That's all we'll be
You might also likeWe don't wanna be
A yesterday's hero
A yesterday's hero
Is all that we're be gonna be
If we don't get together
Make a new plan and be constantly better
All that we'll be if we don't get together now
When we walk down the street
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing don't ask me why
I don't read the news
When we walk down the street
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story, I'm just as glad
You ain't in my shoes
Because
Haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television ev'ry night
Haven't you seen me round?
We don't wanna be
A yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero
That's all we'll be
We don't wanna be
A yesterday's hero
A yesterday's hero
Is all that
We're be gonna be
If we don't get together
Make a new plan and be constantly better
All that we'll be if we don't get together now
(Spoken:
Ladies and gentlemen the Bay City Rollers. Everybody move back, move back please, here you go, back, back)
We don't wanna be
Yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero
No, no
We don't wanna be
Yesterday's hero, no
Yesterday's hero
No, no
We don't wanna be
Yesterday's hero
