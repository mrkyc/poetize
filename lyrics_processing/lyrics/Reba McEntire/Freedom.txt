I'm no stranger to the thick smoke of a bar
And heart chained to a bottle of whiskey
And I've held strangers in my arms
To pull apart the bars because I couldn't find the key

I've searched high and low
Been to Hell and back
Been a prisoner to my soul
And all I know is that
The price of being free
It don't come cheap

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothin' you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom

You're the red, the white, the blue
The stars that cover the scars
When we broke the shackles
And I've never been to war before
But your boots there on the floor
Are proof that I've won the battle
You might also like
And all you had to give to me
Was the gift of being free

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothing you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom

I've searched high and low
Been to Hell and back
Been a prisoner to my soul
And all I know is that
The price of being free
It don't come cheap

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothing you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom
Oh, freedom, loving you feels like freedom
