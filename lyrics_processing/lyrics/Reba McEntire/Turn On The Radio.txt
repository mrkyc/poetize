No good, two-timin', lies comin' out of your mouth
Cheatin', mistreatin' games that you play brought you down
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now
Don't you come crawlin' back, beggin' please on your knees
Baby, if you're missin' me

Well, you can hear me on the radio (Radio)
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo (Stereo)
You can sing along
While they're playin' our song, how you done me wrong
Baby, crank it up (Crank it up)
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck (Chevy truck)
So listen, Romeo
When you're feelin' kinda low, let me tell you where to go
Turn on the radio

Try to call, Twitter me, text until your fingers bleed
Oh, the DJ's the only way you're ever gonna hear from me
If you're reminiscin' and you're missin' me this much
And you really wanna stay in touch

Well, you can hear me on the radio (Radio)
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo (Stereo)
You can sing along
While they're playin' my song, how you done me wrong
Baby, crank it up (Crank it up)
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck (Chevy truck)
So listen, Romeo
When you're feelin' kinda low, let me tell you where to go
Turn on your radio (Turn on your radio)

Woah, turn on the radio (Turn on the radio, oh)
Turn on the radio, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, you can hear me on the radio
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along
While they're playin' my song, how you done me wrong
Baby, crank it up (Crank it up)
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck (Chevy truck)
So listen, Romeo
When you're feelin' kinda low, let me tell you where to go
When you're feelin' kinda low, let me tell you where to go
Turn on the radio

Turn on your radio
Turn on, turn on the radio (Turn on the radio, turn on the radio)
Turn on the radio, oh
Turn on you radio, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
