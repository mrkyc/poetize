She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready, now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
Now she's just wondering what she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how to live for today
Oh, she's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy or just get away
Oh, something for herself for a change

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
Oh, she looks out her window and she wonders again

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, is there life out there?
Oh, oh

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, she doesn't want to leave
