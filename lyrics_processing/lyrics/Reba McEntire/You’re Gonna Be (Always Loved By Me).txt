Like I have all the answers
I hope I have the ones you need

You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay

Life has no guarantees

You're going to see
Just what you are to me

You're going to fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
