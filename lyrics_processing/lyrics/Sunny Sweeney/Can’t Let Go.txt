Don't make me sit all alone and cry
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
I'm like a fish out of water I'm a cat in a tree
You don't even want to talk to me
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he put me down
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
See I got a candle and it burns so bright
In my window every night
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
You don't like to see me standing around
Feel like I been shot and didn't fall down
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he put me down
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go

In my window every night
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
I turn off trouble like you turn off a light
You went off and left me it just ain't right
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he put me down
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he put me down
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
It's over, I know it, but I can't let go
