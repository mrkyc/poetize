Drove down the waterline with you at Flathead Lake
Car was like a mirror ball in the snowflakes
By Livingston, we'd made it to the top of the world
Neil Young came on the radio, that's where it all took a turn
We smoked cigarettes and watched the people down below
Said I reminded you of someone you'd never known
We could hear the band playing in the bar downstairs
We were dancing by ourselves, I guess it had to start somewhere

I need falling in love with you like I need a hole in my head
I'd let you kiss me right now, but I'm already hanging by a thread
Trying to push you away is much harder than it seems
'Cause you're all that I want, all that I don't need

You were wanting to stay out late and watch the sun come up
We could stay all night, I guess, and really push our luck
The fool in me is singing, you really make me wanna stay
Somehow you're fooling me, boy, and really stealing my heart away

I need falling in love with you like I need a hole in my head
I'd let you kiss me right now, but I'm already hanging by a thread
Trying to push you away is much harder than it seems
'Cause you're all that I want, all that I don't need
You might also like
I'm out of breath, I'm letting go
I'm letting go 'cause some things you just know

I need falling in love with you like I need a hole in my head
I'd let you kiss me right now, but I'm already hanging by a thread
Trying to push you away is much harder than it seems
'Cause you're all that I want, all that I don't need
