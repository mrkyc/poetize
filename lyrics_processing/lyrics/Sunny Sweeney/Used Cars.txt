With bells and whistles and seats made of leather
But I find joy in an old joyride
That needs a jump start every once in a while
Like a diamond in the rough
There's a gem waiting in the junkyard
Used cars
Owner driven previously
Has always turned out to be a blessing to me
You take the latest model for a spin off the lot
Hit the main drag and the value drops
I saw the potential of a real love sitting in park
Used cars
Just when I was thinking
All the good ones were gone
I found one woman's wreck
And made him someone I could count on
No you didn't look broken down
But I could tell you had a broken heart
I guess I always had a certain kinda thing
For used cars
One headlight and a windshield crack
Minor repairs can fix all of that
It's just my opinion but I think it's true
They quit making good men like you
Some are older but they look younger than they are

For used cars
Miles don't matter as much as you think
And I know you don't come with a warranty
I just wanna spend every second with you
On the boulevard where the streets are smooth
Running real slow
Cause you know we don't have to go far
I don't love you for the way you were
I love you for the way you are
