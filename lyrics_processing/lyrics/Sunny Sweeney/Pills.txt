Are you still takin' them pills?
Are they still givin' you thrills?
Does your coat still sound like a maraca
When you're walkin' up and down around the Tennessee hills?
The prescription that you're takin' to the pharmacist is written
On a stack of twenty dollar bills
Uh-huh, are you still takin' them pills?

I remember back when we used to take 'em
And we'd feel them start to kickin' in
At first, we'd feel a tingle, then we'd feel a prickle
Like there's something crawlin' on my skin
I think they almost made us feel a little happy
I think they nearly made us feel like we belong
They said it's bringin' on somethin' for an entire day
Then we'd talk about it all night long

Are you still takin' them pills?
Are they still givin' you thrills?
Do you still feel like you're getting prodded
By a hundred thousand nasty little procupine quills?
Your mind is like a cyclone needin' satisfaction
But it empties out as quick as it fills
Uh-huh, are you still takin' them pills?

(One, two, three)
You know, it's strange the way time can change a person
Just yesterday, it seems like we were gettin' high
Now I've been clean for years, but to be completely honest
I think about it all the time
But wait, I think you don't remember how you know me
I gotta say that you don't seem the same
You oughta hang it up 'cause by the look that's on your face
I think you wonder how I even know your name

Are you still takin' them them pills?
Are they still givin' you thrills?
Outside, there's a bin man starin' at you
Can't you see I'm leanin' on your window still?
I'm afraid we might read it in the paper
That you're pushin' up the daisies and the daffodils
Uh-huh, are you still takin' them pills?
