You call him in the middle of the night
Saying you can't make ends meet
Maybe you should've thought about that
Before you made him take the backseat
What makes you think he should fix your sink?
He's a sink paying for your sins
He knows I love him more than you ever loved him

I know what you call me, that word fits me to a T
You just think I'm pretty and you're just full of jealousy
I don't make him play the fool
Put him on a pedestal is something you would never do
Yeah, he's got a trophy now, for putting up with you

You say I'm a wrecking ball
Girl, he says I'm the glue
You always kick him when he's down
Well it's hard to take a shine to you
You wanna have your cake
And eat it in my living room
I already clean your mess
You can't stand that he loves me
And I couldn't care less
You might also like
I know what you call me, that word fits me to a T
You just think I'm pretty and you're just full of jealousy
I don't make him play the fool
Put him on a pedestal is something you would never do
Yeah, he's got a trophy now, for putting up with you

Just thinking out loud but in the long run
Don't a trophy mean you think he won?

I know what you call me, that word fits me to a T
You just think I'm pretty and you're just full of jealousy
I don't make him play the fool
Put him on a pedestal is something you would never do
Yeah, he's got a trophy now, for putting up with you
Putting up with you, for putting up with you
Putting up with you
