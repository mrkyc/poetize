Then I would make my living with a line and pole
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord
Buy some working clothes cause I ain't
Making money going fishing Like I'm paid at the factory
If I could pay all these bills with my guitar
Then I would pay these bills with some rock and roll
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord
Buy some working clothes cause I ain't
Making money going fishing Like I'm paid at the factory
Well if I could (if I could)
Then I would (then I would)
Make money doing something that I love
I'd thank my lucky stars above
If I could just get by loving you dear
Then I would just get by making love to you
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord
Buy some working clothes cause I ain't
Making money going fishing
Like I'm paid at the factory
(PLAY THAT GUITAR)
Well if I could (if I could)
Then I would (then I would)
Make money doing something that I love
I'd thank my lucky stars above
If I could just get by loving you dear
Then I would just get by making love to you
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord
Buy some working clothes cause I ain't
Making money going fishing
Like I'm paid at the factory
