Her daddy played the fiddle and used to do the calling when they had hoedowns
She said the neighbors would come and they'd move all my grandma's furniture 'round
And there'd be twenty or more there on the old wooden floor,dancin' to a country sound
The Carters and Jimmy Rodgers played her favorite songs
And on Saturday nights there was a radio show and she'd sing along
I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me
That she'd dreamed about singing at The Grand Ol' Opry
Her eyes, oh, how they sparkled when she sang those songs
She was hanging the clothes on the line, I was a kid just a hummin' along
Well, I'd be playing in the grass, to her, what might've seemed, obliviously
There ain't no doubt about it: she sure made her mark on me
She played old gospel records on the phonograph
She turned them up loud and we'd sing along, how those days have passed
Just now that I am older it occurs to me
That I was singing in the grandest opry
And we sang Sweet Rose of Sharon, Abide With Me
'Til I ride The Gospel Ship to Heaven's Jubilee
And In That Great Triumphant Morning my soul will be free
And My Burdens Will Be Lifted when my Saviour's face I see
So I Don't Want to Get Adjusted to This World below
But I know He'll Pilot Me 'til it comes time to go
Oh, nothing on this earth is half as dear to me
As the sound of my Mama's Opry

'Til I ride The Gospel Ship to Heaven's Jubilee
And In That Great Triumphant Morning my soul will be free
And My Burdens Will Be Lifted when my Saviour's face I see
