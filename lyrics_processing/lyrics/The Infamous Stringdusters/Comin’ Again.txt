I've been thinking 'bout the past and the things that you said
Try to keep it right, not let it get to my head
We're a mess, but we smile anyways
Our thoughts are scattered around, but I'll lead the way
Look as the fools keep me thinking I'm out of my mind
But they catch me, my friend, when they get here on time
I feel the love for a woman who treats me unkind
It wasn't my idea to make her heart blind

We're living life like we'll never get another try
Don't need a reason to throw our hands to the sky
All my friends say the means justify the ends, yeah
Keep it comin', comin', comin' again
(Keep it comin', comin', comin' again)
Yeah, comin' again
(Keep it comin', comin', comin' again)

The wine is sweet when I'm drinking and so is your touch
You keep me coming back, maybe a little too much
I got a song running 'round, around in my brain
It's the rhythm of life coursing through my veins
The colors soar up above and around in the sky
The fire dances to the ancient cries
We leave it all for a moment, a moment in time
Let the moment shine, the moment shine
