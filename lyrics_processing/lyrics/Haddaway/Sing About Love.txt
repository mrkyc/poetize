Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybdoy's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in us and it starts above
Put on your shoes, gotta get in the race
Cause the way that we're going is a really sad pace
Pick up the mick, hold it in your hand
It's cold, it's bold, might think you're a man
Listen to the words we don't even understand
I'm not a preacher, nor a selling man
It's a product at end now to you understand
Big approach you wanna kill you man?
Leave the truth, don't try to kill each other
White or black, he's got to be your brother
Day and night, you've got to have a look
Before he goes you just have to take it
I've been told that things just last forever
Form the top of the sky to the bottom of the water
Isn't true you lost your brother?
Don't try to hide this feeling you have inside
Cause we all see your mood

God was talking to us through words
But he never told man how it would go
First came light, then tv
Another day later, lots of babies
Look at the colour, what do you see?
White, black, green; it don't matter to me
Ring, ring down talking to the phone
Somebody's taking your life; nobody's home
