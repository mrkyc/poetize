The one you call, yeah)

I'll admit I wasn't ready
I was chasing all the hoes
I was dead wrong
I'll make it up to you if you let me
Something 'bout you, I can't let go
Body, mind, and soul

But you slipped out of my hands
When I was your man
Girl, can we just give this love
A second chance?
I heard you found a new romance
I understand
That you're somebody else's girl
But I still want you
I still want you

I want to be the one you call
When he don't hit that shit right
And you need shivers down your spine
I want to be the one you call
When you get tired of being lonely
Yeah, you know you can count on me
I want to be
You might also like
Why don't you stop
Acting hard to get?
If you know you ain't happy
Let me handle it
Girl, I'll come to your rescue bus (rescue)
I know how you like to get it
I'll be over there in a minute

But you slipped out of my hands
When I was your man
Girl, can we just give this love
A second chance?
I heard you found a new romance
I understand
That you're somebody else's girl
But I still want you
I still want you

I want to be the one you call
When he don't hit that shit right
And you need shivers down your spine
I want to be the one you call
When you get tired of being lonely
Yeah, you know you can count on me
You can hit my line, girl
Anytime, yeah
Won't let it rest
Until you're mine (uh)
Would these, these memories
Of you and I
Get out out my head
And back in my bed

I still want you
I still want you
I still want you, baby

You slipped out of my hands
When I was your man
Girl, can we just give this love
A second chance?
I heard you found a new romance
I understand
That you're somebody else's girl
But I still want you
I still want you
I want to be the one you call
When he don't hit that shit right
And you need shivers down your spine
I want to be the one you call
When you get tired of being lonely
Yeah, you know you can count on me
