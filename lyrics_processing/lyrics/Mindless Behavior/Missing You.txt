Prodigy: Yo Roc?
Roc Royal: Hey, what up Prod?
Prodigy: She won't even talk to me
(Missing You)
Roc Royal: Just give her some time
Prodigy: But I didn't even do anything wrong

I can't get through
No matter how many times I hit you
You just pick up the phone
See my name and let it go
See me in your log about a hundred times
How long you gon' let this go on?

I'm just gon' keep on calling you
Texting you
Blowing you up on your aim
Ya know I don't give up easily
Go ahead and keep deleting me
From your 3G
I'mma be all up in your brain
So you wanna play games?
Thats alright...

Girl I got something to say ( yes , sir )
Don't hang up in my face ( that's right )
Cause you too stubborn to let it go
If thats how you wanna play
Keep pushing me away
But make no mistake
Girl I'mma keep on missing you
I'm tryna get to you
But if I can't get through
Ain't nothing I can do but
Keep on missing you
Do what you gotta do
But if I can't get through
Ain't nothing I can do but
Keep on missing you

Yell at me
Tell me off
Call me all out my name
Just pick up the phone
I'm not gonna leave you alone
Don't be mean
How many times I gotta say sorry?
Stay mad if you want
This just means your love is strong
I'm just gon' keep on calling you
Texting you
Blowing you up on your aim
Ya know I don't give up easily
Go ahead and keep deleting me
From your 3G
I'mma be all up in your brain

That girl didn't mean a thing
The only girl I want is you
