Told her when I met her
You the type I like to take out
Tell me what we doing
Before I hit you with the fakeout
Now she know I'm gettin' money
16, my own banker
Paint the whole city purple like I'm playing for the Lakers

I pull up on the spot
I see your beauty, cutie
And she swinging like she got a job at Hooters
I see what that about
The jingling
Got me faded kinda like the way
You toot out
I know she wanna ball
She see this (?)
Hater's whispirin'
How the heck is he pushin' that?
Homies cuffin' her
Asking her what she lookin' at
Who complains about the traffic when it's (?)

I see she playing the part
But I can tell she ain't had love
So what you puttin' on for, you know
He ain't that one
You got all that hotness baby
I know what you thinkin'
It just ain't enough
Can I
Tell you what I
Been thinkin' 'bout
From day one
You might also like
Bang(x7)
That's what I be thinking
Every time that I see her
Bang(x7)
She got my heart beatin' like the
Tweeters on my speakers
Bang(x7)
She wit' him but I'mma take her
She don't even need to be there
Bang(x7)
I'd be lying if I say
That my intentions ain't to freak her
White two seater
While she pulled up on my bumper
Then she introduced herself
Said her first name Rita
You know my first thought,skeeter(?)
Then she leaned over in the car
Hit a smile
Then my thoughts got deeper
She done forgot about her people
Homie over there in the cut, on the set
Acting like he ain't never leave her
I'm like (?)
Can't resist the feeling that you give me
When I look into those eyes
They be killin' me
I see she playing the part
But I can tell she ain't had love
So what you puttin' on for, you know
He ain't that one
You got all that hotness baby
I know what you thinkin'
It just ain't enough
Can I
Tell you what I
Been thinkin' 'bout
From day one
