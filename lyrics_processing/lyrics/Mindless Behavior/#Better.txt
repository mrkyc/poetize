Grinder on her nightstand
Stinker in her right hand
Lighter on her pillow
She like cigarillos
She can read the meter
On the scale, she can tell when a
Nigga tryna' short her
And keep a pill bottle in the
Pocket of the Louis bag that I bought her
We be watching netflix
She be making breakfast
Now we both got bloodshot
She said give me gunshot
And give me really good head
But won't let me record her
Shawty get high, so do I
Easily go through a quarter

Damn, I swear this girl be
On another level (ah-ah)
She be going hard, ain't
Nothing I can tell her (ah-ah)
And I know she ain't tripping
I ain't complaining, no
Whatever she do
I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)
You might also like
She freaks me (better)
She treats me (better)
Whatever she do, I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)

I love, I love I love you
When she rolls up
First she let her hair up, then
She turn the air up
Open up her window
Let some fresh air in so
She be on the loud, on the cloud
Gotta air it out, don't do no mid-grade
We can hit the quick trip real quick
Never no roaches in her ashtray

Damn, I swear this girl be
On another level (ah-ah)
She be going hard, ain't
Nothing I can tell her (ah-ah)
And I know she ain't tripping
I ain't complaining, no
Whatever she do
I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)
She freaks me (better)
She treats me (better)
Whatever she do, I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)

Talent driven
When I asked her for the number
She gon' tell me she committed
But I notice that's some
Bullshit, baby girl why you steady tripping?
Tripping over love and shit
When I get you alone I
Might hug a bit, or touch
A bit, no fuck the gift
Let a young nigga know
Right now
Head when I'm on the road
Pipe down
Funny how we both know
I put that pipe down, but
When we in the bed you make
No sound
You mke me a better me, a better me
Maybe we discuss over Hennessy
A-a-ashes and Hennessy
All over everything
Blunt going back and forth
Hit, pass
Weed smokey flavoring
All she can really taste
On the floor with her knees
On the pillow case
I give her what she desires
Cause she give me smoke and she
Give me fire

Damn, I swear this girl be
On another level (ah-ah)
She be going hard, ain't
Nothing I can tell her (ah-ah)
And I know she ain't tripping
I ain't complaining, no
Whatever she do
I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)

She freaks me (better)
She treats me (better)
Whatever she do, I'm gon' let her
(she roll up, make everything better)
