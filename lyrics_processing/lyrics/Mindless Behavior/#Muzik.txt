This that super bad bitch strip
2 count grip
2 thug niggas blood crip
2 set trick
2 Chevys with the 4 door
2 top back
2 pyrex pots music
This that Styrofoam cup filled up
To pinky nail
Got blood too
Ew something you can stunt to
Worried he front you If he wanted to
Gold fronts to music

Some put you in your feelings
Staring at the ceiling
When you hear some real good music
Smoking when you lay back
Make you call your bae back
Make you wanna play that music

When I'm high and I'm bored
My auxiliary cord
Got me in my feelings
Staring at the ceiling
When I hear some real good music
You might also like
This that hella Californ-I-A
All my Philly boys bop to big beard too
Down south niggas say its straight
Mixtape too
NWA crew music
Bottled water Zany's
Bad bitches with no panties
Calling Zab in Miami
After party at the Grammys
Too late in the Jammies
Stolen Acura's and Camry's
The power of that good music

Some put you in your feelings
Staring at the ceiling
When you hear some real good music
Smoking when you lay back
Make you call your bae back
Make you wanna play that music

When I'm high and I'm bored
My auxiliary cord
Got me in my feelings
Staring at the ceiling
When I hear some real good music
So slow up the tempo
Don't interrupt me I'm floating face up on the ocean
Vacay from my mental
Melody simple
Cause that's what I'm into
All I need, I got
All I need
All I need
When I hear some real good music

Some put you in your feelings
Staring at the ceiling
When you hear some real good music
Smoking when you lay back
Make you call your bae back
Make you wanna play that music

When I'm high and I'm bored
My auxiliary cord
Got me in my feelings
Staring at the ceiling
