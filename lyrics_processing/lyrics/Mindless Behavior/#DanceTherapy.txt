Gets dressed to go
'cause she's no longer

Headed out to a
Place that she knows
She won't feel lonely

To cover up her tears
She's putting on her heels
So she can stand tall

At her job every week

At home to talk to

Let the music touch your soul
Let the rhythm move your body
Move your body

Until you touch the stars
