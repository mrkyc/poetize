(Gone, Gone, Gone, Gone, Gone, Gone, Gone, Gone)
Gone!
I'm never coming back

You got everything you want, you happy now?
Saying everything is good but you never smile
When you alone I know what you thinkin bout
Where he at? Where he at? Where he at now?

Thought we were cool
Thought we were friends
Tied up the phone them nights and weekends
But you chose him and all this time you couldn't see me
But don't look now

Girl I'm gone, gone
You didn't want me when you had me
Girl I'm gone, gone
Im sorry he didn't make you happy
But baby I'm gone
(Roc Royal: Out here floatin on the breeze, yup)
I know you wanna get at me
But baby I'm gone
(Roc Royal: I'm everywhere you wanna be, yup)
You didn't want me when you had me
So baby I'm gone

Like I got rockets on my shoes
Kinda like im allergic to your perfume
You won't catch up, play tag with that other dude
So where he at? Where he at? Where he at now?

Faster than a train go
