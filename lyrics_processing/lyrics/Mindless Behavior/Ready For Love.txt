You ready? Cause I'm ready
For love

Remember the first time I saw you in the crowd
Looking me up and down
Checking me out
Slipped you my number
And you promised you would dial
And from that moment I could not forget your smile

All I ever did
Is think about you
Every time I dream
I dream about
You
I know there are times that I'm gone
And it's hard, cause' you're alone
But I promise shorty I won't do you wrong
And if you ever forget play this song
I'm telling you

So I'm ready for love
Girl I think I'm ready for love
So I'm ready for
Love
You're the only one that I want
So I'm ready for love
All I want is you nobody else would do
So I'm ready for love
I'm ready when you ready baby
Yeah I think I'm ready for love
You might also like
In my hotel suite
In my bed I can't sleep
Cause you keep running through my head
Then I drift off and dream
That you're here with me
But I wake up all alone from my dream

All I ever do
Is think about you
Every time I dream
I dream about you
I know there are times that I'm gone
And it's hard, cause' you're alone
But I promise shorty I won't do you wrong
And if you ever forget play this song
I'm telling you

So I'm ready for love
Girl I think I'm ready for love
So I'm ready for love
You're the only one that I want
So I'm ready for love
All I want is you nobody else would do
So I'm ready for love
I'm ready when you ready baby
Yeah I think I'm ready for love

Yeah, look
Between interviews and showtime
It always seems I have no time
But I hit you with a text or two
To let you know you're on my mind
Smiley faces, twitpics
Quick reminder of who you wit'
If you ever left me it's Tylenol
In other words I'm so sick
Cause' I miss you baby every time I'm gone
Another show another time zone
But once it's settled when I get a minute
You already know what I'm on
Late night pajamas on
Skype up put your camera on
Whatever it takes to give you attention
Prove to you you're all I want cause'
