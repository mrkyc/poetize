I guess it's official
So you don't wanna kick it with a 5 star stunna like me
You got his initials
Where my name used to be
Where my chain used to be
Ay didn't I used to be that dude?

I see you everywhere-everywhere I go
Gotta hear it from everybody we know
I be tryna keep it G like it's whatever
Wishing you and me were back together

Girl I used to be your Superman
Now I'm flying solo
You used to be 100 with me
Now you on the low-low
Things ain't been the same
Girl we ain't a thing like we
Used to be, used to be, used to be
We used to be like Jay and Beyonce
Brad and Angelina
Haven't let the gossip and the rumors come between us
We ain't like we
Used to be, used to be, used to be
That used to be us
You might also like
We has J's in every color for the summer (th-that was us)
Spent them holiday's with one another (th-that was us)
Oh, girl we was like family
Don't front with me I know you missin'
What we used to be

I see you everywhere-everywhere I go
I gotta hear it from everybody we know
I been tryna keep it G like it's whatever
Wishing you and me were back together

Girl I used to be your Superman
Now I'm flying solo
You used to be 100 with me
Now you on the low-low
Things ain't been the same
Girl we ain't a thing like we
Used to be, used to be, used to be
We used to be like Jay and Beyonce
Brad and Angelina
Haven't let the gossip and the rumors come between us
We ain't like we
Used to be, used to be, used to be
That used to be us
Can you even blame me girl
For feeling like you threw it all away
I'mma let you crown your rebound king
But that ain't nothing
Like we used to be


Used to be 3x (th-that was us)
You and me 3x (th-that was us)
