I just hope, this lasts forever.

Baby how 'bout we take the long way
So I could spend a little longer by your side yeah
Take off my shades I wanna see you
So I can stare a little deeper in your eyes (ooh)

I threw a penny in the wishing well
And made a wish to meet you girl (ooh)
That's why it's no coincidence
That you're here in my world

What if forever's
Standing right next to me
This could be you right here in my arms
Maybe forever
Isn't so far away
Baby, baby tell me if you're her
Are you forever, ever,ever
Are you forever?
Are you forever, ever, ever
Baby are you forever?
Yeah
Don't wanna let go when I hug you
Cause that's the moment that you're closer to my heart
Hey, those extra seconds that I have you near
Hold me over whenever we are apart

I threw a penny in the wishing well
And made a wish to meet you girl (ooh)
That's why it's no coincidence
That you're here in my world

What if forever's
Standing right next to me
This could be you right here in my arms
Maybe forever
Isn't so far away
Baby, baby tell me if your her
Are you forever, ever,ever
Are you forever?
Are you forever, ever, ever
Baby are you forever?

Can you see us fallin' deep in love forever?
Cause I could see us being how we are forever
Baby say forever
Baby girl I really hope you are
What if forever's
Standing right next to me
This could be you right here in my arms
Maybe forever
Isn't so far away
Baby, baby tell me if your her
What if forever's
Standing right next to me
This could be you right here in my arms
Maybe forever
Isn't so far away
Baby, baby tell me if your her
Are you forever, ever,ever
Are you forever?
Are you forever, ever, ever
