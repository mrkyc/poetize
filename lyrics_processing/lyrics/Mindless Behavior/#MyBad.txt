Monday bae got a frame like a model
She make it go fast full throttle
But she know about my motto
So she's not the only one
Tuesday boo wanted to be turnt up
She take it like a big girl suppose to
She talk a lot shit cause she know
That she's not the only one
My Wednesday worse she be tweakin'
That's why I never see you on the weekend
Hey, She a freak, and we might not speak
Til next week
Cause she not the only one

 I love you girl
Are you for sure?
 Why you gotta ask that
Who do you love?
 You know I love you girl
Are you for sure?
 Well wait, let me think about it

Guess i'll find out the day that I crash
Try to tell them that the shit ain't gon' last
When their hearts break I just tell em'
My Bad, My bad
Oops, I ain't mean to do that
My Bad, My Bad
Oops, I ain't mean to do that
If I broke your heart
Well shit
My Bad

Happy hour got her feeling unladylike

If you been late night scrolling on my Instagram
And all the comments make you mad
You got it bad
Well I guess that's my bad
"My Bad"
If you text me in the morning and I don't reply
Then you hit me like 10 more times
Then baby you got it bad
But I guess that's my bad
But I see why you asked
Is a nigga moving to fast? Baby
Guess i'll find out the day that I crash
Try to tell them that the shit ain't gon' last
When their hearts break I just tell em'
My Bad, My bad
Oops, I ain't mean to do that
My Bad, My Bad
Oops, I ain't mean to do that
