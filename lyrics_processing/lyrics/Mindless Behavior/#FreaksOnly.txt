(Foreplay started four minutes twenty seconds ago)

The foreplay started four minutes, twenty seconds ago
Right when you hit my blunt
Before you hop that lil body in my rari
Just know that's that shit I'm on

Freaks only
If you rollin' wit' me ah yeah
Freaks only
That's the policy

You know you bad girl
But so is every chick around me
Wherever I'm at girl
Don't mean to sound cocky but it's poppin'
You do the math girl (yeah, yeah)
Chicks over here, chicks everywhere
Snuck into my room, now they all up in my bed
Tryna' get it poppin

The foreplay started four minutes, twenty seconds ago
Right when you hit my blunt
Before you hop that lil' body in my rari
Just know that's that shit I'm on
You might also like
Freaks only
If you rollin' wit' me ah yeah
Freaks only
That's the policy, oh yeah

Ay, I'm living in the fast lane
I don't know if you can keep up
Baby if you put ya' mind to it
You'd be surprised what could go down
In my two-seater
But you ain't got a lotta' time, to choose up
You forgot I got chicks over there
Chicks everywhere
Snuck in for  my room
Now they all up in my bed
Tryna' get it poppin, oh

The foreplay started four minutes, twenty seconds ago
Right when you hit my blunt
Before you hop that lil' body in my rari
Just know that's that shit I'm on

Freaks only
If you rollin' wit' me ah yeah

Aye, lil' mama check it (check it)
B.A.D in the building you gon' respect it
Rolled about a zip and a half
I'm 'bout to crash
Before I give up my last
You were laughing?
Now gone get natty
Hard to fool a nigga with them big wheels
I like to play in that pussy
Im a kid still
Diamond Lane forever baby
Who dat there?
Bad Lucc and MB
We a fool outchea
The foreplay started four minutes, twenty seconds ago
Right when you hit my blunt
Before you hop that lil' body in my rari
Just know that's that shit I'm on

If you rollin' wit' me ah yeah
