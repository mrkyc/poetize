I,I,I (Repeat)

(Ay baby) where you come from?
(Ay baby) you snuck up behind me
(Ay baby) we've only just begun
(Ay baby) but I'm all and you got me
(Ay baby) people got it all wrong
(Ay baby) when they say love is hopeless
(Ay baby) love is what you want
(Ay baby) no distractions man I'm focused

Hands were meant-meant to be held
And lips were meant-meant for sweet kisses
Hearts were meant- meant to feel love
And you give me more than enough

You make love so fun
Maybe you're the one
Even though we've just begun
I'm falling
Some say love is hard
And I should hold my guard
But tonight I'll give you my heart
I'm falling
Oh, I,I,I've fallin' in love and I can't get up
No I,I,I've fallin' down, in love
And I don't care who knows about it
They can also talk about how I
I found love
(Ay baby) I cry when I laugh
(Ay baby) I feel so lucky
(Ay baby) hope this feeling don't pass
(Ay baby) and you're the drum of my heartbeat
(Ay baby) I could do anything
(Ay baby) with you right by my side
(Ay baby) they say love is blind
(Ay baby) but it's also hard to find

Hands were meant-meant to be held
And lips were meant-meant for sweet kisses
Hearts were meant- meant to feel love
And you give me more than enough

You make love so fun
Maybe you're the one
Even though we've just begun
I'm falling
Some say love is hard
And I should hold my guard
But tonight I'll give you my heart
I'm falling
Oh, I,I,I've fallin' in love and I can't get up
No I,I,I've fallin' down, in love
And I don't care who knows about it
They can also talk about how I
I found love
