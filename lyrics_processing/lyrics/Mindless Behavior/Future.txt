Hey Girl
Now you rockin with MB girl
(You didn't know?)

Wish I could drive a whip, and take you 'round the city
Cruise around the strip, and pick up something pretty for you
Wish I could ball out in the club and the nightlife ya heard me
But that might be just a little too early
Instead of shoppin malls, take you to the Taj Mahal
Maybe the islands, only the finest for you (yes)
I know I'm young but I ain't even tryna fool ya (no)
What I'm sayin is that

Girl I gotta future, I got a future
And when I'm older I'mma know just what to do witcha
Because the future's lookin' bright so come into the light
And everything that's wrong I'll make it right
Cause girl I got a future, Girl I got a future
Girl you know I got a future, future, future, girl I gotta future, yeah

Wish I could meet your moms, and show her that I'm decent
Wish that I could tell you that I love you girl I mean it I do
Wish I can kick it with your friends on a regular basis
But we're from two different worlds, I gotta face it
I'm still a boy and, you need a real man
I'm gonna get there, yeah I know I sure can (yes)
I know I'm young but I ain't even tryna fool ya (no)
What I'm sayin is that

One day, I'll be older and wiser (yeah)
One day, I'll be somebody's provider yeah
One day, Yeah I'm gonna be able to do
All of the little things that I been singin' to you
And one day, I'll be ballin', drivin 'stead of walkin'
Take you where you want and take you shoppin in the mall and
