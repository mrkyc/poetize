Aye, come here
(All I want for Christmas)
Let me talk to you for a minute
Heh, it's Princeton
RAY!

Your presence is the only present that I really wanted
(Uh) It's priceless (What'chu got on it?)
(Uh) Comin' over? I got you something gorgeous (Gorgeous)
I've been saving up, so I could afford it
I kinda over did it, but I got mistletoe wishes
Cocoa goddess, marshmallow kisses
Only thing been on my mind since Thanksgiving
And gettin' your permission, are you wit' it?

The first time I ever talked to you
My heart told me you are a dream come true
And the first time you put your hand in mine
I was wishin' it would last a lifetime
All I want for Christmas is my girl
All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl
(x2)

And we watched the moonly shadow in the snow
And it was right then your boy knew for sure
That I got exactly what I asked for
Cause

When I look in your eyes
(Eyes ... And when I wake on Christmas day)
You'll be my best surprise

Sittin' fire side, cocoa in a cup

Let the past be a wrap (yeah)
