One time for all of my
Waitresses with the sparkles
Or stripper chicks sharing lockers
That don't fuck with
Their baby father, cause he a bother
One time for all of my open minded
Both-way girls, my
"fuck your feelings", get paid girls
Save all the games for the lames, girl
(Do your thing girl)
Won't no Berkin' off me
Picture with you if you
Come with a fee
Don't want you up in my section
We ballin' she keep callin'
Thirsty for my royalty
She pull out cash and
I pull out a card
Push button start, I pull out my garage
Wrap your legs around me
Like a wrestler
But my pull out game strong, oh

I know it's a 'lotta 'lotta
Good girls out there
But it's hard tryna find 'em
When all I see is fake asses
Make-up. and long hair
Girl you tried it, But you thought
A nigga was gon' put you on
(on, on)
Don't wanna'  be loved, yeah I
Know what you want
(I know what you want)
You might also like
Girl, you looking for that
Come up, come up
Got your head in the clouds
But you should come down
I ain't your come up
They say it ain't trickin'
If you got it, well I got it with my own trick

One time for all of my
Bougie girls with street smarts
My moody bitches on safe guard
My roll the weed, EBT card
(do it sweetheart)
One time for my cougars
With a teenage shooter
I'm a sniper baby come see me
Better hit the bullseye
What it's gon' be?
Line them in a row, 'ima hit all three

I know it's a 'lotta 'lotta
Good girls out there
But it's hard tryna find 'em
When all I see is fake asses
Make-up. and long hair
Girl you tried it, But you thought
A nigga was gon' put you on
(on, on)
Don't wanna'  be loved, yeah I
Know what you want
(I know what you want)
Girl, you lookin' for that
Come up, come up
Got your head in the clouds
But you should come down
I ain't your come up
They say it ain't trickin'
If you got it, well I got it with my own trick

If you about it baby
Go and do that shit, do that shit
Do that shit
If you about it baby we can
Do that shit, do that shit
Do that shit
Got news for y'all hoes out here
Tryna come up (yeah)
That quicksand ain't gon' have me
Out here stuck

I know it's a 'lotta 'lotta
Good girls out there
But it's hard tryna find her
When all I see is fake asses
Make-up. and long hair
Girl you tried it, But you thought
A nigga was gon' put you on
(on, on)
Don't wanna'  be loved, yeah I
Know what you want

Girl, you lookin' for that
Come up, come up
Got your head in the clouds
But you should come down
I ain't your come up
They say it ain't trickin'
