Hello
Yo it's Mike
Can you talk?
Listen, listen
This is my last time havin' this conversation
Okay cool

I was on my OVO Drake shit
Heart easy to break shit
Never fake type that would admit to his mistake shit
(Thinkin' that's the way to make you love me)
So pretty but inside so ugly
Was on my that's the girl I date shit
Scoop you up round' 8 shit
While you were on your smiley face
Couldn't wait shit
Turn my back you had a dagger
She ain't worth it homie, you can fucking have her

So I'm falling back, way back
Don't be texting me no naked pictures
Thinkin' Ima call you back
So I'm falling back, way back
I was in all my feelings I thought
I would never go out like that, no
You might also like
I caught way to many feelings for you
Trust I-I-I already got someone new
But I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry
No I, no I, don't cry (Never cry, never cry, No!)
No I, I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry

So we through now?
What I'm suppose to do bout this tattoo now?
Start wondering about who fucking you now
How?
(I'm in love with you still and  always will be)
Might be strong but I feel like this could kill me
Time will tell, inhale, exhale the L smoke
Never shed a tear, eyes bloodshot, heart broke
I don't know what is that got you so damn mad
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

So I'm falling back, way back
Don't be sexting me no naked pictures
Thinkin' Ima call you back
So I'm falling back, way back
I was all in my feelings I thought
I would never go out like that, no
I caught way to many feelings for you
Trust I-I-I already got someone new
But I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry
No I, no I, don't cry (Never cry, never cry, No!)
No I, I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry

You had me from the start
Crosses on my heart
I'm mad at you for being fake, so fake
Mad at myself too
For not seeing it again

I caught way to many feelings for you
Trust I-I-I already got someone new
But I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry
No I, no I, don't cry (Never cry, never cry, No!)
No I, I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
The song cry

I-I-I caught way-way-way to many feelings for you
Trust-trust I-I-I already got someone new
But I just hold it all inside and let the song cry
