How come every time I turn the TV on I see my sisters?
Shakin they ass' for money
Maybe it's cause all my girls in strip clubs make more than my teachers
Don't you think it's funny?

Everybody wants to be, on some old thugged out shit
With they iced out watches and rings, coppers and things
I guess somebody liked them to be
They wanna ride in chromed out things
Well they kids got nothing to eat, she's runnin the streets
Oh ain't life so sweet oh why

I'm not blaming it on MTV
I'm just trippin' off the things I see (oh yeah)
I'm just rollin' down the highway
Thinkin about, thinkin about it
I can't tell you how to live your life
All I can do is try to live mine right (oh yeah)
When I'm rollin' down the highway
Thinkin about, thinkin about it

How come the people brought up for the rightful life
End up taking another life, don't you think it's scary?
And how come the minute some kid picks up a gun
They blame it on the record that's number one?
I guess their parents too busy to know what's going on

When I'm rollin' down the highway
Thinkin about, thinkin about it
Living alone watchin' TV (What does it mean?)
It's hard not to be influenced by everything I see
Well it's what it comes to
You win or you lose
Can't change the way things are
That's what I'm thinking

Me oh my
When I'm turnin' the radio, I think of these silly hoes
Is it the reason we strip our clothes?
Can we make music fun?
Cause it's all about guns, booties and G-strings
Jewelry and bling bling
Tell me when will we grow up
Or do we not give a fuck?
Cause music controlling us
Is music controlling us?
Is music controlling us?
Is music controlling us?
Huh huh huh?
