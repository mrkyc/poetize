I was sitting on my throne
Rapping on how no one else knows
We're not really into each other
We were forced into being lovers
Down to Earth, we maintain
In this whole ordeal that's fame
Wonderin' what you're thinkin' next
And is your mind that too complex?
Again, I escape to where you are
And find a place down in your heart
It's a shame that this whole game
Has got me goin' insane

So let's go deep
Deep into the minds of a king
And who once was in love
Tryin' to hide behind me, oh
Let's go far, farther than a dream
If you told her once that you loved her
Then don't come back to me

Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da, da
You might also like
Possibly, I know the girl
You want to capture in your world
If I could I would jump into her body
Picture it and I can't stop smiling
Trust me now, I don't want to
Be here if I'm just preview
I'm supposed to be your everything
And you're supposed to be that for me

So let's go deep
Deep into the minds of a king
And who once was in love
Tryin' to hide behind me, oh
Let's go far, farther than a dream
If you told her once that you loved her
Then don't come back to me

Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
Deep
Deep into the minds of a king
And who once was in love
Tryin' to hide behind me, oh
Let's go far, farther than a dream
If you told her once that you loved her
Then don't come back to me

Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
(Deep, deep into the minds)
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
Da-d-da, da-da-da
Da-d-da-da-d-da
D-d, da-da
