I really hope that tonight
The rain keeps on fallin'
I need you to fall through

Eleven, thirty
Can't sleep I need you next to me
Feelin', sexy
Wonderin' can you come handle me?
Baby, can't be
Wasting a night like this
You need
To call your, boys and
Tell 'em your heart can't handle me

Oooh I kinda hope that tonight the rain keeps on fallin' and
Oooh I wait by the phone but your body just keeps on callin' me
Oooh I can't get it out of my head, been waitin' all week
See I was hopin' that you would fall through
I need you to fall through

Heartbeat, is racin'
I know you want your way, I'm
Anticipating
Your hands around my waist, I'm
Touchin', tastin
Do what you wanna do to me
Tired of, waiting
(Come back to me)
Breathin' hard
(I keep lookin out my window)
I'm pressed against it, so I can see you
Getting closer to my door
And I just want you to know
You might also like
Oooh I kinda hope that tonight the rain keeps on fallin' and
Oooh I wait by the phone but your body just keeps on callin' me
Oooh I can't get it out of my head, been waitin' all week
See I was hopin' that you would fall through
I need you to fall through

Come inside, close the door
See what I, have in store for you
Take a seat, stay a while
Baby make, my love come down now
A lot of love, I wanna give
Do you think you can handle it?
Hold me tight and don't let go
I'm about to lose control (What you waitin' for?)

Oooh I kinda hope that tonight the rain keeps on fallin' and
Oooh I wait by the phone but your body just keeps on callin' me
Oooh I can't get it out of my head, been waitin' all week
See I was hopin' that you would fall through
I need you to fall through
Oooh I kinda hope that tonight the rain keeps on fallin' and
