Yo, yo (Ooh)
Let me explain this to you (Yeah)
See, I'm not gonna let you run me (Uh, uh)
How we're gonna do it is (No, no)
I'm gonna run you

You, you got a lot of nerve
I guess you haven't heard
I'm doing fine out here on my own
You, you think that you can come
Around here for some fun
But boy, you've got a lot to learn

Don't shake your head from side to side
Saying that you're changing all that
You see the light
'Cause you just say what you say
You want your way
And it's that game that you play
It's a little late

But as if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So, see you 'round
Wave goodbye
Be a bird
Pass me by
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna
Let your love back in my life
Not tonight
Get a grip
Baby, as if
You might also like
You seem to think that I (I)
Ain't got no sense of pride (Pride)
Well boy, you got a weird perception of (Yo)
Of what it is to love (Love)
And I am sure because (Because)
You got a look of desperation (Oh)

Don't shake your head from left to right
Saying that you will when you won't
Ever see the light
And you just say what you say
You want your way
And it's that game that you play
It's a little late

But as if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that (No)
So, see you 'round (See ya)
Wave goodbye (Goodbye)
Be a bird
Pass me by
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna
Let your love back in my life (My life)
Not tonight (Not tonight)
Catch my drift (Get a grip)
Baby, as if
(You gotta go, you gotta go, bye, bye)
(As if, as if)

(Never gonna take you back, whoo!)
I (I), I got places to go (Go)
With people you don't know (You don't know 'em)
We're gonna dance all nice and slow

Don't shake your head from left to right
Saying that you're changing all now
You're on my side
'Cause you just want what you want
Some lucky charm
And it's that game that you play
So I'm moving on

But as if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that (Come on, come on)
So, be a dear (Man)
Disappear (Uh-huh)
Maybe I'm not being clear (Yo, yo)
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna
Let your love back in my life (Yeah, so, in my life)
Not tonight (Yo, yo)
Get a grip (Yo)
Baby, as if (Want that?)
But as if (No, no)
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So, see you 'round (See you round)
Wave goodbye (Wave goodbye)

Pass me by
As if (Be a bird)

Not tonight
Get a grip
Baby, as if (See ya)

If I'm gonna let you my break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let you try and be my friend
It's the end, take the hint
