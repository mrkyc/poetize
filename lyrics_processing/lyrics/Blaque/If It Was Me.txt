I never knew love could be this true, be this cruel
Forever I'll wanna spend the rest of my life with you (Uh huh)
I wish you were here lying next to me, holdin me
But I understand you're my girlfriend's boyfriend (Come on)

I should feel bad but I don't
I wanna make a move but I won't (Whoo)
And everyday I see ya
Kissin' and huggin' and missin' each other and lovin' each other
And I can't help but wonder

If it was me, (Me) under the sheets (Sheets)
If it was me, kissin' your cheek
If it was me, lovin' you down
But I won't be around sayin'
If it was me, your wife to be
If it was me, showin' a ring
If it was me lovin' you down
But I won't be around sayin'

I see the way you make her feel
The way you keep it real
When you're not around
All she ever talks about oh
(Is how she's) livin' the good life
(And how she's) lovin' her sex life
(And how she's) so lucky to have you in her life

If it was me, under the sheets
If it was me, kissin' your cheek (If it was me, yeah yeah)

But I won't be around sayin'

How would I feel if my best friend wanted my man?
But I didn't know it
How would I react to the fact that; she fell for him?
But she didn't show it
Would I be hurt? Would I be mad? If he loved her
Bet I'd be sad
So I keep it all in me (Yeah)
Cause I know how I would be!  (Come on!)

If it was me (You wish it was me) I wish it was me
If it was me (You wish it was me) I wish it was me
If it was me (You wish it was me) I wish it was me
If it was me, lovin' you down (You wish it was me)
But I won't be around sayin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
