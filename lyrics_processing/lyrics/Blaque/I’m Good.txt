Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
New Blaque, uh-huh, uh
Darkchild, Darkchizzle, uh-huh, uh
The jump off, it is
Oww

Is it true that I'm the one makin' you nervous?
You're tryin' real hard as if I'm for sure 'pressed
By you and your crew, that's helpless
You saw that X5, that's me outside
I know you, (Whoo!)
Kinda seem so confused
You can't understand how my diamonds seem blue
But it's cool, it's true, it's unusual
A girl so fly out-shinin' a guy

You wanna talk about whips?
Let's talk about it
You wanna talk about hips?
Don't think about it
You want me on the floor?
That's what I came here for
So pump your brakes
It seems as if you're wantin' more
It ain't me - I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me - I just came out to have fun
It ain't me - Go and find another one
I don't like what you're kickin', son
Now leave
You might also like
'Cause even if I leave alone
I'm good
And even if you come along
I'm good
It don't mean a thing to me 'cause
I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then
I'm good
Well, say what you'll do for me then
I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause
I'm good
With or without you

I'm good, I'm good without you (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'm good, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good (Uh, verse 2!)

Playa, please
Please stop frontin' and do you
I didn't know Benz started makin' Isuzus
But it's cool 'cause I do what I do
Which causes me not to be needing you
When I leave, I got a crib to go to
That I got myself straight outta high school
So if you're comin' at me, be ready
'Cause ain't no way I'm gonna let somebody play me
You wanna talk about whips?
Let's talk about it
You wanna talk about hips?
Don't think about it
You want me on the floor?
That's what I came here for
So pump your brakes
It seems as if you're wantin' more
It ain't me - I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me - I just came out to have fun
It ain't me - Go and find another one
I don't like what you're kickin', son
Now leave

'Cause even if I leave alone
I'm good
And even if you come along
I'm good
It don't mean a thing to me 'cause
I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then
I'm good
Well, say what you'll do for me then
I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause
I'm good
With or without you
I'm good, I'm good without you (Said I'm so good)
I'm good, I'm good (Whoa-ooh, ah)
I'm good, I'm good without you (Said I'm so good)
I'm good, I'm good (Introducin' Natina, YUP!)

Yo, I'm only Clyde if you clip me
And I still got ice even if you ain't wit' me (Say what?)
Candy paint and I still bump Biggie (Uh huh)
Halter, throwback, ripped-up dickies
She hatin' me 'cause I'm nice up on the mic (Uh)
I'm twice the size of rice
My flow keep on the lights (Uh-huh)
Brain-dead, you need cents like 50
'Cause you don't truly love me like Bobby and Whitney, no

'Cause even if I leave alone
I'm good
And even if you come along
I'm good
It don't mean a thing to me 'cause
I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then
I'm good
Well, say what you'll do for me then
I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause
I'm good
With or without you

I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you (Oh yeah)
I'm good, I'm good (Baby)
I'm good, I'm good without you
