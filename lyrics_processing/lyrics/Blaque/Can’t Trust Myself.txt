I didn't really wanna be on your team
I just want to wear the uniform
That was enough for me
But somehow you stole the ball from my court
And you forced a game of one on one
That I didn't wanna play
I never had a guy to play the whole game
They always seem to quit at half time
Leave the rest to me
I never thought love should be that way
If you're down, you should be down
Until the buzzer rings

And I can't go back down that road again
Knowing that it is a dead end
And although I really wanna take this ride with you
I'm unsure what our destination is
And baby this is why (why)

I can't trust myself
Cause every time I get around you
I turn to someone else
I'm loving too much about you
You can't possibly, be this perfect see
Why, every time I get around you, I can't trust myself
Trust myself
You might also like
When I'm alone it drives me crazy
Cause, I hate the fact that I don't want your love
I find myself pushing you away
Then I turn around and I want you to stay
And I know it's kinda premature
But I just gotta be sure

And I can't go back down this road again
Knowing that it's a dead end (a dead end, a dead end)
Although I really wanna take this ride with you
I'm unsure what our destination is
And baby that is why (why)

I can't trust myself
Cause every time I get around you
I turn to someone else
I'm loving too much about you
You can't possibly, be this perfect see
Why, every time I get around you, I can't trust myself
Trust myself

I can't (Trust myself)
I, I can't trust my, myself (Trust myself)
Ooh, I can't
Oo oo oooo oo ooh
Ah oh
Remember the time you looked into my eyes
I never wanna be with another guy (Trust myself)
Every time I think how you make me feel
I know you're the one for me, for real (Trust myself)
I never had someone to treat me like you do
I pinch myself; I can't believe it's true (Trust myself)
You're the one, you set me free
I'm falling in love, and it's killing me

I can't trust myself
Cause every time I get around you
I turn to someone else
I'm loving too much about you
You can't possibly, be this perfect see
Why, every time I get around you, I can't trust myself
Trust myself

I can't trust myself
Cause every time I get around you
I turn to someone else
I'm loving too much about you
You can't possibly, be this perfect see
Why, every time I get around you, I can't trust myself
