Uh huh yeah, uh huh yeah yeah this ones for the club
Uh huh, uh huh yeah, uh huh yeah yeah (YoungBloodz blaque)
Dallas where you at? (what you sayin' boo)
Clubs wild gettin'
This track is ... uh huh
Pass me a smidgen, so I start spitting
106 hittin'
Dallas Austin written
Perfect smashes (Ayayayaya)
All day club, gimme me my hug
Indo's, fours, drop those bawls
Gimme those boys and ATL noise
Blaque throws bows uh huh

I met him at the spot, told him come by my spot
Started blowing in my spot, leaving his shoes at my spot
So I start headin' to his crib where his home boys was at
And I started thinking I was in too hot
Crazy calls on my phone, buzz on my phone
Calling, hangin' up the phone, should of seen the bill on my phone From here to LA for hours everyday
I knew that it was time he went away (Come on)

Ghetto boys don't work for me, no more
All the drama that I ain't really looking for
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin boo)
Ghetto boys wanna keep you anyway
Standing around the streets, trying to hang onto me
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin boo)
You might also like
See him on the scene, but try to cause a scene (Yeah)
With his boys on the scene, they don't even know what I've seen
From blocks in the street, he clocks in the streets (Uh huh)
And I knew that he wasn't really meant for me
I told him how we didn't click, I didn't like his clique
And then something just clicked, I never thought about that shit
He had me up in his mix, but he was hitting licks
And it wasn't safe for me to be his chick

Ghetto boys don't work for me no more
All the drama that I ain't really looking for
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin boo)
Ghetto boys wanna keep you anyway
Standing around the streets, trying to hang onto me

Ghetto boys don't work for me no more
All the drama that I ain't really looking for
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)

Ghetto boys wanna keep you anyway(Ghetto boys, ghetto ghetto)
Standing around the streets, trying to hang onto me
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)

Going down like this here you understand
It's a real A-Town thing going down
It's real big ya know I'm sayin'?
YougnBloodz, Blaque it's goin down for real
Ghetto things happen round here

I'm a ghetto boy, you're a good girl
I put 22's on a hooptie with, pearl
My ghetto world got me drug, dealin'
I got a ghetto baby mama and some ghetto, chitlin
My ghetto way, 30 ghetto J's
Hit the trial baby and stay ghetto, paid
White Cadillac with some brand new, J's
I got some ghetto gold teeth and some ghetto braids
Oh yeah you see it we ghetto
Slumped back with cornrows
In Polos in bigger than old school
Like them Kangols
A-Town, it goes down
Attic Crew my background
And ghetto girls runnin' round
With ghetto boys shippin' pounds
Underground, 2 around
Listen to these southern sounds
Ghetto this, ghetto that
We all from these ghetto grounds
Shuttin' down tryna catch the baddest thing about the bat
And if it ain't twerkin' then I guess I gotta holla back
Ghetto boys don't work for me no more
All the drama that I ain't really looking for (We back, with Blaque)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin boo)
Ghetto boys wanna keep you anyway(A-Town, don't play round)
Standing around the streets, trying to hang onto me
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin shawty)
Know what's up before you keep sayin (Whatcha sayin boo)
Ghetto boys don't work for me no more
All the drama that I ain't really looking for
