Yo, see what I believe is
Uh-huh, uh-huh
808 needs love
Remix!

Oh, babe
Is it true that you can't even do the things I do?
Are you missing this love I used to give to you?
Had you coming in the front door
Leaving out the back at night
Oh, babe, oh, babe
Oh, babe do you stay up all night thinking how I did you right?
Are you missing all the ways I used to keep it tight?
I'm the only one who knows all the freaky things you like
Oh, babe, oh, babe

She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she ain't got the jump in her trunk
Or the bump that you want
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do
And she ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes
When she makes her body roll
And the girl don't work it slow like I do
You might also like
Oh, babe
Is it true that one day you called her my name?
It was then that you knew that it didn't feel the same
Down deep in your mind got you boning me again
Oh, babe, oh, babe
Oh, babe don't pretend that your girls love is as good as mine
If it was you wouldn't be calling me all the time
This love so good and the first thing on your mind
Oh, babe, oh, babe

She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she ain't got the jump in her trunk
Or the bump that you want
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do
And she ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes
When she makes her body roll
And the girl don't work it slow like I do

Ain't nobody, bang it like me
Stack it like me, wha like me
Ask Kelly, it's the original, pallanigen
Lodgin the map, makin you clap your hands
Dance you, inside shh
I ain't gonna lie
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy, take me to lunch
Aw gone and done it now
With the lucious music
Wha, pop the cruize
Wha, get your boost
Wha, insented you
Yeah, you hear me up
You wantin' the bell
But forget it cause they ride in my pocket
And today I just wanna jiggle my paw
And knock your socks off with my
Wha, wha
She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she ain't got the jump in her trunk
Or the bump that you want
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do
She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes
When she makes her body roll
And the girl don't work it slow like I do

She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she ain't got the jump in her trunk
Or the bump that you want
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do
She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes
When she makes her body roll
And the girl don't work it slow like I do

She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she ain't got the jump in her trunk
Or the bump that you want
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do
She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move the room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes
When she makes her body roll
