Ha ha ooh ah
Can't nobody tell me what I can
'Cause I be lovin my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shant
Can't nobody tell me what I can
What what? huh? huh? hah

Can't nobody ever say I don't love my man
Who are you to justify what I can and can't? (how I can ahhh oohh)
Gonna make him love me even more (loving even, loving me more)
I've been giving him more love than I did before

And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs
And I do give him the love
That no girl in this world could ever touch and I do

(dah rah dah dah dah)
(Dah rah dah dah dah) (shoowop shoowop)

And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs
And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs

You ain't never heard a cop like that
Be tryin' hurl me out of my relations nonstop
Time to get the pop, pop what you want to hit me wit
I make the driest curls drip drop
Possibly l-a-d's these days just don't be givin' a cuff
When you thinkin' that you're lovin' yo man
That's when he taps you on the shoulder
Sayin "baby you ain't givin me love"
What?
And I do give him the love that he wants (I do)
Give him the love that he needs (I do)
Give him the love that he wants (I do)
Give him the love that he needs (I do)

And I do give him the love that he needs
And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he wants (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he needs (Aw sookie sookie now)
And I do give him the love that he wants (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he needs (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he wants
