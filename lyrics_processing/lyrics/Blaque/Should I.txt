Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
I need to do what I need to do

The other night when you took me home after the movies
Know I laid disturbing news on you
I took a test and the answer was yes
It was my choice, what about my voice?
Time is bad for us, it's a show for us
But this body is mine and I'll decide
What I'm going to do with this life

Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
I need to do what I need to do

Daddy wouldn't understand, it wouldn't make him happy
To see his baby on stage and the crowds in a rage
Having paid to see me, have fantasies about me
Making ends meet  money to keep the bills paid
I could be a star, go really far, do I relive the high?
What's a young girl to do?
You might also like
I can't live that way
Do I go left? Do I go right?
Is the price too high for me to pay?
Need to count up the cost before it's too late
But life's full of mistakes
And I'm sure that I'll make a few
Is this the chance that I want to take?
I only got one life to live, so what do I do?

Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
I need to do what I need to do

Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
I need to do what I need to do
Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
I need to do what I need to do

Should I, shouldn't I do, what my friends are telling me to
My body yes but my mind says no
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I, shouldn't do what my friends are telling me to
I know I can't leave it up to you
