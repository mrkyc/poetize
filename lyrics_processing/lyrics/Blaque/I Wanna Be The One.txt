The finest thing that you ever done
Is you show me love, your special touch, you gave me trust
Ain't nobody got it like you do
You kept it real, you take your time to staying true
And I ain't going nowhere
I'll always care, you know I swear I'll be right there
And one thing you can know for sure
My feelings are the same and I'll always remain by your side

I wanna be the one you run to
I wanna be the one you call
I wanna be right there to show I care
To catch you when you fall
You'll never need to look no further
You know that I will understand
Whenever you need a place where you can run
When all is said and done

I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
Oh, I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one

My homegirl tried to lie to me
She said she saw with another girl out in the street
The funny thing that she don't know
Is that you and I was on the phone all night long
No one can take my place
No matter the lies they never replace, they'll never erase
We know that what we got
More than a rockin' candy
I can't imagine us apart

I wanna be the one you run to
I wanna be the one you call
I wanna be right there to show I care
To catch you when you fall
You'll never need to look no further
You know that I will understand
Whenever you need a place where you can run
When all is said and done

I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
Oh, I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
Cause you're supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
If you got a cutie then you know you need to roll this
He's my guy, fly guy, brown eyes, booty
Bump this up in your truck
Cause you'd be the one he's going home with

The finest thing that you ever done
