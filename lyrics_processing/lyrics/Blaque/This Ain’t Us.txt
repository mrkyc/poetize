I never thought there'd be a day
That I would have to question
If you really want to continue together
How did it ever get this way?
Hey when just a week ago
We were planning our lives
You spend a lot of time away from home
And all I can do is try to hold you longer
When we were together
You tell me that it's still the same
But looking in your eyes
I know something ain't right
Cause I know

This ain't us
This isn't us
You gotta tell me how I made the love disappear from your heart
It tore us apart
Baby, this ain't us
This isn't us
You broke my heart many times
Don't know who to trust

This ain't us
Yeah, yeah
Baby, this ain't us
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
What happened to the promises, baby?
What happened to its only you and me forever?
But everyone's allowed mistakes
Cause I know I made a couple of them in my life
But why is that a fixing thing?
It's like you weren't missing me
If we don't grow up
And make things right
It'll be the worst mistake of both of our lives

This ain't us
This isn't us
You gotta tell me how I made the love disappear from your heart
It tore us apart
Baby, this ain't us
This isn't us
Your broke my heart many times
Don't know who to trust

We started out okay
So how did it get this way?
And after all we gave a chance
We let it slip away
I don't wanna be the one
Stuck with in the past
So boy, I will decide for you
If yesterday with you is through
This ain't us
This isn't us
You gotta tell me how
I made the love disappear from your heart
It tore us apart
Baby, this ain't us
This isn't us
Your broke my heart many times
Don't know who to trust

This ain't us, baby
Baby, this ain't us
