I'm the type to mind my own business
There is someone always starting mess
Always telling what somebody say
Never tell them what they said and say

You're a no good troublemaker
And I can't trust a word you say
Everything that I gotta say to you
I'm gonna say it up in your face

I know you heard that
Somebody told you
But I don't care what he say
So you can keep that
And tell somebody else that
Cause I don't care about that he say she say
So don't be telling me who told her to tell you
About what she said
And let her know that I don't get down
With the he say, she say
She say, he say

So who are you trying to impress
What you're saying is so meaningless
What do you think you were going to get
I play none of those silly games
You might also like
You're a no good troublemaker
And I can't trust a word you say
Everything that I gotta say to you
I'm gonna say it up in your face

I know you heard that
Somebody told you
But I don't care what he said
So you can keep that
And tell somebody else that
Cause I don't care about that he say she say
So don't be telling me who told her to tell you
About what she say
And let her know that I don't get down
With the he say, she say
She say, he say

They saying what she say
You need to go tell somebody else, oh
Cause I don't really care about it, no
Why do they act like they know me?
We sneak everytime we meet yeah
What would they say to you that they won't say to me
Is that really what they mean?
Cause it's not all that it seems
That's why I stay away from the he say, she say
I know you heard that
Somebody told you
But I don't care what he say
So you can keep that
And tell somebody else that
Cause I don't care about that he say she say
So don't be telling me who told her to tell you
About what she say
And let her know that I don't get down
With the he say, she say
