Oooh Ooh!

Damn homie, in high school you was the man homie
What happened to you, you was my tenderoni
Now the lies you spit is full of baloney (Uh)
So there's no need to push up on me
You say my love is your one and only
And to your game you can't fool a phony
Pullin' out your wallet like your spending money
You's a gangsta...

Said you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin' (Say you a gangsta)
Said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
Go to the dealership but you never cop nothin'
Been hustlin' a long time but you ain't got nothin'
Said you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'(You ain't pop nutin)
Said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
(Stop frontin' babe)
Go to the dealership but you never cop nothin' (Ohh)
Been hustlin' a long time

I don't believe in vendettas

Although chicks always sweat him (Uh huh)
'Cause he sport Gucci sweaters (Uh huh)
If he broke I'll just debt him (Oooh!)
You look good homie
But that don't mean you can pull one on me
I remember what my mama told me
Just cause say you love me, can you support me?

'Cause I done seen a lot of so called gangstas
