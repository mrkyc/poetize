The jump off
Is it true that I'm the one making you nervous?
Trying real hard as if I'm for show shit
By you and your crew, that's helpless
You saw that X-5, that's me out side
I know you, kinda seem so confused
You can't understand how my diamonds bling through
But it's cool its true, it's unusual
A girl so fly out shining a guy
We can talk about this, lets talk about it
We can talk about this, don't think about it
About me on the floor, that's what I came here for
So pump ya breaks it seem as if ya wantin' more
It ain't me, I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me, I just came out to have fun
It ain't me, go out and find another one
I don't like what your kickin' son, now leave
'Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me 'cause, I'm good
With or without you
You might also likeIf you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me then, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause, I'm good
With or without you
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
Playas please, please stop frontin'
I don't know when Benz started makin Isuzu's
But it's new, 'cause I do what I do
Which causes me not to be needin' you
When I leave, I got a crib to go to
That I got myself straight out of high school
So if you comin' at me, be ready
'Cause there ain't no way I'mma let somebody play me
We can talk about this, let's talk about it
We can talk about this, don't think about it
About me on the floor, that's what I came here for
So pump ya breaks it seem as if ya wantin' more
It ain't me, I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me, I just came out to have fun
It ain't me, go out and find another one
I don't like what your kickin' son, now leave
'Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me cause, I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me then, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause, I'm good
With or without you
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
Yo, I'm only Clyde if you clip me
And I still got ice even if you ain't wit me
Candy paint and I still bump Biggie
Halter, throwback, ripped up dickies
Ya hate me cause I I'm nice up on the mic
I'm twice the size of rice, my flow keepin em' right
Brain dead you need cents like 50
'Cause won't you to love me like Bobby and Whitney, mo
'Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me 'cause, I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me then, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing 'cause, I'm good
With or without you
I'm good' I'm good without you
I'm good' I'm good
I'm good' I'm good without you
I'm good' I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good without you
