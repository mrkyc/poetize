Boy didn't I say it's over?
So why you crawlin' on your hands and knees?
I cried till my eyes turned blue
So don't expect no sympathy from me
So what makes you think you can come thru the door?
And tell me everything gon' be okay
You figure, I love you way too much to tell ya
To stay the hell away from me

You won't get the Nappy Dugout, baby
(I said you won't get the Nappy Dugout baby)
Imma wait till I'm married for now, I'll save it
(See, Imma wait till I'm married for now, I'll save it)
For a guy who truly loves me, baby
(For a guy who truly loves me!)
Not for a lowlife fella who's drivin' me crazy
(Ohhh, yeah)

Stop leavin' messages on my phone
Tellin' me to call you back sometime tonight
See all those times I was hittin' you up
So now, why you wanna come back inside
But it's too late I already told ya
Why you wanna mess up somethin' so good
I know if I gave you a little control
You would take advantage, that's how you do it
You might also like
You won't get the Nappy Dugout, baby
(I said you won't get the Nappy Dugout baby)
Imma wait till I'm married for now, I'll save it
(Imma wait until I'm married!)
For a guy who truly loves me, baby
(For a guy who truly loves me!)
Not for a lowlife fella who's drivin' me crazy
(Ohhh, yeah)

(No more)
No more for you
It's over baby (No more)
No more for you
(You can't have it)
No more for you
It's over baby (No more)
No more for you

You won't get the Nappy Dugout, baby
(I said you won't get the Nappy Dugout baby)
Imma wait till I'm married for now, I'll save it
(Imma wait until I'm married!)
For a guy who truly loves me, baby
(For a guy who truly loves me!)
Not for a lowlife fella who's drivin' me crazy
