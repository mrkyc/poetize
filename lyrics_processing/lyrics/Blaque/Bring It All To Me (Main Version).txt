There you are
Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me
What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby, oh

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (baby I don't need, no)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (hoh, no)

Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if I
Told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thing
I'm so for real
I'm feeling your Timb's, your baggy jeans
Your thug appeal
Cause I like it when a man can keep it real, oh baby
You might also like
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all, baby)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings, oh no)
Oh, baby (baby bring it all to me, yeah)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (bring it all baby, bring it all, yeah)

Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good
You make me feel inside

There's not a single question
That we can't make this right
Cause it's you who I need
Every day and night

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all baby)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (no I don't)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(oh)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (oh)

Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh woah)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (ooh)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (oh baby)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (bring it all)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (oh)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings baby)
Oh, baby
