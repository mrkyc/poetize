You can do a little bit better
You can go a little bit deeper
Please her
You gotta do what it takes to keep her
You can come a little bit harder
And at the same time softer
If you love her
Do what it takes to keep her

I know you love her
But you've got to show her
Spend some time with her
Just you and her, yeah
You can't act like that
Raise your voice like that
You're quick to get mad
So I'm tellin' you boy

And at the same time softer (And at the same time softer)
If you love her (Love her)
Do what it takes to keep her

I know this is hard for you
But everybody goes thru
This dirty game called love

But you got to work harder
Love to get it back
Work hard to get her back
Things will change you will see
