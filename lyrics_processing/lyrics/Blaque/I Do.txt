Cause I be loving my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can
What? What?
Huh, huh, ha

Cause I be loving my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can

Can't nobody ever say I don't love my man
Who are you to justify what I can and can't
(Can't and can't and how I can, ooh)
Gonna make him love me even more
(Loving me even, loving me even more)
I've been giving him more love than I did before

And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs
And I do give him the love
That no girl in this world could ever touch and I do

Be tryin' hurl me out of my relations nonstop (Shoowop shoowop)
Time to get the pop, pop what you want to hit me wit
I make the driest curls drip drop (Shoowop shoowop)
Possibly l-a-d's these days just don't be givin' a cuff
(Shoowop shoowop)
When you thinkin' that you're lovin' yo man
That's when he tap you on the shoulder
Sayin "baby you ain't givin me love"
What? (Uh)

You ain't never heard the nine degrees
They my degrees on loving as philosophies (Shoowop shoowop)
Unity the cornerstone that forms the one
Two ways to trust, either all or none (Shoowop shoowop)
Joy, honor, respect and form the laws that hurdle four walls
That define the first five of all (Shoowop shoowop)
Harmony number six takes commitment
Seven love and is peace, makes confidence
Balance like a figure eight joined at the hip infinity
Ninth reign, never-ending trip
Don't just, focus, on what your eyes can see
Think, feel, believe, give and receive
I do give him the love that he wants (I do)
Give him the love that he needs (I do)
Give him the love that he wants (I do)
Give him the love that he needs (I do)

And I do give him the love that he needs
And I do give him the love that he wants
And I do give him the love that he needs (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he wants (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he needs (Aw sookie sookie now)
And I do give him the love that he wants (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he needs (Shoowop shoowop)
And I do give him the love that he wants
