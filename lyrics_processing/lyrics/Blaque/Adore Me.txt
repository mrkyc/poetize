It seems like the longest (Whoo!)
Before I remembered (Uh huh)
That you haven't paged me
And I'm about to go crazy
Why can't I address this? (Huh)
I'm not on your guest list (Huh?)
Is it another chick?
Let me know if I am ditched for her

And I came across your mind
I know I did, I know I had to (Uh huh, yeah)
And I know you value our time
Cause other wise we wouldn't have gone this far (Uh huh)
And I spent my nickels and dimes
Just tryna be wherever you were
And you still ignore me now
Ooh you still ignore me now
I'm the only one that will be down
You might also like
I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
The only shoulder you lean on
When you cry and when you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
That we both have caught the eye
I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
The only shoulder you lean on
When you cry and when you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
That we both have caught the eye

I took the stuffin' out the teddy bear
That you bought for me last year
And you're the one to blame (That's right)
Cause you still haven't changed your ways
What you think this is funny (Ha-ha)
Boy you still owe me money (Ha-ha)
And I know you're feeling me (Uh huh)
But you persist to play your games
And I came across your mind
I know I did, I know I had to (Uh huh)
And I know you value our time
Cause other wise we wouldn't have gone this far
And I spent my nickels and dimes
Just tryna be wherever you were (Wha-wha)
And you still ignore me now
Ooh you still ignore me now
I'm the only one that will be down (Come on)
Down...

See
Let me tell you something
I trusted you
And you know what you did with my-my trust?
You threw it away
And I'm a tell you something
Boy, that's not how I operate

I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
The only shoulder you lean on
When you cry and when you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
That we both have caught the eye
I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
The only shoulder you lean on
When you cry and when you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
That we both have caught the eye
I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
