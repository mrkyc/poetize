It don't get no better than this, come on
Blaque is back again
Salaam hit 'em

Gave you my love and I can't get it back (Uh huh)
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back
No, the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cause this shit's not going down like that (Nah)
Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back (Uh huh)
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But this shit's not going down like that

Verse one when we begun
You know you have a sista on sprung
When we hung
'Cause a brotha was nice with his tongue
As we played every day
You always knew, just what to say
As we laid and planned to go to Paris the very next May
As time moved on, we were torn
You used to love me from dusk till dawn
Now you trippin' from night till morn (Wha-what, wha-what)
You changed your song
And you can no longer keep me warm
Cause the loving we shared was gone (Bye-bye)
You might also like
'Cause you better know
That you can't get back
What you put in this relationship
I'm telling you so
'Cause I can't get back
All of my kissing and loving and hugging
So I'm telling you

Gave you my love and I can't get it back (Ohh)
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back (Oh yeah)
No, the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cause this shit's not going down like that (Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But this shit's not going down like that
Come on

Verse two, now we're through
Up, out my life and away love flew
And it's cool
Put the glass shoe on another young fool
'Cause I had slept
While you crept
Can't take the heat so away you step
Now upset
And don't come back for nothing that you left
I gave you my all
But if it's too small, I can't call
'Cause every playa's got to ball
As seasons change
You couldn't hang
But if you think your coming back for this ring
Then you better know (Uh huh)
That you can't get back
What you put in this relationship (Yeah, yeah)
I'm telling you so (Come on)
'Cause I can't get back
All of my kissing and loving and hugging
So I'm telling you (Uh huh)

Gave you my love and I can't get it back (Yeah)
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back (I should've known)
No, the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cause this shit's not going down like that (No, Ohhh)
Gave you my time and I can't get it back (Uh huh)
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back (Yeah)
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But this shit's not going down like that (Wha-wha-wha-what)

Mhmm
Ah haa (Yeah)
Hey, why you got to lie? (Uh huh)
It's a shame-shame
This whole game-game (Come on)
Got me go-going insane-sane
You've been busted, dusted
Can't be trusted
Don't say  and don't say nothing (Uh huh)
Blaque came here to the party with a grillie face (Yeah)
And with a little ol' school just to change the game
And if your glass has rum (Rum)
And your clique wants to have fun (Fun)
Represent where you are from (From)
If the club closed way passed one (One)
You say:
Owwww, Owwww
Owwww, Owwww
Owwww, Owwww
No, you can't have it back silly rabbit! (Lemme hear you say)
'Cause you better know (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
That you can't get back
What you put in this relationship (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm telling you so
'Cause I can't get back
All of my kissing and loving and hugging
So I'm telling you

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back (Oh-oh)
No, the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back (Oh-oh-ohh)
'Cause this shit's not going down like that (Yeah, yeah)
Gave you my time and I can't get it back (I gave you all my love)
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back (Ohhh)
But this shit's not going down like that
