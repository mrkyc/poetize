I wanna know why this feels so right
I wanna know why you hold me tight
Each and every night, it keeps me up all night
Thinking about the things I like
Can't believe your in my life
I wanna know why your the one
The things that they should have you've already done
God sent you straight to me
You make me wanna sing lalalalala

But when you look at me, do you see your wife?
Can you picture us lovin' each other for life?
Are you playin' the role, just like the rest
These are the questions that I ask myself
If, another should come, who's finer than me
And she wanna take your love away, would you leave?
Baby please answer these questions

Could this be my whole fantasy
Maybe you could just be too good for me
If I don't wake then I won't see
Cause if I'm not the one you met, then who is in me
In the mist of the tears how come
I love you more, and more, and more
I never longed for no one, yes it's true
Seems like these questions keep me here with you

If you, really wanna be with me
Then I'll say, I love you endlessly
One thing that I really wanna know
Will this end or will this grow i said now
