I was fifteen years old
I found somebody new
And how could I have known
That one day she would give me you
Hell and high water
She stuck right by my side
And that kind of love
Is all I hope that you can find

If all I had left
Was my last breath
Here's what I'd spend it on:
I'd tell you: "You were my world
And she was my girl"
If all I had left
Was my last breath

Well, Pa Dearly died
Right after you turned two
And I miss him so bad
But I can see him when I look at you
You've got that same smile
That can light up a room
And I know my Grandpa
Is lookin' after you

If all I had left
Was my last breath
Here's what I'd spend it on:
I'd tell you: "You were my world
And she was my girl"
If all I had left
Was my last breath

When the world outside is restless
I will be your best friend
I will love you 'til the end of time
I'll love ya 'cause the sun does shine
If you're ever out in the cold
Well, I would be your hand to hold
We won't always see eye to eye
But I'll love ya 'til the well runs dry


If all you had left  (If all you had left)
Was your last breath  (Was your last breath)
Do you know who you'd spend it on?

Do you know who you'd spend it on?
If all I had left

I'd tell you: "You were my world
And she was my girl"
If all I had left
Was my last breath

If all you had left  (If all you had left)
Was your last breath  (Was your last breath)
Do you know who you'd spend it on?

Wanna have my loved ones hear it again!
