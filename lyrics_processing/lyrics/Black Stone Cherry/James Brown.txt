In time to write a rhyme to reach
Get'cha new procedure
Need a soul to preach to
Get me a soul to preach to, ah

Don't want, but you know I'm needed
Gets ya on your feet
'Stead of tryin' to beat it
I am not defeated

Ah!
Well let me talk at you, babe

Hot damn, you move just like magic
So hip that it's tragic
(Well lookie here, let me break this down)
(I feel good, just like James Brown)
Heart-breaker got me a-ramblin'
Like I've been time travellin'
(A back-beat to the funky sound)
(I'm a ghost, just like James Brown)
Wa-hoo, wa-hooo!
Wa-hoo, wa-hooo!
Wa-hoo, wa-hooo!
Wa-hooo! Wa-hooo!

We have time to find a way to say it
Said rewind, replay it
'Til it's sex or rated
Until it's sex for ratings
