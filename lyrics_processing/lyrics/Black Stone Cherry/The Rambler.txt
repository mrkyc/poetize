In a southern fall
It might have been sunday
But I can't recall
All the birthdays
I must have missed
Your first steps
And your first kiss
I don't even know
If you know my name
But you should hear the truth
Before it's too late
So I hope this finds you
On some highway
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
But I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
I played for tips
And I played for less
I played a pretty southern girl
Right out of her dress
She danced until the lights came on
There's a reason she's here
Instead of being at home
She said the songs you sang
Made the whole room cry
And that night I told
A young man's lie
When I said I would call her
And I said I'd write
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
But I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
Turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
I'm sorry for the tears
I made you cry
I'm sorry for the promises
That turned to lies
If I could turn back
The hands of time
I'd take it back and try, try, try
To make you understand
That this is who I am
I met the devil in an old motel
It seems I ain't got much of a soul to sell
My glass is empty
My hands are blue
And the doctor gave me
About a month or two
Well, I thought I would make it
To you this year
So forgive me one last time my dear
And tell your mother
I won't be coming home
'cause I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
Forgive my indiscretion
It's the only way I know
A million miles from Kentucky
But I will always be around
So turn the radio up
When your heart breaks down
Turn the radio up
