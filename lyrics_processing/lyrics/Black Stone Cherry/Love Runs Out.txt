I'll be the bright, and black, that's making you run
And I feel alright, I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you ever doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
I got my mind made up and I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder and Mephistopheles
My momma raised me good, momma raised me right
Momma said "do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah

'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
Oh-oh, we all want the same thing
And I believe we all run for something
For God, for fate, for love, for hate
For gold and rust, for diamonds and dust
I'll be our light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright and black that's making you run
I got my mind made up and I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
