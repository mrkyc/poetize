Might have to rob a bank
Maybe then fly away
But baby, you're perfect!

You got me runnin' hot
Chasin' these mountain tops
I just can't ever stop
'Cause girl, you are worth it

The way you run the river
I ain't like those other fellas
Ain't no need for heat in deserts
Yeah baby, I'll tell you my secrets

I gotta new kinda feelin'  (You want it, you can't have it)
It's a perfect kinda healin', yeah!  ( all night)
So I don't need a reason  (Don't need no reason, yeah)
For my new kinda feelin', yeah!  (You keep it all right)

What did I get into
What am I gonna do?
She turned the ocean blue
But damn it, she's perfect!
