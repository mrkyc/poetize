A little bit of rain wouldn't make the news
You'd mix champagne with mountain dew
You'd keep the name that was given to you
And if we played a game somebody's gonna lose
Indian food would be cornbread and butter
You'd get your ass kicked if you talked about my mother
You'd open up a trunk door taking out your lover
She might be your cousin but she wouldn't be your brother
Every pair of boots would be a little muddy
Your ass would get a job if you ran out money
The only stars you'd wanna see
Would be somewhere over Tennessee
Everybody's hands would get a little dirty
To be a movie star you'd have to serve in the army
The good old boys would be the only ones getting lucky
If Hollywood was in Kentucky
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
A malibu would just be a car
The real barbed wire wouldn't be on your arm
They'd serve sweet tea in mason jars
Down on Santa Monica Boulevard

KFC would still be Kentucky Fried Chicken
A trailer on the lake would be waterfront living
The Kardashians wouldn't be allowed in
Come on ya'll, we've all gotta lighten up
Every pair of boots would be a little muddy
Your ass would get a job if you ran out money
The only stars you'd wanna see
Would be somewhere over Tennessee
Everybody's hands would get a little dirty
To be a movie star you'd have to serve in the army
The good old boys would be the only ones getting lucky
If Hollywood was in Kentucky
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Come on ya'll, we've all gotta lighten up
Come on ya'll, we've all have a light one
Every pair of boots would be a little muddy
Your ass would get a job if you ran out money
The only stars you'd wanna see
Would be somewhere over Tennessee
Everybody's hands would get a little dirty
To be a movie star you'd have to serve in the army
The good old boys would be the only ones getting lucky
If Hollywood was in Kentucky
