Knew the minute that I laid eyes on ya
I was gonna be as good as gone and
You're the kind that wanted it all
Lit a wild fire in my bed
You took my wallet and you wrecked my head
Drink my bourbon, burn my cigarettes
And now I don't feel nothing at all
I could rob a bank and beg her back
Break down and show them where the money's at
That girl loves diamonds and cadillacs
Cheaper to drink
Cheaper to drink
Yes, she'll leave me more than heartbroke
High heels and high dollar cosmos
I wish it was, but it ain't no joke
Cheaper to drink
Cheaper to drink
Cheaper to drink alone
Well, I guess I should have seen the warning
But you was everything I ever wanted
Always kept me coming back for more
And god I felt like taking you home

Like shots of whiskey when they hit your chest
You loved me and let me in the red
And now i don't feel nothing but broke
Yeah broke
I could rob a bank and beg her back
Break down and show them where the money's at
That girl loves diamonds and cadillacs
Cheaper to drink
Cheaper to drink
Yes, she'll leave me more than heartbroke
High heels and high dollar cosmos
I wish it was, but it ain't no joke
