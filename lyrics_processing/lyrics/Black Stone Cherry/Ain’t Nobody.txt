Hey, yeah!

I needed somethin' to squeeze, it never bothered me
'Cause I'll eat the peach right off a tree
Shit, I know you know what I wanna found
And if the sun don't shine, we'll get them pound

I say: "Ain't nobody got a body like you
Ain't nobody walk the walk with you
Listen babe, it's not hard to prove
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Ain't nobody got a body like you
Ain't nobody talk the talk like you do
Listen babe, it's not hard to prove
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody like you"

So where we been ain't no coming back
I been lost in you and that's a natural fact
The way it feels when you decide to drive
Is like tastin' honey after workin' the hive

I say: "Ain't nobody got a body like you
Ain't nobody walk the walk with you
Listen babe, it's not hard to prove
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Ain't nobody got a body like you
Ain't nobody talk the talk like you do
Listen babe, it's not hard to prove
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody like you"

I say: "Ain't nobody got a body like you
