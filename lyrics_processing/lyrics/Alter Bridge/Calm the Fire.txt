Calm the fire
Do not fight anymore
They don't know what they're saying
Don't know anything at all
For all that matters is you know
That this is not their fault
There are places
We should never go
Lost between the cracks
Something wicked waits below
And all I'm saying there are some things
Better left unseen at all

It's been so long
It's tearing me apart
I cannot understand or comprehend
Where we went wrong
Though we've come so far
The madness in our hearts will never end

'Cause I've seen it all
I can't fight it anymore
The fire burns forevermore
Is there nothing left to save?
You might also like
'Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful
If only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

Is there no more?
Have we gone too far?
There's nothing I can do to make you sway
To see the blood
Running through our hearts
No different from the blood we've come to hate

When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can't deny
Only ignorance to blame

'Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful
If only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love
Now let it calm the fire
That burns within your heart tonight
For some are too blind to see
The world as it's meant to be

When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And you know you can't deny
Only ignorance to blame

'Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful
If only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
