Can you hear the marching, beating of the drums
Once again, the dogs are out for blood
Words and accusations, history revised
The time is gonna tell that you were right
Oh, how you tried
I know that you tried to save us
Save us

I remember dreaming not so long ago
That change was gonna come, I still had hope
How long must I keep waiting, feeling so ignored
Is anything worth saving anymore
I just don't know, but need you so

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who will save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero

Tyrants overtaking, intoxicate with lies
There is no escaping, not this time
The simple man receiving, defending every crime
Somehow, still believing they're all right
So hypnotized
You might also like
Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who will save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero

Tell me where are the heroes, no
Tell me where are the heroes, no, no
Have we lost all our heroes, no
How could it be we couldn't see
Now we are left here to fight this on our own


Build them up to tear them down
What we've done, I'm far from proud
Chew em up, spit em out
In the end, who will save us now

Can you hear the marching, beating of the drums
Once again, the dogs are out for blood
Words and accusations, history revised
But time is gonna tell that you were right
Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who will save us in the end
Have we lost our last hero


Have we reached the end, are we lost to know
Have we sealed our fate, nowhere left to go
No, it's much too late, this I hope to see
