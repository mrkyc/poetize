If I died tonight
Would the question still remain?
Did I live for what was right?
Did I live this life in vain?
A simulated lie
Just a spark that's sure to fade
Then I start to wonder why
I couldn't see the apparition from the start

Like a counterfeit, I've had enough of this
I bought the dream and it let me down so
I wanna take a risk, I wanna learn to live
To find the one thing that can't be sold

This might be paradise
A mirage that's in decay
In this world it's hard to find
Something real among the wreckage of our hope

Like a counterfeit, I've had enough of this
I bought the dream and it let me down
You might also like
Awake, now I see the clear horizon
It was just out of reach from the start

If I take the chance
Will you cross the line with me
And amend this circumstance?
Only this eternal truth can set you free

Like a counterfeit, I've had enough of this
I bought the dream and it let me down

Awake, now I see the clear horizon
It was just out of reach from the start

Pure escape
Pure escape
Pure escape
It's not too late
Lay me down in the field, I'm letting go
There is beauty to behold, a pure escape
Just take me now to a place where I am whole
To fill the void that I have known, it's not too late
I wanna take a risk, I wanna learn to live
To find the one thing that can't be sold

Awake, now I see the clear horizon
It was just out of reach from the start
The day we can see the clear horizon
Is the moment we save our broken hearts

The clear horizon
A pure escape
