Buttercup
Baby, just to let me down
You mess me around
You know worst of all
You never call
Baby, when you say you will
I love you still
I need you more than anyone darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up
But buttercup, don't break my heart
This happened again
You'll be over at ten
But you're late, I wait around and then
I rush to the door
I can't take anymore
It's not you, you let me down again
Oh baby, baby, try to find
A little time, and I'll make you happy
I'll be home, right beside the phone, waiting for you

And buttercup, don't break my heart
To you I'm a toy
But I could be the boy you adore
If you'd just let me know
And though you're untrue
I'm attracted to you all the more
Why do I need you so?

A little time and I'll make you happy
I'll be home
Right beside the phone
Waiting for you
