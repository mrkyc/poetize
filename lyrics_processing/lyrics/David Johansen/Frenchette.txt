I've been to France, so let's just dance
I get all the love I need in a luncheonette
In just one glance, so let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want
Or that I need, so let's just dance
You come on like it's all natural darling
But you know, oh it's really only naturalette
It's just like all of your leathers darling, they don't scare me
I know it's really only leatherette
I take it down, gonna wash it down
I scrub you on down in any old launderette
I can't get the kind of love that I want
So let's just dance, and I'll forget
Want you to come in my kitchen and not my kitchenette
Want you to come in my dining room, not my dinette yet
I can't get the kind of love
So let's just dance and I'll forget
I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
So let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
So let's just dance

I said, let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance

Remember how we were marveling darling, we were marvelous
Yeah we were marveling at The Marvelettes
We fell in love with Veronica
And every last one of The Ronettes
It sure got hot when Levi Stubbs
He got burned boys
Messing round with Bernadette
You call that love in French but it's just Frenchette
I've been to France, so let's just dance
I get all the love I need in a luncheonette
In just one glance, so let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want
Or that I need, so let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance
I said let's just dance
My doctor says to take it easy, baby
So let's just dance
My doctor said to take it easy, baby
So let's just dance
Let's just dance, baby
Let's just dance
I'm bound to take a little roll with you, honey
So let's just dance
I'm bound to take a little stroll with you, honey
So let's just dance
I said let's just dance
Well, darling, let's just dance
I said let's just dance
Come on and let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
