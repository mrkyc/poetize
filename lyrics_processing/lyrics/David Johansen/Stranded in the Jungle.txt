Well, I'm stranded in the jungle
I try to keep a date
When my little girl that's back in the States
I stranded in the jungle, I'm afraid and alone
I'm wondering how I'm gon' get that message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted by the girl on Lover's Lane?
I said, meanwhile, back in the States...

Baby, baby, let's make romance
I says your old time lover hasn't got a chance
I says he's stranded in the jungle, mad as he can be
So come on, pretty darling, just-a you and me
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Meanwhile, back in the jungle...
Well, the boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
I woke up kinda slow, my head starting to clear
I had a strange feeling I'm with cooking gear
I smelled something cooking, I looked around to see
That's when I found out they was cooking me
I said, "Great God! Jiggabunga! Let me out of here!"

So baby, baby, let's make romance
I said your old time lover hasn't got a chance
I said he's stranded in the jungle, mad as he can be

Meanwhile, back in the jungle...
Well, I jumped out the pot, I tried to get away
I'm frantic and worried 'bout what my baby might say
So I jump in the ocean, I starting to swim
But my chance of survival was getting mighty slim
I thumbed down a whale that was passing my way
I reached the States in about a half a day
I got to Lover's Lane and my soul was dead
My heart was gone and here's what I said
I said

Baby, baby, the man's no good
Whoa whoa, baby, baby, yeah
You shoulda understood
I says you can't trust me for as long as you please
So come on, pretty darling, like you used to be
Cause I love, cause I love you
Cause I love, cause I love you
Don't you know that I love you, baby
Yeah, I love you
Don't you, don't you know I love you, baby
I love, I love you, baby
