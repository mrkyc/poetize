I can still remember every song you played
Long ago when we were younger and we rocked the night away
How could I see a future then, where you would not grow old?
With such a fire in our belly, such a hunger in our souls
I guess I probably loved you when those words rolled off your tongue
Seemed that we were traveling under some old lucky sun
I know I couldn't save you and no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once will never be the same

Hey gonna roll away
Won't be coming round again
Hey with a song, I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away

I wandered in the wilderness, for a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season and every blessing has its cost
So I took what you left to me, put it to some use
Went looking for an answer with those three chords and the truth
I come down from the mountain, I come walking in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler when I had no more to lose
For he put me on that pathway, how could I refuse?
And I have spent my whole life out here working on the blues

So I carried on, you can't be haunted by the past
People come, people go, and nothing ever lasts
But I still think about you, wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place up there among the stars?
But down here under heaven, there never was a chart
To guide our way across this crooked highway of the heart
And if it's only all about the journey in the end
On that road I'm glad I came to know you, my old friend

Hey gonna fly way
Won't be coming round again
Hey with a song, I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away

I'll fly away
I'll fly away
