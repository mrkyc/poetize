Or be the doctor who's experiment
Finds the cure to what she's in here for
But right now treatments keep her sick in bed
That baseball cap never leaves her head
And while she sleeps I sit and dream
One day I asked her what do you wanna do when you grow up
I soon found out I wasn't dreaming big enough
She said, I'm gonna ride my bike, I'm gonna climb a tree
Gonna fly a kite, score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again
Take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair
She could question God, Lord, knows I would
She could just give up, I don't think I could be that strong or fight so long
How can such a little girl have such big faith
And even through the pain she still prays, saying, God will make a way
For me to ride my bike, for me to climb a tree
I'm gonna fly a kite, and score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again
And take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair that's down to my waist
Then I'll get it cut so they can make
Locks of love for some little girl who's just like me
Wonders if she'll ever be
You might also likeAble to ride her bike, able to climb a tree
Able to fly her kite, and score running little league
Able to go to school, make new friends, be able to run again
Take off her mask and just breathe in the air
And most of all she can braid her hair
