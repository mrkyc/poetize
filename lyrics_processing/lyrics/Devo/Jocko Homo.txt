They tell us that we lost our tails
Evolving up from little snails
I say it's all just wind in sails

Are we not men? We are Devo
Are we not men? D-E-V-O

We're pinheads now, we are not whole
We're pinheads all, Jocko Homo

Are we not men? We are Devo
Are we not men? D-E-V-O
Are we not pins? We are Devo

Monkey men all in business suits
Teachers and critics all dance the poot

Are we not men? We are Devo
Are we not men? D-E-V-O
Are we not pins? We are Devo
Are we not men? D-E-V-O

All together now, God made man, but he used the monkey to do it
Apes in the plan and we're here to prove it
I can walk like an ape, talk like an ape, I can do what monkey do
God made man, but a monkey supplied the glue
