Verse 1: I'm back on my shit with a new bitch fresh off a zip
With a new clip the blue diamonds dancin like a loose crip

Damn what you know about this
Hittin licks for a bag you don't know about this guns drawn in your face
You don't know about this hustlin with no bed you don't know about this homies in street got more tools than a chop shop
Had to ball through the cracks like a blacktop
Robbing houses open windows just like a laptop
