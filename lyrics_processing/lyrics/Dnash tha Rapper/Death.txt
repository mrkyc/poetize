(Verse)
I'm So Infatuated with death that I lose breath
& Stress hurting the left side of my chest
I can't Fathom, ghost of dead niggas ridin phantoms
Cause I Knew they couldn't live longer than they madames
Couple good kids on the block running rock
Hard headed moms said it, you sling them drugs you'll regret it
His eyes gleaming, cold Coke got em feinding
He prepared for scheming, I couldn't believe what I was seeing
Was a honor student the boy was named Keenan
They found him dead tied up bloody not breathing
Word on the street Keenan got caught thieving
Pops reading what's the reason his crew was very treason
That's why I keep my circle tight keep my shape right
Uh no new niggas, cause they bring fool niggas around my clique
That'll act quick buss quick make em run quick
Like a marathon, King Pins pushing pawns
Bang 1 one gone Bang 2 two gone
My heart (hart) ice cube better ride along away from me
Lonely nights flipping pages thru the Quran
Hearing bullets popping hot arizona Tucson!
I'm the don, nobody can't stop shawn
Cause these Cincinnati rappers is my God sons
Ha watching flashbacks of my friend
Almost see his final end

How much time do I got left? what am I doing with my time left
Cause I'm haunted by death cause I'm haunted by death (repeats twice)
Codiac
How much time a nigga really got left
Upset
Tryna fight death
Falling every step
But I get back up
Hope I don't mess up
Stress up
That's enough
Man life can be tough
But
Fuck all that crying shit
Fuck all that trying shit
I'm riding or dying it's
Gone feel like flying bitch
I might be the pilot bitch
My angels a lion its
Gone sound like I'm lying but
You gotta acknowledge it
Cause I put my time in this
Got no scholarships
I just want acknowledgment
If I got it say I got it then
If I got the pen
I gotta win
Fuck it, I just called that shit
If you feel offended by it
Fuck it, you should call it quits
Cause nigga I want all of this
To see my family balling man
Life's been fucking complicated
I'm just tired of falling man
Codiac start winning they'll find ways to make it problematic
Automatic, I get through them issues just to cause a panic
Blunt ended when I wanna get offensive
Call me Kenshin
Did I mention
I'm my only competition
What you missing
Just envision
The life that you see you living
If you driven
Just make sure you fucking gassed up
Life been moving fast huh
Things that you can't pass up
Hope that you don't crash uh
Gone right in a flash, you need to backup
Moral of this, hope you see where you going
You perceive what you knowing
Imma proceed with the flowing
It's Codiac

(Verse 2)
These Black masked goons they starving for my pockets
I'll rip the skins off these raccoons davie Crockett
Dying pleading for air I hear a enemy near
I'm panicking
Standing still like a mannequin
Sorry for not trying to be better
& for jet the letter
I promise I won't say gang gang but it's too late
I see the gun by my nose too late bang bang
