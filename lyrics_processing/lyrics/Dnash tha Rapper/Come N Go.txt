The money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
The money come n go like that
You know the bitches
Coming right back
Money come Money go
If you get it then you know
Enough money
Ain't enough money
I gotta get some more
Remember back when I was lil
Mama money running slow
Lights off bill due
Now the house is getting cold
Now the food is getting old
What the hell we finna do
Mama please get some money
I need some new pair of shoes
She said I ain't made of money
Go ahead & get yo own money
So I made a plan
To get out the hood
With the rapper money
I was sixteen
Bumping dot up in the whip
Heard money trees & realize
Money make you switch
So at twenty had my first job
One month called it quits
When back to the field
Landscaping long shifts
Aye but shit it wasn't enough
Yea my Mama kicked me out
Got a place with my bro
We was struggling on the low
He went to jail I got banned
Now without a home
Years later i got the money
Blood sweat & tears
For the money
The money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
The money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
You know the money
Come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
The money wasn't always there
But the love was
The pain covered by the pride
That we all share
Couldn't show no weakness
Don't let them see you fear
I remember waking up
Every morning
My eyes full of tears
I was shielded from it all
Yeah I was well aware
Woke up one morning
No water running
Underwear didn't have
A clean pair
Mama how am I gonna wash
Boy go to ya grandma house
We walked them streets
I didn't believe in defeat
Mama got that water on
The next day that told me
Never get down
On your situation
You just got have faith
Now days I look back on times
Like that & realize
How far i then came
But I also realize that
Money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
You know
The money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
It was proven
Can't keep the money
Can't save the money you know
The money come n go like that
You know them bitches
Coming right back
You know the money
Come n go like that
You know them bitches
