Can't even vibe at the party
Can't even lie to you, shorty
Obsessed with the money and Ferraris
Good turned bad, yeah I'm sorry

Can't even lie to you, shorty
Obsessed with the money and Ferraris
Good turned bad, know that I'm sorry
She sacrifice cash, Chanel for Ferraris
She's roaming with drug dealers, Probably off the Molly
I'm looking at the brown for Christmas
No Charlie,  caressing on my chest
On my tats, on my body
Too keen/Keene for bitches, stick and move like I'm Robbie
Loving on a thottie, thought you was different
Clouded all  my senses, cause I was ignorant
Good turned bad, yeah I'm sorry

Obsessed with the money and Ferraris

Obsessed with the money and Ferraris
And I can't trust no one
And I can't love no one
All these girls all the same
Purple passion for the pain
And I thought you're the one
The one for me in my life
Oh, oh, oh, my life oh woah yeah
Life real heavy right now
Give me space like a Maybach
Star ceiling peace is my taste
Life is what you make it
So why you wanna take it from me?
Every day I stay cunning
Hate when I spend money
But every dark day eventually becomes sunny
Remember winter days in the cold nose stayed runny
Good turned bad, but for better or worse
I'm just an unseen star in the universe
Good turned bad, yeah I'm sorry
Can't even vibe at the party

Good turned bad, yeah I'm sorry
Party, party, party
Obsessed with the money and Ferraris
Woah, woah, woah
Shit really crazy like
How you can be in bliss one moment
And the next turmoil
How illusions can be shattered in the blink of an eye
Like, you thought you knew this person but
You really didn't
How something good can turn into bad
