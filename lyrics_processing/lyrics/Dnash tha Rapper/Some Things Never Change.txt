Dnash tha rapper Verse 1
Lookin' at the World
& I Know It Will Never change
Kids Dying, Bum lying on the floor For sum change
Troy Ignorant Flexing Louie V & Chains
Next Morning, Got Robbed & shot in his Brain
Left Behind a lil sister brother & a mother
They love em like no other
& they Cried Undercovers
Lives goin' strong but, Black Souls Long gone
Will that Runaway ever Phone Home?
Like Et, My brain is larger than capacity
My mentality Grows Exponentially
Being smart takes time
Having sense take mind
Only time we blow up when its mines in my area
Some things never change but i broke the criteria
So i wasn't never a slave to my environment
I Won't go into Confinement
The purpose can i find it
Fuck the world i might find a ditch so i can lie in it
Started at the projects end up making city projects
Shoutout to oprah Winfrey
He was poor without a cup then went & found a star bucks
Shout out to howard
She was homeless couldn't afford a swiss roll
Now she the biggest star in movie roles
Shoutout to halle berry
I know life is scary but that ain't stop jerry
Or Mariah Carey denzel curry

Until we make a change
Until we make that change
Dnash Tha Rapper Verse 2
Now lets get back to the basics
We still got racists in southern places
They dont love other races
Some people kill for color in most cases
If you gay i can't judge you
Love who you love
Don't let the public change you
You are who u are
Lets Break the cycle
Heal the world just like Michael
Joseph was sold into slavery
Then became an important figure in history
Some things Never change shit is a mystery
Maybe cause jealousy causes misery then
Misery causes pain
Then reminds lock in the membrane
That means, hatred then becomes contagious
Fuck yo opinions you know i gotta say this
Anything from a killer or bully can change
