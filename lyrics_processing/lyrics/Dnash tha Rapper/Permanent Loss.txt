Think you was apart of me
For real oh no
I think that I almost lost
Apart of me for real
And you don't ever
Think you was apart of me
For real
Let me tell you about the game
Let me tell you about the game
If you ain't starving
Eatin bread with yo fam
You ain't gang
I started from the soil
Remember everyone ain't loyal
Hope you know that
Now you know that
I'm one the realest they
Ever witness manifest
I don't need the Christmas
Bitch you know
I'm back up in this
Cut off bitches
Now I'm back to business
New to the scene
Like who is that
Hit 100k how you do like that
I sip that brandy I sip that rum
No Voodoo but I don't
Get too attached
Fuck that bitch
She a permanent loss
Gotta take a L to become a boss
Apply yo life
With much persistence
Grow yourself and
Love from a distance
I been down bad
Can't even cap
Reminsice times
I can't get back
Pain in my forever trapped
Lost friends and family
I can't get back
I been through this

If she acting flaw
I gotta cut her like that
She bitch about this
She bitch about that
Hmm can't fuck with that

Damn why she never listen
Texting mad
Just to build the tension
Please stay out my mentions
Lil shit just to gain attention
Yeah I fuck with the bitch
Cause her cheeks sweet
Like Sandie can't fuck with you
If you can't be fancy
If you do I go ghost like Danny
Why these lames
Hit my line like this
When I was broke
They ain't act like this
I do me and I mind my biz
Dusty bums hurt my sinuses
Don't ever think
You was apart of me for real
Oh no I think that I
Almost lost apart of me
Yea you know
Let me tell you about the game
Let me tell you about the game
If you ain't starving
Eatin bread with yo fam
You ain't gang
I started from the soil
Remember everyone ain't loyal
Hope you know that
Now you know that
Don't ever think you
Was apart of me
For real oh no
I think that I almost lost
Apart of me for real
And you don't ever
Think you was apart of me
For real

Think you was apart of me
