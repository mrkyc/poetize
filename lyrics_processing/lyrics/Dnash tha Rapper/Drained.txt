Dnash Tha Rapper:
I Been Prayin' for some Blessings
Cause Lately I been Stressing
Over life & them Demons
& this life is what im seeing
But i do love, all the Fan love
For a few hugs, they Might do drugs
Cause my life is feeling empty
& my haters wanna tempt me
& these hoes tryin' play me
& these kimmys wanna date me
But i told her i ain't shady
Billie jean is on my line
Leave me alone that my baby
I never fuckes are you crazy
Hannah Reid: They wanna see me fall, they wanna take it all yeah I know, yeah I know
They already took it all, but I don't care at all, yeah I know, yeah I know
They kick me then they beat me till I'm laying on the floor, yeah I know, yeah I know
Up, down, left, right, good, bad, black or white I know, I don't care at all

Hex.exe: questionin & doubtin' slippin up & drowin'
I'm not even floatin' tryin get up on the ropes yea
What am i suppose to do? In my focus view
Not envy in the choosing few, who can fit up in golden shoe
So confused,they fuck up perception finally know truth
So take it to the judge yea,so many questions
So hit them with the request, promise i gotta address
Just keep it 100 & blessed yea
