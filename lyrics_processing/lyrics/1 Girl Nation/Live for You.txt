Trying to feel dope in my brand new high-tops
And my brain can't explain all the ways i feel You You Yeah
Sixteen so mean in my school day
All the kids laugh but I love You anyway
Everything disappears when I put my mind on You You yeah
Been Through Alot Of Games But I Ain't Mad At It
Cause You Make My Light Up Just Like Matches
If Only I Could Find The Words To Say To Say To Say
Can't Think Can't Speak When I Feel Your Grace
Cause You Love Me Up To Outter Space
You Really Blow My Mind Like Dynamite
And I'm Always Gonna Live For You
I Live For You I Live You
LA LA LA LA LA LA live For You
I Live For You I Live For You

I'm like a work of art made in Your hands
Van Gough couldn't draw like You
Help me understand that
Heaven ain't far away when You shine Your light on me me me
You tell me all the things i need to hear
Cause my heart ain't always in the clear but
Though You seem far away
You always keep Your hand on me me me
