Oh, oh, oh oh oh

I know we been going through some changes
We two different people, now it's time to face it
You tried to give your heart to me and I ain't take it
I know your flaws and I ain't ever tryna change you
It's my fault (ay)
I miss your heart (ay)
And the way you talk (and the way you talk)
And the way you walk (and the way you walk)

Aye
Like say it ain't so
I know this shit ain't true
You swear I was out cheatin' I was only in the stew
You tried to get me back so you start fuckin' with a dude
And then you left me in the back but I ain't 
Just hold it down until the love is break
I asked if you was riding' then you just started to hesitate
I looked you in the eyes and said we moving' at a steady pace
The way you keep me sane
I swear it feel like I can levitate
Yeah yeah
And I don't know just what to do
I know it's been some time but girl I still believe in you
Just think bout' all the love and all the shit that we've been through
Let's try the shit again girl you know I'm all for you
Yeah you know that shit the truth (that shit the truth)
Yeah, girl you know that shit the truth (girl you know that shit the truth)
Yeah, you know I'm all for you (girl you know I'm all for you)
And you know I'm still for you (girl I'm still for you)
