I know Alcorn State chick
To be honest she the reason I don't date chicks
Look, ass fat but the face hit
The only reason we talk is cause she can take dick
And I'm a pro at the backshot
And I'm a Mac with the ladies like a laptop (Hey)
Niggas ain't shit what they rap about
While they took the one way I took the cash route
Hold up, wait till I cum
I might fuck around put my dick on your tongue
I ain't gonna lie, I thought you was the one
You took me for granted now I think I'm done, yeah

Now slow it down and make it whine for me
She screaming she ain't got the time for me
But you my main, ain't got no sides baby
We can go and take a flight, let's go to my city
I love to sip just like it's my city
Now let's get litty, pass me my Henny
She lightskin but with the fine titties
Now baby, can you take this ride with me?
And I won't even lie, girl it's you that I want
I found me a vibe, girl I can't even stunt
Let's get shit acquainted, gon' light up this blunt
If they fuckin with you, I slide with the pump
You might also like
Let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me goin' crazy
Turn me on, Turn me on

Trap, trapmoneybenny
Had to settle for the ends, yeah i know you like the Henny
You be mean muggin everybody, never lookin friendly
What you need? Yes I got it girl,  bout a penny

She ride the dick just like a dirtbike
She eat the wood just like a termite
I put the spice back into her life
Now all she want is me, come and fix up her life

Let me see what the waist do
The way you like to ride, can't nobody replace you
Flexin on your ex and every nigga that played you
You sittin on your knees waitin for that facial

Girl let me hold you

That you've been my go to
I'm here like i'm 'posed to
Let me hold you
Girl, girl let me hold you

When I hold you?
So you gon' whine for me, whine for me
Baby can you take the time to me, time for me?
Never will you drop it down for me, down for me
Yeah, you gotta spin around for me, 'round for me
