She wasn't into me
She heard I'm gettin a bag, I guess she switched up her energy
I know I'm makin em mad, but I gotta shit on my enemies
I know I'm makin em mad, but I gotta shit on my enemies

She tryna fuck cause she heard that I'm poppin'
Won't get treated like an option
See a bad bitch and I pop it
See a fast whip and I cop it
Honestly I do not picture me stoppin
Stuffin blue faces in the wallet
Now when I want it, I cop it
Louie bag, couple k, I'mma drop it
She tryna fuck cause she heard that I'm poppin'
Won't get treated like an option
See a bad bitch and I pop it
See a fast whip and I cop it
Honestly I do not picture me stoppin
Stuffin blue faces in the wallet
Now when I want it, I cop it
Louie bag, couple k, I'mma drop it

Told my chick if she down, then I got her
Have her drippin in designer
I'mma dress you down in Prada
And I put that on my momma
I told Rock to grab the choppa
We ain't tellin no, your honor
We just countin up the commas
If you hated this is karma (Yeah)
She never fucked with a rapper like me so I'm tellin you this shit is different to her
Now I pull up in a foreign, remember them days in the kitchen was whippin the work
I be so high off the gas and the lean, I been mixing the dirty and been sippin the purp
My momma told me these hoes be for everybody, man I guess I should listen to her

Now I just sit back and laugh
Diamonds play tag

Shooters gon blast
I tell em put down the mask
Walk through your crib with the mask, aye
Know I do not think 'bout the past, aye
Hop in the whip, do the dash, aye
Prayin to God ion crash, aye
Lately been thinkin bout cash, aye
Put the city on my back, aye
