Verse 1:
I gotta' lotta' things to share with you boy
I'm checking for ya', call me baby sometime, I'll tell it to ya
I'm feelin' all this chemistry between you and me
I can't sleep at night I toss and turn and turn
Lookin' for ya' dreams of you by my side, I'm talking to ya
What's this
What's this
I feel
I feel
I'm curious, 'gotta see
Chorus:
How many ways can I show you how I feel
Let you know my love is real
I'll be the girl for you I will . . 
Give you all of me
I wanna' hear how it sounds when you say my name
Boy for that I'll do anything
And if you need or you want for more
Tell me how many ways
Verse 2:
I'm waiting for the day, you say to me, tellin' me
I'm the one you need and you'll always take care of me
And you take me by the hand and tell me 'Baby it's alright, its okay'
Then you and me can finally live out all our fantasies
Layin' on the beach - fall asleep in the West Indies
Listenin' to sounds of pleasure
