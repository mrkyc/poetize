And all my sister girls
Um
Yeah
She was five foot nine
And she didn't wear shoes
Body like a goddess
Walk by her own rules
Reign supreme over her ghetto kingdom
Possess interlectually wisdom
Any man she met wanted a piece of her
Qualifying things in hopes to creep with her
Talk like twenty-five
Look like twenty-three
Who could believe the sister's only fourteen
Hold On
If You Can
Cross Your Legs
Forget that man
Someday
You'll look back and understandddd
Sista Girl
You're only a child
Walkin' around, sista girl
Don't let 'em rock your world
Sista Girl
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee
Sista Girl
You're Only
Fourteen
In retrospect he wasn't really her type
But he was tall with big hands and the sexiest eyes
So she fell for him and in the blink of an eye
He became part of her for the rest of her life
Four months later considering her plight
Belly's gettin' bigger she saw the plus sign
So she she calls him up hoping he'll easy her pain
Don't remember her name
Hold On
If You Can
Cross Your Legs
Forget that man
Someday
You'll look back and understandddd
