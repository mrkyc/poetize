But always holding onto the past
I built these walls around me but somehow You have found me
Now I know a joy that will last
'Cause in this love You gave amazing grace
And healed my broken soul
And from Your mighty throne You held me close
And made this wounded whole
You could write a note across the sky
Make heaven testify 'cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing Your praise
So I wonder how an extraordinary God could love an ordinary me
I'll never understand it, how Your love has set me free
I gotta know how can the King of Glory care so much about me?
That You would choose to give up Your life
With every changing season You love me without reason
Everything I have You provide
I fall on my knees and give You praise
I will worship You alone
You are the only God, the highest power
I live to make You known

Make heaven testify 'cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing Your praise
Oh, I wonder how an extraordinary God could love an ordinary me
And though I don't deserve this gift of mercy and abounding grace
You blessed me with it anyway
I'm not ashamed to tell the world about You
That You're more than enough for an ordinary girl like me
You could write a note across the sky
Make heaven testify 'cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing
You could write a note across the sky
Make heaven testify
You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing Your praise
I will say that an extraordinary God, He loves an ordinary me
You could write a note across the sky
Make heaven testify
You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing Your praise
I can say that an extraordinary God can love an ordinary girl like me
You could write a note across the sky
Make heaven testify
You could make the mountains shout Your name
