Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah

Imagine seeing him on the town holding another hand
She's staring me down, so I figure that he told her who I am
But it don't matter either way, what they do or say, 'cause ain't nothing changed
He's standing with her, but his soul is calling out my name

In my mind, I'll always be his lady
In my mind, I'll always be his girl

Saw his mama just the other day
Said he'd been through a spell (Well, well, well)
Had a bad break up, thinks he's on his way up
"It's hard to tell"
She said, "I think it'd do some good if you call him every now and then
You see he's been through some things and I'm thinking he could really use a friend"

In my mind, I'll always be his lady (I'll always be)
In my mind, I'll always be his girl

Only time will tell if I'm his lady
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl
You might also like
They say if you love something, you've got to let it go, oh-oh
And if it comes back, then it means so much more
But if it never does, at least you will know
That it was something you had to go through to grow

In my mind, I'll always be his lady (I'll always be his lady)
In my mind, I'll always be his girl (I don't care what nobody else says)

Only time will tell if I'm his lady (Oh, yes, it will, yes, it will)
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl

Always feel this way about you, always be your lady
In my heart (In my mind), in my heart (In my mind)
In my soul (In my mind), baby, you should know
You're in my thoughts (In my mind), you're in my prayers (In my mind)
I'll always (In my mind) keep you there
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
