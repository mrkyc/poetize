You said you loved me
Said I was everything you wanted in a woman
You said you needed me
You said no place on earth is happier than our home
You said ain't nothing wrong with ya'
You said you didn't want to talk about it
You said 'baby I'm tired'
Must have been tired of me cause you left me hangin'

You never said goodbye to me you just left
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
Sent me a letter with no return address
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
If you wanted me I wouldn't have to guess
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
If you can't find the right words to express how you feel
I think I'm hearing what's not being said

You said, but now its time for show and tell
Sent me a letter saying you still care
You say you ain't in love with no one else
And now I'm living everyday blaming my self
So if you have a reason
And you ain't speaking up
Why can't you just be a man
And tell me I ain't good enough
No I wasn't dreaming
I know some days things got rough
You must have been tired of me
To just leave me hangin
You might also like

What you're saying to me I don't want to believe
I translated your language to find out what you mean
I don't think this is how we should communicate
How could you take your love and throw it all away
I guess that was yesterday
You're hurting me today
Cause you said goodbye...
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
Sent me a letter with no return address
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
If you wanted me I wouldn't have to guess
So I think I'm hearing what's not being said
If you can't find the right words to express how you feel
I think I'm hearing what's not being said
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna say goodbye, my babe?
You sent me a letter
But it didn't say nothing, baby
If you can't find the right words to express how you feel
I think I'm hearing what-
I think I'm hearing what-
