Last night I had a dream
And I couldn't sleep, what was wrong with me?
Thinking 'bout the fight we had
And it makes me mad that I'd go off like that
I wish that I could take it back
So baby, I apologize if we'll survive
Is there a compromise that we can find
'Cause I'll be thinking you're insensitive
But it's your language
It's just different from mine

Understand the nature of a man
And realize that were just different
(I understand) I understand if I be me, and you be you
We know love, will pull us through
Understand the nature of a man (I understand)

I'll be there for you
Baby, through and through
I'll be you're candied yams, ya know I love ya, boo
(I'm not trying to be the man)
Naw, ain't got that kinda nerve
Ain't trying to role reverse
I know I wear the purse
For me its not about the 
That's not what I want
It's you're love I want
It's from you I want
All the lil character flaws, it's part of natures law
From the beginning of time

Understand the nature of a man
And realize that were just different
I understand (I understand) if I be me, and you be you
We know love, will pull us through
Understand the nature of a man (I understand)
The nature of
Of a man
I understand
You're the creamy part of my chocolate star
That's what you are
You stole my heart
You're fragrance and your melody
I can't describe what you are for me my baby, my baby
You do that thing for me

Understand the nature of a man
And realize that were just different
I understand if I be me, and you be you
We know love, will pull us through
