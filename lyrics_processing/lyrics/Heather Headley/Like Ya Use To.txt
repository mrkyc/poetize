This morning when you woke up I
Had breakfast cooked with everything you like
But you didn't even give the eggs a try
And you left without kissing me goodbye
Used to wake up happy everyday
With the glow of love upon your face
But now that shine has gone away
Has someone else taken my place
Bridge:
You need to stop stop
Asking me to cook and giving me the look
That you were turned on by me
Stop stop coming home to me stop hanging
In the streets instead of being where you should
Stop stop looking in my face when you would come in late
I said I know you way too good
Stop stop fooling me around boy if you ain't down
And you want to leave you know you could
Chorus:
You dont love good baby like ya used to
Hold me like ya used to
Do the things ya used to
You might also likeYou dont touch me baby like ya used to
Say the things ya used to
Tell me are you used to me
You dont love good baby like ya used to
Kiss me like ya used to
Tell me what ya used to
Say you dont miss me baby like ya used to
Love me like ya use to
Maybe your too used to me
Yesterday I wore my favorite jeans
The ones you love to see on me
But you didn't even give a second look
Guess someone else had your attention took
Even did my hair in a brand new style
To see if a change would bring a smile
And I might as well have stayed the same
Cause you still didn't say a thang
Bridge:
You need to stop stop
Asking me to cook and giving me the look
That you were turned on by me
Stop stop coming home to me stop hanging
In the streets instead of being where you should
Stop stop looking in my face when you would come in late
I said I know you way too good
Stop stop fooling me around boy if you ain't down
And you want to leave you know you could
Chorus 2x
La la la la 8x
