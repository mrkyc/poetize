So blurred
So unclear
Then suddenly eyes focus and realize that
This man should be here
It's funny how there's no remorse in the moment
But after it's over you wish you could disown it
And as you get up to tell this stranger to leave
The love of your life walks in and sees . . . everything
Chorus:
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to
And it's reality now
Pictures of him and your baby
Smashed in broken glass all on the floor
With his suitcase in one hand, your little girl's hand in the other
You hear him say "Mommy don't live us no more"
And it cuts like a knife but you can't blame him either
You're a mother, you're a wife, but you're also a cheater
Ooh girl, one silly moment of lust
Just cost you everything that you've ever loved
You might also likeChorus:
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to
Bridge:
Oh, the clouds are rolling in
As you prepare to face this punishment and suffer the consequence
Such a price to pay
Was it really worth it?
And you fight back tears
As you watch him take the only thing you ever truly loved away
The tears in her eyes as she waves goodbye
Slowly kills you inside
Chorus:
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
