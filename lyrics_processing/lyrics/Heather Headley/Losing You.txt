Cause you appeared to be the perfect gentleman
You would open doors and make those daily calls
Just to check and see if I needed anything at all
You used to be concerned
Then things changed suddenly
And when something went wrong
You were never there to see
When I would tell you that I need comforting
You would tell me you were kickin' it with "Ray and them."
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Even though I cried a little
And I tried a little
I learned what a good woman really needs
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Now that I'm over the pain
I found love again
With a man that makes me so happy
You would get mad at me over stupid things
Now why would I be going through the pockets of your Jeans?
I had suspicions and I felt something was goin' on
You blame me for cheatin'
But it was you doin' something wrong
They say that guilt will break ya down
And lately you've been calling, but it's too late now
And I just wanna' thank you for leaving when you did
'Cause I never woulda' fell in love with him

The best thing that ever happened to me
Even though I cried a little
And I tried a little
I learned what a good woman really needs
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Now that I'm over the pain
I found love again
With a man that makes me so happy
Thank you for the silly arguments
You made me realize
And the times you tried to kill my self-confidence
Now I know the reasons why
I appreciate you leaving me when you did
Cause you made me understand
Cause I never woulda' saw the great man that I found in him
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Even though I cried a little
And I tried a little
I learned what a good woman really needs
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Now that I'm over the pain
I found love again
