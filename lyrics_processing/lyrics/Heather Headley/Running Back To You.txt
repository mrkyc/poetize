How can You think of me when I do things my way?
Turning my back from You, the one who loved me first
Having my own desires, renewing my worldly thirst
You told me You loved me and I should make up my mind
You tell me come back now, but I keep wasting time
Feeling so very weak, You say I can be strong
But I feel I've gone too far, but You tell me to come home
You love me still and I know this is real
And I am running back to You, I see You're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide and I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me and I am running back to You
Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own?
You told me You could keep me but I've turned it away
I failed You so much now I don't know what to say
Using the same excuse that I'm only human
But You tell me You have been there
And hold your nail scarred hands so I can see
Now I know I am free
'Cause You're standing there for me and I am running back to You
Why do I go away when I know I am no good?
I have taken advantage of Your love and grace
Forgive me Lord and take me back home, take me back home
You might also like'Cause I'm running to You, Jesus please take me home
You see I'm tired of pain and I don't like fear
But Lord, I gotta be more sincere
And I am running back to You, I see You're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide and I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me and I am running back to You
I never should have left Your side, no, no
