Find he was walking out with nothing left to say
Just determined to live a life without her
He left a note she couldn't read
Blinded by tears, she felt she couldn't breathe
As she pondered she wondered what to do
All I could say was
Give it just a little while, just a little while
Things will get better
Give it just a little while, just a little while
The angels will do their thing
Just a little while, just a little while
You'll feel like smiling again
She cried the tears, picked up a laugh
Still had to be a mother while she was not his wife
As the years passed she prayed and asked and he answered
And all I can say is
It's only been a little while, just a little while
And it's already better
It's only been a little while, just a little while
See, the angels are doing their thing
It's been a little while, just a little while
You might also likeHe may never apologize for the pain and broken heart
But she'll always remember how she loved him
And so the day she forgives him
Now that she's old she chooses to say
That she will not complain, but thank God for everything
Now her kids are grown and went on their own, but makes her happy
And deep in her heart she still thinks of him
She wonders how he is and does he love her, still
In a simple way, she's rebuild a life that's lovely
I just remind her
I know it's been a little while, just a little while
But things sure got better
I know it's been a little while, just a little while
The angels did their thing
It's been a little while and we're all so much better
I know it's been a little while, just a little while
