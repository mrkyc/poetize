I got a song in my heart
Let me start with I'm over you
Still it can't hurt me to say very plain . . . I think about you
And the laughs and the jokes and the times that I shared with you
I got this feeling for reminiscing
Wanted to take that trip down memory lane
But what is missing, is that you're not here to sit down with me
So I'm thinking these beautiful things all by myself
And what's on my mind is...
Chorus:
Back when it was
Simple as breathing
Just the two of us
We were happy together it was
Easy to be in
Our relationship
You remember when
You used to say you loved me so
Promised one time to never go away
And now you're gone
Verse 2:
The smile that you left me with, is the same smile I've kept on wearing
The smile's not so much tied to you
More tied to what we spent sharing
Simple little things
But it was all those simple little things that pleased me the most...
Need I remind you 'bout the good times baby
There were good times from the start
Good times in my heart
A heart that never lied
Remember back in '99
When we snuck into the neighbor's pool and went for a dip
There were good times in the rain
Good times everyday
Good times Heaven knows
Remember that dirty little joke
Made us laugh all night long

Easy to be in
Our relationship
You remember when
You used to say you loved me so
Promised one time to never go away
And now you're gone
Bridge
The joy you left me with, nothing stronger since
What we did together
I ain't felt nothing better since that time
Those were the days
The nights
The minutes
The seconds
That you were mine
Chorus
Back when it was
Simple as breathing
Just the two of us
We were happy together it was
Easy to be in
Our relationship
You remember when
You used to say you loved me so
Promised one time to never go away
