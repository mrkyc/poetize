I'm sure You got better things You need to do
But I've been real bad, but You already know that, don't You?
And that that way ain't easy
I did some things wouldn't have done to me
Things that would make an ordinary man yell, fight and scream
But no, no, not him, he just left without a scene
That's just a man he is
And I understand why he set me free
But I want him back home, so I'm begging You, please
Jesus, you know I can't live, live without him
He's more than I need
Since he's been gone I can't breathe, breathe without him
Have mercy on me
You can work miracles, this I know
I don't care how You do it, just bring him back home
Jesus, you know I believe You can bring him back to me
You can bring him back to me
I found myself more in a compromise
But I never meant to hurt my angel
And before you know it, I was telling lies
That's just the way it was
You might also likeI don't know how I could ever go on
I did my man harm and that day's gone
Jesus, you know I can't live, live without him
He's more than I need
Since he's been gone I can't breathe, breathe without him
Have mercy on me
If You walked on water and made that man see
Then You got the power, make him come home to me
Jesus, You know I believe You can bring him back to
These arms that will hold him
And love him like I know that I should
Can You bring him back, cause I'm nothing without him
I'm promise this time I'll be good, I'll be better than I can
Jesus, you know I can't live, live without him
He's more than I need
Since he's been gone I can't breathe, breathe without him
Have mercy on me
You tell the winter to turn into spring
You do it, if You tell him to love me again
Jesus, You know I believe You can bring him back to me
You can bring him back to me
So listen, in the meantime
I'll be waiting by the door
Sitting by the phone
I'll be right here until You bring my man back home
Bring him home, back
Bring him back to me
You just bring him back
You can walk on water, make blind men see
Isn't that hard, you can do this for me
Bring him home, back
You bring him home, back
Bring him home, back
I need You to tell him I'll be real, real good
So, so, so, so good
I'll do anything
I'm begging You, please, down on my knees
I just want my man home
I'll stay on my knees
Bring him home, back
