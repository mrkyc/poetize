Have fun, girl talk, talk real loud
Then I get approached by a man that probably didn't know I demand respect
All I wanna do is your offers necklace and brag about his big vet house in Texas
So I told myself it's time to make my exit, then he had the nerve to grab my arm and say
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
I feel like creeping myself, rolling my eyes, snapping my fingers, then I'll be alive
He thinks I could be his extra on the side, he must be one of those guys
One of those guys that think I should be mesmerized by his car or I could be impressed so easily
Instead of being strong and classy. You don't know me
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
You might also likeI could've been yours so easily
'cause you're the kind of guy to stay with me
But you played yourself, try to tie that lie with someone else
Not that kind of girl, who would come around you just because you called
I need a man who can love me even without the little things he could get me
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
Hey mama, won't you, won't you
Come here to bar, I won't stop you
Hey mama, come here, sit down
Let me holla at you, got something for ya'
If you play your cards right played
Treat me like I wanna be treated
Maybe one day I'll sing you a little song
And say
Hey papa, won't you come here to mama, I won't stop you
Hey papa, come here, sit down, let me holla at you, got some for you
Hey papa, won't you, won't you come here to mama, I won't stop you
Hey papa, come here, sit down, let me holla at you, got something for you
Hey mama, hey mama
