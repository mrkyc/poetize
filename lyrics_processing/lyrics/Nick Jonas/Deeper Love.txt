Tryna find the words to say
I got a feeling that you know what's on my mind
So I let you lead the way
'Cause you take me to a perfect paradise

Wherever you go, I'll go
'Cause we're in it together
Forever, always, hold on
'Cause it only gets better

I want a deeper love, yeah
I wanna know what it be like
To know what I'm believing
I wanna find it in your eyes
I want a deeper love, yeah
I wanna feel it every night
I want a deeper love
A deeper love

You pull me closer to the truth
And now I'm hanging on to every word you say
There's a way your body moves
I can feel you from a million miles away (You know, woah)
