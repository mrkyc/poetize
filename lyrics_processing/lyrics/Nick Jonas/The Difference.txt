You never had a love like this
Baby, not this kind
You ain't never been touched like this
Feel it down your spine
I ain't never been one to miss
Don't plan on starting tonight
I think I could be the perfect fit in your life (In your life)

Yeah, you're looking for love
You say nothing's good, good enough
You've been broken like way too much
Let me fix you, baby

You're way too uptight
You keep it on the low, but you know your body wants mine
Why you tryna go, when you know I'll never waste your time? Yeah
If you don't feel the difference when you walk away
Well, you're gonna learn today
I'll show you the difference, baby (Woo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo)
I'll show you the difference, baby (Woo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo)

I'll love you like a grown ass man, pushing all your buttons
I'll let you in on all my plans, you might learn something (Might learn something)
And you might be surprised what you get out of it
These clothes keep you confined, so just get out of 'em
You might also like
