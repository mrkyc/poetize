I'm, I'm good at wastin' time
I think lyrics need to rhyme and you're not askin'
But I'm tryin' to grow a mustache
I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise, it smells like feet to me
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love it when you say my name

If you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows if we're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain and my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusin', at times confusin'
Slightly amusin', introducing me

Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da

I never trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word "dude"
As a noun or an adverb or an adjective
And I, I never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
I love the sound of violins
And makin' someone smile

If you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows if we're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain and my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusin', at times confusin'
Possibly amusin', introducing me

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time
So, if you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows if we're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain and my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusin', at times confusin'
Hopefully amusin', introducing me

Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
