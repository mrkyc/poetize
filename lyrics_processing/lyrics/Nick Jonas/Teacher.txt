So frustrated, girl, you make me wanna shout
And it's only the start of the night
And I'm like

When you wear that dress
Oh my heart, it just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong? Why you do me wrong?
When you act like this
It's like your momma never taught you how to love
So let me teach ya

Take one step forward, then we take a couple back
But you know I'm gonna keep up the pace (Ooh)
This game we're playing, make me wanna break the rules
