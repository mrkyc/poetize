Oh, damn, oh, damn, oh, damn, I'm so perplexed
With just one breath, I'm locked in
Oh, damn, oh, damn, oh, damn, I'm so perplexed
Oh, that it's almost shockin'
I know, I know you know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, yeah
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

'Cause if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't goin' backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause "space" was just a word made up
By someone who's afraid to get too

Close, ooh-ooh
Oh, so close, ooh-ooh
I want you close, ooh-ooh
'Cause "space" was just a word made up
By someone who's afraid to get
Close, ooh-ooh
Oh, so close, ooh-ooh
I want you close, ooh-ooh
Oh, I want you close, then close ain't close enough, no
You might also like
Oh, man, oh, man, I am not
Really known for ever bein' speechless (Yeah, yeah)
But now, but now, somehow
My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, ah (Oh, babe)
I'm keepin' cool while you keep smilin'
Sayin' all the things I'm thinkin' (Oh, baby, yeah)
Oh, man, oh, man, I am like you
So I want proof I'm what you're feelin' (Oh)

Because if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't goin' backwards (Goin' backwards), won't ask for space
'Cause "space" is just a word made up
By someone who's afraid to get too

Close, ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, so close, ooh-ooh
I want you close, ooh-ooh (Yeah, baby)
'Cause "space" was just a word made up
By someone who's afraid to get
Close, ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, so close, ooh-ooh
I want you close, ooh-ooh (I want you)
Oh, I want you close, then close ain't close enough, no
'Cause if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't goin' backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause "space" was just a word made up
By someone who's afraid to get too
Close

Close, ooh-ooh (Close, babe)
Oh, so close, ooh-ooh (Oh, baby)

Oh, I want you close, then close ain't close enough, no

Oh, I want you close, then close ain't close enough, no
