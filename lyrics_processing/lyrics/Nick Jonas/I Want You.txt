Motherfucker never loved me
Motherfucker never loved me
So I'll take it back, what I deserve
'Cause I deserve better
And you say you never need me
Yeah, you say you're gonna leave me
Well, I'd like to see, you try to be

'Cause I ain't gonna let you go
Moving on, gotta take control
Staying strong, but it's taking hold
Can't go back, never going back, back, back

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you, and nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I've got nothing to lose
I want you, and if I can't have you
Then no one will

So when you think about me
I know you think about me
Does it scare you that, I know everything
And I won't keep quiet?
You got the key to my heart, yeah
I got the key to your apartment
Would you let me in, or I'm breaking in

'Cause I ain't gonna let you go
Moving on, gotta take control
Staying strong, but it's taking hold
Can't go back, never going back, back, back

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you, and nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I've got nothing to lose
I want you, and if I can't have you

Oh, if I see you with someone else
I would lose my head
If I had your love for myself
Don't know what I'd do (Don't know what I'd do)

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you (I want you), and nothing else will do
I'll never let you go
(Na-na-na-na-na)
Hey (Na-na-na-na-na)

I want you

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you, and nothing else will do, baby
No one acting confused
I've got nothing to lose
I want you, and if I can't have you (If I can't have you)
Oh, if I see you with someone else (Someone else)
I would lose my head
If I had your love for myself
Don't know what I'd do (I don't know what I'd do, baby)
I want you and no one else
