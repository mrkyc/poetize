Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spark that was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?
I've been looking for love in all the wrong places
You too? You too?

I don't like the way you went and told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?

Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spark that was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool
And I hope that she gives you, all the things that you deserve
That's true, that's true
You might also like
Listen, I don't like the way you went and told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool

Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spark that was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

Had to cut it off and we know why (Ahn)
I'm in love with myself, cold inside (Inside)
Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try
More woman than I should've in a century
Bitches on the side like a Kennedy
Starting to drain all my energy
I love it, shoot the frame like an enemy, uh
At the same time, and I can't lie
Too many girls for the way that I rock the bassline
You got addicted to the seas of the bassline
Let's see how you're gonna do with the back and forth fameline (Ooh)
After all the shit we been through (No, ooh)
I play The Roxy, I ain't 'bout to guestlist you (N-no-ooh)
And I know I'm talking shit, it ain't fair
Hate is just a fancy way saying that I care
Remember I told you, I need you (Hey!) (Ooh)
Remember the spark that was there (Spark that) (Was there)
All of the words that I'm saying (Words that I'm saying)
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care" (Saying "I care")
Remember I told you, I need you (Ooh, ooh)
Remember the spark that was there (No, no, no) (Ooh)
All of the words that I'm saying (Oooh) (Words that I'm saying)
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"
