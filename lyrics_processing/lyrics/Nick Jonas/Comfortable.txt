My faith in you is very comfortable for me
My faith in you, baby, is very comfortable for me

Never trust a door 'til it's open
Never trust a heart 'til it's broken
I know you're the one who can break the mold, the mold
Iverson was right, it's only practice
I don't need a mic cause the fact is
I'm living my life, in solid gold, gold

So who are you catering to?
Who you fucking with when there ain't nobody fucking with you?
I told you I knew you before you even knew that you were you
Yeah, I know you better than that, I know you better

'Cause my faith in you is very comfortable for me
My faith in you, baby, is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through-ough-ough-ough
Until you're comfortable for me
My faith in you, yeah, is very comfortable for me

Never met a beauty queen I didn't like
It doesn't mean it's alright and you got to wife 'em
Trying hard to take my time 'cause these ten's got friends
And I'm just tryna kick it with the girl in the back
Who doesn't give a damn
If I'm J from Brooklyn or just in the band
It's all the same, it's all the same in her eyes
You might also like
Well, who are you catering to?
Who you fucking with when there ain't nobody fucking with you?
I told you I knew you before you even knew that you were you
Yeah, I know you better than that, I know you better

'Cause my faith in you is very comfortable for me
My faith in you, baby, is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through-ough-ough-ough
Until you're comfortable for me
My faith in you, yeah, is very comfortable for me

Not a game; not the game that...talk about, it's easy to sum it up when you just talk about practice... we're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice. I mean, listen, we talking about practice. Not a game, not a game, not a game, we talking about practice. Not a game; not, not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it's my last, not the game, we're talking about practice, man. I mean, how silly is that? Man, we're talking about practice. I know I'm supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to lead by example, I know that. And I'm not shoving it aside like it don't mean anything. Not the game, not the game, I'm not shoving it aside, you know, like it don't mean anything...

My faith in you, yeah, is very comfortable for me
My faith in you, baby, is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through-ough-ough-ough
Until you're comfortable for me
