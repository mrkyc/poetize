Oh, man down
You're shaking his solid ground
You're running me wild
And breaking me down, down (Hey)
Desperate now
Way you do it, I don't know how
You're drinking me dry
Throwin' fuel on the fire, fire

And we ain't enough
If this is what you're calling love
I swear I'm better alone
I feel your claws sinkin' in, gettin' under my skin like

Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And just like that, got me comin' right back like
Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And I know that I ain't fuckin' with your voodoo
Voodoo, do, voo, voo, voo, voo, voo
You might also like
And all my life
Can't hold on to you this tight
Phasin' you out
Just a face in the crowd, baby

And this ain't enough (This ain't enough)
If this is what you call love (Call love)
I think I'm better alone
I feel your claws sinkin' in, gettin' under my skin like

Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And just like that, got me comin' right back like
Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And I know that I ain't fuckin' with your voodoo

Fakin' the rush
Is almost like callin' it love
So why are you callin' it love?
Yeah, why are you callin' it love?
Ooh
Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And just like that, got me comin' right back like
Voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
V-v-voodoo, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
You got me too attached, keep me comin' right back
And I know that I ain't fuckin' with your voodoo

Voodoo
Oh no
