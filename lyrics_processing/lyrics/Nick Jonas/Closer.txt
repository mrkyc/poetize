All I really know is that I felt OK
When I met you in April
You were looking like May
I know you like to run, girl
So go on, set the pace
The liquor never tastes good
But I don't need to chase

Take another hit
Just fake it 'til you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you

Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment

Like the sun in December
Or a lemonade in June
I know what you want, girl
'Cause I want it, too
Have you ever noticed
That I can't see straight
'Cause I'm hooked on your body
Got me glued to your waist
You might also like
Take another hit
Just fake it 'til you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you

Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment

Aye
Waddup, Nick?
Alright
I look good, I smell good, I fuck good too
I'm looking around like
She would, and she would, and she probably would too (Yup)
I'm sittin' on the couch like it's my house
You a bad girl, take a time out
Matter fact, you can bring a friend
My voice sound like silk in the wind
Henny bottles on my table
The owner was a fan, so that's already paid for
Girls lookin' at me like I got a halo
I don't do second dates, that's just how the game go
Look at my life, I made that shit
Look at my car, I suede that shit
Replay that shit
She don't fuck white boys
I'ma change that shit
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment (Oh)
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer (Oh no), closer (Oh no)
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
