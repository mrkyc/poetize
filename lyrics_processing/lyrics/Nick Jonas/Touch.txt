Oh, love
Hey
Oh, no

Trust me
I'll be so good for you, baby
(Oh, no, no)
Love me, hate me
Either way, we'll go crazy
Go crazy

In a good way
'Cause anyone could you, babe
But that ain't all I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you

I go from touchin' you with both hands
To touchin' you with no hands
T-t-touchin' you
It's my favorite way of touchin' you
(Favorite way)
You might also like
No words spoken
I still speak your language
I swear I do (Woo!)
There's a story in between those pages
Those pages

That I wanna share with you
'Cause any one could you, babe
But that ain't all I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you

I go from touchin' you with both hands (Babe)
To touchin' you with no hands (No hands, no hands)
T-t-touchin' you
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
My favorite way
I go from touchin' you with both hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
To touchin' you with no hands, no hands
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
T-t-touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
I'm touchin' you, babe
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
'Cause anyone could you, baby (Yeah)
But that ain't all I'm into, love, no, no
I wanna get inside your brain, oh
Oh, no
And every part of you (I go)

I go from touchin' you with both hands (Yeah, babe)
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
To touchin' you with no hands (No hands, no hands)
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
T-t-touchin' you, touchin' you
(Touchin' with no hands, ooh)
That's my favorite way of touchin' you
