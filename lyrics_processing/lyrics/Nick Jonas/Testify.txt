I'm on one
I can't deny it, not this time, no
I'm on one
And just the thought of touchin' her, I come undone
Every time I'm with her, it's brand new
So brand new, yeah

She's got something that keeps me coming
I tried running, but ain't no running from the truth
Tell myself to just be cool
I can't help it
I know what she wanna do

So anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah
'Cause the way that it feel ain't right
Messed around, and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh
Oh, that love's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh
That love's too good, baby
You might also like
Hands up high
Got me where she want me with my hands up high
Every time I'm in it, wish I could rewind
Don't nobody do me like she do
It's all brand new, oh baby

She's got something that keeps me coming
I tried running, but ain't no running from the truth (No running from the truth)
Tell myself to just be cool
I can't help it
I know what she wanna do

Anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah
'Cause the way that it feel ain't right
Messed around, and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh
Oh, that love's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh
Oh, that love's too good, baby
Take me to a higher place
Yeah, I can never walk away
Oh no, oh no, yeah
Take me on a ride
You know it kills me every time that it's over
Yeah, you make me wanna testify

Anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah (ooh)
'Cause the way it feels ain't right (Ain't right)
Messed around, and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh
Oh, that love's too good
Make me wanna testify, ooh

Make me wanna testify, ooh
Oh, that love's too good
