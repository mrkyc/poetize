Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose, and that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me, you would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me

Whenever I can, I'll be there
You've got a man who knows exactly what you need
And I got a plan, don't be scared
I know, I know right now it's hard to see, yeah

Trust me
I can compartmentalize
Don't wanna throw this balance
I'm in for the ride, but

Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose, and that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me, you would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me

If you wanna talk, I'll listen
I'll be here on the line until you fall asleep
Gimme your time, gimme permission
To make it work, to put your mind at ease

I need you to trust me
I can compartmentalize
Don't wanna throw this balance
I'm in for the ride

Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose, and that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me, you would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me choose

'Cause I lose every time you push at me like this (Like this)
But I'll find a way to show you these two worlds can more than co-exist, yeah
Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my left hand and my right
Don't make me choose (Choose)
Between my love and my life
Either way I lose, and that just ain't right
Don't make me...
If you really love me, you would never judge me
I would never do that to you
Don't make me

Don't make me
Don't make me choose
Don't make me choose
Don't make me
If you really love me, you would never judge me
I would never do that to you
