I get anxiety when you're not with me
I'm a mess, yeah, I get so erratic
You know there's a part of me that will always be
Breathless when you speak

It's the way that you say that you need me
It's all that I want, yeah
Always trying to keep it together
I know that I won't, yeah

After all this time
Your love's still making me nervous
You're the reason why
My heart beats out of my chest
Looking in your eyes
It's a blood rush right to my temple
Every night that you tell me you love me
Feels like the first time

You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
You know you'll always make me
You might also like
You're like a symphony
Way you play the strings
Just a look, all it took
I was shattered
You know you're a masterpiece
Pulling it out of me
Yeah, you knock me off my feet

It's the way that you say that you need me
It's all that I want, yeah
Always trying to keep it together
I know that I won't, yeah

After all this time
Your love's still making me nervous
You're the reason why
My heart beats out of my chest
Looking in your eyes
It's a blood rush right to my temple
Every night that you tell me you love me
Feels like the first time

You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
You know you'll always make me
Yeah-yeah, after all this time
Your love's still making me nervous
You're the reason why
My heart beats out of my chest
Looking in your eyes
It's a blood rush right to my temple
Every night that you tell me you love me
Feels like the first time

You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
You know you'll always make me nervous, yeah
