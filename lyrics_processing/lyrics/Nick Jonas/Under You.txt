Yeah, yeah
Uhh

Cigarette, mmm, that I never got a chance to hit, chance to hit
But in my mind, yeah, baby, I can taste your lips
Taste your lips, mmm

I was so foolish, on some stupid shit
Should have never let you out, no, no
Knowing that you left messes with my head
Shadows of you haunt me now

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No, I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you

Poured a glass, mmm, but I never got to take a sip
Take a sip
I've been around the world (Around the world)
But baby, you're my only fix
My only fix
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
I was so foolish, on some stupid shit
Should have never let you out, no, no
Knowing that you left, messes with my head
Shadows of you haunt me now

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No, I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you (Getting under)
Getting under you

Had a heart attack
Full speed, swerve off track
Can't breathe
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Ain't no way to turn it back
I've become a heart attack
Everywhere I see your face, and it kills me everyday

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you (Can't get over)
Getting under you (Can't get over)
No, I'll never get over (No)
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you (Never get over)
Getting under you
No, I'll never get over
Never get over (Can't get over)
Not getting under you
