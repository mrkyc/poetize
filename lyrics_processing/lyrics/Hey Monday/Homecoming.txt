Homecoming, I'm coming, my sweet mistake
Summer's over, hope it's not too late
I'm pacing, impatient, up in my head
Taken back to the sidewalk where we met
And carved out our names
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

Descending, I'm spinning, lost all defense
How could you swallow me again?
I left you, I meant to, couldn't let you in
Never mind a single word I said
Carve out your name
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart
You might also like
You've got control of me, is this the end of me?
'Cause I just can't cut up the strings
I'm coming back for more, don't let your heart go
Please don't walk away
Homecoming, I'm coming, I'm coming back

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart

I'm coming home, I'm coming home (Homecoming, I'm coming)
Did you take off while I was gone? (My sweet mistake)
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you (Summer's over, hope it's not too late)
I'm coming home, I wanna know (Homecoming, I'm coming)
When all the leaves begin to fall (My sweet mistake)
