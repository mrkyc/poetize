Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa

Hit me out of nowhere like a car crash on the street
Suddenly colliding into me
Now I'm broken, bruised and beat up
Tangled in my sheets
How can this feel so bad when you seemed so good for me?

Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
It's the short hello's and the long goodbye's
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die
I've got the worst hangover from you

Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa

Swimming in the deep end, tryna keep from turning blue
Danger, danger, hoping not to drown
(Somebody get me out of here)
Sinking in the quicksand just to walk right up to you
You're so easy to pick up and so hard to put down
You might also like
Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
(Tell me how I'll ever make it through)
It's the short hello's and the long goodbye's
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die
I've got the worst hangover from you

All that I really wanted was a habit I could drop anytime that I wanted to
And what I really got was you
(And no medicine, is gonna cut it)

Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
(Tell me how I'll ever make it through)
It's the short hello's and the long goodbye's
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die
I've got the worst hangover
Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
(Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
It's the short hello's and the long goodbye's
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die
I've got the worst hangover from you
