Miraculous you call it, babe, you ain't seen nothing yet
They got Pepsi in the Andes, they got McDonald's in Tibet
Yosemite has been turned into a golf course for the Japs
And the Dead Sea is alive with rap
Between the Tigris and Euphrates, there's a leisure centre now
They got all kinds of sports, they got Bermuda shorts
They had sex in Pennsylvania, a Brazilian grew a tree
And a doctor in Manhattan saved a dying man for free

It's a miracle (It's a miracle)
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
Another miracle
By the grace of God almighty
And the pressures of the market place
The human race has civilised itself
It's a miracle

We got warehouses of butter, we got oceans of wine
We got famine when we need it, we got designer crime
We got Mercedes, we got Porsche, Ferrari and Rolls Royce
Yeah, we got choice...
She said meet me in the garden of Gethsemane, my dear
The Lord said "Peter, I can see your house from here"
An honest man finally reaped what he had sown
And a farmer in Ohio has just repaid a loan
You might also like
It's a miracle (It's a miracle)
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
Another miracle
By the grace of God almighty
And the pressures of the market place
The human race has civilised itself
It's a miracle

We cower in our shelters with our hands over our ears
Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff runs for years and years and years
An earthquake hits the theatre, but the operetta lingers
Then the piano lid comes down and breaks his fucking fingers
It's a miracle
