"Christmas comes but ones a year
for every girl and boy
the laughter and the joy
they find in each new toy.
I tell you of a little boy
who lives across the way
this little fella's Christmas
is just another day.

It was just before dawn
one miserable morning in black '44
when the forward commander was told to sit tight
when he asked that his men be withdrawn.
And the generals gave thanks
as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while
and the Anzio bridgehead was held for the prize of a few hundred ordinary lives.

"He's the little boy that Santa Claus forgot
and goodness knows he didn't want a lot
He sent a note to Santa
for some soldiers and a drum
It broke his little heart
when he found that Santa hadn't come.
In the street he envies al those lucky boys..."
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise.

Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too.
And the sea may look warm to you babe
and the sky may look blue.
Ooooh Baby
Ooooh baby blue
Oooooh babe.
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet.
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice.
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what d'ya leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
"Easy. Be careful.
What ?"
"Will You put me on that ?"
"Well, Where's your ma then ?"
"She's gone to the shops"
"Yes. All right.
How's that then ? Enjoying it ?
Ooh wabba..lovely lovely.
"What you again ? Now Off you go ! Go on.
What have I told you about this ?
What have I told you; you're not mine.
Now, sling your hook.
Go on sling your hook"

And kind old king George
send Mother a note
when he heard that father was gone.
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
with gold leaf and all.
And I found it one day
in a drawer of old photographs, hidden away.
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp....
It was dark all around
there was frost in the ground
when the tigers broke free
and no-one survived from
The Royal Fusiliers Company C.
They where all left behind
most of them dead
the rest of them dying.
And that's how the High Command
took my Daddy from me!

Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the
promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on.
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

"Wait for me Pinky, you rotten bleeder."
"They're live bullets, aren't they ?"
"I don't know"
"Come on Tubs. Its great down in the tunnel."
"Don't you think it'd be dangerous Pinky ?"
"No don't be daft."
" "You all right Tubbs ?"
"Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit"
"Come on!"
"Nah, it's too dangerous. We'll wait for the train."
"Gimme the torch"
"Pinky here comes the train. Get of the line you bloody idiot, here it comes"
"Pinky get of the line, here it comes! Get of the line!"
"You! You! Yes, you! Stand still laddie!"
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
The teacher gets a black book from Pink's possessions.
TEACHER
"What have we here laddie ?
Mysterious scibblings ? A secret code ?
No ! Poems no less. Poems everybody !
TEACHER
The lad here reckons himself a poet.  "Money gets back. I'm all right Jack. Keep your hands of my stack. New car, caviar, four star day dream, think I'll buy me a football team." Absolute rubbish laddie. Get on with your work! Repeat after me : An acre is the area of a rectangle whose length is one furlong and whose width is one chain.

But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
TEACHER
"Wrong! Do it again!"
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
TEACHER
"If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!"
We don't need no thought control
TEACHER
"How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat !?!"
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
TEACHER
"You! Yes you laddie!
Poems! Poems everybody!
The lad here makes himself a poet"
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
TEACHER
"Wrooooong !!!!"
We don't need no education.
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
TEACHER
"Again! An acre is the area of a rectangle whose
length is on furlong and whose width is one chain"

Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother do you think they'll like this song?
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Oooh aah, Mother should I build the wall?
"K B Y M S H A M"
Mother should I run for president?
"As my college Donald supposes...."
Mother should I trust the government?
Mother will they put me in the firing line?
ooh aah, mother am I really dying ?
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mother's gonna make all your nightmares come true.
Mother's gonna put all her fears into you.
Mother's gonna keep you right here under her wing.
She wont let you fly, but she might let you sing.
Mama's gonna keep baby cosy and warm.
Ooooh baby ooooh baby oooooh baby,
Of course mamma's gonna help build the wall.
"Hello.
Hello.
Is there anybody in there ?
D'you remember me ? I'm the one from the registry office"
Mother do you think she's good enough -- for me?
Mother do you think she's dangerous -- to me?
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?
Oooh ma, Mother will she break my heart?
Hush now baby, baby don't you cry.
Mama's gonna check out all your girl friends for you.
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through.
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in.
Mama will always find out where you've been.
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Ooooh baby oooh baby ooh baby,
You'll always be baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high?
"Hello..?"
"Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
Will you accept the charges from United States?
I wonder why he hung up?
Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?"
"Hello?"
"This is United States calling, are we reaching...
"See he keeps hanging up, and there's a man answering."

What shall we use
to fill the empty spaces
where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
in search of more and more applause ?
Shall we buy a new guitar ?
Shall we drive a more powerful car ?
Shall we work straight through the night ?
Shall we get into fights ?
Leave the lights on ?
Drop bombs ?
Do tours of the East ?
Contract diseases ?
Bury bones ?
Break up homes ?
Send flowers by phone ?
Take to drink ?
Go to shrinks ?
Give up meat ?
Rarely sleep ?
Keep people as pets ?
Train dogs ?
Race rats ?
Fill the attic with cash ?
Bury treasure ?
Store up leisure ?
But never relax at all
with our backs to the wall ?

I am just a new boy,
Stranger in this town.
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh, baby set me free.
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.

GROUPIE
"Oh my God, what a fabulous room!
"Are all these your guitars?"
"I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!"
"This place is bigger than our whole apartment!"
"Uh, could I get a drink of water?"
"Let me know when you are entering a room" Yes sir!"
"Ya want some? Huh?"
"Yes"
"Oh wow! Look at this tub!"
You wanna take a bath?"
"I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for here main"
"What're you watching?"
"If you'll just let me know as soon as you can
Mrs. Bancroft. Mrs. Bancroft"
"Hello?"
"I don't understand"
"Are you feeling OK?"

"When are we going to get something to fly ?"
"They're sending the first batch of Lancs tomorrow"
"Now these are the first dropping tests at the Chesil beach near Weymouth."
"Here comes the Wellington.
Mutt Summers is the pilot, and I'm working the release gear."
"God;"
"In a moment you'll see the bombs."
"That makes the ten they promised us to get started with
Have them flown and tested tomorrow.
We can begin this afternoon dividing the crews into flights. The first job will be to fly over every big lake in England and Wales and photograph them"
"Lakes!?"
"You like the tube, huh ?"
"Lakes."
"Crews are already in the briefing room."
"Can I get a drink of water?"
"Hello."
"Hello Mutt. This is wing commander Guy Gibson"
"Can I get you a drink of water ?"
"I'm glad you've come. My name is Barnes Wallis."
"I'll leave you to it. See you later"
"Right."
"Thanks a lot Mutt."
"Would you like to put these things down ? Here give me that."
"Thank you"
"I don't smoke, but there's sometimes a cigarette in here. Yes there we are."
"Oh wow, look at this tub. Do you wanna take bath?"
Well, here we are all together for the first time.
You're wondering what it's all about, and I can't tell you, cause I don't know myself.
But I do know it's a big thing and if it comes off..
"What are watching?"
"...it'll have results that may do quite a bit to shorten this war.
Discipline is going to be essential,"
"Hello?"
"and so is security."
"Hello?"
"It's unusual for a crowd like you to be formed into a new squadron.
So you are going to be talked about.
Rumors are flying already. But you've got to keep your mouths shut!"
"Are you feeling okay?..."
Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of the dying man.
Night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older
and you have grown colder
and nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.
I feel cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would'ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Nigger ! Come on old boy ! Come on Nigger!"
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
"Next time fuckers!!!"

Ooooh Babe.
Don't leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe.
Don't leave me now.
"Do you know how much water it takes
the Germans to make a ton of steel ?"
"Haven't the least."
"One hundred tons"
How could you treat me this way?
Running away.
ooh Babe.
Why are you running away?
Oooooh Babe!
Oooooh Babe
Oooooh.
Oooooh

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me.
I have seen the writing on the wall.
Don't think I need anything at all.
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.

Goodbye cruel world,
I'm leaving you today.
Goodbye,
Goodbye,
Goodbye.
Goodbye, all you people,
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind.
Goodbye

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

"Oh hello Gibson. I was wondering if you where here."
"I was watching from down there."
"Why didn't you come and watch with me here?"
"I knew how you must be feeling. I guessed you'd rather be alone."
"It's the devil; isn't it ?"
"Yes, 'its rather."
"It's most disappointing. I shall have to go all out on some modifications.
I wonder if I could ask you to do something ?"
"Of course. Anything I can."
Well, you see. It isn't only the structure of the bomb.
It's the trouble. It's in the bopping of it
We must lessen the force of the impact.
I asked you originally if you could fly in over water,
and drop the bomb at 150 feet."
I've got a little black book with my poems in.
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on.
Got those swollen hand blues.
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from.
I've got electric light.
And I've got second sight.
"It requires..."
I've got amazing powers of observation.
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
"One of the thrilling things for me has been..."
There'll be nobody home.
"Turkish ballet"
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.
"Down. Down. Down. Steady."
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.
"Hello Nigger old boy. What are you doing ?"
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
"Hello Nigger. Not in here old boy. Go on."
I've got wild staring eyes.
And I've got a strong urge to fly.
But I got nowhere to fly to.
Ooooh, Babe when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home.
I've got a pair of Go hills boots
and I got fading roots.

"Do You want me Crosby ?"
"I-I'm sorry sir. It's Nigger. He's been run over. He's dead.
The car didn't even stop."
"Where did it happen?"
"Outside the main gate. He ran across the road sir, and the car hit him."
"Where is he ?"
"In the guardroom Sir."
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day?
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you?
Does anybody else here
Feel the way I do?

Bring the boys back home.
Bring the boys back home.
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no.
Bring the boys back home.
Bring the boys back home.
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no.
Bring the boys back home.
"You can bet your boot it's gonna be something big."
"They say it's a special squadron to kidnap Hitler."
"Who's that big dark fellow by the table ?"
"Wrong! Do it again!"
"Time to go! 
"Oh that's Young. Gibson's Second in command"
"Are you feeling okay?"
"Dinghy Young they call him, cause he always comes down
in the sea and paddles home in his rubber boat."
Aah, is there anybody out there ?
"Stay there Nigger. Stay there boy."
"Fuck me!!
He's gone completely round the bleedin' twist!
You vicious bastard, you never did like me, did ya ?"

Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now,
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
"...the boy's an asthmatic."
"Asthmatic!?"
Relax.
I'll need some information first.
"...he's an artist..."
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you will not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
I have become comfortably numb.
O.K.
Just a little pin prick.
There'll be no more (Pink: AAAAAAAAAH!)
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
"...He's coming around. There, you see!"
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go.
"How do you feel?"
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion,
that space cadet glow - huh!
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,
Pink isn't well. He's, err, back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
Now, tonight we're gonna find out where you fans really stand.
Are there any queers in the audience tonight?
Get them up against the wall!------Get that one
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right,
have him up against the wall!------Get that one
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint,
And that one's got spots!
If I had my way,
I'd have all of you shot!
Hammer. Hammer. Hammer. Hammer.....

Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better make your face up with your favorite disguise.
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes.
With your empty smile and your hungry heart.
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.
With your nerves in tatters as the conch shell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door.
You'd better run.
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better run all day and run all night.
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside.
And if you're taking your girl friend out tonight
You'd better park the car well out of sight.
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks,
They're gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box.
You better run.

"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Aah , you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by.
We're {waiting to succeed} and going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be...
Waiting to cut out the deadwood.
Waiting to weed out the weaklings.
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors.
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain.
Waiting to follow the worms.
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station. We'll be moving
along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road {..........} {Abbot's Road }
{.....} twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge.
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in
Westminster {Borough } area. It's quite possible we may encounter
some {.....} by the way we go. {... ..}."
Hammer. Hammer. Hammer. Hammer.


STOOOOOOP!
"Do you remember me? The way it used to be?
Do you think we should have been closer?
Put out my hand, just to touch your soft hair.
To make sure in the darkness, that you where still there.
And I have to admit, I was just a little afraid.
of the ones living under the dirty old knife.
And the ones who where pointed with guns to their backs..."
Stop. Stop.
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show.
But I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know.
Have I been guilty all this time?

Good morning, Worm your honor.
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature;
This will not do.
Call the schoolmaster!
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor.
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape.
But my hands were tied,
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder.
Let me hammer him today?
Crazy,
Toys in the attic I am crazy,
Truly gone fishing.
They must have taken my marbles away.
Crazy, toys in the attic he is crazy.
You little shit you're in it now,
I hope they throw away the key.
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no! You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honor,
Him and Me, alone.
Baaaaaaaaaabe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
In my arms.
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble.
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home.
Crazy,
Over the rainbow, I am crazy,
Bars in the window.
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in.
Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy.
The evidence before the court is
Incontrovertible, there's no need for
The jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penalties of law.
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother,
Fills me with the urge to defecate!
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear,
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall.
Tear down the wall.
Tear down the wall.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!

All alone, or in two's,
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall.
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands.
The bleeding hearts and artists
Make their stand.
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
