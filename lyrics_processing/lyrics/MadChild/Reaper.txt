Yeah, yeah, yo
I'm a demon and I rap with a serpent's tongue
My brain from outer space where the surfer's from
Fan's get jacked like when the circus come
Most these new rap cats bunch ofworthless scum
I'm an old rap bastard, that's classic dark
Spittin' dinosaur raps on Jurassic Park
I ain't tryna hear these little back spastics bark
Dog I turn into a werewolf after dark
Little puppies pump Kool-Aid from plastic carts
Go-fish swimming guppies, I'm a massive shark
Besides let's face the facts - they don't have the parts
They wanna be friends, gee stack that's a start
You get it in don't lie, homie that's a farce
Besides it sounds like you rip your ass apart, I'm a real rap slasher
Bash your smart
Track master I'll smash like a glass of dark

Eh, yo, my plan to attack, it is lethal
Don't fuck with the reaper
I inhale and exhale ether
Old school dope dealer with a beeper
Sleeper, groupies on the internet are creepers
Life's a bitch you can keep her
Inebriated Libra, abbreviated reverb
And you don't always get what you deserve
So I'mma just take what I need - think of me first
You might also like
Slash these little bastards with a fuckin' tongue lashing
They should practice rapping, worry less about fashion
Imagine a fire breathing dragons enjoyment
Listening to Black Flag while I'm spitting rap poison
Yeah, who let the bad boys in?
Making bad choices while taking Mad's voice in
Last 5 years got lost in the Matrix
Now I need a whole set of teeth and a facelift
Most kids want rings and a bracelet
Immortal demi-god wanna learn how to shape shift
Try to tell me my tapes ain't the tastiest
You can suck a cock, get raped by a atheist
Face it - all these rappers wish that I was still wasted
But now I want the shit so bad I can taste it
Madchild wear a mask like Jason
