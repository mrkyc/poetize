Another Darkchild classic
Uh, yeah, yeah
Teairra, Teairra
(What's up) Talk to 'em
Talk to 'em
(Whatchu want) Talk to 'em, talk to 'em
(Hm, you gotta come with a better game than that)
Talk to 'em, talk to 'em (You know what)
(Just stay in ya lane) Let's go

Yes, I got a tight crew, so
Yes, I know what these jeans are doing to ya
Yes, you like how we move, but
Just be careful we don't start clowning you
Yes, I might give you a chance if your game is times four (Four)
Might give you the sell if your backseat fits four (Four)
Until I do, respect my whole crew
And stay in your lane

I see you, baby (Woo)
But stay in your lane, take it easy
Keep gettin' at me
But stay in your lane, I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
But stay in your lane, take it easy
You want me, but be easy
So, look upon me, just stay in ya lane

Yes, we came in five coups, so
Just be easy, it the first time I met you
Yes, we're particular too, so
Watch your mouth or bottles are flying at you
Yes, I came to play around and shut this place down
As fine as I am, I can't take this route
If your mouth is loose, you're with the wrong crew
We gon' handle you

I see you, baby (Oh)
But stay in your lane, take it easy (Take it easy, yeah)
Keep gettin' at me
But stay in your lane, I ain't easy (But stay in your lane, I ain't easy)
My frame is crazy (So crazy)
But stay in your lane, take it easy (Easy)
You want me, but be easy (But be easy)
So, look upon me, just stay in ya lane (Just stay in ya lane, no)
I see you, baby (Cause me and my girls came to)
But stay in your lane, take it easy (Have a good time, baby)
Keep gettin' at me (And we don't need nobody getting out and poppin')
But stay in your lane, I ain't easy (Thinkin' they're hot, just stop it)
My frame is crazy (I know you like what you see)
But stay in your lane, take it easy (But stay in your lane, please)
You want me, but be easy (And I'm not gonna tell you no more)
So, look upon me, just stay in ya lane
I'm not really tryna play you
But certain things I can't tolerate (Tolerate)
Like a nigga up in my face (In my face)
I really need my space, so
(I'll show you how you can get through) Get through
And most important stay in your lane (Your lane)
But you really can't play these games
With me, oh

Keep gettin' at me (And I know you don't know me)
But stay in your lane, I ain't easy (So, my nigga, please)

But stay in your lane, take it easy (You better stay in your place)
You want me, but be easy (You better stay in your lane)
