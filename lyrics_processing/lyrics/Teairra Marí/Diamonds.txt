Aye, aye
Uh

You love my diamonds don't you
Love the way a nigga shinin', don't you
Baby, what's your disposition
Have you ever tried this position
You're my dream girl from the posters
That I thought I'd never get close to
In the back limousines with chauffeurs
Right next to the Testarossas
It's funny how all the jewelry
Just gets your cat so purry
And it look good all together
They say they are forever
You love my diamonds, don't ya
That I bought from all this rhymin'
But I know you'll never love me
You only love my diamonds

You pick me up on a hot summer night
I fall in love with you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger, boy, I hope you love lingers
I do (Do), I do (Do)
You might also like
You're my one and only rock in the rough (Flawlessly cut)
I like to floss you, baby, you light me up (Like stars above)
And there ain't no way I'd give you away
He's my di-di-diamond daddy and I just gotta have him

When I love you, baby, I'm gonna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds)
I treasure you, cherish you way you on my body, ooh
Cause we go together, diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby, ooh
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds)

Like every girl I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls and pretty diamond rings
But you're my precious possession, I rock you 24/7
I do (Do), I do, do (Do)

All my accessories, yeah, I give 'em up (Yeah, just like you)
I'd even trade 'em in for your love (That's what I do)
And there ain't no way I'm giving you away
You're my di-di-diamond daddy and I just gotta have you, oh
When I love you, baby, I'm gonna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds) (Just like you were my diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy (Ooh)
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds) (We be shining, diamonds, diamonds)
I treasure you, cherish you way you on my body, ooh (Cherish you, ooh)
Cause we go together, diamonds are forever (Forever)
You're my ice blue baby, ooh (And I)
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds) (Love you like my diamonds)

You sexy, you fine, I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine, he's my one of a kind
You sexy, you fine, I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine, he's my one of a kind

When I love you, baby, I'm gonna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds)
I treasure you, cherish you way you on my body, ooh
Cause we go together, diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby, ooh
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds) (I wanna love you, woah)
When I love you, baby, I'm gonna love ya
Just like I love my diamonds (Diamonds, diamonds) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when I wear you out at night, boy (When I wear you out at night, night)
Yeah, we'll be shining (Diamonds, diamonds) (Diamonds, diamonds)
I treasure you, cherish you way you on my body, ooh (Cherish you way you on my body, ooh)
Cause we go together, diamonds are forever (Diamonds are forever)
You're my ice blue baby, ooh (You're my ice blue baby, oh)
And I love you like my diamonds (I do, diamonds, I do, diamonds) (Like my diamonds, my diamonds)
