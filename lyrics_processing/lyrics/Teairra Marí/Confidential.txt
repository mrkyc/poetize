Tea
I want you, ma
Can we do this (Can I trust you)

If I take it off, would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, if I come off of this
Loving, it's confidential
If I take it off, would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, if I come off of this
Loving, it's confidential

If I (If I) let you get me (Let you, let you)
Take off my jeans (Let you, let you)
You're gonna be
The first one to score
And if I let go (Let go, let go)
Act irresponsible (Oh no, oh no)
After all this is over
Will the joke be on me

Though my body's saying (Take me)
I got my mind saying (Same thing)
Slow down, don't be fooled
By the things you say
You might also like
If I take it off, would you take it slow (Oh)
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know)
About nothing, if I come off of this
Loving, it's confidential (It's so confidential)
If I take it off, would you take it slow (Oh)
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know)
About nothing, if I come off of this (Oh)
Loving, it's confidential

I'm so close to giving you all of me
But I can't be sure that you gon' stay with me
I know that I said we were meant to be
But I can't say this time and it's right for me
Your swagger is right and our bond is strong
You're beggin' to see me with nothing on
So many of my girls are home alone
Wishing that they would've remained strong

Though my body's saying (Take me)
I got my mind saying (Same thing)
Slow down, don't be fooled
By the things you say
If I take it off, would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know (Promise that you won't betray me)
About nothing, if I come off of this (No)
Loving, it's confidential (It's so confidential)
If I take it off, would you take it slow (No)
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know)
About nothing, if I come off of this (Woah, woah)
Loving, it's confidential (It's so confidential)

(I like you)
(I mean)
Nothing
Loving
(I really like you)
(I just don't know)
Nothing
Loving (If I'm ready)
If I take it off, would you take it slow (You feel me)
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing
Loving (You willing to wait)
If I take it off, would you take it slow (Huh)
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, if I come off of this (Nothing)
