Yeah, right
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, right
Yeah, turn the lights on

Maybe I forgot his birthday (Oops)
I meant to take him to lunch this afternoon
Now, he's pissed off in the worst way
I hope he gets over this attitude real soon

I guess I did something so wrong
Cause my baby won't pick up the telephone
And he ain't even coming home
And it's been so long

So, I said hello operator, hello
Can you put my baby on the line (My baby on the line, oh, oh)
So, we can get together later
Cause I really wanna spend some time
Cause he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't answer my call
Cause he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't answer my call (Ooh)
Cause he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't, he won't answer my call (So, I said hello operator)
Can you put my baby on the line

I was shopping with my homegirls
Didn't expect him to act so immature
He be off in his own world
I thought my baby wasn't so insecure

Maybe I should send him some flowers or a card
Some candy or a letter cause his taking it so hard
I should take him on a shopping spree, let's ball out at the mall
Out wine him and dine him, I might as well have me a brawl
