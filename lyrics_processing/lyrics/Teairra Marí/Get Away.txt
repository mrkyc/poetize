Sometimes
I just need
To get away

I just wanna get away, my hideaway
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free
I just wanna get away, my hideaway
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free

Blood pressure is
High
With so many ways for me to trip and fall
Flat on my face (And I)
I wonder
Why
Is it so easy for the waves to come
Crash down on me, tell me why

Things are so tricky
And dangerous
I know there's no such thing
As a perfect world
But does it have to be
This way, tell me
(Sometimes, I just wanna get away)
(Get away)

I just wanna get away, my hideaway (Wanna get away)
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me (Oh, I gotta get away)
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free
I just wanna get away, my hideaway (Wanna get away)
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me (Oh, I gotta get away)
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free

I refuse to let things
Get me down
Cause I know the rain is not gonna
Stay away (It's gonna go away)
But I can't help the fact that
If you sue me
And it seems that it will never
Stop pouring and I don't know what I'm gonna do

Things are so tricky (No, no, tricky)
And dangerous (Dangerous)
I know there's no such thing
As a perfect world
But does it have to be (Does it really have to be this way)
This way, tell me (Hey, tell me)
(Sometimes I just wanna get away)
(Gotta get away)
I just wanna get away, my hideaway
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me (Don't wanna be here)
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free (Oh whoa)
I just wanna get away, my hideaway (My freedom lives)
Just up in the sky where the birds are free (Up there in the sky)
And if you're feelin' me, come with me
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free

Lord, please gimme
My wings so I
Can fly like an angel
And escape this place, so
Lord, please gimme
My wings so I
Can fly like an angel
And escape this place, so

I just wanna get away, my hideaway (Go with me)
Just up in the sky where the birds are free (Go with me)
And if you're feelin' me, come with me (Come with me)
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free
I just wanna get away, my hideaway
Just up in the sky where the birds are free
And if you're feelin' me, come with me
I'll be in the clouds livin' worry-free
(Up in the sky)
(Oh)
I just wanna get away (Worry-free)
And if you're feelin' me
I just wanna get away
