Charles Hamilton and this pretty girl
Teairra

Okay, you're mad, you're screaming and such
You hate me so much, you could at least set me off (Oh god)
Okay, I get it, I hit it, I'm wrong
But you've been gone for a minute at getting his long
And she said everything you did and she kissing you marks
Then you did, I'm livid, she livid, you gone
So, come back at me when lyrics for pissing me off
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I guess I'm

You running out of luck, yeah, your stars are not aligned
And now, I played the last game with you for the last time
Threw the cards on the table, can't take another round
Got these chicks callin' me, it's about to go down
You messy, I can't take a man who can't get his stuff together
Can't get his words together (You can go into whatever)
Keep my name out your mouth, yeah, the door's been closed
Every chick had yours, baby, that's a no-no

Gotta take it, babe, you been warned, so you know you gotta go
To caught up in the wrong, oh no (Oh)
Get your bags and run, said you messin' with the wrong one
Take your back and let it go, oh hell no (Ooh)

Did you think I wouldn't find out she was chillin' at the house
Yeah, you tried to clear it up (Baby, I don't give a what)
Boy, you know you're free to go, changing what was wrong before
Thought it was about you (Boy, you acting brand new)
Save your money, flowers, and the cards, it ain't working out
Ain't no kisses for you, go (That's a no-no)
You can have your stuff back, you can have the pictures of
But you can't have my love, oh no-no

Gotta take it, babe, you been warned, so you know you gotta go

That's a no-no gettin' with me, no more causing drama (That's a)
No-no, no, no-no, no-no (No-no, no-no, no-no)

I thought about it, I don't want it, I don't need it, no
The games, the problems, the drama, yeah, they can have it all
So, I don't know why you keep callin' my phone
Might as well leave me alone cause you know I'm gon' say no
And quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of your bullshit
My time is exclusive, your lying is useless
Ah-ha-ha, and right now I'm on my new shit
I'm not on you shit, a no-no

That's a no-no talkin' to me, no more causing drama (I can't take no more)
No-no loving from me any time you wanna (Baby, no means no)
That's a no-no gettin' with me, no more causing drama (Now, I'm out the door)
No-no, no, no-no, no-no (No-no, no-no, no-no, ooh)
That's a no-no talkin' to me, no more causing drama (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
No-no loving from me any time you wanna (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
That's a no-no gettin' with me, no more causing drama
No-no, no, no-no, no-no (No, no, no, no)
That's a no-no
