I need to make a collect phone call
Hello

Teairra (Please hold)

Damn right, now my life ain't filled with nothing, but the drama
Just had the worst fight ever with my mama
She believes that you got two or three on the come up
Telling me you're loving me, but you're going home to them
Damn, I hope she's wrong cause, boy, I love the ground you walk on
She knows that your ties in the streets can be fatal
She's threatening to disown me if I don't let this go
Lord, can you help me 'fore I blow, I'm so afraid

I'm at the phone booth, my ma just pissed me off
I can't take no more, can you come and get me
From the phone booth, she's telling me to break up
Cause you ain't gon' do nothing but hurt me, come get me
From the phone booth, it's raining, I'm crying
Damn, I hope he ain't been lying to me, come get me
From the phone booth, my ma just pissed me off
I can't take no more, can you come and get me
