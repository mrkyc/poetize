Act right, if I put my money on you every time I know I'd
Bet right, checkin' my call log to see if I missed your call
When I was in the shower, boy, you got that (Boy, you got that)
Act right, the way you love me I swear that it's a
Life changer, if I was a dude, homie, you would get all
My paper, don't know what to do with you, ODing over you

Pay phone, hope you left a message, baby, you're out

More, more, what the streets call the reason
