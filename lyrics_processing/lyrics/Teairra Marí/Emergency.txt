Uh oh, I did it again
Just when I thought I couldn't fall no deeper
Somehow, I bumped right into him
I guess the game of love is ready to begin
(Another page added to the story)
Feelings are hard to pretend
I thought my heart just couldn't get much weaker
But somehow it bruises, breaks and bends
I want to hate him, but he hits me with that grin
(And now, I'm back in love again, no-woah)

Emergency, I got this feeling (Ooh)
Emergency, I need your healing me
So, send rescue here for me
It's an emergency
Emergency, I think I'm hopeless (Hopeless)
Emergency, I'm losing focus
How could this thing happen to me
Oh, emergency

Can't get him out of my mind
I'm so infatuated with his swagger
His style is so one of a kind
I think of him and now, wish I could press rewind
(My hero's finally coming for me)
I can't take rejection this time
My heart is still bleeding from the last dagger
And I vowed to leave the pain behind
And, baby, love is like a mountain I can't climb
(Just when I thought that I was fine, no, call)

Emergency, I need your healing me
So, send rescue here for me (Send it for me)
It's an emergency (Oh, oh, oh)
Emergency, I think I'm hopeless (I'm hopeless)
Emergency, I'm losing focus
How could this thing happen to me
Oh, emergency (It's an emergency)

We both shared favorite authors and watched vintage movies
Our signs are so compatible, the chemistry is there
Ooh, but why am I so scared
I'ma call emergency, baby, yeah

Emergency, I got this feeling (Emergency, I'ma 'bout to call 'em)
Emergency, I need your healing me (Because I think I'm falling, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So, send rescue here for me (Send rescue here for me)
It's an emergency (It's an emergency)
Emergency, I think I'm hopeless (Oh, oh, hopeless)
Emergency, I'm losing focus (Aye, I'm losing focus, baby)
How could this thing happen to me (How could this thing, how could it happen to me)
Oh, emergency (Oh, oh)
