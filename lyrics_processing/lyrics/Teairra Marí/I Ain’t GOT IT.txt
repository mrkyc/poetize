They try to break me down, I tell 'em I ain't stoppin'
I gave my life on TV screens, I bet you watchin'
I've been through hell and back, oh yeah, bitch, I'm back poppin'
And if they ever tell me quit, that ain't an option, no

Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it
Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it
Oh, you think you gettin' now? Oh, you think you gettin' now?
Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it

No, I ain't got it, oh boy, I'm poppin'
I'm takin' off like a rocket, for 30 thousand, that's what y'all on
Y'all some lame ass niggas, I'm a Detroit bitch
Fuck these hatin' ass hoes, tell 'em all get off my dick
Time to go and do it, I'ma do it and that's all
Can't wait 'til I'm 50 just to go and ball
So what you wanna do? Come and bully who?
Fuck them other niggas, ho savage, I'ma ride

They try to break me down, I tell 'em I ain't stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
I gave my life on TV screens, I bet you watchin' (I know you watchin')
I've been through hell and back, oh yeah, bitch, I'm back poppin'
And if they ever tell me quit, that ain't an option, no

Oh, you think you gettin' now? Oh, you think you gettin' now?
Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it

How could you think that I was weak?
Look what I had to defeat
Oh my, I've been alone for a while
Contemplatin' R&B but this is how I eat
Somehow, time I glow all the way up now
So I'ma run it up, run it up, I got the juice again
Second glance, Carti' shades, I'm drinkin' juice and gin
But I won't cry
It's time I spread my wings
I'm alive, now everything's gon' be alright
I'm alive, now everything's gon' be alright
I'm alive, everything's gon' be (RellyMade)
Alright

They try to break me down, I tell 'em I ain't stoppin' (I ain't stoppin', baby)
I gave my life on TV screens, I bet you watchin' (Bet you watchin' me)

Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it (Baby, I ain't got it for ya)

Oh, you think you gettin'? I ain't got it (Got it)
