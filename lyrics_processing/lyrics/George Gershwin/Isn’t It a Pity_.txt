Why did I wander
Here and there and yonder
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a crime?
My journey's ended
Everything is splendid
Meeting you today
Has given me a
Wonderful idea
Here I stay!
(Chorus)
It's a funny thing
I look at you
I get a thrill
I never knew
Isn't it a pity we never met before?
Here we are at last
It's like a dream
The two of us
A perfect team
Isn't it a pity we never met before?
You might also likeImagine all the lonely years we've wasted
You with the neighbors
I at silly labors
What joys untasted!
You reading Heine
I somewhere in China
Happiest of men
I'm sure to be
If only you
Will say to me
"It's an awful pity we never ever met before!"
(Verse 2)
While you were flitting
I was busy knitting

How did you survive
Waiting till I'd arrive?

All my Dresden boyfriends
Were only half alive
Sleepy was Hermann
Fritz was like a sermon
Hans was such a bore!
How well I planned it

I just couldn't stand it
Anymore
(Chorus 2)
It's a funny thing
I look at you
I get a thrill
I never knew
Isn't it a pity we never met before?
Here we are at last
It's like a dream
The two of us
A perfect team

For you're more than pretty, and I have charm galore!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted
You up in Norway
I around my doorway
What joys untasted!
If you'd been handy
It'd have been just dandy
Isn't it a shame
We had to wait?

But thank the Lord
It's not too late

Still, it's such a pity we never never met before!
(Chorus 3)
Love your funny smile
Your twinkling eye

That's very nice
For so do I!

Isn't it a pity we never met before?

Put your hand in mine
A perfect fit

We never knew

Just think of it!
Isn't it a pity we never met before?

Imagine all the lonely years I've wasted
Fishing for salmon
Losing at backgammon

What joys untasted!
My nights were sour
Spent with Schopenhauer

Let's forget the past
Let's both agree
That I'm for you
And you're for me
