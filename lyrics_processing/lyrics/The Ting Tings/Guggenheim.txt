There was this boy who came to town
Was cooler than the boys in all my crazy dreams
All the problems I thought I had all but disappeared
And he would always, always think of me first
And we were writing the history books and we were so in love
And there was this girl, she used to hang out
I never saw anything, anyone, no one so beautiful
And she would sit around and wait for the day to end
And she would offer herself as if she had nowhere else to go
And I didn't think nothing of it
And that's when my life went cold
And then she was now sleeping in your bed
And she was all over you
And there she was sleeping in my bed
And then there were all these issues
And then there were all these issues

This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
You might also like
And all the things we used to say and used to do together
And I can't believe that there were such good things between us
And we threw them all away just because this girl
She thought that she had something to say
And all the things that I'm now left with are scarred upon my mind
And I can't believe all these times I used to wait
And I never used to go out and show myself
'Cause I got everything I need
And you need to stop that now
You used to stop me doing what I wanted
And now I can't do it anymore
'Cause I discovered there's something about me
That everybody wants some more
That everybody wants some more

This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
And after all that's said and done
I had to pick myself up and find myself at number one
'Cause this isn't about you anymore
This is all about me
It wasn't your fault that I was living up in a tree
I was waiting for things
I was waiting for things to come to me
We were never in love
And we were never meant to be
All the things that you said
I don't hold you responsible
I needed to get myself together
And that's what I've gone and done
And that's what I've gone and done
And that's what I've gone and done
And now I'm here right now
And my life has just begun
My life has just begun!

This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
This time I'm gonna get it right
