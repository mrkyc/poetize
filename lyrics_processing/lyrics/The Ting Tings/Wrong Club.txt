If you can't move your feet
You wanna stand with a woman
You wanna stand with me
If you don't seem to fit in
You wanna take some cover
You wanna leave with me

Did I ever tell you about the way that I wanna feel
Giving it up and fly away
Did I ever tell you about the good times that you get
Don't know if you got another day

Hey! I'm in the wrong club
Listening to this shit
Hey! I'm in the wrong life
Someone get me out of it

And if you wanna come in
We can sit on boxes
I keep everything
And if you're standing in the corner
You can tell me you don't wanna talk
And I tell you how it's always been
You might also like
Did I ever tell you about the way that I wanna feel
Giving it up and fly away
Did I ever tell you about the good times that you get
Don't know if you got another day

Hey! I'm in the wrong club
Listening to this shit
Hey! I'm in the wrong life
Someone get me out of it

I ain't moving though the beat is on
Everyone's gonna let me know it
Get me out somewhere I belong
Come with me, we can overthrow it
What's the matter with the crazy fool
Keep it in or I can go and show
No DJ never saved my life

Hey! I'm in the wrong club
Listening to this shit
(DJ never saved my life)
I'm in the wrong life
Someone get me out of this
Hey! I'm in the wrong club
Listening to this shit
I'm in the wrong life
Everyone's gonna let me know it
Come with me, we can overthrow it
Deep within I can always show it
Ooooh oh!
The DJ never saved my life
Everyone's gonna let me know it
Come with me, we can overthrow it
Deep within I can always show it
Ooooh oh!
Everyone's gonna let me know it
Come with me, we can overthrow it
Deep within I can always show it
