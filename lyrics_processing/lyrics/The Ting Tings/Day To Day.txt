When you wanna play in the sun
If you wanna share what you find
When you've got a lot in your mind
You can say what you wanna say
(Say what you wanna say)
When you gotta be somewhere else
If your gonna travel the world
If you wanna send me a line
When you've gotta hide all the time
You can do what you wanna do
Everyday we'd mean it, respect it
Put it out, neglect it
Talk it through and face it
Tear it up, replace it
Win some, lose some
Find out we used some
Bend the rules and have fun
Someone you can count on
You could be my friend if we had a bit in common
Honesty, trouble free, someone to depend on
You could be my friend if you wasn't such a flyer
Staying alive, taking a dive
You could've been a good friend of mine

Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
When you need some to blame
When you know they'll be there again
In a world messed up for me
I gotta find some loyalty
And be what you wanna be
So you took it out on someone
Nothing that can't be undone
If you wanna turn up the light
If you think everything's right
(Do what you wanna feel)
Everyday when you mean it, respect it
Put it out, neglect it
Talk it through and face it
Tear it up, replace it
Win some, lose some
Find out we use some
Bend the rules and have fun
Someone you can count on
You could be my friend if we had a bit in common
Child's play, roll in the hay, someone to depend on
You could be my friend if you wasn't such a flyer
Staying alive, taking a dive
You could've been a good friend of mine
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
You can call, you can go
If you fall, you will know
How to feel, be for real
Staying alive, taking a dive
You could've been a good friend of mine
Child's play, roll in the hay, someone to depend on
Honesty, trouble free
You could've been a good friend of mine
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
Day to day, day to day to day
