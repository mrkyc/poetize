Four-letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin', not keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back, every day the same
Don't wanna be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

They call me "hell"
They call me Stacey
They call me "her"
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary, Jo, Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
You might also like
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standin' up against the wall
Keep fa-falling, these heels that keep me borin'
Gettin' clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away, listen to me, oh no
And though I'm dressed up, out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

They call me "hell" (First, it was in my head)
They call me Stacey (And now it's in my mind)
They call me "her" (Call a preacher, get some words)
They call me Jane (And get some time in)
That's not my name (And though I realised)
That's not my name (I cannot emphasise)
That's not my name (Sittin' 'round with just a promise)
That's not my name (Nothing binding)
They call me quiet (However, can't you see?)
But I'm a riot (Living so desperately)
Mary, Jo, Lisa (A standing joke)
Always the same (That I provoke a one-liner)
That's not my name (Instead of sing-a-long)
That's not my name (This song is monotone)
That's not my name (I gotta get some soul)
That's not my name (I gotta get some feeling)
Are you calling me "darlin'"?
Are you calling me "bird"?
Are you calling me "darlin'"?
Are you calling me "bird"?

They call me "hell" (Are you calling me "darlin'"?)
They call me Stacey
They call me "her"
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet (Are you calling me "bird"?)
But I'm a riot

That's not my name
