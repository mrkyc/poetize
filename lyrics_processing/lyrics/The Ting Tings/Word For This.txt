I got twenty emotions rolled into one
I got millions of ideas but I ain't got none
What's the word I need to say now?
It's been on the tip of my tongue all day now

There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good

Now, I keep falling, I hit the ground
But I can't work out if I throw myself down
I'm a stick in the mud, can't get me moving
Don't give me a branch or you might just lose it

There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
You might also like
You know that you're doing it and I know that you know I do
There should be a word for this
It's not I'm rendered speechless, it's just not invented and you can't teach us
There should be a word for this

I got twenty emotions rolled into one
And I got a million of ideas but I can't find none
What's the word I need to say now?
It's been on the tip of my tongue all day now

There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good
There should be a word for this, when you shoot but you miss
But it feels good, don't know why it feels good

There should be a word for this
