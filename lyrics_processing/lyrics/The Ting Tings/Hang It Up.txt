My friends, they get me higher and higher
They're killing me with friendly fire
We meet beneath the cactus tree
But walking on spikes just ain't for me

My friends ain't got to worry more
They meet outside the corner store
And walk the pavement, miss the cracks
I'd join them if I could relax
Look for tricks when you don't have a thing
Live like a hermit if you wanna be king
People say it's not worth the wait
Everybody loves somebody to hate

I'm not gonna go and rush this through my veins
Blow them up while looking for this again
Punk rock ain't in division
Send all the wicked kings to prison
I wanna write about setting something free
All the changes drive us back to sea
And this is all about starting out again
Same old, same old, never the same, the same
You might also like
My friends one by one get a job
Meet boys in cars and get a dog
Throw parties, we sit on the ground
I'd rather they just let me down
People say it's not worth the wait
Everybody loves somebody to hate

And you can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up

Could have been a lawyer, take what you can
Never been happy since time began
It's getting kinda heavy, I'm a body full of bad bones
Buried in the back yard, cover me in flagstones
You got the time, they all can wait
You wanna stop talking? 'Cause it's not too late
Aquarium, stare at 'em
Everybody loves somebody to hate
Break it, make it, you can make the break
Back and for fuck sake, just make it great
Intake, don't fake, gonna let go (Give it up, ya mothafucker)
Make all the changes that you need to make
Stand back, give it up, ain't life a bitch?
No-one makin' you just you for this
Insane else is failure maintain
Time for you to rearrange
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
This time maybe you can hang it up
You can hang it up, you can hang it up
