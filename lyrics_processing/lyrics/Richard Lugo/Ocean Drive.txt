Then something inside just takes over me
And i can't stop thinkin about it
I know i can live without it
How can I forget the way she approached me
I don't know where so graceful and slowly
Totally controlling me with every groove
Now I just gotta be everywhere that she
It's because I long for that special feeling
That touched me oh so deep
Moves all the way through me baby
I don't think that i can ever get enough
Enough of her love
So come
Chorus
Come with me to a place I know
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive
Where they dance all night till the morning light
Senorita, Senorita
You might also likeNever again will I feel so lonely
She's in my heart i'm never alone
She talks to me when i am sad and
Good times are as close as by
This sweet melody that i've never heard
So many i know are in love with her
But i don't care she was placed here
For everyone
Now I just gotta be everywhere that she is
It's because I long for that special feeling
That touched me oh so deep
Moves all the way through me baby
I don't think that i can ever get enough
Enough of her love
So come
Chorus
Come with me to a place I know (come on baby)
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go (ooh!)
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live (always live!)
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive (Ocean Drive)
Where they dance all night till the morning light
Senorita, Senorita
Come with me to a place I know (come on baby)
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go (come on baby)
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live (people are solive)
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive (on Ocean Drive)
Where they dance all night till the morning light
