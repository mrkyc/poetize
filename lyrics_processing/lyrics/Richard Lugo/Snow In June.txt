You still won't call me and baby we still ain't speaking
It hurts my heart
Just to be a part
And know that you ain't missing me at all
I wear a smile when I see you to keep from crying
I said I didn't really need you but now I'm trying
To fill the void and find the road
Which leads me back to you
Cause everytime I fool myself to think that I am truly over you
Girl i hear a song, or i see someone that reminds me of you
Chorus
So How can there be snow in june
How can it be night no moon?
Perfect skies without the blue
How can there be me without no you?
Just like trees depend on leaves
Girl i need your love to breathe
Missing you is all i do
How can there be me without no you?
Yeah
My days are empty and nights they are so lonely
I try to be with another but she don't know me
And it's a shame trying to play the game
When I know she is not the one I need
I'd spend a million whole dollars just to be with you
Revisit all those good times when love was brand new
You're the best i must confess
Let's make it like it was
You might also likeCuz everytime i pull myself to think that i'm truly over you
Girl i hear a song, or i see someone that reminds me of you
Chorus
So How can there be snow in june
How can there be light no moon?
Perfect skies without the blue
How can there be me without no you?
Just like trees depend on leaves
Girl i need your love to breathe
Missing you is all i do
How can there be me without no you?
Bridge:
When the chips are down, and no one's around to erase the tears you cry
I want to be the one who's there to make it right. Whoa
I'm standing in a crowded room but still I feel so cold and all alone
Can we make amends and be back friends I need you don't you know
Don't you know.....
Chorus to fade
(sing la dum da da dum da da dum da dum da da
La dum da da dum da da dum da dum da da
Without the blue, whoa
La dum da da dum da da dum da dum da da
La dum da da dum da da dum da da, da da
