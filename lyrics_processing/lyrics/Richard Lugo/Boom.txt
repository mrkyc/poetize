Something about a Friday night
That makes me want to get excited
Knowing that the weekend's near
Just does it to me everytime
I get fresh 'cause the girls they like that
One with me, another on deck
Pull up to the curb
And put the system up to ten like
Boom
I love it when the speakers pop like
Boom
Got the girls droppin' like it's hot like
Boom
Everybody on the floor just sing along with me
Repeat

Yes I'm trying to find her
Looking for the girl
Who makes my heart go boom
There is no denying
If she has what I like then
I will get the girl who's really got that boom
We got the whole place on lock now
So crunk that we just can't stop now
So many fly chicks to choose from
But I think that I found the one
Who can handle what I'm giving
She knows how to get it, get it
Breaking it down on me
From the bottom to the top like
Boom
I love it when the speakers pop like
Boom
Got the girls droppin' like it's hot like
Boom
Everybody on the floor just sing along with me
Repeat
We can get it started
Yes I'm trying to find her
Looking for the girl
Who makes my heart go boom
There is no denying
If she has what I like then
I will get the girl who's really got that boom
Repeat
Boom, she makes me go
Boom, she makes me go
Boom, she makes me go
Sing along with me
Come on
Repeat 3x
We can get it started
Yes I'm trying to find her
Looking for the girl
Who makes my heart go boom
There is no denying
If she has what I like then
I will get the girl who's really got that boom
