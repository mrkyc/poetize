I switch my bitches with the homie, with the switcharoo
I wrapped the brick up, served the dummy with the switcharoo
Out with the old, in with the new
Still stacking money, all my hundreds blue
The Blue Benjamin

Thumbin through the Benjamin's
Paper cuts all on my tips
Servin bags of gas (Good Gas!)
Switcharoo right in the Jag'
MPA Jefe I got on my tag
All of my bitches like, "I dream of Genie"
All of my bitches are bad
Suckin' my dick while I'm swervin' the Lamborghini
Switcharoo whips on they ass
200, digital dash
Peruvian cocaine
Hand me the pot and the beater
I'm whippin' the cake, Anna Mae
Million dollar, trap spot in the A
Young nigga's shoulder strappin AK's
Too cool, 
Killin' the image of 
My dick in two bitches they know my name
Longway Hefner, now they know my name
The blue benjamin, now the blue M&M
I'm rubba-band rackin' em' everyday
A different pack comin' in from the bay
You lil bitty bitch, I'm a dealer
PeeWee longway done fucked all types of race
You lil bitty bitch, I'm a flipper
You might also like
I switch my bitches with the homie, with the switcharoo
I wrapped the brick up, served the dummy with the switcharoo
Out with the old, in with the new
Still stacking money, all my hundreds blue

I got them old hundreds, ew ones the way
Young and road runnin', servin' white yay
Bitch, bite bay, guess she might, aye
Ooh, I think she likes me, yeah, she might, aye
Them blue benjamins
I'm tellin that bitch that I'm gettin' it in, work
Toastin' lean like Hen' when the pint come in
Bat-cam on my Benz, smack-cam, I'm a pimp, bitch
Wipe down my Margiela's, fuck her like Kiesha
On belly, she young and she ready
Switch that bitch up with the camp
Tell that bitch Longway gon' vamp
I'm Michael Vick fuckin' with Falcons, now I got Eagles
A big dog like me very rare
VVS diamonds, that make you just stare
Look at them pointers, lookin' just like Stunna
Ice, bling bling, in the winter, the summer
I'm on Comcast, I'm on so many channels
I switch my bitches with the homie, with the switcharoo
I wrapped the brick up, served the dummy with the switcharoo
Out with the old, in with the new
Still stacking money, all my hundreds blue
