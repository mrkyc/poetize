Huh, Thugger, Longway
Stoner, Stoner !

When I whip dope I'm looking to break my wrist
When I whip dope I'm looking to break my wrist
When I whip dope I smell the venomous fish
I'm Donald Trump, you think I won't fire my bitch

Break it down, speed it up, break it down, speed it up
Breaking my wrist tryna double up
Break it down, speed it up, break it down, speed it up
Breaking my wrist tryna double up
Break it down, speed it up, break it down, speed it up
Breaking my wrist tryna double up
Break it down, speed it up, break it down, speed it up
Breaking my wrist tryna double up

Whippin' the fuck out the dough with the beater
I'm breaking my wrist tryna double up
Speed it up, break it down, speed it up
I'm shifting the gears in the Bentley truck
I'm Donald Trump I just fire my bitch
These bitches know that I don't give a fuck
I call Young Thugger to hit 'em up
I told 'em buck fifty now big ups
I got 'em son, like I'm from New-York
Sixty-five hundred for her brand New-York
Louis scarf wrap me, I'm Jamaican tough
Double cup burberry I pour with the bucks
Nigga drop down on you with that wagon
And you do not shoot it, boy you know you get stuck
Ain't talkin' fit, but I just bought a truck
Ran up my money, broke boy call it luck
The brick wrapped in ribbon, these black powder incence
My trap house is boomin' I slow it up, speed it up
MC Hammer diamonds dancin' VV'd up
OG batch stuffed in the pantry, gon' beat it up
Bitch look like Marilyn Monroe from the feet up
My bitch want me to bare-back her when I beat it up
My clip got a double stack'a who want beef'a ?
I can't pay no double for the reefer
Longway

Touchdown on them birds, singing like McKnight
The 3 amigos in my chain like to fight
