Whole lotta lean in my motherfucking piss
Whole lotta gas in my motherfucking piss
Then a couple gas packs in my motherfuckin' kit
Woke up in a new Bugatti with a brick of molly
Blue Benjamin's all in my pocket, runnin' around the fuckin' lobby
She wanna Nicki Minaj
She wannna fuck on my squad
Lil bitch, go ahead, go hard
Put it on hood, then everybody gnarly
Fuckin' on Holly like Bob Barker
Ya'll nigga fake, got a counterfeit marker
Habitat housing turn him into a trick
BD break him down on benches
BD beat him in the face if he snitch
Steaming body up like Hitler
Look at how that chopper just flip 'em
Universal clip, presidential whip, we with the shit
Pop or die, motherfucker
Go 8 mile with that cutter
Leave his ass with them buggers
Pussy boy thought I was butter
Bumboclaat, Jamaican butters
Come through like they undercovers
Fuckin' your bitch undercovers
Looking for your bitch, you must love her
Ain't too many bitches I ain't fuck
Punching the pussy, uppercut, beat it up
I done come a long way, double up
