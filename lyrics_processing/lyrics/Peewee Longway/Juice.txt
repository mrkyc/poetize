50 some bands on my juice
Spikes on top of Jimmy Choos
So fresh that I made the news
Made a million in the trap, dealin' fool
20 bands in my locker at school
Me and Longway too cool for you fools
MPA, YSL, what it do?
We don't play fair or play by your rules
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
With a bad bitch, smokin' on fruit
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
In the foreign whip, pullin' up, juice
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
We the shit, Thug Life my clique
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
I think I'm 2Pac, got the juice
I got the juice

I got the boots
I got a coupe, I got no roof
I got a boo
She got a boo with way bigger boobs
Longway and Thugger
We switcharoo bitches and we like to fuck em' by the two
Jumanji, Jumanji, Giuseppe Zanotti
The leprechaun bitches move
I walk in the club then I dab it
My coupe outside all filled up with gadgets
Get way too much green like a salad
Wrap it and ship it the package
Young nigga's trappin' and rappin'
I got the pints stacked up in my cabinet
Young rich nigga live lavish
I'm doing it for the kids
I'm spending a hundred bands, just to fuck up my kidneys
Sneaking, geeking on the molly, know she feelin'
I got the juice, pull up Actavis too
With your bitch, rollin' up the good fruit
Sippin' and spillin', pour 8 in the deuce
Lean, lean, lean
I'm Uncle Phil for the week
I got Pints only for me
Smokin' on G
Tell uncle Snoop what it do, it is too plain to see
Young Thug, Longway, lil bitch, check my Feng Shui
I got the juice in the booth, we can turn the fuck up any day

How the fuck I can't afford?
My molly white like a tourist
Her booty fatter than Norbit
I told your bitch that she was gorgeous
Just a lil something to do when I get bored
Might pull up, get head in the Porsche
Light the fuck up, leave the bitches, no torch
Hundred bricks stuffed in the Honda Accord
Hundred grand inside my pockets, San-Tan molly
I'mma make your bitch snort it
Peewee Longway, the Blue M&M
Made a million dollar dealin' food
My style is safari, she instant my body
And put spikes on top of my Jimmy Choo's
Got spikes on my Louie Vuitton's
My diamonds they hittin' and fight like a hadouken
That pussy so wet, I think she got shot in the coochie with the uzi
Young Thugga and Longway don't fuck with dudes
We playin' with choppers, making breaking news
No doctor prescription but we got the juice
Colossal livin', Double R Peekaboo
50 some bands on my juice

So fresh that I made the news
Made a million in the trap, dealin' fool
