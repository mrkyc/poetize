Work that
Jerk that
Now work that
Jerk that
Now take that
Take that
Now make that

Now bring it back
Bring it back

Face down, tune it up
You want this money, then back it up
Pre-Verse: Chingo Bling
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Chingo Bling in the house, que te pasa

With a big booty thick girl jiggle like Playdoe
One eye closed and far away, she like J-Lo
You might also like(Verse 1)
She go hard, but that one go harder
Oooh Lord, must be something in the water
It's Chingo Bling, going hotten than salsa
Bout to run the game, playboy, you better boss up (Sweat)
Sweat til it smells like barcas (Sweat)
Sweat til it smells like patas (Sweat)
It's Sabado, ponle la bata
Habre la boca y taste this horchata
Repeat Chorus
(Verse 2)
New skirt
Just got her hair done
What about the panies?
No, she don't wear none
Here my number
Call me long distance
Can't call Mexico? Buy some more minutes
Take a picture, put that on the wall
Cause them kind of boots, they ain't got on the mall
I'm V.I.P., we ain't s'pposed to be smokin'
But guess what, laws was meant to be broken
Wetback
Just like Gilligan
Worth a million, country like (???)
She got moist when she noticed the paint job
A pimp by night, but tamales my day job
Repeat Chorus

Vieja
Ponte la bata, es Sabado
Break:
(All in background)
 Horchata, jamaica, tres leches, tamarindo
If you see la miga, you better tell Chingo
Say chile con carne
 Chile con carne
 Say you don't got no diamonds
 You don't got no diamonds
 Say chile con carne
 Chile con carne
 Cause Chingo tiene hambre
 Cause Chingo tiene hambre
 Say gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
Gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
Say gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
Gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
Repeat Pre-Verse
Repeat Chorus
All right, all right, all right
A lot of you guys don't know the real definition of manosa
Some of you manosas, don't even know you're manosa
A manosa is
Any girl that does nasty stuff
That shows her stuff
For some moneys
That's right
The pesos
The counterfeit
The cheddar cheese
Chalupas
Repeat Chorus

Chingobling dot com sa la lavan, se toman la agua
Peace out!
Hey you manosa, pick up your money off the floor, you're making a mess
