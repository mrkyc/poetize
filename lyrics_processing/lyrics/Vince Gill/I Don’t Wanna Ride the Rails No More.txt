Well, I've been hoppin' freight trains all my life
I woke up cold and hungry, in the middle of the night
I've been on the wrong end of a drunkard's night
And nowhere to send the letters that I write
And I'll bet I've seen most every single town
But never stopped quite long enough to ever hang around
'Cause that whistle makes a mighty lonesome sound
It's been on my mind, I'd love to settle down

And I don't wanna ride the rails no more
I wanna know a woman's love worth dyin' for
Hear children playin' through an old screen door
No, I don't wanna ride the rails no more

The train's pullin' out at half past 9
The waitress said, "Hey stranger, how 'bout one more glass of wine?"
We kept talkin' and we lost all track of time
The train pulled out, left us there behind

And I don't wanna ride the rails no more
I wanna know a woman's love worth dyin' for
Hear children playin' through an old screen door
No, I don't wanna ride the rails no more

For the first time in my life, I didn't run
I felt your arms around me and my rambling days were done
Somethin' changed deep inside of me
The radio played "Love Is All You Need"

Oh, I don't wanna ride the rails no more
I wanna know a woman's love worth dyin' for
Hear children playin' through an old screen door
No, I don't wanna ride the rails no more
And I don't wanna ride the rails no more
I wanna know a woman's love worth dyin' for
Hear children playin' through an old screen door
No, I don't wanna ride the rails no more
No, I don't wanna ride the rails no more
