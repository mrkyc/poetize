Snaf fudged the crowd with a beat so thick you could touch the sound
And cats's like, "Baje what you up to now?"
I'm like, "It's all work dog, no time to jerk off,"
Uh uh, tryna' hit the road tough
See a little  before this shit blows up
Blows up, blows up what a morbid state
Sir reality's a bitch and you forced to date her
So don't bother with the flowers, rings and the candy that won't come in handy
Between me an you that's like giving more to Mandy
She don't need that shit so don't bring that shit
Good golly it's unnecessary
I'm tryin see green like  verde
Then again not tryin that hard
Still sleeping in a tent in my momma backyard
Backyard, backyard with a funny funny guy
I know a couple guys wanna punch him in the eye
Uh uh, But they never see me 'cuz I move so fast like 3 CD'S
Here take one, while you sitting on the shelf
I'm spitting 'cuz I'm sick I ain't spitting for my health
Hock hock hock a loogie, it's Junk Science gonna cop the movie

I want you to jump into my brain
Come on get to know me
We could have a party
I bring the soda, and you bring the pop rocks
Oh god what a mistake but they such a nice crowd, Snaf cut 'em a break
You might also like
Me and Snaf explosive combination
Came to see the cash in gross denominations
Uhhh, whatever that means
Dumb as a disease we the clever vaccine
So, like I said before, we gotta be the truth 'cuz we get ignored
What an underground thing to say, I woke up feeling fresh I'ma sing today
Just like fly me to the moon and why not?
They think a got a  what they think that I got, I got, I got
But that don't make no sense come on here pop, why ya' face so tense?
Well, moving right along, we ain't right and wrongs we just writing songs
Drop a line if you feel it cuz it's nice to know
We drop records in the winter cuz it's ice to thaw
Consider it a public service, , a little bit of fucking courtesy
See we just having fun when a lot of raps kids really having none
Aw, but that's ok, 'cuz we send it off flying like a glass of OJ
And I'm, and I'm still a bit hung over
Fuck it get the kits and kats and come over

I want you to jump into my brain
Come on get to know me
We could have a party
I bring the soda, and you bring the pop rocks
