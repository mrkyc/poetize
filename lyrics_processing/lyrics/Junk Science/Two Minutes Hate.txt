Yo, yeah, yo yeah
This is my house, don't try to enter
We not friends dog, we not even friendsters
And this is my space, it's my home
So give me my five feet like AC and 
'Cuz I hate being told what I'm supposed to do
Especially when they standin' all close to you
And their breath smells like a dead guy
Matter fact I'll catch the red eye
'Cuz I'm sick of living in this neighborhood
Where everybody rich and they fronting like they not
And  don't got, fronting like they do got
White kids walking 'round dressing like 2Pac
Oh my god, what happened here?
I woke up one day and everybody rapping weird
Hip-hop, one thing should be given
Personality is not a substitute for rythm
So don't try it
Matter fact put your face to that fryer can't say I won't fry it
Right down to the very follicle
Yeah I'm a hater, the most diabolical!

Tom Hater, hate on yo' ass
I'm that rat in your , I'm that snake in the grass
I'm that superpowered hater from some place in the past
And I pop up now and then just to say that you wack!
You might also like
Yo, gimme those beats I'ma choke them words
Got ya kicking accapella like spoken word
While we gotta impeach the president
My tax dollars increased the defecit
Just kidding, I ain't paying taxes
That shit is wack like over-sized hatses
Size 10, you's a genuine baller
Wow, congratulations your head looks smaller!
Why everybody gotta be Famous Amos
You ain't investigating nothing
You's a aimless 
And that's a rookie mistake kids
'Cuz it's just not the way that a real cookie tastes
And I know, 'cuz it's flamed over a hot stove
Taking all that good stuff that's why we ain't got dough!

Tom Hater, hate on yo' ass
I'm that rat in your , I'm that snake in the grass
I'm that superpowered hater from some place in the past
