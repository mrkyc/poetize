You know they said this music's not for us
And that's one of them things you just got to trust
But if you don't trust them, then you won't believe that
Ever since I was a kid, all I heard was feedback
Like "Mike is a wigger"
I'm just trying to make my world feel a little bigger
Plus I ain't trying to be black
Please don't believe that
It's enough trouble trying to be white, y'all, that's a deep fact
Besides, there's all these white folks trying to hate on my style
Because I don't like their tight clothes and their weird music
But when I'm contemplating, they're just mad because I'm ain't chocked full of hating
To be really good, you gots to hate everybody
And these people supposed to look out for everybody?
At least in elected office, it's white dudes
But if you ain't rich like them, then they don't like you
Uh huh, yep yep you know it
You still white even if you is a poet
Racism, that's the name of the game
And you couldn't escape that if you was David Blaine
Know what I'm sayin?

Gonna go back to where I started, tell you what I'm gonna do
Oh, What I'm gonna do, telling you what I'm gonna do
Gonna go back to where I started, tell you what I'm gonna do
Oh, What I'm gonna do, telling you what I'm gonna do

Made my first mix tape at the age of eight
How sweet the sound, like Amazing Grace
It was DMC, and Kool Moe Dee, and Beastie Boys and Public Enemy
Say "Yo, it's not a phase, B, Hip Hop raised me
Take a look around if you think that's crazy"
That's why we respect them so much
So before you check the mic, you needa check your stuff
You needa check your pops and check your granddad
Nothing's gonna change cause you let them pants sag
Claiming speech, like hell I'm not sure 
Like, she ain't got an ass, she just got good posture
It's the same thing, it's even worse
If you racist on the low, telling fucked up jokes
So when the black kids step on the spot, you shut down
Run across the room just to give them a pound
Now that's bitch ass material, stop running
You're barely even fooling yourself, it's not funny
Need to turn off the tele', needa stop watching "Belly"
You need to stop with all the Machiavelli
It's a fetish, see you don't like the fact
That if you wanna be black there's nothing whiter than that
There's a history there, for real, so you might
Wanna learn about it before you pick up a mic
Or tell another racist joke, cause I figure
You'll end up being just another House Wigger
So why did the white kid cross the road?
He didn't, the roads not crossable
