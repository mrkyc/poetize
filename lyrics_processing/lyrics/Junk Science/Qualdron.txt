But, there is trouble inside the moon too
Inside? The air?
Not that, the Selenites have almost exhausted the resources of the moon's interior
They mean to try and colonize the Earth!

It's not what you expect
It's not what you was asking for
Matter of fact it just is what it is
You can live what you give
If you given the gift
Cuz alot of kids live in the fridge
And you got, lots to eat
But you locked on the inside
Nobody heat
It was not on the invite
Joyless and cold
The leather stay crispy
WHITE PEOPLE
One of life's hella great mysteries
Darwin, drop bombs
Renovate swiftly
I got the yoga fire
So levitate with me
Ah, ah levitate with me
Buh-buh-buh boom bobby with me
It's not what you expect
It's not really a sect
But or it's more what you go to confession for
Used to talk more shit than people on message boards
When I was 19 living in Ecuador
In the rains forests, the same tourists
Still keep taking this time to sing tor-toise
Still keep making it rhyme 'cuz Baje raw is
Talk like Yoda because Yoda's from Brooklyn
But I ain't in the  game
I manufacture pudding
Call me Mr. Kozy Shack
Get off the bosey act
It's eight glasses, the flows intact
Plus he's stuck between yadda yadda
Rocking this place
The illest rapper out there like Rock Kim Shakespeare
Do it how it's been done, plus how it might be
Make's girlfriend's boyfriend wanna fight me
When he do the thing right
Like he was least spite
Cursed at reversed like socks red emphatically
Not dead, animatedly
Hot fresh pies on the window sill
Go to modernshark dot com forward-slash free mouth fulla ink
Watch 'em autograph beats
It's not what you respect
It's not what you respect it's more what you protect
More what you expect it's more who you protect
You might also like
'Cuz you could be like, you could just keep askin' like
Like why me?
And I could say
Dude you were born like this
It's just a roll of the dice dice dice dice
Nobody gets a 4, 5, 6
Even sometimes that's what it seem like like
Homegirl you were born like this
And I know it's not fair fair fair fair
But if that's not what life is
Then tell me what life is and we could both be millionaires
Sometimes I sit back like the Buddha sat
Thinking how 90's hip-hop might've ruined my life
Then I pause... and I stop being stupid
Can't blame the messenger
Can't shoot cupid
He's just a little dude playing with his arrows
You the one that's jumping off the falls in a barrel
Baje One, Snafu collabo
Youth life-forms came to analyze the data like D.A.R.Y.L
The ill Darryl no American-Apparel
Never got along with kids who's vision's all narrow
Y'know, the one's who's at the table
Everyday and never wanted
These the one's who take some lemonade and get some lemons from it
Though that's borderline chemically impossible
God bless intelligence they find a way to follow through
Not me, not him, not us
Huh, raps god busts and raps you gotta trust
