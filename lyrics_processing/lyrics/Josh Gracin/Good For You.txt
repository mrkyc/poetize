I don't give a damn what you're smoking I still wanna taste your lips
We can stay as long as you wanna as long as I'm the one you're leaving with
And I know I've told you before but baby I'm feeling it
And I'll tell you a million times more 'til you're tired of hearing it

So why don't you try me?
I won't burn you like a cigarette when you light me
I'll be the whiskey going to your head on a Friday
I'll be that high you can't lose and you won't want to
More than likely, you're out there telling all your friends that you like me
But you won't give in you just keep fighting
Like love is something bad to do
But I know I'd be good for you

Your self destructing not trusting each other won't work with me
'Cause I'm not a, who you been with pretending I'm somebody I'm not gonna be

So why don't you try me?
I won't burn you like a cigarette when you light me
I'll be the whiskey going to your head on a Friday
I'll be that high you can't lose and you won't want to
More than likely, you're out there telling all your friends that you like me
But you won't give in you just keep fighting
Like love is something bad to do
I know I'd be good for you
You might also like
So why don't you try me?
I won't burn you like a cigarette when you light me
I'll be the whiskey going to your head on a Friday
I'll be that high you can't lose
More than likely, you're out there telling all your friends that you like me
But you won't give in you just keep fighting
Like love is something bad to do
I'd be good for you
