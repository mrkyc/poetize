Sometimes I feel like I need, to shake myself, to wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin' through my life
It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly goin' numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by

I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I want to live

Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard my heart
'Til I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall
So I could feel the ground beneath me
Really taste this air I'm breathin'
And know that I'm alive
You might also like
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I want to live

Somethin' deep inside
Keeps sayin' life is like a vapor
It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye

I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I want to live
I want to take every breath I can get
