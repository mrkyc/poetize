To wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleep walkin through my life
Its like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly goin' numb inside
I dont like who I'm becomin'
I know I've got to do somethin'
Before my life passes right by
I wanna cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird
Roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I wanna live
Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard
To guard my heart
Well I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building up this ivory tower
Now that I'm in it I keep wishin' it would fall
You might also likeSo I could feel the ground beneath me
Really taste this air I'm breathin
And know that I'm alive
I wanna cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird
Roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I wanna live
I wanna live
Something deep inside keeps saying life is like a vaper
Its gone in just the twinklin' of an eye
I wanna cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird
Roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I wanna take every breath i can get
I wanna live
