Always had a little restless in my soul
Had to get a little lost to find my home
Used to think I'd have to go real far
To find what you and I got here in our front yard

So come here, baby, I just need your love
If I got you, I got more than enough
Yeah, my head can get to spinning
From the world and the junk that's in it
They can keep all that stuff
If I can end up with a front porch kind of love

I can see us turning ninety
Wild child nights long gone behind me
You making fun of my old grey hair
God, I hope that I end up there

Just a bunch of wood and some rusty nails
Got a pretty good view of these rolling hills
I'm sure it ain't some fool's paradise
But I sure hope it's mine, for the rest of my life

Come here, baby, I just need your love
If I got you, I got more than enough
Yeah, my head can get to spinning
From the world and the junk that's in it
They can keep all that stuff
If I can end up with a front porch kind of love

With the stars out and the summer wind
I'll look at you and be a kid again
Sweet tea and some rocking chairs
God, I hope that I end up there

So come here, baby, I just need your love
