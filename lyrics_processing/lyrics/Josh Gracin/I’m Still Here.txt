I'm right there
Watching you dance in the sand under that cabana
A couple of margaritas
Like no one else could see us

Well I'm right there
Holding your hand in the stands
Petty on the speakers
Everybody singing
I knew I'd never leave ya

Oh you got a piece of me I can never get back
Well I got a memory that holds on to that
Last night when we made promises we couldn't keep
Goodbye taillights down the street
No more of you holding on to me
And oh, what I love the most about you made you go
I'm kickin' myself cause I should've known
You were only mine for awhile
You were free and you were wild
Where we left off, you moved on
Can't believe you're gone
But if you care, I'm still there
You might also like
Well I'm right there
Midnight glow, back row at a drive-in movie
Whatever we were seein'
We still ain't seen it

Well I'm right there
My old truck pickin' you up in your new dress
It made such a mess
There's still glitter on the seats

Oh you got a piece of me I can never get back
And I got a memory that holds on to that
Last night when we made promises we couldn't keep
Goodbye taillights down the street
No more of you holding on to me
And oh, what I love the most about you made you go
I'm kickin' myself cause I should've known
You were only mine for awhile
You were free and you were wild
Where we left off, you moved on
Can't believe you're gone
But if you care, I'm still there
Oh I'm still there
I'm right there
My front porch at sundown
I can almost see you now

Oh you got a piece of me I can never get back
And I got a memory that holds on to that
Last night when we made promises we couldn't keep
Goodbye taillights down the street
No more of you holding on to me
And oh, what I love the most about you made you go
I'm kickin' myself cause I should've known
You were only mine for awhile
You were free and you were wild
Where we left off, you moved on
Can't believe you're gone
But if you care, I'm still there
Oh I'm still there
I ain't going nowhere
