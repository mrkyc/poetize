Hatred grows for Sam
The Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan
With his goal to control, be number one
Making modern day slaves of everyone
There's this plan to protect, in fact
While the rich get fat
They'll always send the brother in combat
To kill another man from another land
Man it's a shame being a pawn in the game so the rich gain
Another murder in the name of democracy
Land of the free with policies of slavery
I'm laughing hard - The draft card I watch it burn
They want to see my ass dead, well it's his turn
That's why they're calling me a communist, a socialist
Ain't that a bitch?
I'd rather be a commie than a fascist
I fight the system of oppression who's profession
Is aggression on others for the possession of money
And of course they think it's funny 'cause they're worldwide
So many millions are the victims of a genocide
I'm going crazy, all I do is see and stand by
While the pigs commit another fucking homicide
So I'm waiting for the day to rush the White House
I'm saying fuck it, kill the puppet, take his head out
Until that day I'm dedicated to open eyes
Who organize the revolutionaries of the mind
And yet we'll soon see the movement reach an apex
A lynch mob with a noose for Sam's neck
Fair retribution for the land that they stole
A whole nation built upon the labor of black folk
He's gonna pay for his crimes to humanity
The ultimate creator of the world's insanity
And yes I'll put a rest to the merchant of death
With a shotgun blast to his chest

We're the victim of a criminal
The victim of a criminal
A message so cynical
I ain't down to be a killer's accomplice
Accessory to murder so I fight to resist this
System of oppression leaving people with no hope
Conspiracy to kill us, lock us up, have us all broke
At the same time say there's equality
For all nationalities in the midst of brutality - yo
Here's the reality while in the United States
Four hundred years of hate and the world's highest murder rate
And it's hard to escape being a  at the pig's 
Resumed and consumed inside the belly of the beast
As have-not's  of the have's
Making billions off poor 'cause we're the permanent underclass
And with no shame we're motivated to rearrange 
And mutilate or simply blow out Sam's brains
With no attendance at his goddamned funeral
Not even one individual
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
Yeah kick that shit
Victim of a criminal
Assembled on the front line what yeah
A message so cynical
Dedicated to a world revolution straight up
Kickin' that shit
A system of a criminal
Yeah you know it's time to kill
Straight up yo
Sick of the genocide
Sick of that man made disease
It's a world wide genocide I'm on the side
Ain't going out like that
Assembled on the front line
People oppressed by the world's entire ruling elite
Comin' on
Bringin' it to ya
Yeah and it ain't no joke
Goin' out with nothing but gunsmoke
Organizing a world revolution
Ten thousand Somalis lying dead in the desert sand
Killed by American humanitarians
Operation Restore Hope - No hope restored
Just another killing field, they slay the poor
And just like Iraq we never see the attack
Or things like the pictures of their bodies be they brown or black
We carried out our routines like some zombies or things
So they believe in every message of the TV screen
The newspapers get filled with propaganda and hype
But you can't believe anything you see, read or write
So much lead we're brain dead and trained to not care
The American Dream becomes the whole world's nightmare
Our future home's nothing but a war of the classes
All of the masses versus the fascists
This is just a plea to save the Earth and all living kind
There ain't much time to find that
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
A message so cynical
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
A message so cynical
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
We're the victim of a criminal
A message so cynical

A message so cynical
We're the victim of a criminal
