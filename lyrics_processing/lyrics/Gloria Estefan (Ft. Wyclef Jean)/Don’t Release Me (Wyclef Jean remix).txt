At the Copa Cabana
Gloria Estefan
With the refugees
Get off the wall
You ready?
This one goes out for the cuban kings and queens
Thugs falling in love
With latin serpentines
I met her at the club, yes down with my pager
Asked her what's her name, she said: Gloria
Where you from: Cuba
What do you do: I'm a singer
She looked at me and said: Do you wanna let go?
No, no
But can I get you a tequila?
She said: Hell no, I'll take a pina colada
With one sip I got her in a spell
I'm huntin' her kin
Like a cheetah hunts a gazelle
I know it's wrong
But I'm waiting for her to break
So I can take over like the devil's advocate
You might also likePlease don't release me, don't release me
From this spell you got me under
Please don't release me, don't release me
From this spell you got me under
You make me feel like I could lose control
I'm gonna lose it right now
You know I feel like I am walking in the clouds
And I don't wanna come down
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Why do we hold on to this love now?
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Got to hold on, baby
Hey yo, wave your hands like this
Shake your feet like this
Clap your hands like this
You know we're live and all that from the Copa Cabana
Please don't release me, don't release me
From this spell you got me under
So, please don't release me
No, don't release me
From this spell you got me under
You want to find the way to paradise
You can take me there
Know I feel like I could, rise above the ground
And I don't wanna come down
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Why do we hold on to this love?
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Yo Gloria
Can I play my guitar in this party?
Gloria is in the place
The east coast is in the place
The west coast is in the place
Why do we hold on to this love?
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Why do we hold on to this love?
I wanna let go
But I can't let go, do you wanna let go?
Got to hold on, baby
I wanna let go
But I can't let go
