These are my ghetto fairytales
Sit back and just listen to what I'm spittin' cause I'm cold
I'm straight reminiscing on all my niggas dead and gone
See when I was young I was just so dumb and didn't know
How quickly the reaper would come and creap up for your soul
I play with them niggas that like to live it by the chase
They told me whatever you do just keep your body safe
Pitbull in the front and my german shepard by the gates
Blowing blunts of that broccoli to keep my body out of space
And I heard bout my nigga they send up to their face
And they sayin' it's probable when the feds investigate
Gotta do what I gotta do while they take my nigga away
Promised you my protection I gotta make a nigga pay
Bustin' in the direction of any mothafucka fake
I burn a nigga to residue, residents up in this place
Now they tell me I'm too ghetto for this shit
I feel like I'm the only rebel in this shit
 These are my ghetto fairytales
These are the tales, my ghetto tales
These are the tales, that I tell so well
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside

Commin' to you live and direct, with revolutionary respect
Keep ya' heads up, eyes open, fists clenched and dig this...
These are the sentences of those that exist
And the condition of the breedin' resistance
Na fuck the formalities for this is rated R for reality
It is what it is and I'm a give it to you the only way I know how to give it
Ain't no second takes or commercial breaks
Where they got us at right now-life lines bend that of love and hate
They talkin' 'bout terrorism-shit...
In our streets it seems that realities of every day is september 11
Being that our lives don't make the headlines
And we never get a correct account of
How many of us they be lockin' up and body baggin' up
We have been given the Voice of the Voices
Now it's gettin back to the point where
On a daily basis we pourin out a lil liqour for the ghetto live-ations
Buy these should be our told testomonies and our safe stories
That other cats won't even speak about
Now, our pain don't never go away
And our teachers don't even want us to know about our real leaders
While we suffer they want somebody else speakin' for us
And while we struggle they want somebody else profiting off of us
Seem like every time we go to the grave somebody gettin paid
This a new age of dealin with plantations
In other words; ghetto translation;
We gotta all ghetto  and those that represent the real
Now it's only right that those that live this shit and feel this shit
Be the ones to reveal this shit
These are the ghetto fairy tales
These are the ghetto fairy tales
