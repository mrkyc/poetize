Some people say "Don't go away, just stay right here"
Some say if you stay at home, you're gonna wind up alone
Now, you know you can't go two different ways
You can't believe everything you hear
And if you always do just what you're told
Then you've got no mind of your own

So if each man has a different plan, let 'em go, let 'em go
You have a power all your own
There's a spirit child inside you, ready for life and I know
It's just waiting to see how you will grow
And when the spirit feels the need to wander, oh, let it go

Sometimes they say the only way is to really sing that song
Sometimes they say, "You're singing that way too loud and too long"
And if they can't make up their minds, then I think I'll make up mine
Whatever way I feel is the only way I'm gonna sing that song

And if people don't seem to like it, that's O.K., let 'em go
Some day they'll sing a song of their own
'Cause there's a spirit child inside 'em, ready for life and I know
It's just waiting to see how they will grow
And when their spirit feels a need to wander, I'm sure they'll go

Some people said, "Try this, it'll make you smile"
Some said, "Don't touch it, you'll end up crying"
Oh, well, it felt so good for a while, but then I saw too many dying
When all they wanted to do was get a little higher

So if the game won't follow through, oh, let it go, let it go
And leave the loaded dice alone
There's a spirit child inside you, ready for life and I know
It's just waiting to see if you will grow

One too many users lose it all
Then there's no one, no one to help them break the fall
It's people just like you, who say, "Oh no, that won't be me"
Well, they end up face down
Is that where you wanted to be?

So if it's gonna bring you trouble, oh, let it go, let it go
Remember that doesn't mean you'll be all alone
'Cause there's a spirit child inside you, ready for life and I know
