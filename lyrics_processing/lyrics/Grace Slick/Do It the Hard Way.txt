She's been living too high, trying to get to heaven at night
They all knew she was bound to go down 'way before she fell
They all know how it feels to try and hold on to the light
They know the darkness of the night sky so well
Oh, but there's just no way to tell her

She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna break right through the sign that says "This is the end of the ride"
She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna shake the hands of time and try to turn back the tide
She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna take whatever she can find until there's no one by her side
And there's no place left to hide

Oh, she said "I'm gonna get more, more out of living every day"
She said "I know how to get more out of life, if I just had more time
If I can just keep on taking when someone else is giving it away
That way the sweet life, that'll be all mine in no time"
But there's just no more time for her

She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna break right through the sign that says "This is the end of the ride"
She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna shake the hands of time and try to turn back the tide
She'll do it the hard way
She's gonna take whatever she can find until there's no one by her side
And there's no place left to hide

She said, "I gotta make 'em all think I'm winning, so I'll just tell 'em lies
That way, I make sure no one ever knows just exactly what I mean
Then I can beat the drums and yell it to the skies
I'm the queen of the nut house, I'm the queen
And I can justify myself, say I been cheated
I'm the only one in this game who knows how to play
And if it weren't for time, I'd never be defeated
But people, places and things, they get in my way
And I don't like what they say

She's gonna keep on doing it, oh, 'til she proves that they're all wrong
She's got to let 'em know she's the exception to the rule
She's got no friends 'cause she thinks she's so damn strong
But she's the only one who doesn't know that she's the fool
So now I'm asking you
