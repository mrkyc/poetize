You gotta reverse that motion when you're with me to ride this ride
Don't hesitate goin' the speed tonight
No time to waste
We can get away
So baby come with me
And I'll fulfill your fantasy

You can get anywhere that you wanna
Tonight it's all on me
Waiting for that bom-bom, bom, bom, bom boy
Come lay it down on me
Now we're together
We gonna be bumpin' up in them streets
I feel the pressure
I got that overdrive you need

You got me right there where where you want me
Your hands on on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here, babe
That's how I like it
Backseat, windows up, that's the way that I like to (Uh)
Backseat, windows up, that's the way that I like to (Uh)
Backseat, windows up, that's the way that I like to (Uh)
That's the way that I like to (Uh)
That's the way that I like to (Uh)

I'm putting in that special order for you, for tonight
You want that on the side
We both grown, so turned on
Put all your love in me
Baby, put all your love in me

You can get anywhere that you want now
Tonight it's all on me
Waiting for that bom-bom, bom, bom, bom boy
Come lay it down on me
Now we're together
We gonna be bumpin' up in them streets
I feel the pressure
I got that overdrive you need

You got me right there where where you want me (Right where)
Your hands on on my body (My body, yeah)
This feels so right (Uh)
Let's park it right here, babe (Right here)
That's how I like it (Oh)
Backseat, windows up, that's the way that I like to (Uh)

I think somebody's watchin', but I don't care
It's just me and you
Let's keep going (Keep goin', keep goin')
The windows fogged up, the car is rockin'
My feet on the dash, we ain't stopping
Uh, right there, don't stop

You got me right here where you want me
Your hands all on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here that's how I like it
(Backseat) Windows up
(Backseat, backseat love)
Backseat, windows up
(Backseat) Windows up
(Backseat) Windows up (That's the way that I like to)
