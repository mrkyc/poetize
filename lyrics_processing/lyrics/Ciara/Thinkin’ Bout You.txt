I've been thinkin' 'bout you

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night
Wonder if I ever cross your mind (Yeah)
Keeping you up in your bed at night (Ooh-ooh)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Uh)

I can't get you off the brain (No)
Loving you is something strange (So strange)
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complainin' (Nope)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm wondering if your love's a game
Just kissing girls and taking names (Tell me)
Is it love or entertainment?

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Ow)
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night
Wonder if I ever cross your mind
Keeping you up in your bed at night (Ooh-ooh)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout, 'bout)
I try to fight it but it's hard to hide ('Bout, 'bout)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Yeah)
You might also like
You're a habit, hard to break
You're more than a heart can take
There's no exit, no escapin' (No)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Maybe you're my destiny (Maybe you're my destiny)
Or maybe just a fantasy (Or maybe just a fantasy)
Maybe it's just my imagination

Boy, I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Ow)
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night (Is it me?)
Wonder if I ever cross your mind (Do I?)
Keeping you up in your bed at night (Yeah)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout, 'bout)
I try to fight it but it's hard to hide ('Bout, 'bout)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Yeah)

Early in the mornin' ('Bout, 'bout)
Think about you all day ('Bout, 'bout)
Late night in the evenin' ('Bout, 'bout)
I can't get you off of my brain ('Bout, 'bout)
Early in the mornin' ('Bout, 'bout)
