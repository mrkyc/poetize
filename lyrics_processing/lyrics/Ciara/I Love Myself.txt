The best thing I could ever do for me is love myself

I was sitting on the bed, Atlanta, Georgia
All alone in my emotions, full of fear
Gotta protect this precious life, I got the future by my side
Be the last time that I cry these tears again, hey

No more drama, no more pain
No drama, no drama, no pain
I'm done making same mistakes, ayy

It's alright, I been to the bottom, and I've seen the end
Wanna forever be together 'til the end
And I found the problem, it starts with me
I figured out now what I want, got what I need
(Ladies, help me sing it out now)

Damn right, yeah, I love myself
I'm never gon' fall 'cause I love myself
Damn right, yeah, I love myself
And I can have it all 'cause I love myself

Check it, now
If loving myself's a job, am I doing it?
Art's a weapon, a resistance, am I using it?
I got two girls, how do I get through to them?
Don't want the 'Gram telling my daughters what beauty is, nah
I ain't raising princesses, I'm raising warriors
Self-love is a bite, keep some extra in the holster
My children, I'm trying to teach them to love themselves
But I can't expect it if I haven't accepted myself
See, if Dad isn't sober, and Dad isn't honest
And Dad can't control it, and Dad got these problems
If Dad is so selfish, and Dad is lying to mama
Then that is gonna have an impact on Dad's daughters
If I'm not right with me, how can I pass it on?
I got a path today, I know, and I cannot get off
And if I'm blinded by the light, then I can't walk with God
Don't wanna realize later He was with me all along
Loving me, being free, bringing peace, leave these wings
Tryna fly to my peak, I reside eye to eye
The divine in my reach as I strive and I seek
Live light, proceed, love me for me
At ease

It's alright, I been to the bottom, and I've seen the end
Wanna forever be together 'til the end
And I found the problem, it starts with me
I figured out now what I want, got what I need
(Ladies, help me sing it out now)
Damn right, yeah, I love myself
I'm never gon' fall 'cause I love myself
Damn right, yeah, I love myself
And I can have it all 'cause I love myself

I'm not tripping, it's not vain, no, I'm not selfish, nope
No more holding back on me, I'm feeling free
Only happy tears I'll cry, I swear, this time, I'll get it right
It's the best thing God could ever do for me, hey

No more drama, no more pain
No drama, no drama, no pain
I'm done making same mistakes, ayy

It's alright, I been to the bottom, and I've seen the end
Wanna forever be together 'til the end
And I found the problem, it starts with me

Damn right, yeah, I love myself
I'm never gon' fall 'cause I love myself
Damn right, yeah, I love myself
And I can have it all 'cause I love myself
Playing hopscotch with ya life
Couple heartbreaks 'til you get it right
Sometimes, you gotta fall
Sometimes, you lose it all
That's when you get it right
Taking shortcuts get ya cut short (Yep)
Never ever settle when you know your worth (Never)
You gotta free your soul, you gotta take control
That's how I got it right

It's alright, I been to the bottom, and I've seen the end
Wanna forever be together 'til the end
And I found the problem (I found the problem)
It starts with me (It starts with me)

Damn right, yeah, I love myself
I'm never gon' fall 'cause I love myself (Ayy)
