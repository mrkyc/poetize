Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh (My love)
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh

I ride like a soldier
Put nothin' before ya
Anything you ask
I'll be right there to do it
But if I react, you tell me to relax
Too late to take it back
'Cause boy, you put me through it

This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
You said you wanted to have some kids, build a family
(Now I) Wish it wasn't true
It's killing me to do what I gotta do
The problem here is you
Ain't nobody new, not even my crew
Could take the place of you
The problem here is you
You might also like
'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would have held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see
You'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper
Didn't know how to treat her
Should have felt a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love

Kick it with ya friends (Go)
Go out with other chicks (Go)
Be all up in the mix (Go)
You got the right to do it
You wanna be a pimp
Be treated like a prince
Go 'head and click the switch
'Cause now you got ya crown back

This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
You said you wanted to have some kids, build a family
(Now I) Wish it wasn't true
It's killing me to do what I gotta do
The problem here is you
Ain't nobody new, not even my crew
Could take the place of you
The problem here is you
'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would have held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see
You'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper
Didn't know how to treat her
Should have felt a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love

My hugs and my kisses
You know you're gonna miss it
And while you're tripping on the love we could have had
I'm moving on
I got to
And ain't no looking back

'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would have held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see
You'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper
Didn't know how to treat her
Should have felt a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh
My love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh
Oh ooh oh oh huh huh

See boy, you had a keeper
