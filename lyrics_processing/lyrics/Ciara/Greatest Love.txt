It's the greatest love
It's the greatest love
It's the greatest love
Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh
Oh, na-na-na, na-na

You're the greatest love I ever seen
Where you are, I'm gonna be
To top it off, you been there for me
Never change your energy
'Cause only you got what I need
I'll give you everything in me, I'll ride for you
I would do anything, believe, I'll die for you

From the first day that I met you, knew you were special
There was something different 'bout you
Had to pray 'fore, 'fore I jumped into it head first
Ain't an expert but I know I never, ever felt like this
Never, ever been held like this
Never met nobody real like this, oh
I should've known when you took my son as your own
I'm not sayin' I ain't like all the carats and the stone
It's just your love that I want
Now it's me and you against the entire world, the entire world
I see our love when I look at our baby girl, I'm a lucky girl, oh
You might also like
You're the greatest love I ever seen (Greatest love)
Where you are, I'm gonna be
To top it off, you been there for me
Never change your energy
'Cause only you got what I need
It's the greatest love
I'll give you everything in me, I'll ride for you
It's the greatest love
I would do anything, believe, I'll die for you

I can do this on my own but you won't
Let me, we in this thing together, we got a special bond
For life like mob ties like when you look at me with those eyes, say
You would kill and die to keep me, say
Got me feelin' sexy on off days
Things you do, things you say
Baby, I'm followin', lead the way
I'm so glad I get to call you bae
Wish that everyone could feel this way, ayy
Ask God to take out everything toxic in my life
And baby, he did
Tell me, won't He do if it you're going through it?
Baby, don't worry, He will
You're the greatest love I ever seen (Greatest love I ever seen)
Where you are, I'm gonna be (Gonna be, oh)
To top it off, you been there for me
Never change your energy
'Cause only you got what I need
It's the greatest love
I'll give you everything in me, I'll ride for you
It's the greatest love
I would do anything, believe, I'll die for you

It's the greatest love
Baby, this is the greatest love (This is the greatest)
Baby, this is the greatest love (It's the greatest love)
Baby, this is the greatest love, love, love (This is the greatest)
