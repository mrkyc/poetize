Oh, what a feeling
To wake up everyday knowing I am loved by you
I can't believe it
What did I do to deserve someone to hold me like you do?

If nobody's perfect
Then all that I want is to be imperfect with you

'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks

Oh, beauty marks
Beauty marks

I look in the mirror, and I see all my flaws
But you see light in all I do
Now I'm realizing that the uglyness I saw
There are pretty things to you
You might also like
And I don't have to cover anything, I share it all
I don't have to hide from the truth

'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks

Oh, beauty marks
Beauty marks

Now I know why you love me
So real, it feels like a dream
No looking back to the past
It was all part of the plan
I feel the love in your haze
Boy, when you touch me like that
The way you love every part
You show me my scars are beauty marks, beauty marks
Oh, they're beauty marks, beauty marks
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
