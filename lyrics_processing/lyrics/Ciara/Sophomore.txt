Oh na-nai, I ain't no amateur
Baby, I know how to handle ya
If you ready for this ride, get your saddle up
I need a boy with some stamina
He had me all year, now he back around
'Cause he liked the way I put it down
You can be my student, I'mma be your teacher
Let's play a little game, follow the leader

I give a little lesson in sex education
Didn't know I can work it like that
I got him working overtime
There'll be no time for wasting
C-c-c-cookie keep him coming back

So soft, my skin
So soft, my booty
So soft, my bed
So soft, I got him sayin'
Give me more, I got him sayin'
Give me more, I got him sayin'

Give me more, I got him sayin'

Give me more, I got him sayin'

Don't drop out, stay in the game
Better come hard boy, you know my name
