All I know is hustle, I put that on my set

I hustle 'til I pass out
Treat all my shoeboxes like the bank now
Guess you could say that I'm the man, wow
On that big boss level, and I put that on my set

On my set (Set)
On my, on my, on my set, we set
On my set (Set)
On my, on my, on my set, we set
On my set (Set)
On my, on my, on my set, we set
On my set (Set)
On my, on my, on my set, we set

I can smell your hate from 'bout a mile away, you mad that I just won't come down (Yeah)
I can see the look that's written on your face, wonder how I still fit this crown

You hatin' but (Hey), you watchin' though (Why?)
I guess you kind of mad that I'm unstoppable (Stop)
You count me out (Count), the counters count me in (In)
Looks like I'm putting up another win again (Ayy)

'Cause I hustle 'til I pass out (Hustle 'til I pass out)
Treat all my shoeboxes like the bank now (Like my bank)
Guess you could say that I'm the man, wow (Yes, I am the man)

I go too hard, grind for my team
Been that since back, I run tings
No cap, I own it, my name, you know
The name, ain't a damn thing changed
