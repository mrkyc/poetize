I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is just like honey, it's so sweet to me
He can have everything in this world, but he'll sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind, I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't ever part
It's time, time for us to settle down
And I
Wanna be with him forever

They can say that I am crazy
For making him my baby, but that's how it's gone be
See, I done been through many changes
But this one I ain't changing, it's gon' stay the same
I can have everything in this world, but I'll sacrifice it all for him
And I made up my mind, I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

Wanna be with him forever (Wanna be with him)

And all of the things that you do

'Cause I know this is real
