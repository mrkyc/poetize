Sweat dripping from my body
We both at this party
So come and show me your moves
I got some things I can teach too
If you wanna see, oh
You say you a need a shot of the Henny
Then you're ready, do what you need to do
'Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy

It's really late
You're getting close, and the lights are off
Your body's in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising while I wind on you

Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making love

If we're down just maybe, we dance like we're making babies
As soon as our song comes on
'Cause boy, we got all night long
So if you ready, I'm ready, to get it, come on
I see a little faded
You wanna get crazy out on this floor
I hope you sure this is what you want
'Cause once I'm turned on, you can't turn me off
You might also like
It's really late
You're getting close, and the lights are off
Your body's in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising while I wind on you

Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making love

Off the wall
Body to body you and I
All through the night, baby
Closer than before
Dance like no one's watching you and I, and I
Be the time of your life, babe
Oh, let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
