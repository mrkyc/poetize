Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner
For the feeling that I lost todaySomeone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner
For the feeling that I lost todayYou must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking merrilyI don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make correctionsFamous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles Cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for meYou put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
You put an ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself and homeYou must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking merrilyI don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make correctionsFamous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles Cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for meAfraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
'Cause they're desperate to entertainAfraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
'Cause they're desperate to entertainAfraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
