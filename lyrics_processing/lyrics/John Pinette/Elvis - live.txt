Took a stairwell, would I fall to please her?
Just to tear this out of my belly forever
Cause I'm still hooked to the light forever
I can do it if you're there and it's only when you're thereBless them with the arrogant Brandos
Leave your heart stitched in a hundred pieces
If it's not wet then you shouldn't be doing it
She's no bitch, she's far too rich
And I can do it when you're there
And it's only when you're thereAll these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said a sensations
Are as perfect as sturbation
Hardly needs to be nailed as frustration
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be soiledYou wash yourself
You wash yourself
And I wash myself
You wash yourselfEnd up in a young hair, curled round with a finger
I can't excuse this, it's all fucked but if you're there
I can screw it when she's here, I can rule the world six times over
With my head burned out and my body on hold
I can do it if you're there and it's only when she's thereAll these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said
All these amazing sensations
Such a virgin celebration
Never needs to be soiledYou wash yourself
You wash yourself
And I wash myself
You wash yourselfThe whole world joins the French foreign legion
Get a new suit for the man who discovered Elvis
Was so fat when he died and ascend to heaven
I live here in my watered down Disney baby
With ten million attic clad genius abort me, 'cos I have to compete
And maybe one man will eventually spit on MarsSave us if you're there, only if she's there
I can do it if you're there, I can do it when she's there
You can screw when she's there
You can screw when she's thereAll these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be saidOoh, these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly need to be saidOoh, these amazing frustrations
You're a virgin celebration
Hardly needs to be deadAll these amazing frustration
Such a perfect celebration
Only needs to be saidAll these amazing sensations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be saidAll these amazing frustration
Such a perfect celebration
