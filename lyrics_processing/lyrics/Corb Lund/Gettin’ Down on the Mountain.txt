Can you break the horse, can you light the fire?
What's that, I beg your pardon?
You'd best start thinkin' where your food comes from and I hope you tend a good garden
Gettin' down on the mountain, gettin' down on the mountain
Don't wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin' down on the mountain
When the trucks don't run, the bread won't come, have a hard time findin' petrol
Water ain't runnin' in the city no more, do you hold any precious metal?
Can you gut the fish, can you read the sky?
What's that about overcrowdin'?
You ever seen a man who's kids ain't ate for seventeen days and countin'?
Gettin' down on the mountain, gettin' down on the mountain
Don't wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin' down on the mountain
There ain't no heat and the power's gone out, it's kerosene lamps and candles
The roads are blocked, it's all gridlocked, you got a shortwave handle?
Can you track the deer, can you dig the well?
I couldn't quite hear your answer
I think I see a rip in the social fabric, Brother can you spare some ammo?

Don't wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin' down on the mountain, goin' to ground on the mountain

Nobody wants paper money, son, so you just as well stop countin'
Can you break the horse, can you light the fire?
What's that, I beg your pardon?
I think I see a rip in the social fabric, Brother can you pass the ammo?
Gettin' down on the mountain, gettin' down on the mountain
Don't wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin' down on the mountain
