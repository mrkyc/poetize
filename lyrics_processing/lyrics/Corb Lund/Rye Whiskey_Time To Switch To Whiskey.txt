"Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey", I cried
If I don't get rye whiskey, well, I think I may die
I'm gonna go up yon holler, I'm gonna build me a still
And I'll sell you a gallon for a five dollar bill
Well, if the oceans was whiskey and I was a duck
I'd swim to the bottoms and never come up
But the oceans ain't whiskey and I ain't no duck
So I'll play the Jack of diamonds and trust to my luck
Jack of diamonds, Jack of diamonds, know you'll hold
You dropped my poor pockets of silver and gold
Well, it's beefsteak when I'm hungry, rye whiskey when I'm dry
And greenbacks when I'm hard up in Heaven when I die
"Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey", I cried
If I don't get rye whiskey, well, I think I may die
Well, my horses ain't hungry and they don't want your hay
So fair thee well, darling, and I'll be on my way
Here's to it folks

Well, I like a full bodied lager as much as the next hard workin' man
And the taste of suds, while dealing stud, I can surely understand
Trucker speed and, yes, indeed it's nearly gettin' light
It's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night

Sure enough, 'cause the powerful stuff that'll knock you on your ass
It's like diesel fuel, nobody's fool is gonna wanna get left behind
It's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
Well, it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
We're all half dead and them that's left are spoilin' for a fight
Who'd 'a thunk, we'd get jackass drunk, the boys won't spare the rye
And it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
I've been splittin' eights and hittin' my straights
In the cardrooms of the world
Chasin' skirt and gettin' hurt but now I got a card playin' girl
But man she gets excited when the deal don't come out right
It's time to switch to whiskey, she's been drinkin' beer all night
Well, it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
We're all half dead and them that's left are spoilin' for a fight
Who'd 'a thunk, we'd get jackass drunk, the boys won't spare the rye
And it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
Okay, alright
Well I've heard it said that you can get some heat in Irish pubs
Servin' Jamesons to an Orangeman and Bushmills to his cuz
Well here's what you do with Tullamore Dew
You can meet 'em both halfway
It's time to switch to whiskey, they've been drinkin' beer all day
Well, it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
We're all half dead and them that's left are spoilin' for a fight
Who'd 'a thunk, we'd get jackass drunk, the boys won't spare the rye
And it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
And it's time to switch to whiskey, we've been drinkin' beer all night
