Long gone to Saskatchewan
Where the gettin's good if you're gettin' gone
I'm gonna put my boots and my hat back on
Cause I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan
Well it's a hell of a battle to try to raise cattle
In the prettiest place on the hoof
Oil refiners and lot sub-dividers
Got land prices right through the roof
They got value's distorted and my brow's all contorted
With the words that the banker just wrote
Me and the missus, we love the cow business
Took jobs just to keep us afloat
The old lady's a waitress in three different places
And still can't afford her own car
I've been drivin' grader, I'm a smooth operator
Wonderin' where all the gravel roads are
I like Alberta, but dang ain't ya hearda
How much it can cost to buy oats?
I'll always love her and think kindly of her
But I got no money left over for smokes

Adios, goodbye, farwell, so long
I'm long gone to Saskatchewan

She's a little bit flatter but the cows are as fatter
So I think I'm gonna get me a tent
Cuz I can buy up an acre beside a nice lake here
For what it costs me at home to just rent
Sure, the winters are tough and roads get rough
And we might have to feed a bit more
And it's further to ship'em, but damned if it isn't
Good cow country this, that's for sure
I can miss my foothills here and still drink my pilsner
And bitch and complain and surmise
About missin' the mountain, buy hey, look, who's countin'
My place here is five times the size
Well I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan
Where the gettin's good if your gettin' gone
I'm gonna put my boots and my hat back on
Adios, goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm long gone to Saskatchewan

Now I gotta give honours to Stompin' Tom Connors
For "Roll on Saskatchewan" first
And Hus put his toque on in "Long Gone to the Yukon"
I figured he owed us a verse
But I've been comin' out bringin' my t-shirts and singin'
To my good eastern neighbours so long
And you put up with dumb jokes about your province and so I figured hey, I owed you a song
Well I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan
Where the gettin's good if you're gettin' gone
Gonna put my boots and my hat back on
Raise my cows like my grand daddy done
Where the birch trees grow and the sharp tail roam
Adios, goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone
