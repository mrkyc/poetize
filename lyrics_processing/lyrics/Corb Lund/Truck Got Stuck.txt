But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
With some difficulty
Well more rain than we'd seen for a thousand years
Caused financial joys and biblical fears
It caused some smiles it caused some tears
But more to the point of our story
For The first time in the collective memory
That old brown prairie that had been so dry for so long was very muddy
Boggy and sticky
We'd pull one truck out and get another stuck in
And motors would roar and tires would spin
We'd sink right down, down to the diff, and we'd all take turns and do it again
Till no one could move, we'd call one more friend
Come on out here, we need you...bring your truck
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
And the Dodge
They got me stuck in the mud, so they couldn't rehearse
And Chavase too has missed his work
Richie, he now fears the worst, he stood up his ex wife she called him a jerk
Course Holman didn't have nothing better do to, 'cept ranch

Well it was truck after truck, we all got stuck
'cept the big old four by Hutterite truck
We all thought "lord are we in luck!"
But he wouldn't come anywhere near us
Mighty neighborly, mighty neighborly
So we used a lot of our backs, a little of our brains
We jacked up the jacks, and snugged up the chains
We all did our very best to refrain from shovelin'
We put what timber we had, underneath the wheels
And we was all out of sand, but managed to steal
Two sacks of the best modern canola seed you ever did see
That oughta give us some traction
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up

We spilled genetically modified canola seed
That was genetically modified for controlling the weeds
And for big old yields and margarine oil, raised hell all over that native prairie soil
