Brady grabbed the Gideon's from the hotel in the desk
We said 'What's the matter, brother, are you worried about your soul?'
He said 'Better safe than sorry, boys, that's just how I roll'
We hit the road feelin' cool as Crosby, Stills and Nash
Overflowin' with the spirit and the bible on the dash
We pulled the whole rig over for the flashin' reds and blues
Police come to the window and we said 'Have you heard the news?'
He said 'Don't get smart with me, boy, why you doin' ninety-five?'
My foot is heavy with redemption, I'm just blessed to be alive
He said 'I oughta pull you out of there and beat you black and blue'
I placed my hand upon the good book and said 'What would Jesus do?'
It's better than insurance, registration or lyin'
It's better than these fake IDs I keep on buyin'
It's even better than an envelope stuffed with cash
They always said it'd save me, that old bible on the dash
He said, 'Round these parts that hair alone will make probable cause
When you're movin' through my county you'll obey my earthly laws'
We did our best to quote some holy writ, chapter and verse
'What kind of music y'alls make? And we said 'Christian music, sir'
He contemplated, thought about it, twitched his cop moustache
'Alright you boys be careful now, just don't drive quite so fast'

Pull in over there, son, we're gonna do some search and seize'
Maybe if we'd been more famous, he'd have said 'Just move along'
If he'd have seen us on the TV, or if we'd had hit single songs
He's just about to ask us 'Where's the money, guns and hash?'
I was prayin' it'd save me, that old bible on the dash
His hand was on his pistol and his dog was on his leash
That shephard, he was keepin' a pretty close eye on his sheep
'We got a list we're gonna look at to see if we can't find your names
Got us some parabolic laser beams that hear everything you say
We got ultraviolet x-rays that can see right through your bus'
Yes sir, well I hope the good Lord keeps an eye on all of us, uh-huh
It's better than a green card, it's better than lyin'
It's better than these work visas I have to keep buyin'
It's even better than an envelope stuffed with cash
