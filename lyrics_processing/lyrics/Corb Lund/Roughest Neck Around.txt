He's been all around the world on the big oil rigs
With the welders and the trucks on the black gold rush
And the diesel burnin' Cat motors growlin' and the mud
You'd better hire him on, he's the roughest neck around
He got the power in his hands to pull the dragons from the ground
Yeah
It's 35 below or its 98 above
And he's workin' thru it all, cuz baby this is what he loves
Drives a hundred-fifty miles make sure his kids are doin' fine
And he sees 'em when he can but he's married to his iron
You'd better hire him on, he's the roughest neck around
He got the power in his hands to pull the dragons from the ground
Yeah
He's a good hand to have on, and he's throwin' on the tongs
Spinnin' chain and slidin' high side all night long
And he's tripping in his pipe, and he torques it good and tight
And ya gotta figure Eddy's got his mud weight right
You'd better hire him on cuz he's better than the rest
He got the power in his hands and the dragons in his chest
Yeah
See Corb Lund LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeWell, his mind's a little tired but his back is plenty strong
Got his green kings and filthy, frozen coveralls on
And he's drilling by the inch and he's hauling on the winch
Takin' fuel from the tanks on his short change shift
You'd better hire him on, he's the roughest neck around
He got the power in his hands to pull the dragons from the ground
Yeah, you'd better hire him on cuz he's better than the rest
He got the power in his heart and the dragons in his chest
Yeah
He brings the power to the people
Power to the people
Cuz he's the roughest neck around
