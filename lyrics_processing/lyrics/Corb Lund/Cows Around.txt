Living in town sometimes brings me down
Let me bestow this western blessing and share what i have found
May you always have cows around
What else you gonna spend that extra money on
What else is gonna get you up hours before dawn
What else is gonna keep you toiling on and on and on
May you always have cows around
Come on, you know that you got too much time on your hands
And not nearly enough complication in your plans
You need to embrace all of the frustration that you can
May you always have cows around
What else is gonna make your pony puff and wheeze
Or make you calve 'em out at below forty degrees
What else is gonna eat you right completely out of feed
May you always have cows around
Everything is better with some cows around
Living in town sometimes brings me down
Let me bestow this western blessing and leave you cattle bound
May you always have cows around
What else could make a bishop swear like a sailor might
What else could cause such tension between a man and his wife
What else could ever bring all these enhancements to your life
May you always have cows around

What else is gonna make you prematurely show your age
What else will take a run at you in a fit of bovine rage
May you always have cows around
You'd barely get to see your banker otherwise
You'd never get to fix no fence or buy no barbed wires
Nor have some mangy neighbor's bull come breed the heifers that you prize
May you always have cows around
Everything is better with some cows around
Living in town sometimes brings me down
Let me bestow this western blessing and leave you saddle bound
May you always have cows around
What kinda cows, Corb?
Well, there's Hereford, Highland, Simmental, Welsh Black and Maine Anjou
Chianina, Limousin, Shorthorn, Charolais, Watusi, too
Texas Longhorn, Corriente, Romagnola, Galloway
And Angus, Brahma, Brangus, Jersey, Guernsey, Holstein, hey
You mighta had to let em dig for oil and gas
You mighta had to turn the place into an exotic game ranch
You mighta had to do all kinds of things to raise the cash
So you'd always have cows around
How else you gonna lose it all like daddy did
What else will make sure you leave nothin' for your kids?
It's too late now, you know it is, you'd just as well admit
You have a badly flawed and sentimental masochistic-ness
And that despite all the statistics and the advice that you get
You will always have cows around
Everything is better with some cows around
Living in town sometimes brings me down
You won't know what you're missing till you hear that sound
