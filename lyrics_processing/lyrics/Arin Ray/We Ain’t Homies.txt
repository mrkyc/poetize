Fuck the topic
Why you on it?
Stop that acting like you know me
Talking 'bout my old friends like we homies
I get a high living
They don't know me
Talking 'bout some old shit like you know me
Like you know me
Nigga you don't know me
Talking 'bout my old bitch like you know me
You don't know me
Nigga we ain't homies, no no

Damn
Are you for real, real, real, real, real?
See what's the deal, deal, deal? Wait

See you need to back up, back up
Give me space, I need to stack up
Get my racks up
You a non-fucking factor
I done past ya
I done came a long way since The X Factor, hey
Damn
Where were you when we was broke?
Eatin' Ramen Noodles from the corner store
I ain't even see you when shit was low
So, don't you try to act like you really know
You might also like
I mean for real, real, real, real, real
Hey, what's the deal, deal, deal, deal?

You read about it
Don't run your mouth
And you don't know what you're talking 'bout
You don't know what I'm all about
You, you ain't see how it all went down, down
I'm interested, what's your motivation? (your motivation?)
You say you know me, but got no relation (got no relation)
Your Instagram got you feeling famous
Could give a damn 'bout your confirmation
