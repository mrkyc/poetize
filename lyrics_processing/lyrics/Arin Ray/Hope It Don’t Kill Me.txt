Thought I seen it all
Didn't know what I was in for
I was hesitant to fall, now I'm diving face first
We don't even know, if this is something that we can afford
Everybody pays for it, up to the clouds we will go and we will soar
We've got the world by the horns, let's explore

I hope it don't kill me, no, no, no, no
I hope it don't kill me, no, no, no, no
I hope it don't kill me, kill me, no, no
I hope it don't-

Uh, yeah
Monday mornin's never stressing
 still progressin'
I swear to God that it's the truth
Every moment is a blessing, blessing
She got hella finesse, the bestest
Yo fuck everyone else, we reckless
Take a shot to the chest to test us

I hope it don't kill me, no, no, no, no
I hope it don't kill me, no, no, no, no
I hope it don't kill me, kill me, no, no
I hope it don't-

Whoa
It is the life that they gon' stress after
The type of shit that make lightskins wanna text faster
The type of shit that make ex friends turn they neck backwards
But if I drive by in this whip, you tell me, "Yes master"
Watch me and dezzie, donnie, and keys do it
Knock knock, in hopes you adore it and had no keys to it
You better speak to it, boy you don't even own your soul, you got a lease to it
That's why I hope this don't kill me
Goin' out of my way, at the, end of the day
I just hope that I'm still me
I give a damn if you don't feel me, feel me?
Fuck you

So, tell me
What- what makes you really fuck with, like really fuck with somebody like?
Like what do you really look for?
In a guy
