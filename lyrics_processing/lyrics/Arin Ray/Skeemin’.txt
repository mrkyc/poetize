I'll never miss when you walk by 'cause you out there skeemin'
Oh I was tryna know, I was tryna be a better man
I need a piece of mind
I'm not tryna waste my time with the way you've been
Just go

I was flying home from over seas
She was posed to be waiting on me
'Til I found out she was wit' a hater, hater
A 9 to 5 she was doing favors, favors
You know these down bitches come and go, go
I never thought that she was one of those
Damn, I never knew that she was one of those
Damn, I should've known that she was one of those
Oh yeah
She wanna fuck, want the drugs, want the company
Want it all want it all want it all for free
She want the Benz, want the pad, and the Tiffany's
Head good, pussy good every time I eat
But never once, never once would she offer me
I need a down bitch and that's something she can't be
And that's real

I'll never miss when you walk by 'cause you out there skeemin'
Oh I was tryna know, I was tryna be a better man
I need a piece of mind
I'm not tryna waste my time with the way you've been
Just go

I ain't missin' nothin', oh
And yeah it feels so right
Feels so nice
I really have a home I can call mine
Yeah
To really have a home I can call mine
Inside, my life
Ladada
Oooh

I'll never miss when you walk by 'cause you out there skeemin'
Oh I was tryna know, I was tryna be a better man
I need a piece of mind
I'm not tryna waste my time with the way you've been
Just go
