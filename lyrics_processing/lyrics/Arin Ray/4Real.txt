She don't need to know
I probably shouldn't tell her
Damn I done fucked up
I've been feeling all the pressure
All of these girls see what's going on
It's just the energy is how it goes
But I'm tryin' to slow down
And I hope you know now
Baby when it go down
Girl I'm trying to slow down, slow down

I can come and see you if you want me, get it when you want
Everybody talkin' let em have it we gon' be on top
For real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye
I can see it in written in the stars we were feeling made
Poppin' champagne like we won a race
For real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye

I know you want more
But I'm hoping love
Hoping to change it up
Be on my side
I'll stand by you babe
Just be my guide
I'll follow you babe
You might also like
I can come and see you if you want me, get it when you want
Everybody talkin' let em have it we gon' be on top
For real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye
I can see it in written in the stars we were feeling made
Poppin' champagne like we won a race
For real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye

Oh no baby, oh no, now you really tripping

She lose her mind when that weed is involved
We been here before, we been here before
She lose her mind when that weed is involved

Show you the things that I know
Take you to places I go
Just say the word and we can roll
Wait a minute, got a safe with the money
And I throw the bank in it
Bitch wait, had to freeze it up, I was skating in it
And the commas so big you can put a tank in it
Take cash to the telly, tell her keep it safe wit it, yeah

I don't really so the whole point in hating niggas
I find it hard to sit back and relate wit ya
When you been through all the shit what I'm feeling is way different
Had to switch the whole game because of you lame niggas
Got my gold chain because of you lame niggas
Everything thing fine just give me some down time
Some good to break down some bitches to hang with us
Lashaun

Everybody talkin' let em have it we gon' be on top
For real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye, for real, aye
I can see it in written in the stars we were feeling made
Poppin' champagne like we won a race
