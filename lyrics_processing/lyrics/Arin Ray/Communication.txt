Won't lie I'm still trying to get through
But you're still my love, love, love
In time we'll be fine don't confuse
'Cause you're still my love, love, love

You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better

I know better
Know better than to leave her
Then trusting in the team
No trusting in me
I know better
Know better than to cheat
You deserve the best from me
I know I'll always take the lead
I love your taste
I love your wild
I love your confidence
And in return I know you need an honest man?
And all the moments that we spend are just so hard to match
You got me so bad
Want you so bad
You might also like
Won't lie I'm still trying to get through
But you're still my love, love, love
In time we'll be fine don't confuse
'Cause you're still my love, love, love

You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better

I could lay roses at your feet
So only morning dew is what is on your shoes
(But I want you to want me too)
And I come over a little slowly
Slower than you do or so you know I'm cool
(But I want you to want me too)
And I could perform hat tricks to make sure magic happens for you
(But I want you to want me too)
And I'ma fuck you with passion
Just to make it climactic for you
(But I want you to want me too)
Won't lie I'm still trying to get through
But you're still my love, love, love
In time we'll be fine don't confuse
'Cause you're still my love, love, love

You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
You're still my love
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
I thought you knew better
