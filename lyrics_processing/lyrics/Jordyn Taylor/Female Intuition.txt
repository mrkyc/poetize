Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me who
Tell me when
Tell me where
Tell me why
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me why
My intuition

Sitting down with my girls
Trying figure out what I'm gonna do
Never though I'd see the day
When the question mark was hanging over you

And it ain't nothing that somebody said
There's no where or when
No when, no where
But I've already caught in my head
Time and time again
Yeah, cause
You might also like
Something's going on
Can't put my finger on it
Something's going on
Don't wanna linger on it
Tell yourself you're wrong
But the feeling's so strong
Call it female intuition
I can feel your competition
When we're kissing
Something's missing
Call it female intuition
My intuition

Monday night
You're looking slick
Well, who's it for if it ain't for me?
If it ain't for me?
Called you up on Tuesday
And you say you're busy trying to cook and clean
What you mean?

And lately you've been switching up your phone
From loud to vibrate (vibrate)
Is that why you've been missing all my calls
Did you plan it that way
That way?
Cause
Something's going on
Can't put my finger on it
Something's going on
Don't wanna linger on it
Tell yourself you're wrong
But the feeling's so strong
Call it female intuition (my intuition)
I can feel your competition
When we're kissing
Something's missing
Call it female intuition
My intuition

Trying to catch you is like an occupation
You say that it's all in my imagination
Sometimes it's shadows that I'm chasing
But I can't erase this voice I hear inside
Baby

Something's going on
Can't put my finger on it
Something's going on
Don't wanna linger on it
Tell yourself you're wrong
But the feeling's so strong
Call it female intuition (my intuition)
I can feel your competition
When we're kissing
Something's missing
Call it female intuition
My intuition
Tell me who
Tell me when
Tell me where
Tell me why
Tell me who
Tell me when
Tell me where
Tell me why
Tell me who
Tell me when
Tell me where
Tell me why
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me who
Tell me why
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My intuition
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My intuition
