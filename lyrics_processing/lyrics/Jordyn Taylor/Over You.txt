All this emptiness
Cause the difference is between us won't improve
I'm tryna find a way to bring back yesterday
Love meant everything to you
We been through much
I don't want us to end right here
I can't stand the thought of watching us disappear
I put my all
My heart
My soul
My everything into us
I just can't see it
So let this be
Got me tripping
Cause I'm in this craziness
Should we leave it?
But I'm caught up in your mess
But we drifted far from were we used to be
Wish I could let go
But I can't seem to get over you
But I can't seem to get over you
But I can't seem to get over you
You might also likeJust a single touch
Between the two of us
You used to mean so much
Cause we were all alone
But reality is here
And it's very clear
I should let things go with you
We been through much
I don't want us to end right here
I can't stand the thought of watching us disappear
I put my all
My heart
My soul
My everything into us
I just can't see it
So let this be
Got me tripping
Cause I'm in this craziness
Should we leave it?
But I'm caught up in your mess
But we drifted far from were we used to be
Wish I could let go
But I can't seem to get over you
Boy, I question how something so perfect
Could seem to just fade away
No, I won't give up on you
No, never
I love you forever
And there's no way I turn away from everything
Cause, boy
You got me tripping
Cause I'm in this craziness
Should we leave it?
But I'm caught up in your mess
But we drifted far from were we used to be
Wish I could let go
But I can't seem to get over you
Got me tripping
Cause I'm in this craziness
Should we leave it?
But I'm caught up in your mess
But we drifted far from were we used to be
Wish I could let go
But I can't seem to get over you
But I can't seem to get over you
But I can't seem to get over you
