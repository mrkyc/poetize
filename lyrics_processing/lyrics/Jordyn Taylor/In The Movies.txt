Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I know, I'm asking alot but it seem so
Unrealistic to let go, of the dream of living like a queen
(Don't see it in the magazines)
And so, it's opening night, I'm at the show
And though I've seen this script before
I'm never sick of happy endings, no use in pretending

He looks so good it's a felony, felony
I don't care about what he's telling me, telling me
He don't need a crib up in Beverly
He could drive a hooptie, doesn't matter to me
I just want that love like in the movies (Uh-huh)
Everybody's happy like in the movies
Everything just happens right in the movies
Want my perfect story like in the movies
In the movies-vies

I hope, he could be the perfect leading man
Just want him to do all that he can
And I won't let go 'til the credits roll
(Wanna hear the audience clapping)
No, faded to black, it's time to go
No holding back I need to know
Are you the one I'm looking for?
You might also like
He looks so good it's a felony, felony
I don't care about what he's telling me, telling me
He don't need a crib up in Beverly
He could drive a hooptie, doesn't matter to me (It don't matter)
I just want that love like in the movies
Everybody's happy like in the movies
Everything just happens right in the movies
Want my perfect story like in the movies
In the movies-vies

Ah-ha, ah-ha
Well they may call me B.o.B
But when I hit the club I'm Denzel
So lights, camera, actions, when I come passing
I don't need a script for a chick, chick
I just tell her "Get Here"
'Cause my homework kinda look like Ten Mill
So soon as they hear that I'm in the building
These girls can't even sit still
So for the duration of the night
Girl I'ma say just what you like
If it's a crime to look this good
Then baby I guess I'm serving life
Take one, take two, take three (Three)
This is your chance for your debut scene (C'mon)
Everytime while I'm on the stage they scream
He looks so good it's a felony, felony
I don't care about what he's telling me, telling me
He don't need a crib up in Beverly
He could drive a hooptie, doesn't matter to me
I just want that love like in the movies (Like in the movies)
Everybody's happy like in the movies
Everything just happens right in the movies
Want my perfect story like in the movies
In the movies-vies

He looks so good it's a felony, felony
I don't care about what he's telling me, telling me
He don't need a crib up in Beverly
Doesn't matter to me
I just want that love like in the movies

Oh-oh (That girl )
Oh-oh (And your body rockin')
Oh-oh (I don't want that )
Oh-oh ()
Vies
Oh-oh (That girl )
Oh-oh (And your body rockin')
Oh-oh (I don't want that )
