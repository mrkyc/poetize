Ooh
It's just another day
Pickin up the pieces baby
Tryin to find a reason not to go
And give it all away
Cause everytime your missing
Well I'm feelin like I'm losing part of me
And I can't remember
Where things went wrong
Cause it's been so long and I
I can't believe that it's the end
So baby help me understand

What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
If your not the one you want
Then I don't wanna sit and wonder
What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
Boy I'm sick of being lost
And I just wanna know
What's good (what's good)
What's good with you
You might also like
Ooh
It seemed so ment to be
Till everything got twisted baby
Llook at how we've drifted from those days
But I won't walk away
I deserve an explanation
Tell me why your giving up on
Me cause I can't remember
Where things went wrong
No time can let me know
Cause this ain't the way you let love in
So baby help me understand

What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
If your not the one you want
Then I don't wanna sit and wonder
What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
Boy I'm sick of being lost
And I just wanna know
What's good (what's good)
What's good with you
Cause it's gone too far
Can't you see these stars
There's spoke of lonleyness
I'm so confused
What'd I do to you
To end up in this mess
(nothings wrong)(nothings wrong)
So your telling me
But I can feel the true
So what's good what's good with you
(awh awh ooh)
(awh awh ooh)
(awh awh ooh)
Good with you

What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
If your not the one you want
Then I don't wanna sit and wonder
What's good, what's good
With you (with you)
Boy I'm sick of being lost
And I just wanna know
What's good (what's good)
