To life, to life, to life, mmm

It's 3 AM, 3 AM, I'm half asleep
I start to feel, start to feel you next to me
Lying here in the dark
Something don't feel that right

'Cause it's too many times a broken heart, too many times
That's too many times I've had to start again, oh

I'm looking out at the crowd
I don't know where you are
It's like I'm hearing you now
But you feel so far
I don't know what I can do
I'm searching everywhere
That's why I lay here at night
And dream you to life

D-Dream you
Dream you, mm
You might also like
I try and stop, but I can't resist (Can't fight it)
I fall asleep to the sweetest kiss
I wanna see you again
I don't want the night to end, oh

We can break the rules
They can call us fools
You know I wouldn't care
As long as I had you there, oh

I'm looking out at the crowd
I don't know where you are
It's like I'm hearing you now
But you feel so far
I don't know what I can do
I'm searching everywhere
That's why I lay here at night
And dream you to life

I'll be okay, I'll be alright
I know I'll find you, boy
When the time is right
I can't deny it, I can't deny
I want you right here, right now in my life
Right by my side (I see you in my dream)
I could love you like no other can, oh
I'm looking out at the crowd
I don't know where you are
It's like I'm hearing you now
But you feel so far
I don't know what I can do
I'm searching everywhere
That's why I lay here at night
And dream you to life

No one wants to be all alone
And I know you gotta be somewhere out there
(Dream you to life)
No one wants to be all alone
And I know you gotta be somewhere around there
(Dream you to life)
No one wants to be all alone
