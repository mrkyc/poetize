Listen up, girls
Pay attention
Take some notes on the things I'm about to mention
Sick and tired of the gossip and the drama
Heard it's coming straight from you
Just a young girl with ambition
Not looking for a fight or competition
There you go telling lies
Spreading rumors
Of the things that just ain't true
This is rumor control
And I'm calling you out
Just to let you know
This is rumor control
Fed up with deception
So won't you listen?
You might also likeNo more secrets
Your lies are so obscene
Can't live my life with all these drama queens
All these whispers
Dirty looks
Becoming more than I can take
I've come to realize I'm never gonna please you
I'll tighten up my crew
So another race through
All the scandal and envy
Betrayal
You girls are just too fake
This is rumor control
And I'm calling you out
Just to let you know
This is rumor control
Fed up with deception
So won't you listen?
This is rumor control
And I'm calling you out
Just to let you know
This is rumor control

Sweetie, it's easy to see
Stepping all over my feet
You couldn't dance for your life
Trying to flow with my mike
Baby, I'm keeping it tight
I know he's keeping it right
Here we roll
With no doubt, no fear
Still clear
So take notes
Writing for life right 'till I die
Tossing them up
Head to the sky
Hater!
Keep it real
We taking them higher
And bring in the fire
You can't deny her
The devil's a liar and taking my closer
They talking
But so what
Well, here comes the beat up
Keeping my feet up
Who's staging the shots now?
She's got the heat now
We're kids to the street now
This is rumor control
This is rumor control
This is rumor control
This is rumor control
This is rumor control
Ah-oh
This is rumor control
Ah-oh
This is rumorr control
