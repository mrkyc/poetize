Anything we had at all
If any of it ever mattered
It's been 28 days since that I've seen your face
And I can't erase what I said
What I did
I didn't mean any of it
There's a space inside that you left behind
And I won't buy
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause the only thing I know
Is it cold without you, babe?
Cold without you, babe?
It's wrong without you, babe?
So wrong without you, babe?
And I know it may be late
I know it may be late
But it kills me to watch you walk away
So if any of it ever mattered
Anything we had at all
If any of it ever mattered
Well, then now it's sure
You might also likeYou're everything I ever wanted
Everything we had before
Now I can see
Everything that ever mattered to me
But I guess I got scared
I was unprepared
I didn't see you there
Holding on
Being strong
Damn, I got it wrong
But you know I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Let me try to make it right
'Cause you and me
We're meant to be one last time
So if any of it ever mattered
Anything we had at all
If any of it ever mattered
Well, then now it's sure
You're everything I ever wanted
Everything we had before
Now I can see
Everything that ever mattered to me
I gotta get it all out
What's here inside
Would you give me a minute?
Just gimme some time
I finally see
I realize
I gotta be right by your side
Maybe I could say I'm sorry
Maybe you could take me back
So if any of it ever mattered
Anything we had at all
If any of it ever mattered
Well, then now it's sure
You're everything I ever wanted
Everything we had before
Now I can see
Everything that ever mattered to me
Is it cold without you, babe?
Cold without you, babe?
(Everything that ever mattered)
It's wrong without you, babe?
So wrong without you, babe?
(Everything that ever mattered)
And I know it may be late
I know it may be late
(Everything that ever mattered)
But it kills me to watch you walk away
(Everything that ever mattered)
Is it cold without you, babe?
Cold without you, babe?
It's wrong without you, babe?
