Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Late at night I lie awake
Thinking bout the love we had
Isnt it sad that it all turned to
Memories in the dark
Picture frames and broken hearts
Broken hearts
But they say these wones will heal
But baby the tales tell lies
They get so surreal
It makes me wish
That this world was big enough
For the both of us
That this life was
Bright enough to light another day
But I can't look back
Cause when I do I start wondering
Will I see you again
Everyday were growing up to fast
Got to find away to make it threw
But baby you know
I still think about you
But memories in the dark
Picture frames can't fix these hearts
These broken hearts
You might also likeAnd they say this pain will fade
Ohh but baby the songs weve sang
When I hear them play
It makes me wish
That this world was big enough
For the both of us
That this life was
Bright enough to light another day
But I can't look back
Cause when I do I start wondering
Will I see you again?
Againnn
The thought I knew is nothing at all
When it comes to you
When it comes to youu
Babby
Even though I'm already gone
Even though were threw
Boy I think of you
And I still wish that
This world was big enough
For the both of us
And this life was
Bright enough to light another day
But I can't look back
Cause when I do I start wondering
Will I see you again?
Againnn
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Againnn
Againnn
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Again
Will I see you again?
Again
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Again
