You got me in ICU, every time, baby, that I see you
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it through
It's like being captive, and baby, the fact is (Fact is)
Words, baby, can't describe
Every time you're near me I feel tongue-tied
You're looking in my eyes and I can't disguise
Inside I'm a wreck though, I feel like I'm trapped, oh

Your love got me hostage, and I can't break away (No, no)
But I don't mind being hostage
My heart is yours to invade
Your love has taken a hold, I'm your hostage
And I can't break away
But I don't mind being hostage
My heart is yours to invade
Your love has taken a hold, I'm your hostage

Don't ever set me free
You got me locked, and I threw away the key
I love it when you give me the third degree
You're driving me crazy and nothing can save me (Save me)
I'll stay forever 
As long as you're here, I'll stay under wraps
I promise, I'll be L-O-S-T
I'll surrender, I could not pretend

I don't wanna be changed
I'll never break these chains, it's so insane
