Now we sit here in our special place
All wearing our happy faces gladly
Sunlight appears in our world, our joy
Has been turned from badness

Now we've moved from love to love
And it's easier that way
We are riding on rainbows
And happy today

Now we move to the sun in every direction;
We are cloaked in veils of mystic protection...
Joking a lot, smoking or not
Floating our yacht off to freedom
Voting to be Aquarian!

I hold silver flashing metal in the palm
Of my petal hand, watching it quiver:
To breathe too close is death -
Ah, but what is breath but a way to deliverance?

Soon we will all be joined
In our great silver tube
Wanting every one to come along
That means you too!
You might also like
Now we move to the sun in every direction;
We are cloaked in veils of mystic protection...
Mapping the way, clapping to say
We're happy today, and assured of
The fact that we're all Aquarian!
Ah...

Hardly any money... Who needs bread anyway?
Well, I mean to say, it's just a road to freedom!
Everything's too funny; we just ride along so high
Watch the bad scenes floating by, who needs them?

Soon we will all be joined
In our great silver tube
Wanting every one to come along
That means you too!

Now we move to the sun in every direction;
We are cloaked in veils of mystic protection...
Lighting the path, righting the past
Fighting the dark like centurions
Writing our names as Aquarians!
As Aquarians!
But as Aquarians!
Writing our names as we move to the sun
We're Aquarians
Writing our names as we move to the sun
We're Aquarians
Writing our names as we move to the sun
We're Aquarians
Writing our names as we move to the sun
We're Aquarians
Writing our names as we move to the sun
We're Aquarians
Writing our names as we move to the sun, moving to the sun
(We're Aquarians)
(Writing our names as we move to the sun) ah..
(We're Aquarians)
(Writing our names)
Oh...
Actually 
As a cardboard replica
