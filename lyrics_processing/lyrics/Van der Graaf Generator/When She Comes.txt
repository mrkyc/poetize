(Slow) Slow motion in the quiet of the room;
So potent is the smell of her perfume
That you think she's eternal
That you think she is everything...
But no-one knows what she is

Repentance for all you should have said;
Her entrance seems to raise you from the dead
And you think she's really with you
And you think that she'll always stay
Always ready to forgive you
Always ready to grant you her mercy
But in her own way

When she comes, she'll be a stranger;
Struck dumb, you'll try to protest
As the drum beats out the danger...
Too late, you should have noticed

That the lady with the skin so white
Like something out of Blake or Burne-Jones
Always blocked out the light
And shadowed all you owned
You might also like
Still you think she's forever
Yesterday and tomorrow...
But no-one knows where she is

Still you swear that you can win her
And your prayer is that she'll want you;
Aware - once a saint, now you're a sinner
And your sins are going to haunt you

When the lady with her skin so white
Like something out of Edgar Allan Poe
Holds your hand so very tight
And you hope that she'll never let go


Easy targets, easy crosswords, easy life:
These key margins leave you balanced on the knife
Bleeding darkly
In the end it all comes down to sleazy bargains

That hidden key - you tried so hard to find it
All you can conceive is the effort to be worthy;
Even now you need to be reminded
That La Belle Dame is without mercy
The lady with her skin so white -
You never did quite catch her name -
And now she holds you in the night
And she'll never let go again
