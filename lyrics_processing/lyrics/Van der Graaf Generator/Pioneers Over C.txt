We've left the Earth in 1983
Fingers groping for the galaxies
Reddened eyes stared up into the void
A thousand stars to be exploited
Somebody help me, I'm falling
Somebody help me, I'm falling down
Into sky, into earth
Into sky, into earth
It is so dark around
No life, no hope, no sound
No chance of seeing home again
The universe is on fire
Exploding without flame
We are the lost ones, we are the pioneers; we are the lost ones
We are the ones they are going to build a statue for
Ten centuries ago or were going to fifteen forward

One last brief whisper in our loved ones' ears
To reassure them and to pierce the fear
Standing at controls then still unknown
We told the world we were about to go
Somebody help me, I'm missing
Somebody help me, I'm missing now
Touch with my mind, I have no frame
Touch with my mind, I have no frame
Well now, where is the time?
And who the hell am I?
Here floating in an aimless way
No one knows where we are
Though they can't feel us precisely
You might also like
There is no fear here, how could such a thing exist
In this place where living and knowing and being
Have never been heard of, have never been heard of?

Doomed to vanish in the flickering light
Disappearing to a darker night
Doomed to wander in a living death
Living anti-matter, anti-breath
Somebody help me, I'm losing
Somebody help me, I'm losing now
People around, no one to touch
People around, no one to touch

I am now quite alone
Part of a vacant time-zone
Floating in the void
Only dimly aware of existence
A dimly existing awareness
I am the lost one, I am the one you fear, I am the lost one
I am the one who crossed through space
Or stayed where I was
