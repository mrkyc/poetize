Faded, got me callin' you all through the night, oh no
Ooh, so baby, let's get fucked up, cut your phone off
I swear I'll do you right (Uh)
Put it on me, baby, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now

Uh, where you been all my life?
I've been watchin' and lookin' at all your mentions
I've been searchin' for you like a search engine
It really don't make no sense how bad you are
When God created you, He made a star
Let's put it together like the weather, make it last forever
Have you sweatin' under the sheets, you know I get you wetter
We could hit the matinee, then go to lunch at Nobu
But you on your vegetarian, so I order tofu
It's mackin' on mine, so you know that I had to pop my P's
I'm from the game, I'm wavy like the Seven Seas
I can do it nice and slow or I could pick up speed
When I leave, your pillow gon' smell like some Creed
You a Chanel wearin', Birkin bag carryin', drop McLaren steerin'
Wifey material, the type of woman I wanna be marryin'
Got an amazin' Louboutin and purse collection
I gotta pull you aside and ask you one question, uh

One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now

It's the biggest (Maybach Music)
I'm on the books and turnin' pages with a centerfold
Touchin' paper, dirty money in the envelope
Cuban links but always ended up in Mexico
A fetish for Ferraris, selfies at the Texaco (Woo)
See me winnin' now, it got me trendin' on the block
See who winnin', so they know she not another thot
Her ponytail blow in the wind when we in the drop
We independent, so it's like we sold another block
Boss

40 Water, you the pinnacle, man (Huh)
Down South, smokin' good (M-M)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Huh, Maybach Music, uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now
Know that people be listenin', so I won't be loud
Won't make a scene, I'll take you through the cloud
You want fun, girl, you know I got it (Huh)
Just stay up (Huh), 'cause we gon' do this all night
When we make love (Yeah-yeah, babe, woo)

Faded (Faded), got me (Got me)
Callin' (Callin'), you all through the night, oh no (Oh no)
Ooh, so baby, let's get fucked up, cut your phone off (Off)
Swear I'll do you right (Uh)
Put it on me, baby (Woo), oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
One question, girl, are you mine now?
Mine now, mine now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Uh)
