I don't like it, I love it, I wanna grip it and touch it
I'm tryna hit it and fuck it, stab it and stick it and stuck it
Get you to lick it and suck it and kiss it after I nut it
We can be friends, ain't gotta be seen in the public
I'm about that verb, that action, have that coochie havin' contractions
When I be smashin' and smackin' and sappin', thrustin' and thrashin'
Sit back and relax and have a glass of this bottle

Handbag by Celine, it seem like I already knew you
Beautiful girl, you so bad, look like somebody done drew you
My eyes salute you, you a sight for sore eyes, booty, and thighs
You and your girls should get with me and my guys
Come and get a bar of this mackin', baby girl, get rid of that sap
He ain't real, he a fraud, baby girl, that dude is a cat
When he first intervened, he bought you flowers, no doubt
But once he got in good, he started doggin' you out, uh
