It took a long time to realize and admit
That our words don't mean a thing, so keep talking your shit
How can we honestly live in fear
When everyone will die in a hundred years?

Respect, trust and loyalty
I've gave it out and I've taken it too
But what's the point when everyone
Will secretly think they're better than you?

This is what we have become
A self-absorbed population of scum
The vision of the future is like staring at the sun
God damn (God damn) the elitist ones
This is what we have become
A self-absorbed population of scum
The vision of the future is like staring at the sun
God damn (God damn) the elitist ones

This is what we have become

I've seen it all, there's nothing I haven't heard
Just stay at home and remain a coward
And swallow down that salt in your mouth
Because nobody gives a fuck what comes out

Respect, trust and loyalty
I've gave it out and I've taken it too
But what's the point when everyone
Will secretly think they're better than you?

One day we'll all regret
The things we've said
From here on out don't open your mouth
Show some fucking respect!

Show some fucking respect
Karma will come for your neck
I've run out of patience
For so-called "elitists"
