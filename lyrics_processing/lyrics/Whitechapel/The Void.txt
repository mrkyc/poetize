Bring this, motherfucker!

Grinding again, we're the legion of the south
Another year with our name in your mouth
I know how it feels to hate everything
And feel like you're alone
I am here with you, just close your eyes and listen to my voice
Spill your thoughts inside of me, they'll vanish in the void
No one can feel what we feel, this is family
Just let them burn in the fire that we've set on the world

Close your eyes
And follow the sound of my voice (Voice, voice, voice...)
Close your eyes and follow the sound
Of my voice
(Sound of my voice)

We are the void where the pain is obsolete
You don't have to feel a thing or think that life is not complete
We are the void, just let go and free your mind
Come with us into eternity and leave the rest to die
One more fucking time!

Never again will I be on this earth
Float with me into the void and witness rebirth
The overwhelming beauty takes the air from your lungs
Time doesn't exist, we'll stay forever young


When you think you're lost, close your eyes
And follow the sound of my voice (Voice, voice, voice...)
Close your eyes and follow the sound
Of my voice

We are the void where the pain is obsolete
You don't have to feel a thing or think that life is not complete
We are the void, just let go and free your mind
Come with us into eternity and leave the rest to die

We are the void
You don't have to live a lie
Be yourself and nothing less
Take my hand, and we'll watch the world burn
From the sky
Take my hand, and we'll watch the world burn
Be where we're supposed to be
Take my hand, and we'll watch the world burn
From the sky
Take my hand
