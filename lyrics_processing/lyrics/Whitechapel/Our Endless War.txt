Let's go!

America, our wasteland, where death is entertainment
The place where moving forward means you turn the other direction
A place where reality existed
And we still continue to bleed

Red, white, blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth, so we say "Fuck you"
My country 'tis of greed
Sweet land of idiocracy

This is our endless war
While we still have liberty
Let's take back our justice for all

We can march at sundown
Upon Capitol Hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
See Whitechapel LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like
Let's take it back
We, the people, have spoken against
Our endless war

There is nothing left to prove
We've spoke our minds, risked our lives, make your move
Tread lightly, choose your words wisely
Or we will refuse to bleed

Red, white, blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth, so we say "Fuck you"
My country 'tis of greed
Sweet land of idiocracy

While we still have liberty
Let's take back our justice for all

Shut it down, fifty states united as one
But we still can't find a solution, where have we gone?
It seems that our motto to live by
When you're chin deep in shit, duck, breathe, and die
Duck, breathe, and die
Let's take back our justice for all

We can march at sundown
Upon Capitol Hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
We can march at sundown
Upon Capitol Hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war

I've said it before and I'll say it again
This world is ours
Let's take it back and give them their war
Let's take it back
We, the people, have spoken against
Our endless war

My country 'tis of greed
