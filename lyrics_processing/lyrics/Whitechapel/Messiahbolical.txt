The time has come at last
For years, we have followed the wake of his perilous rule
Serpent of deception, you will fall
To your knees when this is all said and done
March, my minions, for I have freed you
From your timeless chambers
I have been dying to see you die
Among all the witnesses to my last words

Your pitiful scheme will fail
You will fail again
Your pitiful scheme will fail
You will fail again

If you only knew the harm I've caused
In my journey to cleanse you from this earth
Every firstborn child I have slaughtered
And every virgin I have defiled
Even the blind have seen my blasphemies
The deaf hears my sacrilege

Halt! Fallen one, I provoke thee
I created your existence
I can surely cease you of life
So kill yourself
Mindless fool, your apprentice has expired
Banished to the netherworld from which I have spawned
Where is your sense of tyranny?
You can't even keep up with your own kind
My name is scattered amongst those who have feared this day
I am not who you claim me to be

My name is scattered amongst those who have feared this day
I am not who you claim me to be

Do you know what you have done?
This is what we've become
I sense your pathetic guilt
This is what we've become
How you underestimate the power of denial sickens me
And I reject any last apologies
This is the last time you hear my name
But forever, I haunt your dreams of agony

You know my name
I am the fallen one
I am all that is evil
I am diabolical


I am the end
I am the end
