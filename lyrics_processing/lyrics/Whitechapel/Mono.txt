Nothing satisfies me
A cold dark room is where you'll find me
I can feel the hatred slowly climbing
Fuck yourself if you don't like what I'm writing

Don't ask me where to start
And I don't really care if your life is falling apart
Don't waste your time, you're gonna burn in hell
Say seven "Hail Mary's" and kill yourself
Yeah!

I hope that this song will right your sad pathetic lives
I hope you believe what I just said, 'cause it's a lie
Get my name out of your mouth before you choke
Or you can swallow it down and shit out your soul
I've made a name for myself in this dying scene
So that when I die I'll haunt your dreams

I'm so sick of everything
What in this life is left to gain
It's the same thing every day
I need change

Don't ask me for guidance
I live my life for unnecessary violence
I can't help that I'm vain and self-righteous
If it was legal to kill it would be on my license

Don't ask me where to start
And I don't really care if your life is falling apart
Don't waste your time, you're gonna die alone
I'll just stay right here and rot to the bone

I hope that this song will right your sad pathetic lives
I hope you believe what I just said, 'cause it's a lie
Get my name out of your mouth before you choke
Or you can swallow it down and shit out your soul
I've made a name for myself in this dying scene
So that when I die I'll haunt your dreams

I'm so sick of everything
What in this life is left to gain
It's the same thing every day
I need change
I want nothing more than global devastation
It's all around you, just open your eyes
Stop whining for a better life
Just kill yourself, your kids and your wife!

No one cares
Kill yourself
