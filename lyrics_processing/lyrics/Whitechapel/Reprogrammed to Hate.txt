Why have a plan for humanity when you haven't done anything yourself?
If I were you I'd run and hide, because a beautiful darkness has arrived
The one you call father is dead and gone
I slit his throat, I slit his throat, resurrected him and did it again

This bitter world is in my hands, no false pretentiousness son of man
Will inhibit the structures I've devised
Beneath the clouded smoke, beneath the acid rain
The tombs of a fallen race are revived and reprogrammed to hate
Reprogrammed to hate

But why have a plan for humanity when you haven't done anything yourself?
If I were you I'd run and hide, because a beautiful darkness has arrived
The one you call father is dead and gone
I slit his throat, I slit his throat, resurrected him and did it again

These drones of hell will rid the smell of putrid human failure
Man is his own worst enemy
How could you hope, how could you dream for such impossibilities?
Man is his own worst enemy

Man is his own worst enemy
Man is his own worst enemy

What doesn't kill you makes you a victim of eternal torture
What doesn't kill you makes you a victim of infernal flames
This isn't a plea for power, it's the beginning of a revolution
The revolution of extermination, the revolution of total control

I have nothing, nothing to hide
I'm the alpha and the omega
I have nothing, nothing to hide
Imprisoned with no afterlife
