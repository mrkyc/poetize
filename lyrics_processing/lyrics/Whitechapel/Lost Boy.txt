As I approach to the grasslands, I see a golden light
The moon never lies to a wicked eye
For my serpent tongue can only taste the flesh of an only son
Let my tainted blood flow through the parallels of our orphan veins
No man could ever understand the depths of our brain
Take a look at yourself, it's inconsequential
To stare into the eyes of a lost boy

Don't let the truth silence our voice
We have the choice to
Push the boundaries of our own consciousness
Can you not feel the vibrations?
Can you not feel the
Cold blood pumping into your blackened heart?

There's a world beyond the surface of our minds
Where absolute truth won't vanish from our eyes
Let the spirit divide our moral sense and pride
And descend together, forever you are mine

We are coming of age
And the life that you live will turn years into days
Haven't you learned from what she became?
It spawned a demon that ripped an angel from its wings
What is the purpose of living a lie?
When truth is revealed, you'll succumb to the eye's madness

Its power lives deep within us
We can return to
All that we have lost to this withered earth

There's a world beyond the surface of our minds
Where absolute truth won't vanish from our eyes
Let the spirit divide our moral sense and pride
And descend together, forever you are mine
Forever you are mine

Underneath my shadow is a snake
And it's telling me that
I should run far away
But I know its voice will be
Echoing forever (Echoing forever)
Echoing forever (Echoing forever)
Lost boy
We are one and the same, no matter how much
You resist me, I'm with you
We're in this together, you're mine forever

We are connected
We are the orphan sons
I am the voice that guides you
You're mine forever
You're mine forever
