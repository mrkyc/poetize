I, I, dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise

Get out of my head
Someone save me from this madness, I'd rather be dead
All I see is reality
Fabricated by something I refuse to see
You know who I am
You created me by letting yourself believe
Take my cold dead hands
And go six feet down, your failure is found

I, I, dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise

Take me away, take me away
Take me away, take me away

Take me away!
Take me away! (Take me away!)
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
From this self-imprisoned, self-made hell

Don't be surprised, this is your mind
Coming to life by self-sacrifice
This tragedy of death
Will walk hand in hand with every thought of regret
Blame yourself for what you've become
The mind is a powerful thing set to self-destruct (Destruct)
Mind-fucked (Mind-fucked)
You had your chance, your time, this is the end of the line
This is the end of the line
This is the end

I, I, dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise
