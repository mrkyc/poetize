All starting out to find a home with little girls and boys
And as that little railroad train began to chug along
The little engine up in front was heard to sing this song
Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, I feel so good today
Oh, clear the track, oh clickety clack, I'll go my merry way
The little train went roaring on, so fast, it seemed to fly
Until it reached a mountain rising almost to the sky
The little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away
But halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say
I can't go on, I can't go on, I'm weary as can be
I can't go on, I can't go on, this job is not for me
The toys got out to push but all in vain alas, alack
And then a great big engine came a whistling down the track
They asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side
But with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied
Don't bother me, don't bother me to pull the likes of you
Don't bother me, don't bother me, I've better things to do
The toys all started crying 'cause that engine was so mean
And then there came another one, the smallest ever seen
But though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along
She hitched on to the train and as she pulled she sang this song
You might also likeI think I can, I think I can, I think I have a plan
And I can do most anything if I only think I can
Then up that great big mountain with the cars all full of toys
And soon they reached the waiting arms of happy girls and boy
And though that ends the story it will do you lots of good
To take a lesson from the little engine that could
Just think you can, just think you can, just have that understood
And very soon you'll start to say, I always knew I could
I knew I could, I knew I could, I knew I could
