Without an umbrella covering my head
And I'd have stood up to that bully when he pushed and shoved
And called me names but I was too afraid
And I'd have gone on and seen Elvis that night
He came to town and Mama said I couldn't
And I'd have gone skinny dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to and I didn't
Oh I, I'd have done a lot of things different
I wish I'd have spent more time with my dad
When he was alive, now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother just how much I loved him
Before he went off to war but I just shook his hand
And I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday mornings
When my grandma begged me to, but I was scared of God
And I wish I would have listened when they said
"Boy, you're gonna wish you had, but I wouldn't"
Oh I, I'd do a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would

One time so bad she could taste it
I should have bought it but I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow
Trim it in blue and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't have hurt nothing
Oh, and she loved to be held
And kissed and touched but I didn't do it
Not nearly enough and if I'd know
That was going to be our last dance
I'd have told the band to play on
And on and on and on and on
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would
Oh I, I'd have done a lot of things different
Yes I, I'd do a lot of things different
