Monday mornin', oh my head
Gotta go & do it all again
Wake up baby, rise & shine
It's coffee, eggs & bacon time
Walk your workin' man out to the car
The boss is in his usual mood
Not one thing does he approve
Sometimes you can't keep him satisfied
Up & down the assembly line
Weary faces much like mine
Showing the wear & tear in their eyes
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Big policeman in his prime
Sits behind his billboard sign
Aims his radar gun right straight at me
A letter from the IRS
Says "Boy, you're taxes are a mess"
Is this the way the good life's supposed to be?

Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Stumble from my good warm bed
Monday mornin', oh my head
Gotta go & do it all again
Too much room in the Frigidaire
The kids all need new shoes to wear
Payment's late on my old truck again
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man

Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
