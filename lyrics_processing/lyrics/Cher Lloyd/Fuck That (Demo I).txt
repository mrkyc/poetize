Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na

I know you think I need ya, but we both know that I don't
I know you think I'll ring ya, but we both know that I won't
Yeah, I would jump out of a plane to get away from you
Yeah, I would jump out of a plane without a parachute

In your mind, I know you think I'm wrong (Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na)
Is it so impossible to think that I won't miss you when I'm gone, gone, gone (Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na)

I guess this is the part where I feel sad
Missin' all the things we never had
Wishin' that you'd take me back, me back
Oh no, on second thought, f*** that

Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na (F*** that)
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na (F*** that)
You might also like
I was smart enough to know a boy like you don't change
If you were my umbrella, I would get wet in the rain
Now everythin' is looking up, we'll do it 'til we drop
Now everythin' is looking down, so up another shot

In your mind, I know you think I'm wrong (Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na)
Is it so impossible to think that I won't miss you when I'm gone, gone, gone (Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na)

I guess this is the part where I feel sad
Missin' all the things we never had
Wishin' that you'd take me back, me back
Oh no, on second thought, f*** that
