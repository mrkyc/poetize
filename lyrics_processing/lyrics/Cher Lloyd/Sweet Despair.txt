Tell me, what do you see in her?
'Cause I've been living in sweet despair

I don't really know what's in the cards of life
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight

Love was hidden within' your smoke
Blinding lights and disheartened hope

Oh-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in
Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on, put the knife in
You've been foolish
And I've been stupid
Go-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in

I hear voices inside my head
Something's different inside this bed (Inside this bed)

I don't really know what's in the cards of life
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight

Oh-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in
Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on, put the knife in
You've been foolish
And I've been stupid
Go-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in

I'll be crying, you'll be screaming, we'll come crumbling down
Just the thought of you and I another face in the crowd
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this battle ground
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now
You'll be sorry, I won't worry, I'm okay with it now
Just remember what you did and how it didn't work out
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this battle ground
You're on your own now, you're on your own now
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in

Oh-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on, put the knife in
Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on, put the knife in
You've been foolish
And I've been stupid
Go-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
