Mmm, yeah
La la la la la (Haha)

Hey, boy, you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away, way, way
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns (Uh!)

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)

Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryna rock them ugly, jeans, jeans, jeans (Uh!)
You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like, boo-hoo-hoo (Uh!)

Remember all the things that you and I did first?

But I still had you first, uh-oh, uh-oh
