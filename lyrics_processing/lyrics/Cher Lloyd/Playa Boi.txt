No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of

Them boys always acting so mean
Hands down in the dirt, don't come clean
Like a hole and a three-letter donkey (Donkey!)
Ring the bell, let me teach you something
'Cause your mama never taught you nothing
Call Pharrell 'cause you keep on frontin' (Frontin'!)

Listen up, turn it up
Listen up, turn it up

No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
He gotta lean in a gangsta stance
He needa rock all the sickest brands
And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you mess with me

Can't touch me, liar, I'm fire
You and all your tricks expired
Your ride really needs new tires
Vroom-v-vroom-v-vroom-vroom, tire!
You like my kicks? Lemme kick ya
Like a Twilight fan, I'ma bite ya
Turn around, lemme CeeLo "Forget Ya" (Forget ya!)

It's sweetness that I'm thinking of

And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you mess with me

If you want me looking your way
Baby, gotta get real
If you want me ready to play
I'ma have to feel
If you want me looking your way
Baby, gotta get real
Yeah, go and get real

No playa boi can win my love
