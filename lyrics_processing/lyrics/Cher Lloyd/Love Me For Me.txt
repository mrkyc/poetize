Phone rings, don't wanna pick it up
I'm so scared, I'm gonna say too much
I tip toe around your questions
Why you gotta dig so deep?
Tears fall and the glasses break
Inside these walls, the floor boards shake
But from outside, it's alright
Long as you looking from fifty feet

I been trying, trying
Hold my head up high
I been lying, lying
Keeping it all inside
Trying not to trust you, yeah
Take another leaf, am I broke, yeah, yeah

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what?
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
'Cause I don't want you to love me-eh-eh-eh
If you don't wanna love me for me-eh-eh-eh (oh, oh)
'Cause I don't want you to love me-eh-eh-eh (eh eh eh)
If you don't wanna love me for me
You might also like
A dollhouse is all that you could see
But it's so far from my reality
I got problems, I got issues
Sometimes it's all too much for me
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat
So I give it to you anyway
Even though it won't taste so sweet

I been trying, trying
Hold my head up high
I been lying, lying
Keeping it all inside
Maybe I could trust you, yeah
Take another leaf, am I broke, yeah, yeah

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what? (So what?)
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is
(I'm gonna say it like it is)
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
'Cause I don't want you to love me-eh-eh-eh
If you don't wanna love me for me
Sick of all the fighting
All the slamming of the doors
The pain, the pain runs too deep to ignore
Step back, step back
Can you see it through my eyes?
I know, I know
It may be a surprise
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got
If you could see me now in my glass house
I'm not ready to let you in
Oh, yeah yeah
Not ready to let you in (oh, woah, oh, oh)

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what?
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
'Cause I don't want you to love me-eh-eh-eh
If you don't wanna love me for me (eh, eh, eh)
'Cause I don't want you to love me-eh-eh-eh (eh, eh, eh)
If you don't wanna love me for me (yeah, eh eh)
'Cause I don't want you to love me (eh, eh, eh)
