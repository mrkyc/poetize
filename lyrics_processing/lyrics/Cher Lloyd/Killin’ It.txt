Yeah
Haha
Yeah

Last night, what was going on?
Hold tight, only just begun
All out, load the party guns
We're the only ones
Ready, go, gone
Face down, wake up somewhere new
Spaced out, barely made it through
Every time I get into
Whatever we do
Yeah, I'm with you

So, if you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the night's had enough of us
And if you didn't know
I should tell you so and now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cause we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the wa-a-a-ay, wa-a-a-ay
Okay, yeah, we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the wa-a-a-ay, wa-a-a-ay
You might also like
Rewind where we started at
Playback all that we forgot
You, me, all the shit we got
Love it at the top
Ready, get hot
Wild hearts making our mistakes
Switched on but we're never fazed
Get down, we don't play it safe
Go out on the blaze
Live for the day

So, if you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the night's had enough of us
And if you didn't know
I should tell you so and now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cause we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the wa-a-a-ay, wa-a-a-ay
Okay, yeah, we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the wa-a-a-ay, wa-a-a-ay
