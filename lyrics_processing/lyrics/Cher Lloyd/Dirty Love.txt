I see you walking with a halo
Cover it up, yeah, cover it up now, baby
No need to try and be a hero
I've had enough, yeah, I've had enough, my baby
You got a little bit of Tarzan
Let it all out, yeah, let it all out, my baby
They say the thrill is in the chasin'
I wanna find out, I wanna find out, my baby

You're always so nice, I'm gettin' bored
You say the right things, I'm gettin' bored
And you always call first, I'm gettin' bored
Yeah, I'm gettin' bored

Ah-ah
I'm so sick of you good boys, need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead, be a cave man
Give me all your dirty love
Ah-ah
No time for the right one, need a wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead, be a cave man
Give me all your dirty love

You wanna treat me like a lady
Don't even try, no, don't even try, my baby
Ain't gotta say how much you need me
Keep it inside, yeah, keep it inside, my baby
I know I sound a little twisted
Maybe I am, or maybe I'm not, but baby
Playin' the game is so addictive
Want it to stop, don't want it to stop, but baby

You're always so nice, I'm gettin' bored
You say the right things, I'm gettin' bored
And you always call first, I'm gettin' bored
Yeah, I'm gettin' bored

Yeah
When you put your clothes back on
Somethin' always feels so wrong
Baby, all I'm thinkin' of
Is I want your dirty love, yeah

Ah-ah
