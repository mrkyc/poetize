Uh!
Mmm, yeah
La la la la la (Haha)
Uh!

Hey, boy, you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away, way, way (Uh!)
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns (Uh!)

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)

Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
You might also like
Please, this ain't even jealousy (Jealousy)
She ain't got a thing on me (A thing on me)
Tryna rock them ugly, jeans, jeans, jeans (Uh!)
You clearly didn't think this through (Yeah, yeah)
If what I've been told is true (Is it true?)
You'll be crawling back like, boo-hoo-hoo (Uh!)

Remember all the things that you and I did first? (What?!)
And now you're doing them with her (With her!)
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (Like this, uh!)
And now you're taking her to every restaurant? (Yeah, yeah)
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)

Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first, uh-oh, uh-oh

Yeah, yeah, yo

Let's go! Astro!
We used to be, but now there's a separation between you and me
Baby, I'm movin' on to another girl that understands me more
Dates in front your place so you can see it all (See it all)
I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell that you're upset, because it ain't you
Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back? We can just be friends
Don't try to sting all over again, c'mon

(Oh) Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you (No one else can have ya)
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!; I want you back)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Let me know), la la la la la
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back( What, what, what?) (Uh!)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ha ha ha
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
