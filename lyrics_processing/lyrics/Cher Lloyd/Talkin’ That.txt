Y-yo, my flow is so criminal
I'm bustin' it up, and can you hear me now?
I'm up in the party, yeah, I'm freakin' out
It's three in the mornin' on cloud nine
See me rockin' outta, the lights is on, turn 'em all
Yeah, I'm a monster, you ain't scared of nothin'
I'm backin' it up wh-while you're busy frontin'
When the talk goes sick, I'll be talkin', talkin', yeah-yeah

Look at you down, you're so minimal
You wanna be fly, but you're livin' low
I'm the b-b-b-boss 'cause I said so
I'll be rappin' the game up in the chokehold (The chokehold)
You keep talkin' ease, but I'm steady gettin' paper
I got pounds of the money, pound-pounds in my money bag
Big up to all my haters!
