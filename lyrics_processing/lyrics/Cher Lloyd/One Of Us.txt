What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus, tryna make his way home?

She was eight years old when her brother was shot
He got caught walking from the school down her own block
Couldn't take the pain
So she turned up on the streets at only sixteen
What if you grew up in a happy home
And go to church every Sunday to thank the Lord?
After work, you were walking down the street
Saw that girl on the corner, would you turn the other cheek?

What if God was one of us? How would we know?
And if there is another life, where would we go?
'Cause I've been in hell on earth before
I've seen too many people lose their soul
We're all looking for the answer, praying to the sky
But maybe we should look inside
Her papa never loved her, mama never hugged her
So she grew up untrusted

What if God was one of us (Yeah, what if He was?)
Just a slob like one of us (Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust)
Just a stranger on the bus, tryna make his way home?
(Tryna make it, yeah, we're tryna make it
Just tryna make our way home)
Tryna make his way

If I didn't say this, it would be truly wasted
I am an emanation, here's a demonstration
Excuse me if I'm blatant, but I've been really patient
I see it in every single thing that's been created
Girl on the corner or that thief in jail
Just ask, they all got a story to tell
I know you got secrets hidden in scars
Whether we throwin' ones in churches and strip bars

What if God was one of us? How would we know?
And if there is another life, where would we go?
'Cause I've been in hell on earth before
I've seen too many people lose their soul
We're all looking for the answer, praying to the sky
But maybe we should look inside
Her papa never loved her, mama never hugged her
So she grew up untrusted

What if God was one of us (Yeah, what if She was)
Just a slob like one of us (Ashes to ashes and dust to dust)
Just a stranger on the bus tryna make his way home?
(One of us, one of us, yeah)
Tryna make it, yeah, we're tryna make it
Just tryna make our way home
Tryna make his way
I wanna bleed lyrics, leave people blessed
But with this fame, it's a test
Uh, I best get a vest for my soul 'cause I'm gonna need it (Hey)
'Cause all the prophets in the past, man they've been deleted
But I'ma say this from my heart, the world needs more love
And I'm still praying to that light from above
So fuck what you heard and what you thought you knew (Yeah)
Tell me what would you do if God was you?

What if God was one of us (One of us, yeah)
Just a slob like one of us (What if He was, yeah)
Just a stranger on the bus tryna make his way home?
(Just a stranger on the bus tryna make his way home, yeah
Just tryna make his way home)
What if God was one of us (One of us, yeah)
Just a slob like one of us (Ashes to ashes and dust to dust)
Just a stranger on the bus tryna make his way home?
(Just a stranger on the bus
Tryna make it, yeah, we're tryna make it
Just tryna make our way home)
Tryna make his way home (Yeah, one of us)
