I wanna fly where no one else has flown
But I can't understand why my feet still touch the ground
I wanna say what no one else has said
And I try and I try but my mouth won't make a sound, yeah

I know you feel like this
Sometimes everybody feels like this
And when I feel like this, I tell myself

I wanna be brave
Don't wanna be like nobody else
Don't wanna feel sorry for myself
Not lost and faded
I wanna make change
Don't wanna leave dreams up on the shelf
I wanna tell haters "Go to hell"
Won't hide from faces
'Cause I, I realize everyday starts with blank pages
I, I realize everyday starts with blank pages

Don't wanna cry, 'cause no one really knows
How it feels when you're lost and you just can't shout it out
I'm in a cage, but who really cares
And I reach and I reach, but no one grabs my hand
You might also like
I know you feel like this
Sometimes everybody feels like this
And when I feel like this, I tell myself

I wanna be brave
Don't wanna be like nobody else
Don't wanna feel sorry for myself
Not lost and faded
I wanna make change
Don't wanna leave dreams up on the shelf
I wanna tell haters "Go to hell"
Won't hide from faces 'cause
I, I realize every day starts with blank pages
I, I realize every day starts with blank pages

Everybody feels like this (Hey, oh)
Sometimes everybody feels like shh (Hey, oh)
I know you feel like this (Hey, oh)
Sometimes everybody feels like shh (Hey, oh)
I know you feel like this (Oh)
Sometimes everybody feels like shh (Oh-oh)
I know you feel like this (Oh)
Sometimes everybody feels like shh (Oh-oh)
I wanna be brave (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Don't wanna be like nobody else (Oh-oh)
Don't wanna feel sorry for myself (Oh)
Not lost and faded (Oh-oh)
I wanna make change (Oh)
Don't wanna leave dreams up on the shelf (Oh-oh)
I wanna tell haters "Go to hell" (Oh)
Won't hide from faces (Oh-oh)
'Cause I, I realize everyday starts with blank pages (Oh, oh-oh, Oh, oh-oh)
