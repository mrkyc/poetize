No, you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean, shh, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up, show 'em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your hands up
Tell 'em what the truth is
Stand behind the music

You gotta get behind, cross your heart, hope to die
Splash of hype, dash of pretty, that don't mean they'll bite
Okay, alright, already, they getting money
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes, slow down
It's a fast paced world (Breathe, breathe)
Look my face in the mirror
Say, "Who the heck am I?", Look me in the eye
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time?
Just name a genre, yeah, I've tried it
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah
I need a break already, I gotta find it
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my shtick
I, I, I, I wanna stand in this pop star frenzy
Girls getting praised, look at Nicki, look at Katy
Chew it up, make my teeth rot
You think I'm talkin' to ya? I'm probably not, not
You might also like
No, you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean shh, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

Re-re-rewind, when I was a little younger
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger
LA had a taste for a new adventure
We opened every "Do not enter"
I was tryin' hard to be somebody, be the cool kid at the party
Lookin' at me loddy, doddy, hottie, hottie, hot tamale
Stranger sizing up my body, told me I could be somebody
Wait, someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy
I know, I'm not that girl
I still wanna be the leader of a f-free world
Yeah, I'm a big dreamer, I'm a believer
Just try to tell me "No," I'ma go full steam ahead
No, can't slow me down
Gonna run this town from the inside out
Block by block from the bottom to the top
I know just who I am, and I know just who I'm not
No, you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean shh, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up, show 'em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your hands up
Tell 'em what the truth is
Stand behind the music
Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your
Front row up to the nose bleeders
Hands up if you really need it
Stand behind the music

No, you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
