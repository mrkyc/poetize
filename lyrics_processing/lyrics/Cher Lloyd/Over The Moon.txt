I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
I'm over the moon
Just doing my thing, and I won't come down

I'm over the moon, no silver spoon in my Milky Way
When Simon told me I was trouble, all I said is 'ok'
Now l-l-let me turn my swag on and step up to the plate
Then I put London in my pocket, up, up, up and away

I've been chillin' out on a star with my five star view
I wanna get so far, then I see you, Boo
Reaching into the jar for a dream come true (Skipping the sky)

I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
And I can't get enough
Life is feeling so good 'cause I keep moving up
I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, and I won't come down
You might also like
I'm over the moon, so watch your head 'cause I'm throwing rocks
It feels like Redbull gave me wings and I can't be stopped
You see, I rhyme like a beast, but I sing like a flower
I'm feeling tall, so tall like the Eiffel Tower

I've been chillin' on my star with my five star view
I wanna get so far, then I see you, Boo (I see you)
Reaching into the jar for a dream come true (Skipping the sky)

I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
And I can't get enough
Life is feeling so good 'cause I keep moving up
I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, and I won't come down

Floating in space (Floating in space)
I love this place (I love this place)
ET says, "hey!" (ET says, "hey!")
My mind's so clear (My mind's so clear)
This atmosphere (This atmosphere)
I got no fear (I got no fear)
I've been chillin' on my star with my five star view
(View, view, view, view)
Reaching into the jar for a dream come true
(True, true, true, true)

I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
And I can't get enough (Ooh yeah)
Life is feeling so good 'cause I keep moving up (Oh)
I'm over the moon (Yeah)
Doing my thing, and I won't come down

Keep moving up
(And I won't come down)
I'm over, I'm over
(And I won't come down)
