Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey

Boy, I know that you want some of all this
But I'm out with my girls and you can't touch lightning
So we dance and we dance like you're just not there (Yeah, hey)
Only been over here 'bout a minute
But you already sound like a dick, stop tryin'
So we dance and we dance like you're just not there

'Cause, ew
What's wrong with you?
No, the problem is not my attitude
But you're, ew
Just not my type
And the next time I won't be so polite

'Cause (Hey)
This could be great
This could be cray
This could be the motherfucking party of the year
Trying too hard
Tryna be hot
Tryna keep on talking to us when we don't care
Keep it all in your pants, boy (Yeah, hey)
Keep it all in your pants, boy
(This could be the motherfucking party of the year)

Back it up, back it up 'cause you're killin' vibes
