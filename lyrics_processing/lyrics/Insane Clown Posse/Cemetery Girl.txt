"Tonight, tonight, we gather the dead. (tonight, tonight)
Tonight, tonight, off with your head."

My muckin' head blew up

She was lovely, long hair, short, nice booty, though
So at the funeral, it made me cry, I want to die
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep but not a wink
I only think about my lady, I miss my baby
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me
I see my therapist, she only tells me I'm in trouble
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kind of muddy
Don't dig too fast or too deep, things could get bloody
I watch my digging, I hit the top of baby's coffin
I'm thinking, well, she's better off inside if she died
Nah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me
'Cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me
I pry it open, the odor hits me, there she is
I lean down to give her a kiss because I need a...

Girl that make me happy, a girl that make me cry
A girl that passed away back in 1985
A girl I plan to marry, a girl I plan to wed
A girl that I can choke because my baby is already dead

Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl
Cemetery baby, I want you in my world
Cemetery woman, we can still be down
You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown

"Fuck yeah, motherfucker!
I don't want no stuck-up little sassy prassy bitch
You know what I'm saying?
I want me a cold stanky bitch
So bring it on, dead momma!"

She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar
Is that a bug upon her face? Oh, it's just a booger
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips
And then her neck cracks, also does her hips
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty
I notice not, we lay together on the lawn
We lay 'til dawn, I notice her left eye is gone
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a...
