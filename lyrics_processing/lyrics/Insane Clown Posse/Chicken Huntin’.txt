"Where's that mother fucker at, man? Damn. It's been about ten days, man"
"Ay! Ay, man! Over here, man"
"Yeah, what can I do for you, boy"
"Yeah, man, uh, let me get one of these chicken necks"
"A what?"
"A chicken neck, man. A red-ass chicken neck"
"A red what? Necked chicken? What?"
"A red-ass chicken neck like yours, man!"
"Like mine?!"
"Yeah, bitch!"

Well, I'm heading down a southern trail, I'm going chicken huntin'
Chopping redneck chicken necks I ain't saying nothing
To the hillbilly, stick my barrel in his eye
Boomshacka boomshacka hair chunks in the sky
Why, I never liked chicken pot pie
Or the chopped chicken on rye
So tell Mr. Billy Bob I'ma cut his neck up
Slice, poke, chop chop, stab, cut
What can you do with the drunken hillbilly?
Cut his fucking eyes out and feed 'em to his Aunt Nilly
Willy Willy chicken neck, chicken hunting gotta love it
Hit him with the twelve gauge bucket, chicken nuggets
Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog will eat 'em up fast
Last as long as you can, my man
'Cause when that chicken head hits the fan, you got
Blood guts fingers and toes
Blood guts fingers and toes
Blood guts fingers and toes
Sittin' front row at the chicken show so...

Chopping up Hilly and Billy Bob Billy
'Cause I chop motherfucking redneck silly
Peeped in your yard, tell me, what did I see?
I seen a chicken boy fucking a sheep
I say "Mister Mister, what the fuck you trying to do"

Barrels in your mouth, bullets to your head
The back of your neck's all over the shed
Boom shocka boom chop chop bang

Blow off his head but his feet still kickin'

Went to Kentucky, I got lucky
Met this hog-callin' bitch named Bucky
Riding on a chicken, milking a sow
Hittin' switches in a drop top low ride tractor plow
Redneck fella, moonshine sella
Hang him by his neckbones, chicken bones
Locked in the cellar, yellow belly chicken plucker
You redneck fucker!
