*tap* *tap* Hello?
*tap* *tap* *tap* Hello?

2:45 and the bell went off
Thank God, many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one and I walk alone
And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark
Because that's when the real show start (Tap, tap)
"Tap tap" on the glass go the piece of ass
So young and pretty, it's too bad she passed
But she comes to my room and we talk at night
She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone
And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom
But she only exist in the dark of my room

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
You might also like
I try to smile a lot, but I'm always frontin'
But I do love a ghost and at least that's somethin'
She don't talk much, when she do it gets cold
Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
We're lovers, we don't need others
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets
So I twisted its fuckin' head off at the neck
Look baby, it's bloody, it's gone, it's doomed
Please come back to the room
I'll do anything for thee, don't ignore me
This is more than a sick love story
Without you I'd bring a shotgun to school
And I will if you want me to, for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on
And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun'd be gone

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Sometimes I kiss her, I start shakin'
She slips me the tongue, and it tastes like bacon
Uh oh, something's wrong, baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
She can't come back now 'cause they know our secret
Unless I can make them keep it
If I do she may come to life
Now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen, went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
And the daddy was next runnin' down the hall
I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife
Started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done (Tap, tap)
Wash up and wait for my baby to come (Tap, tap)

Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
Love (I can't ignore you)
In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap)
Love (I do adore you)
In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass)
I waited two or three days, four days
Waitin' for the "tap tap" like always
I waited and hated this (Tap, tap)
I created a bloody mess (Tap, tap)
I waited two or three months, four months
Waitin' for the "tap tap," just for once
I waited and hated this (Tap, tap)
I created a bloody mess (Tap, tap)
I waited two or three days, four days ("Where is she?")
Waitin' for the "tap tap" like always
I waited and hated this (Tap, tap) ("Why isn't she comin' back?")
I created a bloody mess (Tap, tap) ("I fuckin' killed those people!")
I waited two or three months, four months
Waitin' for the "tap tap," just for once ("Where the fuck is she?!")
I waited and hated this (Tap, tap)
I created a bloody mess (Tap, tap) ("Why isn't she coming back?!")

I waited two or three days, four days
(Love)
Waitin' for the "tap tap" like always ("I can't believe I did it")
(In my room)
I waited and hated this
(Love)
I created a bloody mess ("I killed them!")
(In my room, you and I)
I waited two or three months, four months
(Love)
Waitin' for the "tap tap," just for once ("Where is she?!")
(In my room)
I waited and hated this
(Love)
I created a bloody mess
(In my room, you and I)

"Hey, man, let me get some of that "
"Yeah, uh, listen, I'm not a crackhead"
