Psycho cyphers Michael Myers set your body on fire

I walk up with an AK and light up your concert
Just killing anyone that's happy you alive
If you survive in a suit and tie you getting crucified
With a nail gun
Motherfucker, my dick's so big that it look like a whale tongue
Mac-11 Lethal dropping microphones up in it
It's the middle of the map its Kansas City that I hail from
Everybody fuck with me, I rip so nice and fast kid

I'm with that dark juggalo clique
The Incredible Hulk on some Mark Ruffalo shit
I got a big hard buffalo dick
I might start humping your chick

Mafia! (Yeah) DJ Paul!
Hundred off in a clip
I'ma push it like the 
Double barrel, double R's on the grill
Diamond fangs in a grip
Johnny Dang on the drip
Smoke a quarter word to Elon, more notorious than B.I.G
Was strappin' 'fore I had a gun ID
Rubber bands on a hundred grand layin' on my hand like I'm T.I.P
Nigga this is just a PSA
I'm dropping bones like I'm DTP
Pass the weed like a box of yay
Niggas copy but I do get paid
Surf's up tryna ride this wave
I got pocket rockets and some knotted wallets and some molly in a Gucci safe
Twenty bitches on a twenty gauge
Twenty haters that's twenty graves
Beat the case like MMA
Run the club like some RCAs
Nothin more new to this silence
I'm colorblind 'til I get violent
Run your mouth you got some mileage
Feature my work to O'Reilly's, nigga

Take me out the worst way
Apocalypse on my birthday
When you starving you eat shit 'til I piss on all the thirsty
For your applause my mental problem
Out for revenge every autumn
Stimulate to get down 'em all
From innovators fend 'em off
And lock me up nightly go psycho when you don't like me
What's in my hands? Ain't my ID
At gunpoint make you recite me
I see some demons that might be trying to fuck me or fight me
Because I wasn't wrapped tightly at Heaven's Gate in black Nikes
I'm in that house like a home invasion
Because your family need a renovation
Say ho don't say amen, say 6-7-8-9 say 10
I'm a trapped ghost in a iPod
And the batteries have been died, God
Evil in me, no antidote
It's boring shooting cantaloupe
And I'm about what killers do
So much they start to kill in school
The heroes lame, the villains cool
Death is here I'm feeling cruel
Burnt flesh that's brand loyal
Bullet holes your guts boil
King of nothing, Fuck royal
There will be blood, I struck oil

What I'm Freddy Kruger, Lex Luthor, Chad Kroeger
The dick in Nickleback who tickle fat nipples on cougars
Sippin' Boocha, your boo fuck with me
'Cause I'm super fly, I splash her neden Jimmy Snuka
I'll slap you, spin your face 'round through the back of your head
You'll have to chomp a hole through your wig or suffocate dead
I'll make the sunshine bright at midnight or black out at noon
Put so much heart in this every beat kicks as a sonic boom
I blow hurricanes, spit monsoons and stomp earthquakes
And me and my Ruby known to bust and murder snakes
I'll snatch right up in your earhole put your brain in your hand
You'll still be trying to comprehend when you end (Dang man)
The hatchet been chopping for years
I'll flex on all of my peers
So high I be poppin' your ears
You rockin' a toilet career
You bust to a brush in a mirror
You flush and your fans disappear
Your stacks are like flat as a beer
Left out in the sun for a year
Trained in Shaolin, red moon howlin'
Decades deep, stomach still growlin'
Elbow to eyeball I'm foulin'
'Til your momma threw the towel in
But I caught it, she fought it and brought it, I applauded
But my rocket kick out it clocked out I sock it and she bought it
With that shing-shing-shing-shing walla-walla bing bing
True ninjutsu Joe Bruce ying yang
Six Six Fivin' big dicks diving
Up in you bitch it's a ICP thing
ICP THANG
