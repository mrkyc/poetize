Bragga shag, shubba wugga bah
Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic, yo

Met this kid named Louie Lou
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders
From Mookan House to Shangri-La
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata
Follow me, and join us as we pray
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Delray
Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells
Got my own food, who wants some?
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue
A non-believer once started to laugh
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass
Then everybody heard him squeal
"This voodoo shit's for real!" It just takes
You might also like
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic, yo

Gripped down Vernor on a windy night
You see voodoo scribblings in the moonlight
Painted all on the city street
It's the ancient craft of gang bangin'
Hey! J! What's in the pack?
A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sack
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake?
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake
"Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba
Sleep no longer, raise, quick
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba"
"Leave us alone, you fuckin' punk bitch!"
Well, fuck it, I ain't that good yet
But one day you can bet I'm a freak
We'll make the whole world dance with the dead
And just like my homie said, it only takes
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic, yo
Branga shag, shugga wugga bah

Voodoo running from my magic
Voodoo running from my magic
Voodoo running from my magic
I'll make a voodoo doll out of ya and flick your nuts

A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little droop
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo
Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic, yo
Branga shag, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic, yo
