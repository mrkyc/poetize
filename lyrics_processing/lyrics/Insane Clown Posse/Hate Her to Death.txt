She's always saving my life, but she don't belong to me
She tells me things are alright, but she don't belong to me
I try to follow her light, but she don't belong to me
I feel her venomous bite, 'cause she don't belong to me

She's carin', she's fine, she's smilin'

I want you off this planet
(I fuckin' hate her to death)
