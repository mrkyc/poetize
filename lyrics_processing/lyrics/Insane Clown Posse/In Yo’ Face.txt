In yo' face!
Something special
"Somethin' special for you and yo' face, bitch!"
"Go get 'em, boys."
In yo' face!
Something special
"Exclusive! For you!"
Something exclusive

I pop out the box, swing on a spring
Big Violent J with the axe out, shing!
Trouble we bring, a juggalo thing
Wicked clown with the boom pow bang, in yo' face!
Smash through the glass as the fireworks blast
Shaggy the clown here to murda some ass
I be the strangala! known coast to coast
And I turn any thug into a ghost, in yo' face!
Some scream juggalo only when it's convenient
And no they don't mean it, we sick of bein' lenient
Step yo' ass back before the hatchet attacks
And you catch a few hacks from the axe, in yo' face!
I crawl like a tarantula on my toes and thumbs
Born to the carnies gypsies and bums
I spit my raps in tongues over voodoo drums
Bitch wicked shit this way comes, in yo' face!

I was fuckin' this slut up in her dirty ass
Threw the rubber out the window as we drove past
Funny thing I ain't see you standin' on the grass
And it fuckin' stuck to your mustache, in yo' face!
Bang to the pow, wang to the mouth
Boom go the wicked clowns Southwest style
From Pluto to your anus, we underground famous
For doom and 808 bass booms, in yo' face
I shook the hand of Satan wit' a cross in my palm
Burnt all the flesh all the way up his arm
I wasn't scared, I was giddy to do it
Then I lopped his head off and threw it, in yo' face!
Insane Clown Posse never gonna fade
Helped yo' ass get laid back in 8th grade
Many years passed and we still top grade
Blowin' up like a hand grenade, in yo' face!

Billy Bill, Jumpsteady, and Nate the Mack
Down 'til the end and never take it back
I'd die for the Hatchet, he Psychopathic Records boys bumpin'
Wicked shit thumpin', in yo' face!
They all wanna kill us but we already dead
And if they think we'll ever die they severely mislead
Phonies out there posin' as juggalos
But see it as a demographic to push what have it, in yo' face!
Neden- if you ain't down with that, fuck off
I like gettin' my dick sucked, jacked off and salad tossed
Ugly hoes, fine hoes, none go to waste
But for you, herpe meth head anus, in yo' face!
Mike E. Clark he make the street pound
Legz Diamond, all around in surround sound
One fork up and the other one down
Fuckin' throwin' up the wicked clown, in yo' face!
