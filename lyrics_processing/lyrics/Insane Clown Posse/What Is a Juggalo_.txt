Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I can juggle, oh
Dead dirty carnies
I'm just a juggalin' juggla, juggalin'
Jugglas!
Jokero juggalo
Well, you know the Juggla
I'm the Jugga-lugga-locoro
Well, you know the Juggla
Dead dirty carnies, dead juggalos
The room of joker-o's
But I can juggle, oh, like you never thought you'd ever know
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
Juggla, J-ay-ay
Jugglas!
Now shut your ass up and let the Juggla sing

What is a juggalo? Let me think for a second (Well?)
Oh, he gets butt-naked
And then he walks through the streets, winking at the freaks
With a two-liter stuck in his butt-cheeks
What is a juggalo? He just don't care (Don't care)
He might try to put a weave in his nut hair
'Cause he could give a fuck less what a bitch thinks
He tell her that her butt stinks, and all that
What is a juggalo? He drinks like a fish
And then he starts huggin' people like a drunk bitch
Next thing, he's pickin fights with his best friends
Then he starts with the huggin' again. Fuck!
What is a juggalo? A fucking lunatic (Tick tock)
Somebody with a rope tied to his dick
Then he jumps out a ten-story window
*Crash* Oh!
