MOTHERFUCKER! YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT, DO YOU?
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW SHIT IF IT WHIP KICKED YOU
IN YOUR UGLY BITCH-ASS FACE
YOU AIN'T EVEN BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE DRAMA, MOTHERFUCKER
YOUR MAMMA
YOUR MOTHERFUCKING BIG FAT CHICKEN FACE ASS MAMMA
Don't EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS DRAMA, MOTHERFUCKER!

Oh my god! look at that turn it up please
Poor Nancy Kerrigan's sweet little knees
Somebody took a black thing and went thump
That's terrible! We heard about it for months
What about that one nobody guy that they found?
Dead in the grass with his dick in his ass
Plus there was more but you won't recall
Because Michael noskcaJ squeezed up on some little kid's balls
What you consider drama
Ain't all that, it's just that you're wack
We can intergalactic satellite data compress (Yes)
But we can't feed the homeless (Oh)
And then OJ's wack story unfolded
Everybody watched that while Oklahoma exploded
Nine hundred good reasons why this world really don't care
That's what it costs for a wheelchair!

Is she so terrible you gotta beat her, you bitch ass wack motherfucker?!

Lordy-Lordy we got a protest that (What?)
Some rock and roll ninja bit the head off a rat
Let's march in his concert and chant him to hell
'Cause he's so fucking terrible
Meanwhile his records sales double and triple
'Cause of you writin' about him rubbing his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bands
Instead of helpin' them poor people eatin' out of them garbage cans
When you done with that, bitch, come protest me
Shit, motherfucker I could use some money
The whole world was crying when Kurt went co-bang!
When Eazy-E died though, it wasn't no thang (Nope)
Rapper dies of AIDS but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Heroin and a shotgun, a hero was made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

Are your kids so terrible you gotta beat on them too, you drunk motherfucker?

(Rebel flag) In your schools
(Rebel flag) In your parks
(Rebel flag) In your courtrooms
(Rebel flag) In your hearts
(Rebel flag) Stood for slavery
(Rebel flag) Stood for war
(Rebel flag) Stood for hatred
But you just go ahead and hang your flag up some more!
Don't worry about my goddamn flag, boy
What's terrible is you damn rappers cursin'!

The country we live in was built by slaves
Beat on and murdered and stuffed in their graves
You put a slave owner on the one dollar bill
And you wanna know why I kill people?
Bombs are blowing up, cops are corrupt
And all you care about is who the president fucked?
You don't know terrible, you will
As soon as our wagons come over the hill!
