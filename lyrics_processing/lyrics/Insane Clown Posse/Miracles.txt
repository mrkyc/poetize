We got a theory
You see, Mike, we got a theory
About magic, and miracles
That's right, that's right

If magic is all we've ever known
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
The sun and the moon, and even Mars
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
UFOs, a river flows
Plant a little seed and nature grows
Niagara Falls and the pyramids
Everything you believed in as kids
Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen
You might also like
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Music is all magic
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Pure motherfuckin' magic. Right?
This shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)

Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
Water, fire, air and dirt
Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
Miracles ain't nothing to lie
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
To witness that without explanation
Take a look at this fine creation
And enjoy it better with appreciation
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
To ignore the miracles of every day
And that's real
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles?) Shit's crazy
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
(So many miracles, the magic miracles)

Are you a believer in miracles?
Do you have time for the miracles?
Do you notice and recognize miracles?
So many miracles, the magic miracles

Well, we're here! We came all the way to Ash, Nevada!
Come on!
Where's the show and where's our money?
I came all the way from England! Where's me bloody 'undred thousand pounds?
What I wanna know is where in hell is my goddamn hundred thousand dollars?
And where can I get some beer in this motherfucker?
I thought this was a carnival. Where's all the sexy kids at? Don't tell me I brought all this candy for nothing!
I didn't come all this way to stand around here with all these goddamn tadpoles! Let's get a move on!
Start this shit so we can get paid!
