The Carnival of Carnage
The Ringmaster
The Riddle Box
The Great Milenko
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers
And The Wraith
Looks like we're all out of time, brother
Everybody's out of time
Fuck it, we gots to tell 'em
All secrets will now be told
No more hidden messages
This is it y'all
Time's up
Everything be out right here
No need for the reverse talking
The truth

Now we've been told this Carnival shit has touched on many lives (That's right)
People have fuckin' sworn to us, they too can feel it inside
What is it that draws you in, this magic that compels you? (What it is)
We've been waiting six fuckin' Joker Cards to finally tell you
The messages and hints were there, although most never picked up on 'em (Nah)
We snuck 'em in subliminally with that wicked shit around 'em
We mentioned more and more of this on every Joker's Card
The bottom line, always the same, you ain't have to look hard
We wickedly kick it, inflict it, you get it, get with it and dig we don't preach it flat out
'Cause some ninjas don't wanna get wit ya, they quick to forget ya without the Hatchet and gat out (Yeah)
So we rose the Hatchet, do or die, now Juggalos standing tall
After all six have risen, the end of time will consume us all
It ain't got nothing to do with us (Nope) it ain't Psychopathic Records (Sure thing)
All we're doing is pointing shit out to you, we in this together (I'm saying)
Who's behind the Dark Carnival, the Gatherings and the Hatchet (Skwo)
Who's behind Dark Lotus, the Circus and everybody at it
Who invented Juggalos and Juggalettes and fuckin' Faygo showers
What about that feeling you get when bumping our shit, who's behind the Juggalo powers
This ain't no fucking fan club, it ain't about making a buck (Sure ain't)
Don't buy our fuckin' action figures, bitch, I don't give a fuck
It ain't about Violent J or Shaggy, the Butterfly or Seventeen
When we speak of Shangri-La (What it is) what you think we mean (What? What?)
Truth is we follow God, we've always been behind Him (That's right)
The Carnival is God, and may all Juggalos find Him
You might also likeMay the Juggalos find him, may the Juggalos find him
