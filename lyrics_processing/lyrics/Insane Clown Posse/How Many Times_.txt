Ya feel better now? I didn't let ya pass
How 'bout I stop my car and beat your fuckin' ass?
How many times will my neighbor beat his wife?
Somewhere in that house there's a butcher knife
Fuckin' drunk, swingin' his fist about

How many times will I sit in a hot car?
Traffic jam, been sittin' for a fuckin' hour
Must be an accident, I hope nobody died
Finally get there, and the crash is on the other side
The gawkers roll by and creep slow
Hopin' they can see a mangled body show
Some park and stand there and watch it all
With their kids, they point, and fuckin' stare, and just look
I remember one time I was pulled over
Handcuffed, the cop was like, "show's over"
People watching, hoping that he shoots me
I just wanted to choke their fuckin' heads

And have to listen, and learn all this bullshit?
Learnin' history and science, fuckin' wait
Knowin' that, will that put food on my plate?
