This one goes out to that special someone in my life
Oh we all have somebody special, this is for them

I like ice cream, cherry pie
And lemonade with summer breeze
I like rainbows, leafy trails
And puppy dogs with bumblebees
I like cotton candy gum
And bumper cars at carnivals
Golden skies and hazel eyes
And sand in-between my toes...
But

SOMETHIN' TELLS ME THAT I HATE YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME I MUST KILL YOU!

YOU AIN'T SHIT BUT A SLUTTY ASS MOTHERFUCKING SLUT YOU FUCKING WHORE!
I FUCKING HATE YOU!

I like birthday candle cakes
And titty shakes with silicone
Secret whispers and D-Loc's Sister
And apple dips, gingerbread homes
Faygo chills, they give me thrills
And NyQuil pills, they make me smile
Hershey Kisses and happiness is
Something so bliss, and yet all the while
You might also like
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME THAT I HATE YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME I MUST KILL YOU!

SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, AND FUCK OFF!
GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU FUNKY ASS LITTLE BIOTCH!
I'LL, F-, I'LL FUCKING PINCH YOUR NIPPLES SHUT!

I like Shaggy, he's my friend
I like his mom 'cause she's nice to me
Thank you J, I like you too
Oh well, it's okay, we're family
Raver chicks and kung-fu flicks
And sugar sticks like lollipop (popping sound)
All these things happiness brings
But my hatred for you don't stop...
Bitch

SOMETHIN' TELLS ME THAT I HATE YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME I MUST KILL YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME THAT I HATE YOU!
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME I MUST KILL YOU!
BITCH, I FUCKING HATE YOU!
I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU, YOU SKANTLESS BITCH!
