One fucking question: tell me, where my Juggalos at
This life is a blessing thank God that I chose rap
Wicked clowns in your town know that the shows packed
Down 'til I'm in the ground everybody knows that
Fill 'em when I get it so you better get the medic
I'm about to blow motherfuckers wig back - dig that
Breaking ya bones like a twig- crack
Put it in the box like a Big Mac run and tell the pigs that
I said "Fuck the police til I'm dead!"
At least I'm a beast in my head
I'm violent 'cause a riot, now bye Fed!
I'm all in you, fallin' and ballin' like west group
Really never had money, never got a checkbook
Stress took away 'cause I got it down dead rook
Know that I'm fresh loose, leavin' the rest shook
Higher and higher and this flow she die for
And I know this hydro that I blow is fire
Just like a pyro, so check out my bio
I'm horned like a rhino and women admire
Young lizzle, hotter than the sun sizzle
'Bout to do my thug dizzle, 'bout to blow up like scud missle
Psychopathic hearthrob heart guy- I could make a tongue drizzle
Thats official. Professional juggalo prolo
Fuck on my team, that's a no-no
Respect that logo
This show, ho, what I stand fo'
Psychopathic Records my fam-o
Better watch, I'm about to eat ammo
Cause I am the Juggalo Rambo
Underground down, like a manhole
The mainstream cannot handle
I got shit for brains, I'm switching lanes
With the hatchet man sticker on that Lambo
Goin' HAM, bro, party 'til the bar closed
Car loads of hoes get swiped like barcodes
Bottle full of narcos up on the ceiling at Harpos
Only at our shows
I'm a rockstar slash monstar
I know I'm goin' fuckin' high star
I got a show to wreck, psychopathic soul to check
Your city I'ma bop hard
Then I stun a motherfucker, you ain't even gotta wonder
I'mma hit you with that thunder, I'm Godzilla!
Fuck you, my squad reala
Deep past that mob killa
Voodoo, Clay, Shaggs, J, Lyte and that ninja Ouija
Its all over, never weepy
Say at the door when you see me
Fuck the TV, the radio, this only for a select few
The only way I'll ever bury this hatchet is deep in your neck when I end you
You might also like
Throw up your sign, blow up your nine
Paw, pap, click, pop!
Skull, cap, spit, slop!
Fall back, click, chop!
All that, slick, hot!
Draw, gat, kick, drop!
Jaw, jack, get shot!
Sword play and quick stomp!
It seems the demon lives deep inside of me
Crying, it's dyin' to kill, kill, kill
Deep in my heart, it's the oddity part
Please, slaughter me, I'm promising I'd oughta be killed
Throbbing, my arteries, always it startles me
Sure to bring murder and kill, kill, kill
Gotta be outta me, shock or lobotomy!
I can't take this out of me, I wanna be killed
What's Juggalo love if you're not a Juggalo
And you got a lotta bullshit, a whole lotta ho shit
Nobody know that ya owe shit
On a whole lotta old shit, got a whole lot of bullshit
Kinda wanna throw shit, kinda wanna throat slit
Kinda wanna go get a four fifth and hold it
Load it, run up in sauna and explode it
Down the road into a Benihana and unload it
*Gunshot* Oh shit, you so lit
Blow shit in half and laugh, they don't know shit
Smoke shit, go kid, full clip
Wall of glass, you broke it, dope shit
Hocus pocus, need to focus
Though, don't blow this please
Triggers squeezing, chokin'
On these enemies croaking, bleeding, soaking
Greedy wipe up, weedy tokin'
Screaming "heed the viper!"
In deep, preoccupied and hyper
Need it but fails, scope in a sniper
Who proceeded to open fire, BLAOW!
Now he need a diaper
We bleed for the fam, ain't right for you
 Psypher do
We fat chicks, hicks, black dicks, clits
Psychics, bikers, dykers, fags
Slackers, crackers, junkies, druggies
Thugs, scrubs, rubber necks and hags
Slugs, hackers, bums, lackers
Winners, sinners, tweekers, drag queens
Richies, bitches, geezers, kiddies
Jerks, experts, fats flirts and gypsies
With ADD, HIV, Hep C
Epilepsy, asthma, stress and zits
Arthritis, meningitis
Crones, herpes, scabies and bitch tits
We movers, shakers, plumbers, painters
Undertakers, pizza makers
Lumberjacks, nuns for crack
Some get slapped and stumble back!
But we real to each other, bust 'em up, bust 'em up
Slug 'em up, slug 'em up, buck 'em up, buck 'em up
And we die for each other, gag 'em up, gag 'em up
Slug 'em up, slug 'em up, bag 'em up, bag 'em up
Ride 'em out, ride 'em out, take 'em out, take 'em out
Drag 'em out, drag 'em out, break it out, break it out
Chop it up, chop it up, risk stacks
Lop it up, drop it in fish snacks
My flows paint a portrait
Vividly, heaven's gate
My homeboys is insane
Literally Leather Face
I spit pure cocaine
Let it mentally resonate
It starts to sink in
Watch you physically levitate
Juggalo love and it's universal
My style's authentic and my words are hurtful
Truth when I give it, no gimmick, raw with it
All in it, y'all get it real fucking with the famo
Kush, cocaine, and gang load of ammo
Is all I keep on me, please don't sleep on me
Underground overlord, combat is my sport
Front line in a war, they ain't really ready for it
I'm rolling deep with fam
Loadin' up the yeapa
Niggas curl up when the Reaper comes
Start yellin' like Chewbacca
Hoodoo suited up and dressed to kill
I ain't nothing but a mobster
I go hard for the Juggalo nation
Spit in a face if anybody wanna say somethin' otherwise
Ride high when I fly by with my guys
All to so hell 'boutta break loose
Show you how to make moves like a double O G
From the hood, low key
Everybody know me I've been getting my grind on
Detroit had my back way before I signed on
I've got the whole city down ready to ride on
With Juggalo love everybody can vibe on (Vibe on)
It's Juggalo love 'cause that shit lasts
Every other love was shut off
Disagree? Fuck your bitch ass
You can fuck the fucking fuck the fuck off
You lick balls and your kid's soft
I'll sock your whole head bald, wig off
Rock your lid off, get hip tossed
Get lost and get kicked in your lip gloss
I ticked off a hick named Hoss that I ripped off
My bitch-made boss to the quick wash
The dick payed raw, so I lipped off
Switchblade to his jaw, made his shit fall
Quick, I dipped in his whip and zipped off
I kick balls and slit pussy lip walls
You told me to get lost, 'cause I get sauce
And fucked this girl in the butt 'til my dick soft
She like dick sauce, her clit's soft, man
So she get tossed, then shit can
Tried to beat it up and lost, the chick boss
Left in my drawers backwards, criss cross
(Jump!) Get the wig wash, to a stick gloss
Dope, black, fat, Rick Ross
My shit swass, big costs
So cold  my shit frosts
Straight to the chop chop, nope, never got pop
Juggalo love, move anything you got, hot
My brother Tre Lb we down, he'd clown
Always gonna be around, D town beat down
Juggalo love any time you hear the beat pound
Every day we put our feet down to the street sound
From Guantanamo Bay to Greek town
It's Juggalo love, but I won't turn your freak down

"And now, ladies and gentlemen, from the label that runs beneath the streets, we present to you, the latest and greatest hatchet man, from the trash fires of Detroit, Murderous, by way of Sin City, Las Vegas, Ouija"

Ay, hold up
Coming up in the bitch swangin'
Leaving ya fucking head rangin'
Hey wait, Hatchet man hangin'
All on my neck and that motherfucker blangin'
Pull up or shut the fuck up 'cause you know that you busters ain't finna do nothing
Couple of holes in your face and I'm lighting your fuckin' ass up like a pumpkin
Technically, that is a vegetable, now you are no longer able to function
Kicking that baby spit I wonder who dick you been sucking
Thinking it's gravy bitch I got that biscuit and I'm dumping (Boom)
Bunch of killers in the function
Pile of haters in the dungeon
Holy shit we 'bout to crush em'
You fucking stupid if you thought we wasn't
Lyte with me bout to rush em'
Kill em' all end of discussion
Suckers claiming what they ain't
Leave em' dripping like some paint
I ain't even gotta rap
I was waiting for the shank
Taking wicked shit back
Y'all been making that shit fake
Sneak dissing little bitches
We ain't nibblin' the bait
Pop off and get knocked off ya nose chopped off of yo face
Hop off in that moth coffin, your broad offer me brace
Who in the fuck did you thought it was
Living embodiment of every murderer
Ouija the goblin the demon the gurgler
Thought they were burglar they never heard of a
Creature like me I'm unheard of
Jump on a track like a hurdler
Foreign bitch in a chopper
Sin city baby burn it up
They found a third of the bitch that I killed in the woods
But they never discovered the cabin
I got your bitch in the cabin
She off a bean and she laughing
Next day you blowing my phone up
Asking me what the fuck happened
Sorry fell off of the wagon
Right into the medicine cabinet
Comet with a come up bullshit but I'm crushing every fuckin' thing in front of me
My moment has arrived
Duck and I slide
Juggalo love on my side
That shit ain't ever gon' die
Run up on me and my posse we gon' see
What's poppin' when I let my chopper decide
Bullets collide
Crumble your skeleton, blood into gelatin
Who wanna die
Better hope all y'all hear this shit
Ouija Macc came here to peel this shit
Never been shot but I drilled this shit
Zipped the body bag up when I kill this shit
For the knockoff brand trying to steal that shit
For the mainstream trying to conceal that shit
Frontin' on me you a stale ass bitch
You gonna ask yourself why you did that shit
No implants this some real ass shit
Whole cup of game, bout to spill this shit
People in the back won't miss this shit
Like the blind do braille you can feel this shit
Sure need some barbed-wire to rip this shit
Fatality mode let me finish it
Never forget who the family is
And the place you discovered the wicked shit

I just wanna celebrate ('Cause Juggalos don't die!)
I just wanna celebrate (Cause we seventeenin'!)
I just wanna celebrate ('Cause Juggalos don't die!)
I just wanna celebrate (Yeah, motherfucker!)
Ay, ay, you bitter, we glitter
Quit pressin' albums up, you shouldn't litter
Yeah, straight wicked shit spitters
