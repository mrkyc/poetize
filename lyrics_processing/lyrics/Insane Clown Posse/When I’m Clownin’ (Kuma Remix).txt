(When I'm clownin') Uh, I get silly
Like something lace my Philly
Been known to pop a pilly
And cop a check with billy
(When I'm clownin') My heart beat poundin'
I sweat so much I'm drownin'
Because my shows astoundin'
And Faygo grape I'm downin'
(When I'm clownin') Abrakadabra
Alakazam what have ya
Quick slight of hand I stab ya
Demons crawl out and grab ya
(When I'm clownin') There's plenty laughin'
Blood on the walls, what happened?
A massive murder stabbin'
'Cause wicked shit I'm blammin'
(When I'm clownin') Shit come alive
And don't no one survive
Off the light rig I dive
And this shit ain't no jive

(When I'm clownin') I'm Psycoilly
Snatch out your icy grilly
I owes the mob a milli
'Bout to knock off a Chili's
(When I'm clownin') Mad hoes I'm springin'
They want my ding-a-ling in
"Ooh let's fuck" they singin'
I keep my hatchet swingin'
(When I'm clownin') I I I'm super sick
Bozo bopper shoot you quick
Why you? 'Cause you's a dick
Is he dead? Poke him, use a stick
(When I'm clownin') I'm heavy high powered
Mad energy devoured
The whole milky way soured
Let my acid rain shower
(When I'm clownin') Everything's a joke
That angel's wings are broke (Ha ha ha ha ha)
So hot your speakers smoke
I freak this 'til I croak
You might also like
Fresh off the red muds of Covington, Georgia
Running with a hatchet
It's Boondox with two wicked whoops for you (Whoop, whoop!)
Danny Brown, show the underground
How you get down with the clown

(When I'm clownin') Take a whole eighth to the face
Anything on my mind right now been erased
And I taste that taste of a nice thin waist
Wanna pick that up, put the pussy on my face
(When I'm clownin') Ate a whole hand full of shrooms
Huffin' on balloons got me in a spinnin' room
All these pills I consume got me hollerin' at the moon
Like, what's that, kaboom, while IC fill the room
(When I'm clownin') You don't really want it with me
You know it's Danny Brown with ICP
Grub her down low, bring her back for a G
But before you do that, lemme see ID
(When I'm clownin') Bout to drop a deuce in my Faygo
Sippin like the west got me moving up in slow-mo
Oh no, let's go, pass the blunt around
Them hoes gettin' pounded when I be clownin'

Clownin'
Wicked Clown
