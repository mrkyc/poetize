You walk too slow
I don't know the way to your home
You say follow me and I know
I look up to you
And the buildings

I'm not safe
I've made mistakes I would again
In spite of what it cost me
I said take me any place I've never been
That was how it started

Who wrote that note
Pinned it to the breast of your coat
Sorry for the people who won't
Ever get to know you, really


Who let you go
Wander through the streets, rows and rows
Maybe close your eyes
So you don't
Wonder why it hurts to know me (Yeah)
You might also like
Yeah
If you were a car, I would crash you to a wall yeah
You just yell at me, I yell at you, we couldn't last yeah
Put my best foot forward but you leave me in the past yeah
I could've just killed you
I contemplated, then I waited
Thought about it, feelings jaded
Undermined me but you overrated, I couldn't take it
I move to London, separate places
I'm better focused and you say you miss me but that shit belated yeah

I'm not safe
I've made mistakes I would again
I don't think I can stop it
You can take me any place I've never been
Is this was being lost is?

Tell all the people that you left
Tell all the world that it's too late
Tell all the friends you haven't met
I'll never feel like this again
Tell all the people that you left
Tell all the world that it's too late
Tell all the friends you haven't met
I'll never feel like this again
Tell all the people that you left
Tell all the world that it's too late
Tell all the friends you haven't met
