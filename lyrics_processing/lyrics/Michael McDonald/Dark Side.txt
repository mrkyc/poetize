I used to think us much too serious
That was long before
I lay drowning in the thought of you
Heart to the flame is an easy throw
So much more than first we know
Since you have to lose all you have to give to learn the truth
Some things we learn come easy
Then there's the things that don't
We're bound to learn the hard way
Love has no pride
We all know love is blind
And we see what we want
We find out all too soon
Love has a dark side
You learn to give up to let go
A heart can always find it's way back home
But now you're different
'Cause you've been there
And now you know
Some things we learn come easy
Then there's the things that don't
How we love to learn the hard way
Love has no pride
We all know love is blind
And we see what we want
We find out all too soon
Love has a dark side

Then there's the things that don't
How we love to learn the hard way
Love has no pride
We all know love is blind
And we see what we want
We find out all too soon
Love has a dark side
Sometimes we see it coming
Sometimes we don't
If there's time to walk away
We just let it ride
We finally reach the point of no turning back
You bet you're silver lining
Love has a dark side
Just beyond Eden's gate
Lies the dark and frozen waste
Somehow we're bound to cross the range of feel
It takes one to make the other seem real
No, no, baby
Some things we learn come easy
Then there's the things that don't
We love to learn the hard way
Love has no pride
We all know love is blind
We only see what we want
You're bound to learn somehow
Love has a dark side
Some things we learn come easy
Then there's the things that don't
We love to learn the hard way
Love has no pride
We all know love is blind
We only see what we want
You're bound to learn somehow
Love has a dark side
Sometimes we see it coming
Sometimes we don't
While there's time to walk away
We just let it ride
We finally reach the point of no turning back
You're bound to walk the line
