Hey now
I've been waiting for you all my life
Only to hear you tell me that you couldn't be mine
How we both lose and we pay the price
You make it sound to me that, that you're crucified
Now my fleeting joy grows so dim
As you turn away and run to him
Makes me wonder what you mean when you say you'd stay
If you only could
That you must break my heart for my own good
Makes me wonder how you'd treat me, baby
If you wanted to hurt me, no, baby
If you really wanted to hurt me, yeah
No matter how I try, I may never find
A single ray of hope in all your lies
So I live in fear, my share of doubt
You're just another heartache and there's no way out
And so this hope grows so dim
As you turn away and run to him
You might also likeSo once more, tell me how you're thinking
That you must be cruel to be kind
For all your good intentions with me in mind
Makes me wonder how you'd treat me, baby
If you wanted to hurt me, no, babe
If you really wanted to hurt me
No, babe
No, baby
If you really wanted to hurt me
Yeah, yeah
So you say you'd stay if you could
But you must break my heart for my own good
Makes me wonder how you'd treat me, baby
If you wanted to hurt me, no, babe
If you really wanted to hurt me, you're doing just fine
For all your good intentions with me in mind
Makes me wonder how you'd treat me, baby
If you really wanted to hurt me, yeah, baby
If you wanted to hurt me, I know you would
Yeah, yeah, your love, baby
No, no
If you really wanted to hurt me
No, no, no
Hey now, baby, don't you do it
Oh, darling

Baby, don't do it
(Don't do it, no)
(Don't do it) No, no
(Don't do it)
There ain't nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
(Don't do it, yeah)
(Don't do it) If I don't have you, baby
(Don't do it) By my side
No, baby
(Don't do it)
Makes me wonder how you'd treat me, baby
If you really wanted to hurt me
