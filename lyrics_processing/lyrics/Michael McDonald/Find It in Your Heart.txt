You may lose the luxury
To have your fun and play it smart
Take your pleasure and still be free
Oh, the loneliness at the end of every dream
Don't you know that there's more to this
Let go of all your reasons
And find something to believe
You gotta find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart now baby
Love's the truth that sets us free
You'll only find it in your heart
Now you found someone who cares
You got your life all figured out
But the truth is you're not really there
'Till you give in beyond a doubt
Let go of your fantasies
And start looking for something real
Your best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that love reveals
You better find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart now baby
Love's the key that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head
You might also likeLet go of your fantasies
And start looking for something real
Your best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that love reveals
You better find it in your heart
You gotta find it in your heart now baby
Love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
You may think it's a matter of choice
But there's only one answer, only one voice
You better find it in your heart
You gotta find it in your heart now baby
Love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it in your heart now
You better find it in your heart baby
Love's the truth that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, find it baby
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it in your heart
You better find it in your heart now baby
Your love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
