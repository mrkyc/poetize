Hey, baby

Down here on love's killin' floor
I doubt if we can take much more, baby
Here and now, we need to ask ourselves why
We've come this far only to find, baby

The price of happiness
We no longer pay
You gotta really love someone
Words alone are cheap
It's more of what you do
And less of what you say

Baby, I don't wanna live
In some prison of promises
Baby, look around at all this emptiness
There ain't no love to be found
No, no, no

With love like this
All broken and bruised
You just walked away
With nothin' to lose, baby
Here and now, we've got to ask ourselves why (Why?)
If love is through, then why even try, baby?
You might also like
The price of happiness
We no longer pay
You gotta really love someone
Words alone are cheap
It's more of what you do
And less of what you say

Baby, I don't wanna live
No, no, in some prison of promises (No, no)
Baby, look around
It's all but hopeless now
Baby look at you and me (Yeah, yeah)
This vision of loneliness (Hey)
Hey, any fool can see
Hey baby, the walls are tumblin' down
There ain't no love to be found

No, ain't no love (Ain't no love, baby)
Ain't no love to be found (No)
No, no (No, no), no, no
There ain't no love to be found (Yeah)

Take a look at you and me
This vision of loneliness
Baby, any fool can see
That between you and me (Oh, hey)
There ain't no love to be found
(Ooh yeah) No, no, no
Baby (Baby)
Ain't no love, ain't no love
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
Baby (Hey, hey), ain't no love
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
Girl (Mmm, baby)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
Ain't no love, ain't no love, baby
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, ain't no love)
