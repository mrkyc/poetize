Child, as I look in your eyes
You know my life seems like a minute
There I find living proof
Of all the wonder life holds in it
In the past I thought I had to learn
Any good that comes from this life we're living
Here and now, let us realize
That this life's gift and it's already been given

Someday when you stand in the middle
Like it or not, you're gonna look both ways
You're gonna find that time is a riddle
Where days turn into years
And years into the blink of an eye
Oh no, no, no

Child, once I saw a man on the TV
Lead a nation up a mountain
He said, "Children, look over yonder" (Look, children)
The flame of truth is burning brightly
Sometimes you look so far, there's only so much time
Only so many of us are gonna get there
Here and now is all we really have
But if we can make it count
We got no reason to worry
You might also like
Someday, baby, when you stand in the middle
Like it or not, oh, you're gonna look both ways
You're gonna find that time is a riddle
Where days turn into years
And years into the blink of an eye
You're gonna walk that mile
You're gonna be in that number
You're gonna make that journey
Just like the Good Book says
There's a time to be born, and a time to cross over
And like it or not, it's a blink of an eye


Someday you're gonna stand in the middle
Like it or not, you're gonna look both ways
You're gonna find that time is a riddle
Where days turn into years
And years into the blink of an eye
You're gonna walk that mile
You're gonna be in that number
You're gonna make that journey
Just like the Good Book says
There's a time to be born, and a time to cross over
Like it or not, it's a blink of an eye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh no no, oh no, oh no
