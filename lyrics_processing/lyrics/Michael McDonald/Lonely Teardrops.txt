My heart is crying, crying

Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
Say you will (Say you will), say you will (Well, right now, baby)
Say you will, my heart is crying, crying
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
Say you will (Say you will), say you will (Well, right now, baby)
Say you will

Just give me second chance for our romance
Come on and tell me that someday you'll return
'Cause every day that you're gone away
You know my heart does nothing but burn, crying

Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
Say you will (Say you will), say you will (Well, right now, baby)
Say you will

Just say you will, say you will
Say you will (Say you will), say you will (Well, right now, baby)
Say you will (Baby, yeah), say you will (Say you will)
Say you will (Say you will), say you will (Oh, say it right now, baby)
Say you will (Yeah, just), say you will (Say you will, baby)
Say you will (Ooh-ooh), say you will (Say you will, baby)
Say you will, say you will
