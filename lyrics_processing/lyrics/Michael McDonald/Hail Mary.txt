At the heart of a memory
The power of one
Moment in time
When I had your love
It felt like winning
But I've paid the price with my peace of mind
Don't you find it strange
I still wonder why
After all this time
Not a day goes by
That my heart doesn't wonder if it's still worth a try
Worth one more Hail Mary
But you don't really know about such things, now do you
Does the sound of my voice still carry
Any kind of message still important to you
Or should I just let it die baby
Should I just let it die baby
Why can't I just let it lie baby
I think of a time
When it came easy
Lost in exchange
For the wisdom of tears
Saddest of fools clutching to vapor
Reaching for something
That's no longer here
You might also likeDon't you think it strange
I still wonder why
After all this time
Not a day goes by
That my heart doesn't wonder if it's still worth a try
One more Hail Mary
But you don't really know about such things, now do you
Does the sound of my voice still carry
Any kind of memory that's still precious to you
Oh, baby one more Hail Mary
Maybe you don't care about such things, now do you
Does the sound of my voice still carry
Any kind of message still important to you
Or should I just let it die baby
Should I just let it die baby
Why can't I just let it lie baby
Don't you find it strange now
I still wonder why
After all this time
Not a day goes by
That my heart doesn't wonder if it's still worth a try
One more Hail Mary
But you don't really know about such things, now do you
Does the sound of my voice still carry
Any kind of message still important to you
Oh baby, just one more Hail Mary
Maybe you know about such things, now do you
Does the sound of my voice still carry
Any kind of memory that's still precious to you
Still precious to you baby
Hail Mary, no no
Would they precious to you baby
Oh no, baby, just one more, one more
Baby, just one more Hail Mary
One more
