And I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me, I do
I've been too long away from my baby
I'm coming down, I'm coming down with misery

Well, I don't need no doctor, or prescriptions to be filled
(I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, Lord, or prescriptions to be filled
(I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor)
Oh, only my baby's arms could take away these chills
Oh, these chills

Well, the doctor says I need rest
All I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
There can't be a medicated lotion
That can soothe, no no, my emotion
