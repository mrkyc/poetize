Living in the Northwest, put myself to the test
Got me a job in a lumber mill
Reeling on the green chain, feeling all the back pain
Log don't get you then the boss will
Five o'clock, twenty bucks in my sock
And the boys all heading for the drinking gourd
But first I do what's right, I pick up my wife
She's home gettin' ironin' bored

'Cause a good, good woman likes to drink with the boys
And playing snooker and snuggling me is some of her joys
And if you're throwing darts, she can take you apart
She can pin you at a game of pinball
Shuffleboard is her favorite sport
But loving is her best of all
'Cause a good, good woman likes to drink with the boys

Put on your dancing spats, put out the cat
And don't wear those shoes that make you too tall
Powder your nose, don't worry about your clothes
'Cause later tonight you won't need 'em at all
And when the jukebox is juking and the smoke is a-smoking
And the cowpoke is poking along
I never feel alone, I never leave her alone
I always bring the little woman along
You might also like
'Cause a good, good woman likes to drink with the boys
And playing snooker and snuggling me is some of her joys
If you're throwing darts, she can take you apart
She can pin you at a game of pinball
Shuffleboard is her favorite sport
But loving is her best of all
'Cause a good, good woman likes to drink with the boys

I said a good, good woman like to drink with the boys
All of them good, good women like to drink with the boys
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, all the quality women)
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(All the good, good women, all the very best women)
All of them good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, very best women)
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, all the quality women)
All of them good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, all the very best women)
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, the very best women)
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, the very best women)
All the good, good women like to drink with the boys
(Good, good women, all the quality women)
