No time left to fuck around, my resume is due
My name is written in the sand alongside the likes of you
I got no time to hug the ground, discuss what might be true
At least you smoke my favorite brand, most good people do
When the bullet left the gun
Ain't no time left to duck
Do not ask what must be done
Get in and drive the truck
Can't be heard above the band, let's head outside and talk
I'll take you by the hand to the place they call Hanging Rock
It used to be the hanging tree till someone chopped it down
They built themselves a rockery on consecrated ground
When the bullet left the gun
Ain't no time left to duck
Do not ask what must be done
Get in and drive the truck
Adam and Eve they blacked my eye, climbed up the backyard fence
One of them was born to die, the rest claimed self-defence
No time left to learn the ropes or mop no runny noses
Share a feast of shattered hopes, no time to smell the roses
Put your foot down on the gas and catch those funny cars
Take a left-turn at my ass and head home to the stars

No time left to fuck around, my resume is due
My name is written in the sand alongside the likes of you

At least you smoke my favorite brand, most good people do
