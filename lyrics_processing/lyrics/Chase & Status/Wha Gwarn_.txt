Couple man chasing papers, couple man chasing status
Couple man chasing dreams, at 19 I was chasing payments
14, I was chasing pagans, 10p fed 'em on the Space Invaders
Chinese food in the grey containers, weed in the blunt, tryna taste them flavours
What's my name, rudeboy? I'm Taylor, my trousers are tailored
When they see me, they're bugging out like I'm famous
Might have to put a new sound on the playlist
You already know I'm out the south and it's dangerous
You already know I've been about here for ages
All of that talk coming out of your anus
Probably why I got you looking down at your trainers

Why you watching my face like that?
Standing up, looking all bait like that?
If I approach you and I ask what's good
Then you better tell me that it ain't like that
Cause me and my Gs don't play like that
Me and my Gs don't play like that
Man wanna act like a G in the rave
You can get put in your place like that

I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs

Couple man chasing skirt
Why you chasing her?
She be on my line tryna make it work
I don't reply, that's what makes it worse
Wanna talk bad about me and my Gs
But when you get punched in the face, it hurts
When you get cut with a blade, it hurts
Flowerpot, man a get laid in dirt
Before I put 'em on, I'm getting tailored first
Rock 'em with the hoodie, no blazer and shirt
Fight man, you'll get the Mayweather work
Wipe his shit off the face of the Earth
Still see me on the bus and chain
But I could drop 15k on a Merc
Man said he was the best in the game
Me and my Gs said it ain't confirmed

Why you watching my face like that?
Standing up, looking all bait like that?
If I approach you and I ask what's good
Then you better tell me that it ain't like that
Cause me and my Gs don't play like that
Me and my Gs don't play like that
Man wanna act like a G in the rave
You can get put in your place like that
I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs

Come round the corner, rudeboy
Why you looking at me like that, blud?
You think you're sick, blud?
You lot come round the corner then
What's good? Wha gwarn? Wha gwarn?

What's good, my G? What you looking at?
Tell your boy that this is the kind of beef that he shouldn't back
See my G to the right of me?
Might pull something out of his sleeve and won't put it back
Don't care if he ends up in a police van
Ain't scared of police, ain't scared of the boogeyman
Man wanna act like a G in the rave
Pull your hood over your head and hoodie man
Your team got more pricks than a cactus
Been running through more clips than an actress
I was out tryna put food on the strip
Now I'm out here tryna put my strip on the atlas
Mad ting, I broke my bed last week
But I'll probably press your chick on my mattress
Man wanna act like a G in the rave but
Dem man didn't look fit for the madness
Why you watching my face like that?
Standing up, looking all bait like that?
If I approach you and I ask what's good
Then you better tell me that it ain't like that
Cause me and my Gs don't play like that
Me and my Gs don't play like that
Man wanna act like a G in the rave
You can get put in your place like that

I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
I'll approach man like what's good? Wha gwarn?
What's good? Wha gwarn? Yo
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs
Tell me why you're looking at me and my dargs

You get me, though?
Walk in the rave heavy, blud
Don't look inna my face
