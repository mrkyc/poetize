I was raised in a city with no heart
Where there's no half-
Stepping when it comes to be getting that dough fast
I'm a hustler I'm a, I'm a hustler
Raised on the battle field, born as a sufferer
Before I had a deal I was still stacking bills
Get punked sell food to the customers
Now I get love cruise in the back o' the S class
Dem can't move like dat y'na
(I was raised)
I come from where man were done for hardly nothing
You can see it in the news,I'm hardly fronting
Got kids with guns in the heart of London
Bullet proof vests like half a hundred
There's no actors and actresses, gully 'round here
Niggas stashing them straps in mattresses
Soon as you exit Stanstead you might see...

Now all the guys are always getting in trouble
(Always getting in trouble)
That's how it's always been
(That's how it's always been)
But when the odds are all against you
How can you win, yeah?
(How can you win? How can you win?)
How can you win, yeah? Yeah, yeah
(How can you win? How can you win?)

I was raised in a city when they was out blazing the Philly
I was on the 5 bus chasing the titties
At the back of the class undoing bras with a stiffy
Tenisha, Tessa, Lesly and Richie
It's a cold, cold world
Gangstas living in a po-po world
So I'm in Koko with a go-go girl
Escaping reality that I know so well
But when you a kid you don't know better
Boys find trouble tryna find that cheddar
Money breeds envy, might get set-up
When pockets get empty, niggas get jealous
Killa done told them, ""
Landed in water, stretching that ketchup from the south of the border
North, west to east, there's nothing round here
Got to see it to believe it

Now all the guys are always getting in trouble
(Always getting in trouble)
That's how it's always been
(That's how it's always been)
But when the odds are all against you
How can you win, yeah?
(How can you win? How can you win?)
How can you win, yeah? Yeah, yeah
(How can you win? How can you win?)
Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner
That I love London town
But London's foul, London's a merry go round
A cycle of life full of ups and downs
'Cause up till now we ain't never won
With the odds against us a million to one
See the Winter's messy but they get silly in the sun
Don't fight just draw the nine milli and it's done...

How can you win, yeah?
How can I win? How can I win?
How can you win, yeah?
How can I win? How can I win?
