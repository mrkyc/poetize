I'm tired of looking in the mirror and saying, "I told you so"
I'm sick of tears on my pillow, this shit is getting old
I draw a line today, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm sick and tired of all the broken promises
I'm sick of thinking that it's love but it turns out the opposite

I draw a line today, no more, no more, no more, no more

I made a vow today that I'm gonna love me
I'm gonna fly so high that nothing can touch me
And the best part is, I'm not sorry anymore
I made a vow today that I'm gonna trust me
I'm gonna take my time, nobody can rush me
And the best part is, I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry anymore
I'm gonna love me and then I'mma love me some more

Been on my knees, yeah, now I am over that
I'm on my way up now, there is no looking back
I draw a line right here, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm sick and tired of all the broken promises
I'm sick of thinking it's love but it turns out the opposite
