Yeah
Let them know
It's NOV in the house
We're not ramping, I'm a man, not a mouse
Ahh yeah

I don't care
I'm a G to the core, let me make that clear
I'm not scared, I've been on the roads
I know the roads, I know that you're not there, ends, I'm from there
Chat about man dem, I got bare
I'm that yout with a hi-top
In Brockley, I'm a don there
Don't say shit about my ends if you ain't gone there
Got a style that can't be written
And I've got a new flow that can't be bitten
I'm a bad guy, not a good guy, I'm a villain
You'll get murked on a riddim
I'm a top boy, what, boy? Blud, you are not, boy
Play around with me, you'll get boxed
Right in your gob, boy
I'm not having a bar, don't make me get dark

I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
NOV with the bigger man sound
Down, I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
It's NOV with the bigger man sound
You might also like
I'm that guy that ain't got a point to prove
I keep a peaceful state of mind
I'm thugged out, I'm the one that
If you're bookey then you don't wanna come round
Or act dumb round
I'm not playing around this time
Cause I ain't got time or patience
And I kept it real to the core from day one
And I beg you don't try that
I will blind man, box man clean on an old school one
I've got bare man dem and you won't school one
Any beef that you had was a vocal one
Know your skin, B
Salute man or don't say jack, I've got my own back
Uncle told me to watch my own back
And if it kicks off, don't hold back, blud

I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
NOV with the bigger man sound
Down, I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
It's NOV with the bigger man sound
I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
NOV with the bigger man sound
Down, I'm gonna break them down
Break them down, gonna break them down
Down, I'm gonna break them down
It's NOV with the bigger man sound

You can't try with me, you'll get heat up
Beat up, fist to fist, you'll get chief up
Give you the regulation, I'm G'd up
And I want a flat in the ends right now
And I wanna chill with my feet up
I still get low when I can't seat up
But I still keep up, and I won't change cause
Sometimes me and my old mates meet up
In the ends, I feel like I'm stuck there
Unfair, Brockley road, I grew up there
Don't wanna be in the yard with my mum there
Cause I wanna better myself
To better myself, I gotta go somewhere
With a lot of girls and 'nough sun there
But until that time, I'm stuck here
Oh well, can't do much, I'm a young breh
Yeah
Chase & Status with the energy and flavour right now, controlling the sector
Hold tight the mmm yeah fam
