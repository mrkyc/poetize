What if I could call you? What would you want?
What if I could be somebody you'd like?
Maybe there's a way I can get you to come
Maybe you'd say that you're better off mine
Imagine all the things you could do with someone
Imagine me and you getting better with time
Think of all the ways you could get me undone
Think of what to say once you're kissing my thigh

This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
Until I came to love you
Since the moment I left
I can't get you out my head
Was kind of hoping you'd said
You stay here with me instead
This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
Until I came to love you

More than just someone that you got sick of before
More than just a lover if I ever get time
Think I know you well but I wanna know more
Think that you could tell I wanted you by my side
Let me in your room for the second someday
Let me in your fumes, we'll be better offline
You'll never be alone when you put it both ways
You're never on your phone, baby, that's what I like
You might also like
This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
Until I came to love you
This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
Until I came to love you

I know I want you
I know I need you now (now, now)
I know I want you
I know I need you now (now, now)

This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
Until I came to love you
Since the moment I left
I can't get you out my head
Was kind of hoping you'd said
You stay here with me instead
This is the moment
This is the moment
All the songs were sad, all the songs were sad
