You've been out all night
You've been out all night
There's so much I could say to you
You've been out of town
You've been out of town
With someone else, I know the truth

'Cause my heart's an open door
And you knew me
I should've locked you up before
I couldn't do it

I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me (crawling back to me)
I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me

Screaming down the halls
Screaming down the halls
Hoping you will leave somehow
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
I just wanna burn them down
You might also like
'Cause my heart's an open book
And you wrote it
I read into it too much
And I know it

I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me (crawling back to me)
I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me

'Cause I wait in the night in the dark for you
To come home but you never do, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me

I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me
(Crawling back to me, crawling back to me)
(Crawling back to me, crawling back to me)
Ooh
(Crawling back to me, crawling back to me)
(Crawling back to me, crawling back to me)
I give it all away, give it all away too easily, ooh
Wishing you were here, wishing you were crawling back to me
'Cause I wait in the night in the dark for you
To come home but you never do, ooh
