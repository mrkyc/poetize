Watch this

They're not talking no more
They just don't see eye to eye
Since the break-up it's all been shaky
But we all tryna get by
And now that I'm partially famous
People think I'm a different guy, but I'm not
It's just that they get about in the daytime, I get about at night
Long-lost siblings that I don't chat to
Old friends I never get back to
The exposure's coming in way too fast
And I can't stand still like a statue
I gotta keep moving
Still tryna figure out if I'm built for this
Thing is, I know man would kill for this
I know girls that would come off the pill for this
I can't stop, it's like I'm on a pilgrimage
Five years in, flying like I'm on a Buzz Lightyear ting
To infinity and beyond
I'm a sinner that don't belong (that don't belong)
You might also like
I'm a sinner that don't belong, I'm a sinner that don't belong
(That dont belong)
I'm a sinner that don't belong, I'm a sinner that don't belong

Somebody sent a hitman out, but I'm on to them
And they stay tryna break my confidence
They must think I'm build of compliments
But on a scale of one to ten, I'm at nine point nine
I'm at nine point nine
And they don't wanna see me when I reach ten

D-d-d-d-d-don't stop, d-d-d-don't stop
D-d-d-d-d-don't stop, d-d-d-don't stop

A part of me wants 'em to fix it
But the other half of me knows
That way too much war went under too many bridges
Deep down I just wanna see them risk it
Deep down I just want back simplistic
This is all complex, gotta sound twisted
But I'm not twisted, I'm just a misfit
Turns out that the misfit was gifted
I think it unrealistic
People are poor, yet materialistic
I'm not even sure that I would admit that
I tell the truth sometimes to be different
I blow money for the hell of it
But the way that I feel is irrelevant
'Cause I'm smiling when I'm in a shop
But when I leave straight back to feelin' delicate
Straight back to feelin' negative
I don't wanna end up like the relatives
So I took couple of doors off to make sure
That I don't go back to claiming benefits
I'm a sinner that don't belong, I'm a sinner that don't belong
(That don't belong)
I'm a sinner that don't belong, I'm a sinner that don't belong

Somebody sent a hitman out, but I'm on to them
And they stay tryna break my confidence
They must think I'm build of compliments
But on a scale of one to ten, I'm at nine point nine
I'm at nine point nine
And they don't wanna see me when I reach ten

D-d-d-d-d-don't stop, d-d-d-don't stop
D-d-d-d-d-don't stop, d-d-d-don't stop

Somebody sent a hitman out, but I'm on to them
And they stay tryna break my confidence
They must think I'm build of compliments
But on a scale of one to ten, I'm a nine point nine
I'm at nine point nine
And they don't wanna see me when I reach ten
Somebody sent a hitman out, but I'm on to them
And they stay tryna break my confidence
They must think I'm build of compliments
But on a scale of one to ten, I'm a nine point nine
I'm at nine point nine
