It's getting harder, harder to get across the border, ain't no jive
Trying harder, harder to get across the border, to hit the I-95

I'll walk, I'll talk, but I not crawl on my belly like a reptile (Jah know)
I'll walk, I'll talk, but I not crawl on my belly like a reptile

Going to Miami via Vancouver coming from Jamaica
I was on di outside, for some reason, they won't let me enter
I went to the border, they say my passport was not in order
Seven of us got back on the bus, felt like a loser
We rent some rooms, we got some food, am I a dreamer
I went to some club, they were playing reggae-rock and blues-a
I know I'm a winner, but this time they say I'm a loser
But, I said, "Hey"; But, I said, "Hey"

It's getting harder, harder to get across the border, ain't no jive
Trying harder, harder to get across the border, to hit the I-95

I'll walk, I'll talk, but I not crawl on my belly like a reptile (Jah know)

Out of all the people me they decided to pull over

Cock-a-doodle-doo, doodle-doo, I am no rooster
Stop spinning me around like I'm some roller coaster
You make it seems, I'm the most wanted
Take me out of this room, it's so scary and haunted

I'm a singer, I'm an actor, born entertainer

Sending me way back to Jamaica

I was on my way to California coming from Tijuana
I was there with a Mexican who was a Pancho Villa
He said to me, "Do you want burrito, taco or salsa?"
I said, I've got to go, I've got to go to California

Seven of us got back on the bus, felt like a loser
We got some food and we got some rooms in Vancouver
We went to some club they were playing reggae-rock and blues-a
I'm kind-a confused-a
I guess I was winner but this time they say I'm the loser
Kind-a confused-a, what I said
