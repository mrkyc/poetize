Some are smugglin in boats, some are smugglin in car
Ganja gon' so far, smoke by President and by superstar
Ganja man, them off so far, ganja bring peace and never bring war
Ganja gon' so far, them are also, them are smuggle, them are hustled
Them are smuggled, them are also, them are hustled
Wanted, we want by medical need, proposition by two fifteen
Them are wanted, are friendly, don't smoke the weed
It should kill the breed

Wanted by the federal agent, urgent, business
Wanted by the federal agent, urgent, business
Wanted by the federal agent, urgent, business
Them are wanted, by the federal agent, urgent, business
Wanted by the federal agent, Cocoa B's, Eeka-Mouse
Wanted by the federal agent, Cocoa B's, Eeka-Mouse
Wanted by the federal, Cocoa B's and Eeka-Mouse, the General
Some men come troublin about smugglin
Kickin my door to the floor, bum rushin in
But them not find nuthin, police them are huntin
But them not find nuthin
Federal agent huntin, but them not find nuthin
Sheriff come huntin, but them not find nuthin, nuthin, nuthin
S-T Double E L-E, find me out in Brooklyn
Reason wit the Rasta, over our tower cookin
Pure iterations, the east frustration, man my station
Prepare for war wit the nation, we bringin the music
We bringin the sound, we bringin the Cocoa, we bringin the Mouse

Me not smuggle, and not juggle and I come from yard
When I see ganja go abroad, and no don't know, so what?
Oh why tease me, I did cause scarred
Some flowery that toured Cuba, done two tear why not
Well me ephy cry still by that, man not smuggle marijuana
Me not smuggle, and not juggle and I come from yard
Had done my yard so hard
Me not smuggle, and not juggle and I come from yard
Man runnin from the coast guard, ten thousand pull off the gan jay
Runnin from the D.E.A., no yes me runnin the yard
Them out come lookin for me for my bribe
And them come out one early night, I meet them
One fifth with extra dice
Smuggle and it come from yard, man runnin from the coast guard
Smuggle, and not juggle and the ganja come abroad
He come out see my coffin yard

It ain't right if I don't smell a scent of ganja
Marijuana, I wanna roll up in the corner
It ain't right if I don't smell a sweet scent sit
Cuz a friend of mine, is a friend that got plenty
Buddha fonto, you didn't know I smoke only fonto
Tilt it back, don't leave no chemical in my smoke
Even I smoke everything, watch your self
Even I eat anything bad for my health
My wealth is my family, jah bless we, big up to Nitty
Wit more cocoa than Nestle, test we
Me and my P.N.C. smokey, we blow more trees than you see on Timb boots
We still troop, still get loot, Tek-N-Steele, stick to them roots
Gun smokin cuz it still shoot
