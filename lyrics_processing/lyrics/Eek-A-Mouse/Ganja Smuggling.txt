Bidi bidi bong bong, bidi bong bong

Bong bong, bidi bong bong, bidi bong bong, bidi men

Early, early Sunday morning
It was a big ganja smuggling (Ehya!)
In a di mud mi a pick cali bud
An' mi a load dem down in a the tub (Ehya!)
One by one, load up the van
All of the ganja, it ram
Put it on a plane, the weed gone a Spain
Money jus' a pour like rain
Mi jus' a model up the lane in a rope-gold chain (Ehya!)
Mi an' mi girl name Jane

Bong gong, gidi bong gong, gidi memdem dem dem
Bena bena mohoi, bena mendem, gena iohoi
Dong dong, didi dong dong, gidi mendem, gidi mendem
Geda mendem, gena mendem, gena men-den

Down there in the ghetto I grow
Where sufferation I once know (Ehya!)
Mummy an' daddy, all of we so poor
We all had to sleep on the floor (Ehya!)
Storm it come, and it blow down mi door
Mi have fi nail up mi window
Mi shoes tear up, mi toe jus' a show
Mi nuh know a where fi really wan' go
Mummy jus' a bawl, "Poor, poor, poor"
Mi cry, she say "Son, cry no more"
