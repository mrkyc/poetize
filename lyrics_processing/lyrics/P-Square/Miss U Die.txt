I dey miss you die
I dey beg you
Make you try to understand
There's no one like you
And I wonder why
Why it is anytime I dey with another person
I dey think about you
Now I realize
I dey think about you every day
I truly no get anything to say
I really think I'm going insane

I never know that you are so beautiful
And incredible
When I close my eyes
I see your picture so unbelievable
So irreplaceable

How could I let you go
Let you walk out the door
Girl I'm all alone
When are you coming home
I wanna know
Don't wanna let you go
Make someone please bring you back to me

Baby all the pains I bring
Forgive me girl

I was made to love you
And I wish I could bring you back
Now, I'm on my own
I'm standing all alone
Standing at that door
Hoping you come back
If na this love be wetin I need
Then na which kind mistake be this
How could I let you go
