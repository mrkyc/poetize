Tell me, tell me
Am I still that special man
Tell me where I stand

Don't know why your love is so much
Girl you be the type wey them dey carry go church
With only one touch
Everything go start dey blend between us
Girl I miss you so much (so much)
E be say make we no rush
Now you don dodge
Why is this happening to me

Na you got me screaming
Oh no no no
Why e be say this loving no dey show
'Cause the way wey you and I dey go
This love no go go

When I see you with another man
Walking hand in hand
It makes me feel so sad
Oh no, if na so
Tell me where I stand
Am I still that special man
Wey you love so much
'Cause the more I see
The less I understand
Tell me (tell me)
Am I still that special man
You're killing me small small
You might also like
Tell me why you just dey push me to the wall
Making me to fall
Killing me small small
Baby come back to me
'Cause everything don spoil (e don spoil)
I wanna be around you
'Cause I cannot do without you
Let me be the one
To make you smile every day and night
'Cause you know say

Na you got me screaming
Oh no no no
Why e be say this loving no dey show
'Cause the way wey you and I dey go
This love no go go

When I see you with another man
Walking hand in hand
It makes me feel so sad
Oh no, if na so
Tell me where I stand
Am I still that special man
Wey you love so much
'Cause the more I see
The less I understand
Tell me (tell me)
Am I still that special man
You're killing me small small
I wanna be around you
'Cause I cannot do without you
And I let me be the one to hold you tight
Every day and night
'Cause you know say
I, baby I love you
And I'll never place no one above you
Let me be the one to make you smile
Every day and night
'Cause you know say

When I see you with another man
Walking hand in hand
It makes me feel so sad
Oh no, if na so
Tell me where I stand
Am I still that special man
Wey you love so much
'Cause the more I see
The less I understand
Am I still that special man
Still that special man
