Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
It's so paradise, turning up I do this every night
Red Kobe's go perfectly with gold the ice
Real nice, every girl in here is getting hype
My kind of night, in love with the stars, watch me fly
Now who's the best?
Passed all the tests, no need to guess
Aiming for the heads, forget the chest
They playing chess, like they wanna take out King
My phone ring, amazed by the polar bling
I gotta think about it, maybe dream about it
Maybe even call my girl and say i fiend about it
Real rap, what a lot of rappers lack
Real wack, most of these rappers on every single track, but its good
I'm here to save Hip Hop, i'm on my tip top, grand Nubian flip flops
My flows in tip top, I built a church upon this rock
And I invest in this rap shhhh, all of my bars are stock
Don't you play me
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night

Rest in peace to Heavy D, she say I got that heavy d
Lol baby girl don't cop a plea, see i'm a freaking dog, need to wash off all these fleas
Hey princess, I know you see me but please, just let the player be
Purple with yellow and white gold, yes I feel free
I'm a lion off the leash, a lion off the leash
Beat, knocking at your door like 5-0
And my shoes cost 5-0, I'm still be a beast at 5-0
It's a shame that you lames will never know
In the night time she sings like Gladys
She ain't messing with these losers cause they ain't on her status
And that's King
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Young King
They got me up here at four a.m. doing this song but
That's the hustle, we gotta stay grinding, On God
(King)
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
Hoes All In, Hoes All Night
