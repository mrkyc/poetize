Too fucked up, might do a solo
I became with my nigga but I'm like YOLO
I don't really give a f how many I got
None given close your eyes and hear the drop
Haters talking saying that we ain't got it popping
Google me nigga, you may know a shit
You may get to know my name you may know my face
But you really never know my history go away
Mattie Maat been popping since 2011
I was 2-12 and started 6-7
Never had a playstation never played no games
Always took my shit too serious niggas going lame

I was thinking of the hook or maybe a bridge
But I got my rap shit you niggas going drip
If I really take my shit where the bars
If you wanna collab where the stack's at
If y'all nigga got them bitches where it at thought
You really sold your soul? The money at bro
If a really kill a show get funeral nigga
Drinking coffee in the night looking ass nigga

He messed around and got the young dude put up on the hit list
We go 0 then we go and hunt the dude real quick
Feel like this beat was made for some king shit
They like King tha Rapper when I step in to the building (Oh Lord)
Me and homie in the bank dawg
Couple white girls trynna take a swim y'all
50 thousand for the great grey looking like a wolf dog
At 12 I had 3 rings, Tom Brady y'all
Who you know with this kinda flow?
Red and green diamonds they thought that I was robin, yo
Was in K.C. and some girls thought that I was JoJo
Just got her nose done, if she say she didn't the she Pinocchio
Just scored a touchdown like I was Calvin Johnson
Just had a green had a girls on my private island
Italian girl call her thousand island
I'm so fly I got my own plane and a pilot
I'm too young to be like this, yo
She grabbed up on me, I'm to young to feel like this, yo
Brown hoodie flow Michael Brown, yo
And to the cops them dudes know they did him wrong, yo
