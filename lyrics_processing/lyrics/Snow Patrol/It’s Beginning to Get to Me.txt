I wanted somethin' that's purer than the water
Like we were
It's not there now, ineloquence and anger
Are all we have
Like Saturn's rings, an icy loop around me
Too hard to hold
Lash out first at all the things we don't like
Or understand

And it's beginnin' to get to me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touchin' in our cold bed
Are you beginnin' to get my point?
That all this fighting with aching joints
Is doin' nothin' but tire us out
And no one knows what this fight's about

The answer phone, the lonely sound of your voice
Frozen in time
I only need the compass that you gave me
To guide me on

And it's beginnin' to get to me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touchin' in our cold bed
Are you beginnin' to get my point?
That all this fighting with aching joints
Is doin' nothin' but tire us out
And no one knows what this fight's about

It's so thrillin' but also wrong
Don't have to prove that you are so strong
'Cause I can carry you on my back
After our enemies attack
I tried to tell you before I left
But I was screamin' under my breath
You are the only thing that makes sense
Just ignore all this present tense

We need to feel breathless with love
And not collapsed under its weight
I'm gaspin' for the air to fill
My lungs with everything I've lost
We need to feel breathless with love
And not collapsed under its weight
I'm gaspin' for the air to fill
