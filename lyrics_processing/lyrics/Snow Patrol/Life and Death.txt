Everything is sudden
Everything is suddenly alive
All these situations
Panic into such sweet calm
I will turn the light on
I will turn the light on everywhere
And I watch you lift your head up
Higher than it was before

No, I don't know how it ends
For both of us
But why would you need to know the end, my dear?
So don't crash into everything
To make your point
Let's get, get out of the way of us

I woke the lion
You woke the tiger
Inside, inside
Don't want to be this far
Don't want to be so far from you

Now everything's forgiven
Everything's forgotten, just look at you
You're shining like a falling
Shining like a falling sword

To make your point
Let's get, get out of the way of us

I woke the lion
You woke the tiger
Inside, inside
Don't want to be this far
Don't want to be so far from you, from you
I woke the lion
You woke the tiger
Inside, inside
Don't want to be this far
Don't want to be so far from you, from you

I don't want to lay this far from you
I don't want to lay this far from you
I don't want to lay this far from you
I don't want to lay this far from you
I don't want to lay this far from you
I don't want to lay this far from you
Don't want to be this far
Don't want to be so far from you, from you
Don't want to be this far
