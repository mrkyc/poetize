You wanted it too late
You wanted it too late now
I can't keep track of all your tears
Been crying rivers way too long
And, oooh, I'm tired of loneliness
But I'm way more tired of wasted time
So still, you barely look alive
These shocks will do you so much good

Just keep your wits about you, don't let it end you
And summon everything you've held up in reserve
Don't fall for every single stolen glance and wink
Try to keep your heart on higher shelves for once

What are you holding back?
I know you've wild horses, enough inside of you
(Stop holding back)
Now's not the time to learn
Serenity, it's gone to red from blue
(Stop holding back)
I think you want this love
And I know you don't want time without it
(Stop holding back)
I know I don't know much
But I do know when to rage
(Stop holding back)

Ooh, you wanted it to work
You wanted it to work so much
But it's been broken in your hands
The minute that it found your hands
Ooh, you're trying not to blink
For once you wanna see what is
Ooh, it hasn't finished you
It's only that it feels that way

Just keep your wits about you, don't let it end you
And summon everything you've held up in reserve
Don't fall for every single stolen glance and wink
Try to keep your heart on higher shelves for once

I know you've wild horses, enough inside of you
