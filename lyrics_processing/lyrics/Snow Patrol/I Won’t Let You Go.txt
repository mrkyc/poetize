No one can ever follow, no one can ever know
Wind up the spinning top and watch it go, watch it go
Never gonna be easy, was it?
You didn't think it'd be so much fun?
The smile comes, despite the danger
Get some, get some

There's something happening here
There's something here that I just can't explain
I know I'm where I belong
Deep down inside I've known all along

I won't let you go (This is what you really want)
So don't leave go of me (This is what you asked for)
I wanted something more (This is what you really want)
I wanted this right here (This is what you asked for)

No one can ever follow, no one can ever know
Wind up the spinning top and watch it go, watch it go
Never gonna be easy, was it?
You didn't think it'd be so much fun?
The smile comes, despite the danger
Get some, get some

We laughed until it hurt (This is what you really want)
And it hurt until we wept (This is what you asked for)
The dead upon our feet (This is what you really want)
But there's joy somehow in me (This is what you asked for)

You're not as strong as I am
You're not as strong as I am
Aah (This is what you really want)
