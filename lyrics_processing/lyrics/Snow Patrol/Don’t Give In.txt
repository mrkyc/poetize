Don't give in, don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know

It's in your blood and it's
It's in your making
So don't hold your tongue
'Cause it's, it's no longer working
Don't fall on your sword
Just follow your instinct
Like an old lesson learned
Like an old lesson learned

Only you know what it
What it is to see through
See through the eyes that are
Trained on me now
I can, I can only tell you how it
How it looks from here
I think you've made up your mind
I think you've made up your mind

I know, I know
Don't give in, don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever

Yes, there's a lot we can
We can learn from this loss
Learn not to let it fall down
Around our ears
Don't fall in love with the
With the way things were
It'll fuck up your mind
It'll fuck up your mind
But this is all
On the wings of others
And I loved you more
More in your own flight
So it ain't the same
It won't be lost forever
It won't be lost forever
Don't give in, don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know
Don't give in, don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know

This is your grace
And I don't know why, and I don't know why
This is your grace
And I don't know why, and I don't know why


Don't give in, don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
