It's hard to argue when
You won't stop makin' sense
But my tongue still misbehaves and it
Keeps diggin' my own grave

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hopin'
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
The best thing that I have?
Well, it makes it easier to know
Exactly what I want

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hopin'
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

My hands open
And my eyes open

That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
You gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
