I feel again a time for me to rewind like you were my life
I gave you so much, I feel like your mom
My fans are my family then I'll be fine
So I met a guy, his name was white
He loved me and I put him back for his sake
Cause he was so good at being so bad
He drove me crazy like being in a cab
He went outta town
Told me that I was the only girl that he want in his life
And I was naive and yes I believe
All the B.S that he was telling to me
Thought I would know but I was wrong
He didn't know what he had till I was gone
I hope she was worth it, he had me cursing
And when I see cupid I tell him in person
(haha) like this

Love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so stupid
Cupid, what's the matter with your aim?
Is my heart just a game to you?
Love is so stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take at my heart
Leave it breaking in two
Love is so stupid

I'm so afraid now to fall for him
This new one is a good guy, yeah
I already feel like we're best friends
Why am I not closing my eyes?
Am I still messed up from the aftermath
Of what the wrong one did to me?, wish I felt better
All the fear I have, I know he's so right for me
Love is so (damn)

Love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so stupid
Cupid, what's the matter with your aim?
Is my heart just a game to you?
Love is so stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take at my heart
Leave it breaking in two
Love is so stupid

The worst part about being alone
Another valentines, ain't nobody calling my phone
Well, I'd rather be with my family and friends
Then let my poor heart get shattered again
Love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so S.T.U.P.I.D
Oh love is so stupid
Cupid, what's the matter with your aim?
Is my heart just a game to you?
Love is so stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take at my heart
Leave it breaking in two
Love is so stupid
Love is so stupid
Love is so stupid
