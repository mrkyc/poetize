I know you're trynna get in this candy rubber
I can see it in your eyes

Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they tryna blow me kisses
Brown sugar can't resist this
Sweeter than candy
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they tryna buy me giftses
They do anything to get this
Sweeter than candy

Watching my Whatsapp they feeling my caramel
Got they heads spinning like they up on a carousel
They be licking they lips
They watching my hips
They see this juice box and they all wanna sip, they all wanna sip, they all wanna sip
They get a little taste and they don't wanna quit
Yeah, they can't losen they grip
I caught these boys messing but they want it too quickly

Make 'em wait for it (For it)
Make 'em wait for it (For it)
If you looking for a trip to escape, boy
Make them get down on they knees, make them pray for it (For it)
Make 'em wait for it (For it)
Make 'em wait for it (For it)
Everybody in the club go cray for it
Make 'em drop from the Bay to L.A. for it

They callin' her majesty, they hoping and wishing
They're tryna rub up on me like they're washing the dishes, washing the dishes, washing the dishes

They tryna get this cake but it's too hot in the kitchen
