You can win my my love
But there's a trick though
Come figure me out, I can't give you a tip though
There'll be no dreamy eyes, I don't fall for hypno
Here goes a hint, I'll keep it simple, I'm no sympth though
These boys be tripping, chasing back to kiss they lips though
They send me texts and send me pics, they think they slick though
Some send me flowers and some act just like some sickos
Want to win it? Wait a minute

If you act nice, you can get it
If you act right, you can get it
If you want my love, better win it
If you want my love, better win it
If you all lies, then forget it
If you uptight, then forget it
If you want my love, better win it
If you want my love, better win it
Wait a minute, wait minute

All these boys, I call them actors winning Oscars
They say they love us but they actually imposters
Don't want no player that's why I fired my roster
I told my mans of the future that he got to be, be
My Prince Charming, kind of gentle, kind of ghetto
Don't want no mans that be softer than that Jello
Don't want no puppet 'cause my name ain't Gepetto
Want to win it? Treat me special

You can take me on a date under the moon, moon
If we kiss, it's gon' be later, never soon, soon
You can get a Ukelele, play my tune, tune
Play a sad song
You think I'm easy, huh?
And now you mad, huh?
You think I'm teasing, huh?
But I ain't teasing you, no, I told you right from the start
If you roll with my love you better win my heart
