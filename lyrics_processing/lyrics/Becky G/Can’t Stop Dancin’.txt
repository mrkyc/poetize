(Hoo!) Just keep your body moving how I like
(Hoo!) Oh yeah, the music feels like paradise
(Hoo!) Can't get any better, no

(Hoo!) I wanna stay right in this moment for life
(Hoo!) Baby, treat me wrong, treat me right

Ayy, ayy, ayy, aye, just can't stop dancin'
Ayy, ayy, ayy, aye, don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ayy, ayy, ayy, aye, I just can't stop dancin'

Again now (Ayy), spin around now (Ayy)
Down now (Oh), to the floor now (Oh)

(Hoo!) Your mind is going places I can feel
(Hoo!) That further lets me know this is real (Prr!)
(Hoo!) And I won't stop, you know I like it there
(Hoo!) You can even go further, babe (Ay-ay-ay-ay)
