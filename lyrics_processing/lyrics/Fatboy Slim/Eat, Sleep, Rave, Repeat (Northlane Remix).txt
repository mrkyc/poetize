So there was this DJ who was, like, kickin' off
I don't know what he was doing, but it was sick, man
Like, he was, like, hands in the air
Like, penis out, like, fuckin'
So, like, this clown started covering us in silly string
And we were all like writhin' around on the floor
Or at least I thought we were
And then this cat walked in
You know, not like a 'cat', like a feline cat
Like a real, like, you know, like
You know what I'm sayin', dog?
Like cats and dogs, it was rainin'
It wasn't rainin', we were ravin'
I ate her, man, not like 'eight', like 'nine'
Like, 'ate' her, she was fine, man, like
You know, like, eatin', sleepin', rave, repeatin', you know
There were people dancing, I think
Or maybe they were cops?
I think they might have been cops
But anyway, like, I was just dancin' and dancin', and
Oh no, they were cops, shit
And this fuckin' cop just looked at me
And I don't know whether he was really saying it
All he kept saying was

Suddenly, I think I'm on the phone
Suddenly, I think I'm tellin' a story
But I'm not, I'm just dancin'
I was just dancin', I'm just sleepin'
I'm just ravin', I'm just repeatin'
And on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
Felt this thud, it was a bass line
Boom, fuckin' boom, man
Sorry, dude, I thought you were an object
Then I went into this diner
And the guy was like, "Fuckin', you wanna buy something?"
I'm like, "No, I'm just dancin' to the hum of your fridge"
He's like, "Then get the fuck out of my restaurant"
I'm like, "I like it here, I like the lighting
Besides, I like your waitress, she looks pretty hot"
So I got her by the arm and I drag her out onto the street
And I gave her to a homeless guy, he gave me all his crack
And all he kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

So, like, John called me the next morning
Like, "Dude, like, where were you last night?"
I was like, "I was there"
He was like, "Oh yeah"
And then, he was like
"Fuckin', you remember that tune they were playin'?"
I'm like, "I don't remember fuckin' anything, man
I mean, I have, like, vague recollections
And, like, a general feeling of happiness?"
And he was like, "No, that fuckin' song, man"

I came out of the club, and there was dark
And there was night, and there was street lamps
I was pretty, like, I dunno
So I went into this diner and I ordered some food
And suddenly, it was tomorrow, and then tomorrow was today
And then I found this club, and I went into the club
And the club was banging, and the music was, like, really loud
And I was ravin', and suddenly, I was saving
This girl from this dude, and suddenly, he was being rude
And all she kept saying was

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
And all she kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
All they kept sayin' was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
All I kept thinkin' was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

She said, "Yo, I'm an artist"
And then she just started to make this thing out of cocaine
And I swear to God, it said
