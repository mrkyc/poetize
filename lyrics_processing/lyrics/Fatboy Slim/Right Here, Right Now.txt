Hey, this is Brad out of, this is Brad out of, this is...
Now huh, who's your, who's your favorite artist, what do you wanna hear?
Well, huh, my favorite artist right now is Fatboy Slim, that guy kicks ass
How tremendous is Fatboy Slim?
The band of the nineties, if you wanna call it a band, because it's a one man name
Wow... Fatboy, and you wanna hear that new Fatboy song?
Absolutely!
Which one?
The huh... it's "funk soul brother, check it out!"
Sing it, I don't know which one!
