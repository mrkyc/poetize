Works like a magnet on the people all around
Know it when they hear the champion sound
Anybody loving music up in your town
Know it when they hear the champion sound
Love it when they hear the champion sound
Need it when they hear the champion, watch out!

Take you on a wild dream, flow through the bloodstream
Baby, it will make you fly
Work out the meaning, you got the feeling
Baby, we can get so high
Switchin' to the meltdown, fly like you're zoned out
Gonna make it overflow
Give out to get back, tell me, do you feel that?
Flip out and overload

And whoever try to disrespect a mighty good time
Or a mighty good rhyme with a sight for the mind
Fresher than pine, or lemon lime pledge
Listen and rewind it, rebel pirates stand its highest
Try this skit trampled by the stampeding feet of the fans
In the crowd screaming, "Yo, that's Lateef! Maroon!"
(Fatboy Slim on the tune)
Rally 'round it if you're strong, throw your arms to the moon, come on
