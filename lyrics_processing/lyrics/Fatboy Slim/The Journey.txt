That journey-a call me quick

That journey-a call me quick

An' have me wonderin' all my days

I can't stay home, I gotta keep movin
I gotta keep doin', I gotta get out
I gotta roam, it's somethin' that moves me
It's somethin' that uses me without a doubt
'Cause somewhere abstract coincidence happens
See someone in passin' while out and about
Next thing I know I'm happily travelin'
Puttin' in action ideas that I mouth
Cause I speak it and do it, talk it and walk it
I'm so bad about it, I shout it out loud
But try to stay open, the forces in motion
They keep me on course, it's just clear that I've vowed
Imprissoned in flesh and reality's blesses
That made manifest every woman and child
I'll keep on expressin' reality's lessons
Explorin' my prison until I'm let out

Travelin' East and West
On every known highway
South to North carryin'
That torch until I'm old and grey

Well in the mean time inbetween I'm pushin' through this
I said in the main time inbetween I'm on my duty

Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong
So the question's repeated: why even try?
When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either
Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door
So I go on my own, got faith in the road
I can share that control cause I'm never alone
I hear the creator speak to me through whispers
On winds the voices of friends and of foes
I listen to omens, the things that he shows me
Shows that he knows me and helps me along
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly
Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm gone
That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have its way
An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have its way
An' have me wonderin' all my days

And when they lay me down
To rest in my Earthly grave
And when they lay me down
Navigate that big sky wave

But in the meantime I, I got my duty
In the meantime, inbetween time I, I got to do this
In the meantime, inbetween time I, I'm pushin through this
In the meantime, inbetween time I, I got my duty

I got my...
I got my...
