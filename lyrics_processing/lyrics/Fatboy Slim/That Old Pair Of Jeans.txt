All you used to do was put me down
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground, and I
All you used to do was criticize me but
Now I found the good and I emphasize it, see
You would always get so sensitive
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness, but now
I'm certain of the way I live
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game
And it's such a shame that you
Try to make pain, another word for my name
Whether giving or receiving, it's one and the same
Just one more link in your long-ass chain
But it's time to break this frame and my strengthful will
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built
Gave my heart, but my self-respect you won't steal
Now it's time to let you go if you can't hear or feel me, so

So I asked my momma for her two cents
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend
Then I asked my poppa once and I asked him again
Came to the consensus from all them opinions
That life is too short to be unhappy
And since I know what I'm worth, there'll be no settling for dirt
Knowing what I deserve is gold
If I want diamonds, then I can't settle for coal
And maybe I was just too strong to let go
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say no
But whatever the case, I can't take it no more

Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up
Like a favorite pair of jeans that you won't give up on
And I hope maybe one of these arguments will make up
And start again like when we had started this up
Back when everything was fresh and every moment a blessing
I'd laugh at all of your jokes, you'd listen to my suggestions
One mind, one soul, one common destination
