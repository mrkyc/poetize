Everyone getting reading for the holiday
City's bright, Really nice
Happier than the other days
Had a lot on my list
A mistletoe kiss
Seeing the family
and getting some gifts
Five days before the day
Was the day for my brother
and I wanted him to have his way
But it'd be something he'd discover
Moms and I, with things to hide
He was in for a surprise
I started asking for advice
My "squad", my "niggas that had my back"
"The ones that were there when I was under attack"
sike
I wouldn't have ever did anything to ever change that
G
You were my first friend at New Gen
and I honestly felt like our friendship would never end
Started questionin' my brother about things he would like
"A quiet night, a nice time playing GTA 5"
Um okay, I guess that sounds fine
Had a weekend of planning
Tryna figure out how it would happen
Only 'cause I love this fool with a passion
None of my friends could make it but
She
Was the only person that promised that she'd helped me
He was my friend
He was friends with all of us
and he told me that he would of course show up
He was kinda the type to get a girl to blush
and sooner or later baby said she had a crush
Good for her, I honestly didn't care
But I started to a few weeks later 'cause she was hurt about them getting no where
I assumed, she was in the mix
of him playing tricks, on every stupid hoe
Flirting with some other chick, messing with one ugly bitch
and she was pissed
'Cause I told her ya'll kissed
She felt dissed
and you didn't even know
and bitches was sneak dissing
But the kept it on the low
Like whoa, I had a lot on my plate
Planning out shit, thinking, and realizing which bitches was fake
So many snakes
I had a friendly friendship with him
I considered him a friend
Old me, I made a lot of mistakes back then
I swear to God, I was the dumbest freshmen
This so called friend I had was full of smiles and laughter
I was fooled , she was a hella good actor
Actor? Yes, actor.
She was an actor not an actress
Sounds crazy, but its 'cause girls is what she attracted
Not just 'cause she wasn't attractive
Something happened, something really tragic
But its not my place to tell you what happened
But anyways, baby was always there
and led me to believe she really did care
Moms didn't want too many people at the house that night
and that was fine 'cause I didn't have much people to invite
Did the shopping, made the plans
A lot of talking, and calling friends
A few days before his day
She told me she got her way
Him and her
Were
Locking lips, hands on her hips, against the wall
and I sensed it all
I had a feeling they'd connect and their feelings would start to intersect
and it had a great affect
But, I spoke too soon
I was incorrect
Baby arrived early that day
I spent so much fuckin' money that day
He was so confused, that afternoon
We were inside my room, popping balloons
We blew a lot up and the popping got louder
So we got him out of the house fora few hours
and while he was out
We decorated the house
and had the food out
Then people started arriving
I was keeping up with the timing
The music was on and blasting
Everyone was joking and laughing
Then my stepdad called and said that he was almost there
and was just asking
If we were ready to surprise him
He sat in the car relaxing and they approached the door
I wonder if he seen the lights flashing
I heard the key move around the keyhole
Before the door opened I took a quick glimpse through the peephole
It was them, It was my brother looking clueless
I imagined his reaction, I wonder if he knew we'd do this
The door slowly opened and my nigga walked in
and we yelled "SURPRISE" and I can tell it shocked him
I thought then, " This nigga will never have a good sister,
addicted to twitter, yet with a heart as deep as a river."
"Wow" I heard him whisper. He was happy and he knew it
I went through the bullshit
To see him smile, I went through it
Now everyone's dancing and listening to music
"Got your girl in the cut and she choosin' "
My little bitch actor made her way through the door
and after acting stupid, she made her way to the floor
Then finally he showed up and baby began to blush
