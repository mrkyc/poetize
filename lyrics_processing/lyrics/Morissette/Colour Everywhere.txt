Used to seeing black and white
Never really in between
Waitin' for the love of my life
To come into my dreams
Everything is shades of gray
Never really blues or green

Needed someone else to turn to
Someone who could help me learn to see
All the beauty that was waitin' for me

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver linin' in my prayers
And now, there's colour everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now, there's colour everywhere
Everywhere

My life is so predictable
Never any mystery
But ever since you shined the light
All of that was history
Now, I have a hand to hold
And a reason to believe
You might also like
There's someone in my worth livin' for
I was hangin' around, just wishin' on a star
To put the happiness back in my heart and

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver linin' in my prayers
And now, there's colour everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now, there's colour everywhere

You care and now there's colour everywhere

Left those hazy days behind me
Never to return again
Now, they're just a fadin' memory
'Cause baby, it's all so clear to see
The beauty that is waitin' there for me

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver linin' in my prayers
And now, there's colour everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now, there's colour everywhere
A silver linin' in my prayers
And now, there's colour everywhere
You came along to show you care
