Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
You got a list in the back of your mind
Of the things you expect from me
I can shift, I can morph, I can fly
Be whatever I'm needed to be
But just because I can
Doesn't mean I should
Just because I am
Doesn't mean you have the right to
Parade me like a trophy
CHORUS
I don't exist for your happiness
And I don't expect for you to do the same
I'm not the cure to your loneliness
And I ain't 'bout to play your games
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
You might also likeShould've known you'd just waste all my time
And consume all my energy
The moment we didn't see eye to eye
You'd take the truth and you twist it on me
Just because I can
Doesn't mean I should
Just because I am
Doesn't mean you have the right to
Parade me like a trophy
CHORUS
I don't exist for your happiness
And I don't expect for you to do the same
I'm not the cure to your loneliness
And I ain't 'bout to play your games
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
You ain't got a hold on me
Can't you see
Your fantasy
It ain't reality
No hold on me
Can't you see
Your fantasy
It ain't reality
No hold on me
Can't you see
Your fantasy
It ain't reality
No hold on me
Can't you see
You're stuck in your silly little fantasy
CHORUS
I don't exist for your happiness
And I don't expect for you to do the same
I'm not the cure to your loneliness
And I ain't 'bout to play your games
CHORUS
I don't exist for your happiness
And I don't expect for you to do the same
I'm not the cure to your loneliness
And I ain't 'bout to play your games
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
Hooo hooo hoooooooo
You ain't got a hold on me
Can't you see
Your fantasy
It ain't reality
No hold on me
Can't you see
