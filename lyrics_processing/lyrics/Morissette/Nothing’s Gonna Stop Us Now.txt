Lookin' in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I found is too good to be true
Standin' here beside you
Want so much to give you this love in my heart
That I'm feelin' for you

Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand
Baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Oh, whoa

I'm so glad I found ya, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
You might also like
Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I wanna do
Is hold you forever, forever and ever

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us, woah
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
If this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Ooh
Nothing's gonna stop us
