Seems like that's when you started
Treating me like your play toy
You know that I'd be there for you
And, now you're playing love too close with the girls
Leaving me with the boys rushing
'Cause they figure with us
It's only a matter of time
Until now it's just been talk
Do we get real or does love walk?
The writing's on the wall
When the others call with their
(Free time) baby, what do you do with their
(Free time) between my little band and you
(Free time) this time
This time gotta make a choice
With your free time
Do you want my ear to hear another man's voice
On the phone, huh uh
Telling me why do you leave a girl like me alone
I used to want to handle it
Now do I really want you?
Since you're leaving it at my whim
Do I give my love to you or him, baby?
Attention is a girl's lifeline
That's what you always forget
I've been on the up and up
Since the day we met
So listen, it's not just another line
Giving me too much
You might also like(Free time) what are you doing with your
(Free time) I can use it, just give me all your
(Free time) but you start over again with this
(Free time) if you want me, put the time in
Somewhere in this affair
I know I'm worth it
No more evasive action, this is it
And I'm laying it on the line
That is if you wanna be mine
I want it, your
(Free time) give me some time, baby
(Free time) I can use it, just give me all your
(Free time) to start over again with this
(Free time) uh, hit it
Until now it's just been talk
Do we get real or does love walk?
It's on you and your
(Free time) give me some time, baby
(Free time) I wanna know, I wanna know, baby
(Free time) to start over again with this
(Free time) if you want me, put the time in
(Free time) now baby, is there a way
We can get right to it
Your free time, I want it
(Free time) won't you give it to me
So we can be like we want it to be
Just you and me
(Free time) I go on and on and on and on, baby
To let you know
(Free time) this love in my heart
Is just made for you and me
(Free time) ooh ooh ooh
(Free time) give it to me, I can use it
(Free time) to start over again with this
(Free time) free-ee-ee-ee time
