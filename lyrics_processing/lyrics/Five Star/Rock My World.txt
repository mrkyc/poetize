You just get even
For something I didn't mean to do
You just go on different directions
It happens
It happens to be true
But don't be sad
Don't even get angry
I still believe that we can see it through
Just don't forget
Everything you give you get
And in a while it all comes back to you
You wanna rock my world
Cause I'm rocking yours
I would pay those odds every time
You got to know how to dance
Before you come to the floor
Now that's the botom line
But baby don't let that guy
Start making you jealous
He knows by now
Why I'm not free
And baby I bet my heart
When you go out with the fellas, yeah
That you would do the same for me
