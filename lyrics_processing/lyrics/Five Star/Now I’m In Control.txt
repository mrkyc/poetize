I didn't really know what I wanted
I never cried
But the tears inside
Left me with a heart that was haunted
I took the blame
It was always the same
I never, ever woke up without it
And now the pain's starting over again
Now I'm doing something about it
Tonight the waiting's over
I'm taking over
Now I'm in control
When the pressure's on
No, I won't let go
Now I'm in control
I can love you so
With my heart and soul
Now I'm in control
If you turn me on
I can let you know
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
I'm in control

When I made up my mind
No one's going to take me for granted
I never hide when my heart is alive
I recognize a love when I found it
Tonight the tide is turning
Tonight I'm burning
Now I'm in control
When the pressure's on
No, I won't let go
Now I'm in control
I can love you so
With my heart and soul
Now I'm in control
If you turn me on
I can let you know
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
I'm in control
Tonight the tide is turning
Tonight you know I'm burning
The night is so exciting
There's no denying
Now I'm in control
When the pressure's on
No, I won't let go
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
I'm in control
Now I'm in control
I can love you so
With my heart and soul
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
I'm in control
Now I'm in control (now)
If you turn me on
I can let you know (I'm in control)
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
I'm in control
Now I'm in control
Can't you feel tonight
