I look in your eyes
And suddenly I can't face the thought of letting you go
But we don't say a word
Although we have so much to say
The look on your face
You're feeling the same way
But time is not our best friend
And falling in love
Is only a heartbeat away
So please don't say goodnight

Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
And I can't let you go now
Please stay, darling
And let me into your life
Please don't say goodnight
Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
I can't hold on much longer
Please, please, darling
This moment is oh so right
So please don't say goodnight
You might also like
Right here in this room
Two innocent fools
Are fighting for the right words to say
And falling in love
Is only a heartbeat away
So please don't say goodnight

Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
And I can't let you go now
Please stay, darling
And let me into your life
And please don't say goodnight
Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
I can't hold on much longer
Please, please, darling
This moment is oh so right
Please don't say goodnight

Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
And I can't let you go now
Please stay, darling
Let me into your life
Please don't say goodnight
Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it, yeah
I can't hold on much longer
Please stay, darling
This moment is oh so right
So please, please, please don't say goodnight

Just one kiss
From your sweet lips, darling
This is it
And I can't let you go now
Please stay, darling
Let me into your life
And please don't say goodnight
Just one kiss is all I need
