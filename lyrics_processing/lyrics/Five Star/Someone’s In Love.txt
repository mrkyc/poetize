Ha mmm uh
Sick of leaving always
Getting nowhere fast enough
To let me know each time you go away
You're feeling nothing for me
But baby this time have to, mmm
Say you really love me
And together tonight
We'll make a toast of our new love
Let's make it happen
Cause baby, someone's in love
And no one's to blame
Someone could lose
A part of their heart
It's feeling misused
Is sometimes a way of love
Someone's in love
You know from the heart, baby
If something good could happen to me, baby
In my life to chase the hurt away
I would like to know
If your love still remains
I'll never stop wanting you
But baby this time have to, mmm
Try your least to hurt me
And together tonight
We'll make the most of our new love
We'll make it happen
