Hey yeah, uh
Mm, mm
Doo, doo, doo, whoa, yeah
Uh-huh, well

I'm living in a world of a strange land
There ain't any familiar things
I don't know what to do
Baby, I need you to relieve my insanity
I know you know the answers
To bring the real world back to me, so

Just take my hand
Say you'll walk with me
Through the test of time with me
You must understand
Baby can't you see
That I know that you know

Baby, this is some kind of magic
I just can't wait no more
What can I do to get it through to you?
If you love me, you got it
'Cause I'll be right through that door
To be in your arms, I couldn't ask for more
You might also like
I didn't know I'd fall
I guess you took me by surprise
Beneath your exterior
You make me feel inferior, baby
So when you're all alone
Just bring your loving back to me
I'll show you much magic, boy
I'm gonna be your pride and joy, so

So just take my hand
Say you'll walk with me
Through the test of time with me
You must understand
You're the world to me
And I know that you know

Baby, this is some kind of magic
I just can't wait no more
What can I do to get it through to you?
If you love me, you got it
