And I'm searching everywhere
To find your love
I had to play so hard to get
And I hadn't found out yet where you are
You know I find just what you got
Here I come ready or not
Hide and seek
It's just a game with me
Hide and seek
Swear I'm gonna find you
Sneaking up behind you
Hide and seek
(Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek)
When I try so hard to see
When you keep this mystery
Around our love
Every simple breath you take
Always makes the love we make seem so new, yeah
You're up to your old tricks again
I close my eyes and count to ten
Hide and seek
It's just a game with me
Hide and seek
Swear I'm gonna find you
Sneaking up behind you
Hide and seek
(Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek)

Here I come ready or not
Hide and seek (hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek)
It's just a game with me
