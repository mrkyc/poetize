Oh baby, mm
No no no no no no
Secrets from my heart
I'm about to reveal to you
Like everything, my inner soul
Alone I lay at night
Thinking about you
I hold my pillow tight
What else can I do, baby?
I need you so bad, I need you so
Baby, don't let go
You got the best of me
And I want it this way now
When you touch me, never let go (oooh)
I feel your love deep inside of me, yeah (inside of me)
My love is yours, so let it come slow (come slow, babe)
Deeper and deeper, come inside and feel
Your body is an muscle
I praise the Lord
That makes this right tonight
Come on and be my lover dear
Hold on and love me all night
