I thought that's how it had to be
I turned off my mind
But I forgot about my heart
Now it's too late to start again
You got the best of me
When we broke up
I thought that's how it had to be
I turned off my mind
But I forgot about my heart
Now it's hard to start again
You've got the best of me
I've had enough
My heart's locked up and you own the key
Won't you rescue me
I need your lovin'
Nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
Baby, rescue me
I need your kind of kissing and hugging
'Cause I miss you too much
Now wait a minute, okay

Radioactive love attack
You hit the spot
Now I understand what I got
I guess I had to go through it to get to it
I don't seem to want any guy in town
But this freedom I'm starting to doubt
Won't you rescue me
I need your loving
Nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
Come on, rescue me
I need your kind of kissing and hugging
'Cause I miss you too much
Come on, rescue me
Don't get your baby
Nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
Come on, rescue me
'Cause I'm on my own, I'm your baby
'Cause I miss you too much, come on
Sending out an S.O.S
When it comes to me, baby, you're the best
Sending out an S.O.S, ah, come on
When it comes to me, you pass the test
Come on, rescue me
Nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
Come on, rescue me
I need your kind of kissing and hugging
Come on, come on, rescue me
I need your loving
Nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
Won't you rescue me
I need your kind of kissing and hugging
Come on, 'cause I miss you too much
Come on, come on
Rescue me
I need your love, I need your love
And nobody, nobody can get to me
I'm too used to your touch
I need your kind of kissing and hugging
Come on, cause I miss you too much
