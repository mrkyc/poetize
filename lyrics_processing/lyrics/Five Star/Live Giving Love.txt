Wondering what you're doing now
Two hours and a minute
Since you've been gone
But your kiss still lingers on and on, oh oh oh
These passing nights have been so long
Without you by my side, yeah
Can't stand for a minute
Ti think where you're at, no
We could learn to love again
So we can live giving love
To each other, yeah
We can live giving sweet love
For the rest of our lives
We can live giving love
To each other, yeah
'Cause two hearts can beat as one
I hear you talking 'bout you and me
About the times when we couldn't see
You know that you want me
Just as much as I want you, yeah
We're not ordinary lovers, and you know
Remember the very first night
You held my hand
These words came straight from your heart
You said true love was not for me
Until I met you, yeah
And together we would be, forever
