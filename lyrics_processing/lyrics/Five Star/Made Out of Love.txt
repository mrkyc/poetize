Ah, he's so tough
They never see what I lack
Only the good stuff
And he's so physical, but gentle
Strong enough to be sentimental
When he looks at me
Anyone can see
That he lives and breathes
For his love for me
He's made out of love
He's my one in a million baby
Ooh, he's made out of love
He's sweet and he's fine
And mine
He's always bringing me hearts, candy and flowers
And even when we're apart
He phones me for hours
We are the perfect combination
My friends say the he's a sensation
When he squeezes me tight
In the heat of the night
Ah, his kisses are dynamite
