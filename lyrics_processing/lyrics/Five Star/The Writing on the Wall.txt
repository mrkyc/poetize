Yeah
Some say that I should have known
Some say, "Girlfriend, he didn't care"
I guess I should have seen the warning sign
Instead of put my heart on the line
No, I cannot deny
Been warned a thousand times
I should have know your kind
How could I've been so blind?
Beware of a broken heart, baby
I guess I should have read the writing on the wall
It said, "Girlfriend, he'll tear your heart apart"
I guess I should have read the writing on the wall
Something told me not to get involved
Stop before this man goes to far
'Cuz he know how quickly you can fall
When you put your trust in your heart, oh oh
Oh, I should have played it cool
Played it by the rules
You played me for a fool
How could you be so cruel?

A broken heart can mend
But a fool never learns
When they always return to love
Oh, why can't I pretend
That I don't hurt inside
But now I realize
Oh oh oh
Ooh, why'd you have to hurt me?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, baby
Ooh, oh
Why'd you go and treat me this way?
