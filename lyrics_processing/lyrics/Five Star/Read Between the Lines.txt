Take my advice
Don't give it away
Girlfriend, you better listening
And take my advice
While you're waiting in the midnight
He's out holding someone tight, hey girl
Don't be making plans for life
I wouldn't if I were you
If you want some satisfaction
And you're looking for his reaction
Ah ah, it's just not in his eyes, no
Why can't you see
You use your heart and not your head, hey
Should know by now
There's no meaning in what's left unsaid
Watch out for the signs, read
Read between the lines (read)
Just look in his eyes
And you'll see the sign
Read between the lines
All you gotta do is
Read between the lines
Do you hear me?
'Cause actions speak
Much louder than his words
You might also likeCheck it
Out, I've been there before
Oh oh
You want a lifetime you can treasure
He wants a moment, strictly pleasure, ooh
You'd better think it over twice
You'd better think twice
He'll break your heart and leave you dry
Then you sit and wonder why, why
You could never break through all the ice
Oh yeah, why can't you see
You use your heart and not your head, hey
Should know by now
There's no meaning in what's left unsaid
Can't you see the signs, oh
