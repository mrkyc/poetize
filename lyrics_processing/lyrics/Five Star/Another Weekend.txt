Woo, another weekend
Another night's fun begins
I can't wait
Another heartache on my make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break

I don't believe it, ha
It never fails a hit when I'm not lookin'
Maybe this one's kind of right
I'm here for the dancin'
But every move that's made just needs romancin'
So I gotta keep tellin' myself it's just another line

Another weekend, that's all
Another night's fun begins, but I can't wait
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break

So gimme your number, ha
I've gotta make sure I'm not caught up
In the wonder of it all
Ha, can't take another fall
'Cause I start to lose it
When the DJ starts to pump up the music
It's like I'm hypnotized
I close my eyes and when I count to ten
You might also like
Another weekend is on me
Another night's fun begins, ha
Like a fool and I can't wait
I can't fake this feeling
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What will I do when I look at you
My heart says "Baby, take me home"
But my mind says (Leave it)
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
I keep hearing the same old song

Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
I can't get serious
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break
A-shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, come on
Ooh, ooh, baby
I need that breakdown
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Breakdown, baby, uh
A night on the town
Gimme, oh gimme, baby, give it
But just leave it alone, leave it alone

Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
I can't get serious
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break
Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
Can't fake this feeling
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break
Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
I can't get serious
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break
Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
Can't fake this feeling
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
Gimme a break
Another weekend
Another night's fun begins
And I can't wait
Another heartache on the make
Another lover to shake
