Can't think of a moment that you weren't there
We've been through so much together
Can't think of a feeling that we haven't shared
Ooh, how many lovers
Ever find the kind of love that we got
Ooh, ain't many others
Because you know what we got is a rare thing
Oh, it's everlasting
This love is as strong as steel
Can't break it up or break it down, it's always gonna be around
This love is a love that's real
It's as deep as any ocean goes, it's gonna last, don't you know
This love's strong as steel
We've been right here for each other
Even through the times when times were hard for us
When it rained we came through shining
Always knew we'd make it, all it takes is trust
Ooh, and now there's nothing, no
That could ever come between you and me
Ooh, our love is one thing
That just keeps on getting better
The more that we're together
