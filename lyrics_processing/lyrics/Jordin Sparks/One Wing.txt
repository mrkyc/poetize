Feels like I'm going down a one way street
In every direction
And I need, I need, I need, heaven to show me just little affection
No, cause all of the signs, oh oh
Torn towards bad for me
And I wish I could get a running start
And soar to my victory

But, one wing I can't fly with one wing
Heaven help me, fly with one wing
I can't fly with one wing, oh no
No matter how hard I try, I can't no

Feels like I'm running out of time
And I gotta whole lotta things on my mind
And I'm walking around with the dark, uh huh
Trying to find just a little peak of sunshine
No, no I did everything to make it work
But, still I'm at a loss, yeah
Now, I'm on a runaway of my life
Waiting to take off

But I-I-I, I can not fly with one wing
Heaven I'm gonna need some help yeah, fly with one wing
I can't, I can't, I can't fly with one wing, oh no
No matter how hard I try, I can't no

Always on my knees, always on my knees
Oh, I been on my knees many of nights
Praying, for the coming of my victory, yeah
But there's always something there in the way to delay my flight
I just can't get off my feet
To reach my destiny
Though it's where I can see
It's just to high to reach, no

I can't, I can't, I can't fly with one wing!
Yeah, fly with one wing!
No, I can't fly, fly with one wing
I can't fly with one wing, oh no
No matter how hard I try, I can't no
I can pray all I want, sister
Fly with one wing, no
Fly with one wing, I can't I can't I can't
Fly, fly, fly, fly
I can't fly with one wing, but I can't
I can't fly with one wing, I can't
I can't fly with one wing, I can't
