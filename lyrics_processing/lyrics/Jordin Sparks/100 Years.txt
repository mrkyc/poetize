There's nothing better than you babe
Can't wait to kiss you every day
Could it really be, I got that special key
To lock your heart in place
What am I supposed to do?
Wishing when you're in the other room
You're the only one who can break through
All I think about is pleasing you

A hundred years is not enough time with you
I fantasize about all that we could do
I wish you knew how much I really love you
Don't go nowhere, baby, yeah

All I need is more time, more time
Just a little more time, more time
Need a little more time, more time
With you, hey

This morning when we kissed
I felt everything you wanted to say
No words even needed to be said
You looked right in my eyes
And I knew
You might also like
Let me catch you staring at me
Can't begin to describe that feeling
Things are running through my mind
Chills go down my spine
You take me to bed
I can't get enough of your smile
One day I'll see it at the end of an aisle
You put your hand in mine
We'll leave the past behind
And start our brighter days

A hundred years is not enough time with you
I fantasize about all that we could do
I wish you knew how much I really love you
Don't go nowhere, baby, yeah

All I need is more time, more time
Just a little more time, more time
Need a little more time, more time
With you, hey

The seconds, the minutes, the hours
Are just too precious to waste
So when your arms are wrapped around me
I can take on anything
Can love transcend past this place?
Cause when we're gone, I still think
I love you, let me say it again
A hundred years is not enough time with you
I fantasize about all that we could do
I wish you knew how much I really love you
Don't go nowhere, baby, yeah

All I need is more time, more time
Just a little more time, more time
Need a little more time, more time
