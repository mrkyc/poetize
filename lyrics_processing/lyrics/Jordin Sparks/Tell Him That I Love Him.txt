First off I ain't mad at you
So don't take this the wrong way
Just wanna put you up on some truth, if that's cool
You know that new man you got coming through?
He was into me way before he was into you
You ain't know, so I ain't blaming you, no, no

Have you ever been in love and
Thought you had your husband
Then you know what I'm going through, yeah
All that playing don't mean nothing, doing him for nothing
Can you do me a favor?

I know the candle's lit and he's on his way
Probably got your sex dress on, waiting all day
So girl, (Don't) stop what you got going
But when he gets there tell him that I love him
Oh, tell him that I miss him real bad
Tell him just chill, I'll see him in the morning
Oh, tell him that I love him

Now we been talking 'bout getting that house
Got me picking out everything
With his and hers in the driveway
I know you wouldn't purposefully get in my way
I know you heard all about 'to each his own'
I know you don't want to break up a happy home
I heard him knocking, won't you let him in, and tell me this

I know the candle's lit (Oh) and he's on his way (He's on his way)
Probably got your sex dress on, waiting all day for him
But girl, don't stop what you got going
But when he gets there tell him that I love him
Tell him that I miss him real bad
Tell him just chill, I'll see him in the morning

Before he gets there hear me out
I ain't tryna burst your bubble
Let him know he got a baby coming
We been planning on it
(Ain't gonna give that up)
Girl you ain't got that long
'Cause pretty soon you'll be gone
(Remind him we got church all in the morning
Better not make me call him)
Enjoy him for now, oh whoa
I know the candle's lit and he's on his way
Probably got your sex dress on, waiting all day for him
But girl, don't stop what you got going
But when he gets there tell him that I love him (yeah)
Oh, tell him that I miss him real bad
Tell him just chill (just chill), I'll see him in the morning

Just tell him that I love him, yeah
Tell him that I miss him
Tell him just to chill, oh yeah
Oh, tell him that I love him
Whoa, oh yeah, tell him that I need him
