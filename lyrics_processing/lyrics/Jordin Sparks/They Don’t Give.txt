Baby, baby, they say we ain't gon' make it
But I know, they don't give an eff about us
The way they hating, that's clear they just can't take it
But God knows, they don't know a thing about love
If we're gonna make it through whatever, don't let them hate
'Cause our love was meant to be forever, no matter what they say (Ooh)

The one thing I know for sure is
I know that they don't give an eff about us
So why should we care at all
When God knows they don't know a thing about love, love, love, about love (Ooh)

They just don't understand me, the way I understand you
(I know that they don't give an eff about us)
I so wish they could see the way I am when I'm around you
(God knows that they don't know a thing about love)
That I would sacrifice it all for you, know you'd do the same things too
Oh I do, why do they try to break our hearts in two?
Don't the know how much I love you? And I do

The one thing I know for sure is
I know that they don't give an eff about us
So why should we care at all
When God knows they don't know a thing about love, love, love, love, love

Well, it really shouldn't matter what they say about us
But if I'm gon' be honest, sometimes it just does
'Cause I'm really in love, mmm
And it really shouldn't matter, but we get caught up
And I'm gon' be honest, hey
Sometimes we just want the ones we love to love the ones that we love
But they don't give an eff about love

The one thing I know for sure is
I know that they don't give an eff about us
So why should we care at all
When God knows they don't know a thing about love, love, love, love, love (Ooh)

Woah, they don't care...
Mmm, I know that they don't give an eff about us (They don't...)
So why should we care, why should we care?
God knows they don't know a thing about love
They don't know, hey
I know that they don't give an eff about us (They don't care...)
So why should we care at all
When God knows they don't know a thing about love, about love
I know that they don't give an eff about you, about me
