So what if I came clean
And told you all you mean to me
So what if I meant every word I said
Baby, don't let it go to your head
So what if I write your name
'Cause you're always on my brain
In a heart, I paint it crimson red
Baby, don't let it go to your head

Don't be getting any big ideas
Let me make it clear

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
If I looked in your eyes
One, two, too many times
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head, oh-oh
Don't let it go to your head, oh-oh

So what if I want to kiss
From your toes up to your lips
It don't mean that you've had me yet
You're gonna be good, I bet
You might also like
I'm the one whose in control here
Let me make it clear

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
If I looked in your eyes
One, two, too many times
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head, oh-oh (Don't let it go to your head)
Don't let it go to your head, oh-oh

Now you think you got me
Well, I'm gonna get you
Now you think you can touch me
Well, I'm gonna let you

Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head
Just 'cause I can't go on
Just 'cause I die when you're gone (Die when you're gone)
Just 'cause I think of you in bed
Don't let it go to your head (Oh)
If I looked in your eyes (Eyes)
One, two, too many times (Too many times)
And memorized every word you said
Don't let it go to your head (Don't let it go to your head), oh-oh
(Don't let it go to your head) Don't let it go to your head
(Don't let it go to your head) Your head

Don't let it go to your head (Don't let it go)
Don't let it go to your head (Oh-oh)
Don't let it go to your head (Don't let it go, oh-oh-oh)
Don't let it go to your head (Oh)
Don't let it go to your head (Don't let it go)
Don't let it go to your head (Oh-oh)
Don't let it go to your head (Don't let it go)
Don't let it go to your head (Oh)
(Your head) Don't let it go to your head
Don't let it go to your head
