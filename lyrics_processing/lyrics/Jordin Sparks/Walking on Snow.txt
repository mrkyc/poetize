You fire words, but all they do is ricochet
You think I'm paying the price, but it's not costing me

Your love was a waste of time
You've been left behind
You made no mark on me
You're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind
Don't try to press rewind

It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
And all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it?
I'm so unaffected

When I was flying high, you tried to clip my wings
(You shoot me out of the sky)
You tried to make it up buying expensive things
(My love you cannot buy)

Your love was a waste of time
You've been left behind
You made no mark on me
You're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind
Don't try to press rewind
You might also like
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
And all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it? I'm so unaffected
It's like walking on snow without leaving a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break
You huff and you puff, but I'm not blown away
When you gonna get it?
I'm so unaffected

You try and find five faults in me
You project your self-hate so easily
You already lost, so you push me lower
Inside you're dying slow, so you punish me slower
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
One, two, three, four!

It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
And all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it? I'm so unaffected
It's like walking on snow without leaving a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break (heart break)
You huff and you puff, but I'm not blown away
When you gonna get it? I'm so unaffected
Leaving a trace
See this heart break
Untouched in another place
When you gonna get it?
