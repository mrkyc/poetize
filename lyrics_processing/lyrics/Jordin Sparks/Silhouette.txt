Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette

Do you see the reflection of the fire dancing on the wall?
Empty bottles and clothes are laying on the floor
Boy, you know exactly where we're about to go
We're about to go
I'm taking my phone and putting it on silent
If anyone calls they can wait 'til morning
All I wanna know is where you're putting your lips
So baby, give it to me, give it to me
I'm pulling the shades, don't let the light in
Want nothing but flames illuminating my skin
All I need to know is if you like it like this
So baby, give it to me

Tonight it's only you, me, and our silhouette
There's no space between us
Tonight we'll be seamless
Painting perfect pictures of what's going on in this bed
Insatiable shadows revealed by the candles
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
You might also like
And I'll cease, there's no need to dream when you're here next to me
No fairytale comes close to this reality
I love how good it feels when you're apart of me
You're apart of me
I'm taking my phone and putting it on silent
If anyone calls they can wait 'til morning
All I wanna know is where you're putting your lips
So baby, give it to me

Tonight it's only you, me, and our silhouette
There's no space between us
Tonight we'll be seamless
Painting perfect pictures of what's going on in this bed
Insatiable shadows revealed by the candles
You and me and our silhouette

Baby, there's no place that I would rather be
Than here with you, giving me love endlessly
The skies could fall, the world could sink into the sea
We wouldn't even know because tonight we're in so deep

Tonight it's only you, me, and our silhouette
There's no space between us
Tonight we'll be seamless
Painting perfect pictures of what's going on in this bed
Insatiable shadows revealed by the candles
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
You and me and our silhouette
Silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette, silhouette
