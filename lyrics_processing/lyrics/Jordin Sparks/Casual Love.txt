And I know I'm yearnin' for your love, baby

And I don't wanna be just a casual love

Woah, love, love, love, love, love

And I know I'm yearnin' for your love, baby

I don't wanna be just a casual lover
I don't wanna be just another girl you knew
And I don't wanna be just a casual love

This love can last forever (Forever), if we just hold on tight (Tight)
