Oh yeah
Okay, woo, ha
Let me tell you a little something

You ain't gotta lie to me (Nope, nope)
Just keep it real for me, baby
Oh, I chill with you 'cause
You understand the limitations
So I'm off in the cut (Ain't worried 'bout nothing)
'Cause I know what we got (So why you tripping?)
Move how we move, no smoke screen
Keep it 1000, 1000, 1000
I love it, one, zero, zero, zero

Ain't no strings, whats understood
Ain't gotta be explained
'Cause we keep it 1000, thousand, baby
We keep it 1000, baby, just like my momma

No second guessing
Cause we both know
That it ain't a thing
If we had to let this go
So we do what we want (Ain't worried about nothing)
'Cause we know what we go (So why you tripping?)
Won't waste my time pretending
That's why I keep it 1000 babe

Ain't no strings, what's understood
Ain't gotta be explained
'Cause we keep it 1000, thousand, baby
We keep it 1000, baby, just like my momma

I been tryna keep it 1000, I be tryna keep it 1000
Cause my girl find out about everything
If I do some bullshit she gon' know about it
If I move around with some bust downs
It gonna Instagram her just like a pic
She gonna call me up out of nowhere on some psychic shit
I'm convinced she do voodoo, I'm convinced she got screws loose
I'm convinced all the ugly girls saying all the pretty ones coo coo
The OG told me "look, that's how it is, that's how it be"
As long as I ain't coming back with no kids, why you trippin' on me?
I be strapped up when I be out here if it is

Ain't no strings, it's understood
Ain't gotta be explained
'Cause we keep it 1000, thousand, baby
We keep it 1000, baby, just like my momma
