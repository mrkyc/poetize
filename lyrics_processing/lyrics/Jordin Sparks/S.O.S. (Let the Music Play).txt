What's up, girlfriend? Something's goin' on
You got a look about you, tell me what's wrong?
Is that your boyfriend dancing with that girl on the floor?
We gotta dance now, time to show our weapons of choice

S-S-S-S-S.O.S is all I need to send
Just a little text, I'm calling all the girls
F-F-F-F-F.Y.I, you know it's not the end
Don't take it lying down, no crying now
It's your world

Let the music play, you won't get away
Just get the groove and then he'll come back to you again (Let it play!)
Let the music play, he won't get away
This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore (Let it play!)

S.O.S
S-S-S-S-S.O.S
