Maybe I should let you
Maybe I should let you go
Maybe I should let you
Maybe I should let you go
Maybe, maybe I should let you (Maybe I should let you)
Maybe I should let you go (Maybe I)
Maybe, maybe I should let you (Should let you go, hmm)
Maybe I should let you go

Thinking back on the times when I thought we'd always be together
Had our problems, challenges, but we always stormed the weather
Guess it's time that I pack and get all your shit together
Love don't love nobody but itself, I should have known better

I, I, I, I, I should have saw the signs
I, I, I chose to turn a blind eye
How can the blind lead the blind?
I never saw it coming, never saw it coming
Yeah, but in the end, we are running out of time

I had no idea that you were so unhappy
You were unhappy, you were unhappy
(So unhappy) So unhappy, you were unhappy
(That you were so unhappy) You were unhappy, you were unhappy
(So unhappy) and I had no idea you were so unhappy
You might also like
When you said you don't want me, it hurt my pride, baby, I admit it
And I know that I shouldn't be eating in the same place where I was shitting
But wait a minute, if you didn't really want this, you should have said it
From the beginning, and I don't mean to be defensive, but it hurts like hell

(I, I, I) Oh I (I, I) I should have saw the signs
(I, I) I could have turned a blind eye
(How can the blind lead the blind?) Lead the blind
I never saw it coming, should have saw it coming
(Yeah, but in the end, we are running out of time)

I had no idea that you were so unhappy
(So unhappy) Oh, you could have told me you were unhappy
(That you were so unhappy) That you were unhappy, you were unhappy baby, ye-yeah
(So unhappy) And I had no idea that you were unhappy

I don't know
(Maybe I should let you)
You're still in my heart
(Maybe I should let you go)
I think of you every day
(Maybe I should let you)
And you bring me so much pain
(Maybe I should let you go)
You only see my mistakes
(Maybe, maybe I should let you)
You never congratulate
(Maybe I should let you go)
You're making me miserable
(Maybe, maybe I should let you)
And you're turning my heart to stone
(Maybe I should let you go)
Walk right out of my life
(Maybe I should let you)
Prove everybody wrong
(Maybe I should let you go)
Oh, you didn't even try
(Maybe I should let you)
You shouldn't be playing with me inside, oh
(Maybe I should let you go)
(Maybe, maybe, I should let you)
Maybe, maybe, I should let you go
(Maybe I should let you go)
You went ahead
(Maybe, maybe I should let you)
And I had no idea
(Maybe I should let you go)
That you were so unhappy, oh, oh
(So unhappy) you were unhappy, you were unhappy
(That you were so unhappy) Why didn't you tell me that you were so unhappy?
