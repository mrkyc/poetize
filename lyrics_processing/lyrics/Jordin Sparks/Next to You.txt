(Ah-ah) Mmm
(Ah-ah) Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ah-ah) Ooh (Ah-ah)

Two o'clock and I wish that I was sleeping
You're in my head like a song on the radio
All I know is I gotta get next to you (Yeah, I gotta get next to you)
Sitting here turning minutes into hours
To find the nerve just to call you on the telephone
'Cause you don't know that I gotta get next to you

Maybe we're friends
Maybe we're more
Maybe it's just my imagination
But I see you stare just a little too long
And it makes me start to wonder
So baby, call me crazy, but I think you feel it too
Maybe I, maybe I, just gotta get next to you (Ah-ah)
(I gotta get next to you)
(Ah-ah)

I asked around and I heard that you were talking
Told my girl that you thought I was out of your league
What a fool, I gotta get next to you, oh (Gotta get next to you)
Yeah, it's five in the morning, and I can't go to sleep
'Cause I wish, yeah, I wish you knew what you mean to me
Baby, let's get together, and end this mystery, oh
You might also like
Maybe we're friends
Maybe we're more
Maybe it's just my imagination
But, I see you stare just a little too long
And it makes me start to wonder
So baby, call me crazy, but I think you feel it too
Maybe I, maybe I, just gotta get next to you

Whatcha gotta say? Whatcha gotta do?
How you get the one you want
To wanna get next to you?
Whatcha gotta say? Whatcha gotta do?
How you get the one you want
To wanna get next to you? Yeah
Whatcha gotta say? Whatcha gotta do?

Maybe we're friends
Maybe we're more (Maybe we're more)
Maybe it's just my imagination (Imagination)
But, I see you stare just a little too long (Hey, yeah)
And it makes me start to wonder (So baby, call me crazy, yeah)
So baby, call me crazy, but I think you feel it too
Maybe I, baby, call me crazy
Yeah, I know you feel it too
Maybe I, maybe I, just gotta get next to you (Ah-ah)
Yeah (Ah-ah, next to you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah-ah)
