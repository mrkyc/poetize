Feeling like I gotta get all this off my chest
I know you're sitting there, thinking whatcha gon do next
Crazy thinking back on the last sext you sent
Crazy like all these bitches
Crazy like all these bitches
Remember I deleted all the other guys numbers out my phone for ya
Remember when you broke your neck and I had to wash your back for ya? (ugh)
You probably don't remember half the shit that I did for ya (yeah)

You don't really fuck with me way back when, boy how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now
And you suck right now
You thought you had it all figured out back then, but how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now
And you suck right now
You thought that little effort that you put in was enough, boy, how bout now?
Boy, how bout now?
How bout know, boy?
What about now, boy?
How bout now? (yeah)

Always been Mommy's little angel
Once you blew up, head got big and you started changin' (what?)
Can't believe all the things she started saying
Like I'm with you for your fame and your name (what?)
That thought in your future now setting up a game (what?)
She dyin to be insta-famous
Asking for the things that you gave me
Try to lock you in with a baby (who?)
Keeping it real, but no I'm not acting shady
Don't blow up my phone, calling complaining
We you tried it once, but
