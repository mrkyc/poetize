Tell me why one day seems so long
When you're gone, ain't no sun
No waves in the ocean
What if I could just make you my job?
I would be so devoted
I need a promotion

Boy, when I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you
When I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you

And I was just a million miles away
But now I'm right here
In your face, in your place
And there's really nothing left for me to say
I'm coming there, I need a play
Performing there, you'll be the stage
Oh, baby, you're worth all my energy (All my energy)
And oh, work it out and then I fall asleep
You might also like
Boy, when I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you
When I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you

And I was just a million miles away
But now I'm right here
In your face, fast pace
Help me out, I gotta make my quota, babe
Let me fix your shoulders, baby
And we ain't gotta go to sleep
Oh, baby, you're worth all my energy
And oh, work it out and then I fall asleep

Yeah, clocking in like bim, bim
Cutting up like trim, trim
You get yours and I get mine's
So either way, it's a win-win
Scored two points for the whole team
Gon' on, show your man what ho mean
I love what you done with the place, girl
But I'mma read Portia the whole thing
My domain is real marble, not faux paint
She gon' make a nigga a sandwich
'Cause I be working hard for that whole grain
Don't you worry, 'cause all that homework and shit gon' pay off
I just get laid while they get laid off
You won't get laid off, you don't take days off
Lock the damn door, mattress floor, padded headboard
Toes on the ceiling like it was a dance floor
Underscore, give me space for something more, come explore
If she got a Thundercat I'll ride it like a Cadillac
Like scrrrr!
Boy, when I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you
When I get home, I'mma work hard
'Cause you work hard like I do
I'mma work hard when I get home
'Cause I work hard on you

And I was just a million miles away
