I can't help myself
And I don't wanna be with nobody else
I don't wanna leave my baby's side
And I don't wanna kiss another guy
I'll pass any test
'Cause nothing in this world or in the next
Could make me second guess
Could make me change my mind
Could make me not protect what I'm feeling inside

Because I'm smart enough to know that this is a good thing
Please believe it, please believe it
And I'm smart enough to stay right where I belong
And I'm faithful enough to know that this is meant to be
And if it's not, then don't speak
Don't ruin it, let me dream

Hear me, hear me
This is for my baby
There will never be another
There's so many ways I love you
And that's just for the record, babe
I need you, need you
I can't wait to see you
I so love when were together
Can't nobody do it better
And that's just for the record, babe
You might also like
I can't be perfect
No one is flawless
But rest your mind
'Cause I'll be there through the good and the bad
And the ugly and worse
So if it's something that you're lacking, go and tell me first

'Cause I'm smart enough to know that this is a good thing, yeah
Smart enough to stay right where I belong (Ooh, no, no, no)
And I'm faithful enough to know that this is meant to be
And if it's not, then don't speak
Don't ruin it, let me dream

Hear me, hear me
This is for my baby
There will never be another
There's so many ways I love you
And that's just for the record, babe (Just for the record, baby)
I need you, need you
I can't wait to see you
I so love when were together
Can't nobody do it better
And that's just for the record, babe
So if there's any way to cheat
Don't tell me 'cause I don't wanna know
And if there's any way to leave
Don't tell me 'cause I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause I don't wanna miss you
This is my team and I love my position
Lead me anywhere, I'll go with you there
I'll go with you there

Hear me, hear me
This is for my baby
There will never be another
There's so many ways I love you (Whoa)
And that's just for the record, babe (No, no)
I need you, need you (Need you, I need you, I need you)
I can't wait to see you
I so love when were together
Can't nobody do it better
And that's just for the record, baby
Hear me (Hear me), hear me (Hear me)
This is for my baby (My baby)
There will never be another
There's so many ways I love you
And that's just for the record, babe (Just for the record, baby)
I need you, need you (I need you)
I can't wait to see you (Hey)
I so love when we're together
Can't nobody do it better
