I'm all alone tonight, no stars are shining on me
I'm thinkin' I'd be alright if somebody would just call me, yeah
I know that I'm not crazy, everybody must get this way sometimes
So look around for the people in your life that say

Save me
I need somebody's help here
Thought it would be alright
But I'm not pulling through on my own
Is anyone around who can save me?
I'm falling down, it's crazy
If this is the pain God gave me
I'm cool with that
But won't somebody save me?

I guess you missed the signs
But honey, I can never blame you
I don't want you feeling guilty
That'd keep you in pain too (Oooh)
Now I can't hear you when I'm far away, away
So maybe you could learn from this
And help somebody else someday
'Cause I'm human after all
And I could not catch my fall
And nobody ever came around my way o check up on me
And see if I was doing alright
Nobody came to save me (Nobody, nobody)

Save me from my demons
Save me from myself
Save me, somebody save me
I need someone's help (Ooh)

Save me
I need somebody's help here
