Tell me what happened this time, made you come back again
I find I only see you when luck deserts you
If this is your idea of happiness, then let's be clear
Those words of yours ain't working anymore

'Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be, but you

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
To keep a girl like me?
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers won't stop the rain?
Baby, no, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more?
You're no longer worth waiting for

I know you're busy, so if you gotta go, then go
But don't forget to leave my heart
I stayed around for you, but you're nowhere to be found now
Once again, here you are
You might also like
'Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be, but you

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
To keep a girl like me?
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers won't stop the rain?
Baby, no, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more?
You're no longer worth waiting for

I settled for less
When I stayed with you, but no more
'Cause you ain't worth waiting for, ooh

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more (Don't you know it takes much more)
To keep a girl like me?
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers won't stop the rain?
(No more waiting for you, no, no, no, no)
Baby, no, no (Uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more? (No)
You're no longer worth waiting for
(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes more?
(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes much more?
(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes much more?
(You're no longer worth waiting for)

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby, no (Baby, no)
Don't you know it takes much more? No, no
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers won't stop the rain?
No, oh
