Yo, the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely
Little faggot motherfucker like **** ******
Tried to get someone to pop my chain
Getting robbed, dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Ayo, I treat that show money, Mike, like it's coke money, all right?
So you better have it, consequences could be a casket
I'm beyond forensic, a menace with a 'matic
I'ma leave 'em in the streets just splattered
Beat and battered, fuck cops, police don't matter, bring 'em to me

With not a dollar, not a cent, not a rock to my name
Yo, I'ma keep it funky, dog, I'll hock my chain
For a block of cocaine, now it's back to my block with cocaine
You know, re-in' up and filling up them pots with cocaine
Then you chop it up and bottle up and top the cocaine
Gotta watch for them cops and they chains
For them Diplomatic affairs, automatic'll flare
I whips everything from automatics to gear
Yeah, you know sticks I clutch 'em, shots with six, I bust 'em
Cop kicks to scuff 'em, fuck 'em
Hop out the 6 and crush 'em, hop in the 6 and dust 'em, boom

I got girls that'll buy me a quarter
Supply me with water, beef come? Drive me to borders
Kamikaze with they homi's, body your daughter
Turn your whole crew into Dodgers like Tommy Lasorda (Yeah, come on)
So you faggots have that money in order
Jim'll come through with wolves and let the hungry extort ya
Now how is that for the drama suspense?
Any beef, our piranhas get sent, kidnap your mama for rent
Hot shots from the Beretta will fly
I'm breaking bread with my guys, we want it dead or alive, Dipset, boom
