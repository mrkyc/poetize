I'm not gonna watch this go on any longer
You know, they put my food in the dark
And then expect me to look for my plate on some Mr. Magoo shit
Fuck I look like
I'm not gon' watch this go on any longer
(Killa, killa, killa...)
Uh (Y'all want to live my life but)
I'm home, y'all (Y'all just can't live my life, though)
Harlem (Y'all want to live my life but)
Who else is gon' hold us down?
(Y'all just can't, y'all just can't)
Bloodshed, nigga (Y'all want to live my life but)
Let's get it right this time (Y'all just can't live my life, though)
Understand (Y'all want to live my life but)
Killa (Y'all just can't)

Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daiquiris
Like it's all good down at The Hit Factory
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me
All that click clackery take your wrist wrappery
I ain't no rapper, B, I skeet Uzis
And I can't act, turned down three movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast
My rude ass, carry three weapons
And I'll give your face a C-section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape 'em, bury their skirts
Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work (What?!)
I'd rather run the streets, 730 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want the order
Came to ask me stop pitching to his daughter (Fuck outta here)
Serious? This man can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties, got a damn handy
How you gon' ever ask stop Cam candy
I'ma sell to anybody in your damn family
Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy
Your right hand man Randy, understand me
In Atlanta I got an outlandish land piece
And a matching Land, desert-colored, sandy
You might also like
You know the one with the whips, THAT'S ME
The one with the chicks and the chips, THAT'S ME
The one with the toast, pants baggy, yelling out get at me
Get at me, nigga, THAT'S ME
The one that be running and dodging YOU
The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU
The one that's scared of some yayo
Always wanna lay low, 'cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch

I could show you some ice, throw you advice
You not that good, dawg, who told you you nice?
Your crew, switch siders
When I come through, "Hey, Cam," dick riders
But I only mess with Navigator 528
6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver
Come through, stick your supplier
Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva
Gas her up, "Ma, put it on you mouth"
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out
And I ain't got beef, I don't play them games
If I did though believe me I would say y'all names
Go to your house, red dot scope your crib
Smack your earth, snatch your seed, choke your wiz
My crew split, it was my mistake
But to my nigga Duke, we all make mistakes
I'ma get shit right if I spend my cake
Jimmy, I'ma get you up out of 5H
This is for my niggas that load the pipe
Saying I'm the best, just not promoted right
You know my life: drink, smoke, roll some dice
Control the heist, know how my patrol get shiesty
We all get shiest
Ma, keep all your rice
Wedding ring, HELL NO, I like all my ice
Niggas tried to make Killa Cam all polite
Turn on the set now, bitch, I'm like Poltergeist
You the type talk about everything you got now
I interrupt you like, "Not now, you hot how"
My rings like a dog, all rock wild
When I flash it, everybody shocked, "Wow!"
I see y'all concerned about me
You ain't gotta go to school to learn about me
Yo, the one with mad guns, THAT'S ME
The one with the yay for 23, THAT'S ME
The one with the ice, slice, coke half price
Yoke that's nice, THAT'S ME
The one that's scared of a scuffle, YOU
The one that say "Baby girl, I love you," YOU
The one that talk about hustling, never seen a oven
You all about nothing, YOU, biatch

Told you I got us this time around, nigga
Feeling me, Self, HUH?
Harlem, I got us, nigga
Santana, Freeky Zeeky, Jim Jones
Salty, Fat Shawn, run with us or run from us or get run the fuck over
It's fuck us so fuck y'all
Killa, bitch; Killa, bitch; Killa, bitch; Killa, bitch; Killa, bitch
