I saw the colossal landscape
Of which I never was a part
It was a magical day, oh
Of which I'd never seen before

The first time I saw colossal girl
The first time I saw colossal girl

Such glowing mountains before us
Pillars of life all fade away
Of all the things I need to say, girl
All of these words are in my way

The first time I saw colossal girl

Well, she's runnin' to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return?
She must be Mother Nature's child
'Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Lookin' at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me, no

Oh, is my love a confession?
Will I just put it back today?
If I had love left to give you
Would you still throw it all away?

The first time I saw colossal girl
The first time I saw colossal girl

Well, she's runnin' to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return?
'She must be Mother Nature's child
'Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Looking at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me, oh

Can you remember the first time we met
Living together in colossal times?
Some things are given with no reason why
Living together all of the time
Well I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep
And all I can give you is all of my love
These are the things I can give you to keep, oh
And I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes
And I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep
And all I can give you is all of my love
