Oh, my friend, don't get caught in yesterday
All the things we've heard have left and made their way
Lower your guns, even if love has turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
If you listen to the sound within your mind
You may find your answer flowing in the tide

Say goodbye to your sorrow, and hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call, say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter, and I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know if I'll go, can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow, and hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call, so say that love is here for all

Lower your guns, even if love turns to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
Oh, my friend, I hope you're done with yesterday
All the things we've heard have left and made their way

Say goodbye to your sorrow, and hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call, say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter, and I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know if I'll go, can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow, and hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call, say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all, say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all, say that love is here for all
