Living without you
So I prayed so hard for your love
In my heart I needed you
Then I looked up in the sky
And I'm thinking why oh why
These are all the many changes in my life
After all the caring and the laughter
No one else like you
I am not a preacher with a sermon
I'm so in love with you
'Cause to live without your love
Like the sun that shines above
Is the magic of the changes in my life
And I'll never forget your love
You and I
We were meant to be
Sweet as rain falling from the sky
You and I
These are all the many changes in my life
Listen to these words I want to give you
On our love so true
Don't forget I love you and I need you
I'll always be with you
So just look up in the sky
And you'll find out why oh why
These are all the many changes in my life
