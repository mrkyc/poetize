Oh, what's the matter baby?
Is the truth too hard to hear
Well, I think you know I'm not the one who lied
And now it's all behind us
And we both play out our lives
But the years don't change the way I feel inside
So we play the game out
Though it feels the same now
Are you missin' me?
Well now, baby just be aware
Of how much I still care
Ohhhh, I need your love
I gave to you
My heart and soul
Now I just need
To let you know
You're part of me
That I just can't let go (go, go)
Go (go, go)
Well, tell me somethin' baby
Is there still some thing inside
To remind you of the way it used to be?
And how the years have rolled by
Still there's somethin' I must say
No one ever could have loved you more than me
