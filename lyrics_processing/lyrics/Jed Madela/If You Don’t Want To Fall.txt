I could write a thousand songs
I could cite a thousand reasons we belong
I could choose the perfect words
They'd still be better left unheard

I could say a thousand prayers
I could weave a thousand lies to make you care
I could live my life for you, I could even die for you
Anything you'd ask me to, I'd do

But if you don't want to fall for me
You don't want to feel the need to be with me at all
Then there's nothing else I could ever do
No words I could say to you to get me through the wall
If you don't want to fall

If you just say it to my face
Then maybe I could change and mend my broken ways
But everything is without use
If life is living without you
Tell me what am I supposed to do

If you don't want to fall for me
You don't want to feel the need to be with me at all
Then there's nothing else I could ever do
No words I could say to you to get me through the wall
If you don't want to fall

Nothing's ever worth anything in my life no more
No one's gonna make me feel just like before
Nothing's gonna work, no one's ever ever gonna do
'Cause there's no one else but you

But if you don't want to fall for me
You don't want to feel the need to be with me at all
Then there's nothing else I could ever do
No words I could say to you to get me through the wall
If you don't want to fall for me
You don't want to feel the need to be with me at all
And then there's nothing else I could ever do
No words I could say to you to get me through the wall
If you don't want to fall
