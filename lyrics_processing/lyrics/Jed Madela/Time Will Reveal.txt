To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that
You're the apple of my eye girl
Fulfillment of my dreams
Time, will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I tell you I love you
But you won't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do
