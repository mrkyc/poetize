But what a time to be alive
Sadly some friends disappeared
It's never been like this before
It feels like we're at war
So I wonder who's gonna decide
If we can do the Auld Lang Syne
I wish that I could do what I like
With this family of mine
We're going out of our minds
So what are we to do
About your FaceTimes and Zooms?
There's a room inside my mind
And it's always here for you
Nothing's gonna stop Christmas...
No chance
You can't take away our season
Like you can't take away the wine
(Santa's on his sleigh
But now he's two metres away)
The people gonna need something to believe in
After a year of being in
(We've got our wish list
You can't stop Christmastime)

Stacks of sanitiser will do fine
I guess you do your shopping online
The High Street lights are out
There's nobody about
So where will we all be
Come this time next year?
I know you'll be with me
And I'll be here
Nothing's gonna take Christmas...
You can't take away our season
Like you can't take away the wine
(Santa's on his sleigh
But now he's two metres away)
The people gonna need something to believe in
After a year of being in
(We've got our wish list
You can't stop Christmastime)
Why oh why are we all waiting?
The whole damn world anticipating
Beyond boredom, past frustration
The planet's locked in what if's and maybe's
You can't take away our season
Like you can't take away the wine
(Let's lie to Santa Claus
Tell him it's Nineteen Eighty-Four)
The people gonna need something to believe in
After a year of being in
We've all missed this
So here's our wish list
