Me with the floor show kicking with your torso
Boys getting high and the girls even more so
Wave your hands if you're not with the man
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
I got (funk), you got (soul)
We got everybody
I've got the gift gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl, every man (hoo-hoo, hoo-ooo)
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop DJ
'Cause you're keeping me up all night

Singing in the classes, music for your masses
Give no head no backstage passes
Have a proper giggle I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mic, I rock the mic (Right)
You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl but your best friend can
It's time to move your body
You might also like
I don't wanna be sleazy, baby just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock (rock) DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop) DJ (DJ)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock (rock) DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop) DJ (DJ)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night

Pimping ain't easy, most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimping ain't easy
But if you're selling it (selling it, selling it)
It's alright
Come on

I don't wanna rock (rock) DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop) DJ (DJ)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock (rock) DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop) DJ (DJ)
