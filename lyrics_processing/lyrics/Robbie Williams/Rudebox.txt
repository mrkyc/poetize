Do the rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Do the rudebox
Shake your rudebox
(Rude Box, Rude Box)

Okay, then back to basics
Grab your shell toes and your fat laces
A little hand clap for some funk faces
And make your body move in the following places
Goes up your back and then down your spine
And when it hits your head...
Okay, then back to bass-heads
Dance like you just won at the special Olympics
I got the rudebox off the back of a spaceship
So sick I just had to take it
The R.U.D.E.B.O.X
Up yer jacksy, split yer kecks
Sing a song to Semtex
Pocket full of Durex, body full of Mandrex
Are we gonna have sex? (Yes)
Will you wear your knee socks? (Oh)
Back to the rudebox
You might also like
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop
I've got one design and that's to funk you to the top
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find
I got one design and that's to bump you till you drop

Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?

Okay, then back to spaceship
Take both pills, fuck the matrix
Jack those Jills, shake your Playtex
Rock 3 stripes, not the Asics
A.D.I.D.A.S
Old school 'cause it's the best (Yes)
T.K. Maxx cost less (Yes)
Jackson looks a mess (Bless)
Okay, then what to do
If you try to jack me I'll rudebox you
If you rudebox me, I'll rudebox your whole crew
'Cause it's what I do, ain't that right, boo? (True)
I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
'Cause the sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this (You did it like that)
I love it when you double clap, clap
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop
I've got one design and that's to funk you to the top
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find
I got one design and that's to bump you till you drop

Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?

Okay, then check the tan line
Make your body shake like you're stood on a landmine
Call me on my mobile, not the landline
And jack the mainline at the same time
Okay, this is what we do
Got a jam so fresh it's nice for you
Okay, give it what you got
And dial 808 for the bass to drop
Okay, then what's the fracas
Grab your cardy, your lead hat and your bus pass
You don't sweat much for a fat lass
Grab your rudebox 'cause your box is righteous
Okay, bum rush the show
I got high speed dubbing on my stereo
And all the tunes in the box are the cherrio
I know I told you before, did you hear me though? (Did you hear me though?)
Got this double fantasy where we just never stop
I've got one design and that's to funk you to the top
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find
I got one design and that's to bump you till you drop

Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox, do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
