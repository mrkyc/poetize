Yeah

God gave me the sunshine
Then showed me my lifeline
I was told it was all mine
Then I got laid on the ley line
What a day, what a day
And your Jesus really died for me
Then Jesus really tried for me

UK and entropy
I feel like it's fucking me
Wanna feed off the energy
Love living like a deity
What a day, one day
And your Jesus really died for me
I guess Jesus really tried for me

Bodies in the bodhi tree
Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family
Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery
And that's the way it's gonna be
You might also like
All we've ever wanted is to look good naked
Hope that someone can take it
God save me rejection from my reflection
I want perfection

Praying for the rapture
'Cause it's stranger getting stranger
And everything's contagious
It's the modern middle ages
All day every day
And if Jesus really died for me
Then Jesus really tried for me

Bodies in the bodhi tree
Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family
Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery
And that's the way it's gonna be

All we've ever wanted is to look good naked
Hope that someone can take it
God save me rejection from my reflection
I want perfection
Yeah

Bodies in the bodhi tree
Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family
Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery
Bodies in the bodhi tree
Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family
Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery
And that's the way it's gonna be

All we've ever wanted is to look good naked
Hope that someone can take it (Someone can take it)
God save me rejection from my reflection
I want perfection

Jesus didn't die for you (Jesus didn't die for you)
What do you want? (I want perfection)
Jesus didn't die for you (Jesus didn't die for you)
What are you on? Oh no (Bodies on fire)
(Jesus didn't die for you) Ooh-oh
(Jesus didn't die for you)
