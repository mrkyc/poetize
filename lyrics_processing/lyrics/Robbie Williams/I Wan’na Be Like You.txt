I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle V.I.P
I reached the top and I had to stop
And that's what bothering me

I want to be a man, man-cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
I'm tired of monkeying around

Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be human, too

Don't try to kid me, man-cub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream's come true

Now give me the secret, man-cub
Come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you
You might also like
Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be human, too

Now I'm the king of the swingers
The jungle V.I.P
I've reached the top and had to stop
Cause that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
We're tired of monkeying around

Swing to the left, swing to the right
Put your hands up if you loving life
(Rob, I'm loving life
I'm loving life, Olly
Oh, I'm loving life)
Swing to the left, swing to the right
Put your hands up if you feeling nice
(Feeling nice, feeling nice
Oh, feeling nice)
Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like someone like you
Can learn to be like someone like you
Can learn to be like someone like you
(I wanna be like you, you know
