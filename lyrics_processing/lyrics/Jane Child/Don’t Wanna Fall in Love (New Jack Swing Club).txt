I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love (Fall in)
Ain't no personal thing (Fall in)
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
Ain't, ain't no, ain't, ain't no
Ain't, ain't no, ain't, ain't no
Ain't, ain't no, ain't, ain't no
Ain't, ain't no, ain't

Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you have got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end

You, y-you
You, you
You (The knife feel good), y-you (The knife feel good)
You (The knife feel good)
You might also like
You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Woo baby, you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it to you one more time, boy

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end, baby, yeah
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end

I learned something about myself
Last night with you I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby
Baby, yeah
Woo, woo
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end, baby, yeah
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end, baby, yeah

I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to fall in love
Please
No, I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love
Please
Ain't no personal thing
Last night
