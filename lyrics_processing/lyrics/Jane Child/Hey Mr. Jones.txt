Nobody knows me like the monkey on my back
He's got control now, and I'll never get it back
It's a brutal attraction, like a moth to a deadly flame
It's a knee-jerk reaction, fall to my knees and beg
Just a still little voice, just a matter of choice
Just the mention of your name
Did it have to be me? Why did it have to be me?
The hunter is the game

Hey Mr. Jones, you led me on, hey hey
Hey Mr. Jones, you did me wrong
Hey hey hey hey hey

He'll never leave me, and he'd rather see me dead
He has deceived me, I'm in way over my head
You appear every morning, and you scream when I'm trying to sleep
You come on without warning, watch laughing as I bleed
Why you fucking with me? Let me go, I can't breathe
Yes, the desperate have no shame
My insatiable need, my uncontrollable greed
The pleasure is the pain

Hey Mr. Jones, you led me on, hey hey
Hey Mr. Jones, you did me wrong, hey hey
Hey Mr. Jones, look what you did, hey hey
Hey Mr. Jones, I'm just a kid
Hey hey hey hey hey
