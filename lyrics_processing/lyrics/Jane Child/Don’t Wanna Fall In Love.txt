Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you have got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing?
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end (Baby)

You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Woo, baby, you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it you one more time, boy

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end, baby
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end
You might also like
I learned something about myself (Last night)
Last night with you, I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end

No

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby, yeah)
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I'll fight you to the end
