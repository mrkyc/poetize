Much stranger than fiction
No danger
It's easy to ignore it
Hide your head
And don't look for it
Ain't no way to run a universe
Someone's holding
The strings of the purse
Got his finger on the trigger
Will he pull it?
Do you figure
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Who's winning the human race?
Who's running?
Who's setting the pace?
Makes my blood boil in defiance
I fall to my knees
And pray for guidance

It's pouring
The old man is snoring
Went to bed with a hole in his head
And didn't wake up in the morning
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Let the world see
Let yourself be
Love each other
Just like you and me
Something's got to give
Better sooner than later
Yeah, hey
Oh, no
Somewhere, someone
Somehow, someday
We will find a way
Somewhere, someone
Somehow, someday
Yeah, hey
Oh, ho
Oh, no
Who's winning the human race?
Who's running?
(Who's running?)
Who's setting the pace?
Yeah
Makes my blood boil
In defiance
(Defiance)
I fall to my knees and pray
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
Welcome to, to the real world
