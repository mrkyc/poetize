Your deepest fear bout growin' old
The loneliest night you ever spent
The angriest letter you never sent
The girl you swore you'd never leave
The one you kissed on New Year's Eve
The sweetest dream you had last night
Your darkest hour, your hardest fight
I wanna know you (Don: I wanna know you)
Like I know myself
I'm waiting for you (Don: I'm waiting for you)
There ain't no one else
I wanna know you, inside out
I wanna dig down deep
I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time
I wanna know you're mine
You know there ain't no doubt
I wanna know you inside out
The saddest song you ever heard
The most you said with just one word
The loneliest prayer you every prayed
The truest vow you ever made
What makes you laugh, what makes you cry
What makes you mad, what gets you by
Your highest high, your lowest low
These are the things I wanna know
