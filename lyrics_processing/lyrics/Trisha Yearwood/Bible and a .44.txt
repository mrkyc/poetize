He had a southern drawl like a red-bone hound
And every word he said was my favorite sound
He'd be the last one off if the ship went down
The kinda man it feels good to be around
The kinda man it feels good to be around

He had hair as white as a cotton field
And he could spin you a story like a wagon wheel
All heart and soul and made of steel
Lord, I miss that man and I always will
I miss that man and I always will

He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more

He said, "Take what you've got and do the best you can
The best thing you'll ever own is a piece of land"
And he knew his like the back of his hand
He was something else, my old man
He was something else, my old man
You might also like
He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make' em like that no more
No, they just don't make 'em like that no more

I saw him strum this thing every chance he could
And he left it to me like he said he would
And if you ask me why it sounds so good
It's 'cause I'm holdin' more than strings and wood
I'm holdin' more than strings and wood

He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more
