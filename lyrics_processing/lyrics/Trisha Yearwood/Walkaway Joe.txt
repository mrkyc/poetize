Mama told her baby, "Girl, take it real slow"
Girl told her mama, "Hey, I really gotta go
He's waitin' in the car"
Mama said, "Girl, you won't get far"

Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh, if she could have only seen

But fate's got cards that it don't wanna show

And that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

Now just a little while into Abilene
Pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waitin' in the car
Underneath the Texaco star
You might also like
She only wanted love, didn't bargain for this
She can't help but love him for the way he is
She's only seventeen
And there ain't no reasoning

So she'll ride this ride as far as it can go

'Cause that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence, she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arms
But she'll just keep reachin' on

For the cold hard truth revealed what it had known

That boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boy was a walkaway Joe
All he was was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
Ooh, he was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
