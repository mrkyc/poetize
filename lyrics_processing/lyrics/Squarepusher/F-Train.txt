The last stage of a send up of a gut feeling doubtful
Touch down to one, two forty Fortran crowbars shouting in the cellar
But, no, maybe it's too much to wear
Yes, considering the fear inside the ride
Starting to die, baby, I don't wanna cry anymore
Yet, anyway, we escape quicker than mechanical deaths, rejuvenated
For transparent transport subjected to interpolated states
Sadly gated, you weigh against all sidechains
Fighting the crush of silence of the right hand mantle, cranium allegedly delayed
Uranium burning fabric off our backs until we can no longer see
Plus, plus the fact that no one's left meaning we're less than apparent
At a rate of complex numbers transpiring to retire rats racing
Time stranded in a stretch predicted yet unfounded
In polynomial calculations set to have misled the walking dead
Yet, on awakening, we may reflect death as a tool to give credibility
To reflectivity falling in slow motion 'cause we're pushed to the last step

Axis discrepancy indicates hexagons beyond control anomaly
Mutilation colony reflects no triangular energy

Components one and two, tubular reality systems in question
Multiply senseless consent of inspection prior to combustion
Eternal conduction experiments once supposed
Disfigured immortal beings wander like stoked navigators
Pretend multifunctioning externals
Yes, we've cracked the menu, sitting like forks
Point at the blue corpse overlord
Splitting opportunities, broken like back doors
Ask why I don't reply, while shoulders overlooked
But retain guises suitable for generating consent
Fooled, we're none the wiser
Baud rate increases as metallic apparitions manifest
Through a thousand yard stare look sideways into infinite parallel ports
Headlong into one another, escaping, velocity becomes a matter of time
Compression thresholds as yet another tectonic secret unfolds
Third degree burns hover one moment above a Faraday cage
Exploding in slow motion, components rated electrolytic
Capacity suffocated in ozone
Waveforms communicate a paralysed process
Submerged calculus offers transient traces of illusion

Axis discrepancy indicates hexagons beyond control anomaly
Mutilation colony reflects no triangular energy
Asynchronous matter avoided by a diagram invisibility
Subtle methods symmetry uncovered a diagonal telemetry

Catastrophes deep frozen, remaining moments horizontal like a stone
Endless slowing down till actions turn sidelong
Still inverted the regressions, lessons unlearnt
Inertia presides over burnt modernist strides
Looking glass to stones thrown
Fractions later, swan songs colliding unpopular
Finding incubated micro command shells, acoustic arguments no longer specified
Yet, this time, freedom transpires wide open deserts
Yet access denied, sinking in like rotten requests from perished minds
Affirmations become distant light sources pinpointing curved fragments
Mysterious elements time stretch incubators, illuminates strange tangents
Electrocution integrated into life on stretcher beds
Conceived by airborne sickness
Surrounded cold avenues of silence
Getting to grips, preparation for long falls
Staircases previously seen only by the dead seem to persist in times of denied states
Yet returning to errors like fools locking doors
Random disintegration occurs as we await falling forwards forever
Axis discrepancy indicates hexagons beyond control anomaly
Mutilation colony reflects no triangular energy
Asynchronous matter avoided by a diagram invisibility
