Love is on the line
When the same mistakes are made
Over and over and over and over again
Love is on the line
When jealousy fades
And we no longer look back when walking away

I know we still believe in love
I can't believe we're giving up

Oh, I wish that we were strong enough
To remember how we were before we tried
Oh, the night is never long enough
To forget about the lonely nights we cried
When our love was on the line

All we ever did was fight
It no longer matters who's wrong or who's right
And after all this time, nobody wins
There's only the memory of what we have been

I know we still believe in love
I can't believe we're giving up

To forget about the lonely nights we cried

I can't believe it, baby
I can't believe it's true
I can't believe it, baby
I can't believe it's happening to me and you
I can't believe it, baby
I can't believe we're through

Oh, I wish that we were strong enough
To remember how we were before we tried
Oh, the night is never long enough
To forget about the lonely nights we cried, oh
Oh, I wish that we were strong enough
To remember how we were before we tried (We tried, before we tried)
Oh, the night is never long enough
To forget about the lonely nights we cried, yeah

I can't believe it, baby (I can't believe it)
I can't believe it's true (I can't believe it)
I can't believe it, baby
I can't believe it's happening to me and you (I can't believe it)
I can't believe it, baby (I can't believe it)
