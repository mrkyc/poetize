Play with me, do what you want with me
You won't see me putting up a fight
Look at me, look what you've done to me
Never let me go after tonight

This feeling that I feel
I don't want to hide

Candlelight is how I like to see you say my name
In the darkness, it's not the same
So come and kiss me before the sun goes down
'Cause in the darkness it's not the same, it's not the same

Promise me you'll wake up next to me
A lifetime, forever and a day
Stay with me, don't let our memories
Take from us the love we have today

This feeling that I feel
I don't want to hide
