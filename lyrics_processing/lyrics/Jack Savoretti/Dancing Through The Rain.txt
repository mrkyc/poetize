The walls are closing in
The clock is frozen on the wall
The noise outside is deafening
Shoes lie dusty in the hall
Who's gonna save us?
Are we puppets in a game?
Will the dice of life decide for us
Or shall we take the blame?

So close the door and come with me
Run your fingers through my hair
Let me rest upon your shoulder
On that sweatshirt that you wear

Turn the music up and sing with me
Hold me tight and say my name
Hide me from the storm outside
Let's dance right through the rain

Dancing through the rain
Dancing through the rain
Us against this hurricane
Let's dance right through the rain
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Oh, the water is coming in
And who is at the helm?
Now the waves are towering over us
Are we drowning in the swell?
If I dare to say I'm scared out loud
Will the walls start breaking in?
Will I lose my grip, lose myself?
Am I dreaming or living?

So close the door and come with me
Run your fingers through my hair
Let me rest upon your shoulder
On that sweatshirt that you wear

Turn the music up and sing with me
Hold me tight and say my name
Hide me from the storm outside
Let's dance right through the rain

Dancing through the rain
Dancing through the rain
Us against this hurricane
Let's dance right through the rain
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Us against this hurricane
Let's dance right through the rain
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
One, two, three
The angry clouds are lifting now
Do we dare to look outside?
The world is stripped and broke
The earth is gaping wide
As I hold your hand and wander
Through the wreckage left behind
The sun shines on my face again
There's hope we couldn't find

So close the door and come with me
Run your fingers through my hair
Light the fire and talk to me
Your words will lay me bare

Turn the music up, sing with me
Hold me tight and say my name
Your arms are home to me
Let's dance right through the rain

Dancing through the rain
Dancing through the rain
Us against this hurricane
Let's dance right through the rain
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Us against this hurricane
