I remember dancing in the pouring rain
Calling you up just to say your name
We felt like lovers, we felt like lovers
Reaching for your hand when you pull away
Every time I'd leave, you'd beg me to stay
We felt like lovers, living life under covers

We'd sail through love and war
We'd fight for everything and more
To save the night, the night was all we saw
That's what the darkness is for

Look at the time and the time that it's taken
Is this a love like the love we were making
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
When we were lovers, when we were lovers

Two hearts beating in stereo
Never needed maps to tell us where to go
We followed the stars, but they took us too far

We'd sail through love and war
We'd fight for everything and more
To save the night, the night was all we saw
That's what the darkness is for

Look at the time and the time that it's taken
Is this a love like the love we were making
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
Giving it all was everything we were giving
Living for each other was why we were living
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
Living life under covers
Here we are slowly falling apart
Every broken promise is a broken heart

Look at the time and the time that it's taken
Is this a love like the love we were making
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
When we were lovers, when we were lovers

Giving it all was everything we were giving
Living for each other was why we were living
When we were lovers, when we were lovers
Living life under covers
It felt like love, love, felt like love, love
Oooh oooh, yes
