Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, oh, oh

Whiskey tango
From the top
I will blow your mind
I just can't stop
Burn a candle
In my name
You can bury me
With all my shame

The poison of sadness
The breaking of the heart
The echo of madness
Tearing us apart
Oh, it's tearing us apart

I've been falling for the day (falling for)
Like I'm falling for the night (I've been running from)
Running from the darkness
Till I'm running from the light (I've been falling for)
I've been falling for the day
Like I'm falling for the night
Trying to make it better, but I just can't get it right
No, I just can't get it right

Do you remember
All of my words?
How I promised you
What you deserved?
I'm a liar
I'm a thief
But I need you more
Than you need me

The poison of sadness
The breaking of the heart
The echo of madness
Tearing us apart
Oh, it's tearing us apart

I've been falling for the day (falling for)
