Like the first snow of December
Like a photograph helps to remember
I have always, in my own way
Tried to live each and every day

Lookin' back at all my memories with so much joy
Summers spent in Italy when I was a boy
Looking back, I know I'll never let go
Maybe it's just how I feel tonight
Maybe it's the time of the year

I know I've always said, "I'm sorry"
But I'm sorry more than ever now
Sorry more than ever
I know I've always said, "I love you"
But I love you more than ever now
Love you more than ever
I love you more than ever
(Hey)
(Hey)

I still taste the first time that we kissed
Hiding underneath my raincoat, we found happiness
No one could see us, no one cared
It was only you and me back then
Only you and me back then

So much purpose, so much feeling
Looking back, I know I'll never let go
Maybe it's just how I feel tonight
Maybe it's the time of the year
