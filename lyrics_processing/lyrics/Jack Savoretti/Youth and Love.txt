Last night I found a photograph
Like a ghost from the past
Showed me who I was, not who I am
The greatest moments never last
Why does life move so fast?
I'll never understand, hey

I miss the broken hearts, the summers in the sun
They always say that love and youth are wasted on the young
But I remember every one
When our love feels more like hatred, how do we save it?
The only way we're gonna make it is if we remember the feeling of
Youth and love

Now every line upon my face
Puts me back into my place
Whenever I start acting like a child
I guess we'll never be the same
It's who we were just yesterday
Loving on the line, our love was wild

I miss the broken hearts, the summers in the sun
They always say that love and youth are wasted on the young
But I remember every one
When our love feels more like hatred, how do we save it?
The only way we're gonna make it is if we remember the feeling
When our love feels more like hatred, how do we save it?
The only way we're gonna make it is if we remember the feeling of
Youth and love
