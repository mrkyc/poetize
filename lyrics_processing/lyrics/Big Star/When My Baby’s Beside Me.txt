Don't need to talk to my doctor
Don't need to talk to my shrink
Don't need to hide behind no locked door
I don't need to think

'Cause when my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know
When my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know

Read all my books and talked about
Listen to my radio
Been in school and dropped right out
Tryin' to find what I didn't know

But when my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know
When my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know

Don't need to talk to my doctor
Don't need to talk to my shrink
Don't need to hide behind no locked door
I don't need to think

'Cause when my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know
When my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know
When my baby's beside me, I don't worry
When my baby's beside me all I know
When my baby's beside me, I don't worry
