O my soul, mama
I lose control
Go ahead and shake if you wanna
And I'll never know, come on
You know it's alright
We've got all night
You're driving me mad, now
You shouldn't do that
Gonna to get on up
And drink till we drop, hey

You're really a nice girl
And I think you're the most
And when we're together
I feel like a boss

Trying to see you
I'd knock off your doors
Dying to see you
I'm down on the floor

I can't get a license
To drive in my car
But I don't really need it
If I'm a big star
You might also like
Trying to see you
I'd knock off your doors
Dying to see you
I'm down on the floor

Never you mind
Go on and have a good time

Never you mind, oh
So go on and have a good time
Yes, indeed

I can't get a license
To drive in my car
But I don't really need it
If I'm a big star

Trying to see you
I'd knock off your doors
Dying to see you
