Dance oh now all night
So wild when she's a mover
She's so wild
Draggin' fast we go
Ooh, I dig speed so good
It destroy her in the cruiser
It destroy her
She name was Marsha
Marsha the name
She look like a dove now
And when she smile like crocodile
She tells the man go to hell
And where that's at is where I'm coming from
So wild
Ooh, she's a mover
She like devil you know
She finds herself in Catholic school
So wild
Don't you know she's so wild
She name was Marsha
Marsha the name
She look like a dove now
And when she smile like crocodile
You might also likeShe's so wild
She's so wild
She's a mover
She's so wild
