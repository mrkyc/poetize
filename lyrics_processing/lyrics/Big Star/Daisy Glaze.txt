Sad about you
Not going home
What's to do
You better not leave me here
Better not leave me here
Ooh, I want you here
How can you leave me here
I lie in a stream
And floating fine
Receiving things
In my beautiful mind
Sometimes, oh sometimes
Sometimes, so sublime
Lover, yes I am
Over you know I am, whoo
Now I'm in a bar
That's gotta be where they are
Gonna dance in the bar
They're going to fight on the floor
Faster than I can see
You might also likeNow I'm gonna score
Make for the door
Who is this whore?
Soon be beggin' drags
And I'm thinking, "Christ
Nullify my life"
You're gonna die, my my, ooh
You're gonna die
Yes, you're gonna die
You're gonna die
