Don't like to see your face
Don't like to hear you talk at all
I could be with Ann but I'd just get bored
Can't even bring myself to call

And I don't want to see you now
'Cause I know what you like
And I can't go back to that

Whatever's all the same
Now there's nobody to know
And I can't recall, recall your name
All I can say is so

And I don't want to see you now
'Cause I know what you like
And I can't go back to that

Your life is white
And I don't think I like
You hanging around
You might also like
Don't like to see your face
Don't like to hear you talk at all
I could be with Ann but I'd just get bored
Can't even bring myself to call

And I don't want to see you now
'Cause I know what you like
