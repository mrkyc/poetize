Waiting
Waiting
Waiting

I've got a brown eyed lover
On the other side of town
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
She's got me upside tongue-tied
Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)

Well, I don't know
I can't tell
Will this last
Or just come and go?
It came so fast
And my feet feel cold
But my mind is for sure
And my heart remains
Oh, she's got everything you want
Wardrobe bought at the thrift shop
And all my friends adore her
She reminds me of my mother
She wonders how my day went
And don't care about my paychecks
Well, I don't wanna keep my baby waiting

Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)

Oh, let me think
What if she finds a man
Who's got so much more time
For her than me on his hands?
That don't make sense
Why would she wait so long
Just to run away?
Oh, she's got everything you want
Let's me pick the restaurants
And all my friends adore her
And I can still afford her
She wishes I'd stop worrying
About where my next paycheck is
Well, I don't wanna keep my baby waiting!
