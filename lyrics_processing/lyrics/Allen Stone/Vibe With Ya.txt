Somebody drank all my Carlo
Somebody stole my glass, oh
But if I hear "shot time," roll out the Phillies, it's
It's gonna kick my ass
You said you're here with your boyfriend
Then point him out him to me
Because nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
If your boyfriend ain't in the vicinity

Oh, I take two sips
Lick that liquor off my lips
I slip into rhythm with your hips
And I'll vibe with ya
Hey, vibe with ya
Yeah, I'll vibe with ya
Hey, vibe with ya
I'll vibe ya
Hey, vibe with you now, vibe

It's three o'clock in the morning
And all of my friends are gone
But you're still up on the dance floor
We're dancing to my favorite song
You're just a Black Magic woman
And you're just another Roxanne
Oh, but as long as you're up on the dance floor
I'm gonna vibe the best I can
