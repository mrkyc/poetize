Acting like it neva happened and we were nothing
(and) I don't even need yo' love...
Now and then I think of when we were together
How you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But...felt so lonely in your company...
That was love and it's an ache I still remember...
(Oh-oh -whoa-whoa-oooh....! )
(Well) You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Resignation to the end, always the end (Well-well) ...
When we found that we could not make sense
You said that we would still be friends
I'll admit that I was glad when it was over... (Huh!)
You didn't have to cut me off
Make-out like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
Ya' treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number...
I don't even need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Me believing it was always something that I'd done...
(that -I do-ya'-day-baby)
But I don't wanna live that way
Readin' into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
An' I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know!! ...
You didn't have to cut me off
Make-out like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
Ya' treat me like a stranger and it feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number...
I don't even need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know (yeah)
That I used to know...
(Oh.. Yeah ...)
That I used to know...
(Hey...)
That I used to know...
(Yeah...yeah-yeah)
That I used to know...
