I'm looking for freedom
I've gotta get free
You'll give me that feeling
It's rushing through me

Amazing, vibration, I'm chasing the power I need
Captive, reactive, I'm asking to show it to me

Cause I've been searching around, turning every stone
Spun the world upside down, I can't leave it alone
And everyday when I rise, you break me from my chain
Supernatural high gets me out my way

I'm looking for freedom
I've gotta get free
You'll give me that feeling
It's rushing through me

Get free, baby
Die young, honey
Drink up, baby
Make love to me
Get free, baby
Die young, honey
Drink up, baby
Make love to me
