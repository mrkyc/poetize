I should of, would of, could of loved her better
She could of loved me worse
Well, I never, ever gave her the love that she deserved
She never wanted much

I wish I could fly right back to her
I wish that time would die and I could hold her
I wish that I could go back and change it all
'Cause, all she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was

Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you, are you gonna be faithful?

I better, let her, get herself away from me
But I know I won't let go
She's gotta, lotta living far away from me
With somebody who's faithful

I wish I could fly right back to her
I wish that time would die, and I could hold her
I wish that I could go back and change it all
'Cause, all she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was

Are you gonna be faithful?

All I know
If you give love, love it will go
'Cause all she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was
All she ever said, all she ever said was
Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you gonna be faithful?
Are you, are you gonna be faithful?
