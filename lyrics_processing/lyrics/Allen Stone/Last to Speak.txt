I know exactly where we're headed
Science won't give God any credit
And the church says
"As long the prophet said it
It's good enough for the church to be fed it"
There's four thousand different interpretations
We disagree from Genesis to Revelations
We need to get to the core of the situation

Your meth, crack and heroin
They are the kings of the underprivileged kingdom

And, yes, I believe everybody's got their vices
But the crisis that provoked me to write this
Is I know the good I should do
But I always do the opposite

So I should be the last to speak, yeah
I should be the last to speak 
I should be the last to
