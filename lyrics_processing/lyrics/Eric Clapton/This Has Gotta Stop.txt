Hmm

This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door

I knew that something was going on wrong
When you started laying down the law
I can't move my hands
I break out in sweat
I wanna cry
Can't take it anymore

This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer

I've been around
Long, long time
Seen it all
And I'm used to being free
I know who I am
Try to do what's right
So lock me up and throw away the key

This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Thinkin' of my kids
What's left for them
And then what's coming down the road
The light in the tunnel
Could be the southbound train
Lord, please help them with their load

This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door
This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door
