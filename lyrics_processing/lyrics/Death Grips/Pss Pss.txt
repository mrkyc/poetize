I saw you doing peace signs with the F.B.I
Might've tried that in the future before so don't lie
All dead dogs go to heaven cause dumb bitches let them in (In)
They're just racist and they wanna fuck
God chills out cause she doesn't touch
This is where I don't come in, this is where I have been maybe
Have a sad cum, baby (Beh, beh, beh, beh)

Cuh, cuh
Beh, beh, beh, beh

I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip (Cuh, cuh)
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip (Cuh, cuh)
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip (Beh, beh, beh, beh)
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh)
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh)
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS (Beh, beh, beh, beh)

My shit's been retarded since beginning of time
I'm up in your party like sickest one line
I'm the only thing ever on my mind
You're one of those things I never rewind (Ah)
I'm coming out your pocket like carving pools with my jewels
I'm throwing heebie jeebies like iTunes
The cars that go boom, these are my gold bars melted on spoons
My junk hits like martial law, you nod like, "True"
You might also like
Beh, beh, beh, beh

I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip (Cuh, cuh, beh, beh, beh, beh)
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh)
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh, beh, beh, beh, beh)
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh)

Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh
Beh, beh, beh, beh

(Cuh, cuh)
If I were her and she was him we would go and fuck ourselves again and again (Cuh, cuh)
Life is very dangerous and it wants to rearrange us like your friends, like the end (Cuh, cuh)
Show me into Target and I'll show you how I bought it with my mind in my mind (Cuh, cuh)
Touch it out in the parking lot, fuck me while the whole world watch us waste our time (Beh, beh, beh, beh)
I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip (Cuh, cuh, beh, beh, beh, beh)
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS (Cuh, cuh)
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
(I piss on your face like I'm-)
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS (Beh, beh, beh, beh)
(You lick up the place like you're-)
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS
(I piss on your face like I'm-)
(Cuh, cuh)

(Cuh, cuh)
(Beh, beh, beh, beh)
