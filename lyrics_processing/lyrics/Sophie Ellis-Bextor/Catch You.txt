The morning paper, look in the mirror
On your keychain, or in the coffee spoon
On your shirt sleeve, in the flat-screen
In your mailbox, I'm breathing over you

Come on, baby, when will you see
That you and I were meant to be?
And now I got my target on track
Baby, you should know that I'm so good at that

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you
Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you

In your top drawer, in your cheque book
On your cellphone, by your easy-chair
In the next room, behind the curtain
Can't escape me, I'm watching everywhere

Come on, baby, when will you see
That you and I were meant to be?
And now I got my target on track
Baby, you should know that I'm so good at that

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you
Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you

Why waste your energy?
No point in fighting
Let you heart surrender to your destiny
And this world's not big enough
For you to hide for long
In this game of hide and seek
There's nowhere left to run

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you
Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you
Catch you, catch you
Catch you, catch you
Catch you, catch you
