I used to change my accent, change my stance
My phone number, the way I dance
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets
But I won't change you, honey, you're for keeps
I used to think I had to change the way I am
To feel better, to get a man
But once I stopped trying, I fell for you
You fell for me, so I'll stay the same for you

Oh, yeah, I know that I'm not perfect, baby
Oh, yeah, it's no reason to go crazy
Oh, yeah, boy, you can always count on me
For better or for worse, I will always put you first

Now that I have found you
You've changed my life
'Cause you're the one who showed me
I have everything right
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
So don't change me and I won't change you

I used to change my style like I changed my mind
I tried to change a tyre, but I'm not that way inclined
Tried to change my figure my diet too
I'll still change my underwear, if that's O.K. with you

Oh, yeah, the world can sometimes make you feel bad
Oh, yeah, but don't forget the things you have
Oh, yeah, boy, you can always count on me
In sickness and in health, baby, always be yourself

Now that I have found you
You've changed my life
'Cause you're the one who showed me
I have everything right
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
So don't change me and I won't change you
And I won't change, and I won't change you
And I won't change, and I won't change you
And I won't change, and I won't change you

Now that I have found you
You've changed my life
You're the one who showed me
I have everything right
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
So don't change me and I won't change you
Now that I have found you
You've changed my life
'Cause you're the one who showed me

So don't change me and I won't change you

And I won't change, and I won't change you
So don't change me and I won't change you
Now that I have found you
And I won't change, and I won't change you
You've changed my life
