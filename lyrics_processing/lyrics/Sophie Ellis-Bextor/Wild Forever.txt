There's a look in your eye
That says you want to be carefree tonight
Just like in days gone by
When we were wild
Darling, I'm not so uptight
And I can still put my mind on the flip side
'Cause I'm not so resigned to a mundane life

Why be so ordinary, why just conform?
Let's rip the night in half and forget it all
So keep the engine running under the stars
I feel release is coming, tonight it's ours

(Running wild) We shouldn't fight the way we feel
(Wild forever) When it comes from somewhere real
(Running wild) A garden always in full bloom
(Wild forever) That's how I think of me and you
(Running wild) And if escape is what we need
(Wild forever) When it comes to you and me
We should just surrender
Stay wild forever

It's like a secret we hold
And the adventures we go on are untold
You've got to lose yourself
To find your way back home
