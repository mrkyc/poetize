We're gonna play a game, just you and me
You never should be won so easily
Your eyes are on the prize, I'm worth the wait
Don't need to know the end
'Cause, darling

Magic stays where myth remains
I'm under your spell, don't release me

Never give the game away
Try to keep me entertained, baby
Don't make it too easy, leave something
For me and my imagination
We're a possibility when you make it hard for me, baby
I'm not in a hurry, leave something
For me and my imagination
