No, I can't get out, trapped inside of it
I won't let go, pain keeps driving it
I only hope and pray that I can make it pay
Keep pushing it, I keep pushing on

I did the best I could
I learned to sacrifice
I tried to make it work
This time away has done me good, it's a change
From you

Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I've got myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)
Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I've got myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)

No, I can't turn back, I'm sick and tired of it
When love broke down, I rewire it
I'm only human, babe, you let the feeling fade
Keep pushing till I reach a higher ground

I tried to make it back
When every door was closed
Your love was all I had
I tried to make an honest man
Out of you

Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I've got myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)
Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I've got myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)

Wired to the sun like a laser beam
Power surge, come feel the energy
And I'm ready to shine and shine

Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I put myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)
Keep switching me off and on and off and on and off
(I put myself back together)
You've been gone too long, the only love is gone
(You thought I'd be free forever)
I put myself- I, I put myself- I put myself
Back together
Y-y-you thought I'd be- Y-y-you-you thought-
Y-y-you thought I'd be
Free forever
I put myself- I, I put myself- I put myself
Back together
Y-y-you thought I'd be- Y-y-you-you thought-
