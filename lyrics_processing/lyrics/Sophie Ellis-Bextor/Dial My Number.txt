I am your agenda
When you hope to find
I'm alone
A coward's way to speak your verse
A hidden message, broken words
I read out lines, but the truth may hurt
I am only killing time with you
You don't understand (You don't understand)
You don't know how I feel (You don't know how I feel)
And so for what it's worth (And so for what it's worth)
I wanna keep it real
If you dial my number
It's not enough
You can wait and wonder
If there's an us
And when it's dead on the line
Do you think the girl is mine?
You know I'm not falling under
I'm not in love
In the depths of your mind
You think I'll surrender
When you're lost at sea
I'm on land
It's only fair I set you right
Cause what we have won't see daylight
It's just for now, so enjoy the ride
I'm having fun killing time with you

Yeah, you can dream about it
But don't believe it's real at all
