You've forgotten we were strange
Guess somewhere we got cold
Now every little bird is tame
Their wings are clipped in gold
Fear puts your heart on ice
For some other rainy day
You'll only know that you're alive
When I melt the ice away

My life, my dreams, my everything is all yours, babe
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'Cause living only happens when you wake

If you go, if you stay
Sometimes better breaking baby, in the sun
Before it's gone
If you love, if you feel
If you wonder how this heaven could be real
Then let it run

Some might say ain't no sun without the rain
Like I knew, I knew yeah
Some might say nothing given, nothing gained
I guess that's true, how 'bout you, babe?

'Cause living only happens when you wake

If you go, if you stay
Sometimes better breaking baby, in the sun
Before it's gone
If you love, if you feel
If you wonder how this heaven could be real
Then let it run

'Cause I'd like, like to be somebody who
You'd take a chance on
I would take a chance on you every day
Like, like to be somebody who
You'd take a chance on
I would take a chance on you everyday
I got my summer sun
I'll take my love and run
I've got you, babe, oh, yeah
'Cause I need somebody's love
And half is not enough to make me stay
I've got you, babe
If you go, if you stay
Sometimes better breaking baby, in the sun
Before it's gone
If you love, if you feel
If you wonder how this heaven could be real
Then let it run
If you go, if you stay
If you go, if you stay
If you go, if you stay
