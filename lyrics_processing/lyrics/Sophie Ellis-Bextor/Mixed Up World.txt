(It's a mixed up world)
(It's a mixed up world)

I'm feeling all messed up
I have a voice inside my head, it says turn to the left
Then it says turn to the right
Don't want to bring you down
But I am really needing guidance now
What would you do within my shoes?

(Don't cry) I'm going crazy
(Stay high) I've never felt so low
(Don't hide) I want to turn and run
We've got to find a place to go

So when you're feeling kind of mixed up
Just remember it's a mixed up world
And if you're feeling life is just too tough
Just remember you're a real tough girl

I look around my life
And all I see is contradiction and a lack of faith
Cynicism rules the day
I know it has its place
But I am really needing guidance now
Reminding me I'm strong inside

(Don't cry) I know you love me
(Stay high) We'll make it through this time
(Don't hide) I want to feel the sun
We've got to start to take control

So when you're feeling kind of mixed up
Just remember it's a mixed up world
And if you're feeling life is just too tough
Just remember you're a real tough girl
(It's a mixed up world)
(It's a mixed up world)
(It's a mixed up world)

Why do I feel this pain?
Why has this world gone insane?
And if you're feeling kind of mixed up
Just remember it's a mixed up world
And if you're feeling life is just too tough
Just remember you're a real tough girl
So if you're feeling kind of mixed up
Just remember it's a mixed up world
And if you're feeling life is just too tough
Just remember you're a real tough girl
