You take my breath away
And yet you're all I'm breathing for
I always want that little bit more of what you do
And I still feel today
The way I felt the first time we kissed
You made me live, not simply exist
Broke like a clear view from out of the mist

I'd known you turned my life to up from down
Taken me from lost to found
Raised me up, and now I see how high we are
And every night before I sleep
I hope and pray you're mine to keep
It's all I can do to thank my lucky stars

The distance between us
'Cause close is never close enough
And there's a world beyond your touch
I want to climb inside of you
And see your heartbeat, your heartbeat

So now and here we are
Within a land that we're making our own
I can't believe how devotion has grown
And still it grows

We're not the first to fall so far
Won't be the last to give our hearts
But now it's me, and now it's you, we own this love
Sounding out the way I feel
Reminds me that this dream is real
All that I can do is thank my lucky stars

The distance between us
'Cause close is never close enough
And there's a world beyond your touch
I want to climb inside of you
And see your heartbeat, your heartbeat, your heartbeat

I've never felt like this before
Never felt this way before
Can't get close enough
Or stop myself from wanting more

The distance between us
'Cause close is never close enough
And there's a world beyond your touch
I want to climb inside of you
And see your heart
The distance between us
'Cause close is never close enough
And there's a world beyond your touch
I want to climb inside of you
