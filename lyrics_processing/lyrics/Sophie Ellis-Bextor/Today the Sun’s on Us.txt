I can see you're somewhere far away
Caught in another place
Where nothing's going right
Shouldn't worry about
The worst that could be
When you're here beside me
Don't look for troubled times
Now when everything is fine

So you need to fear the bad to see the good
And that's the thing you do
But don't let it spoil the view
Of what's around you

There's no rain, there's no storm
Though the blue sky makes you wonder
Don't you fear what will come, will come
And right now we're in the sun
Sure enough, seasons change
But don't let today get lost
'Cause today the sun's on us
Today, the sun's on us

You're so restless
Underneath the surface
Don't you think I notice
It's something you can't hide
When you're fighting with the tide

But you've got to let it go
And just accept the things you can't control
Don't let your shadow spoil the view
Of what's around you

There's no rain, there's no storm
Though the blue sky makes you wonder
Don't you fear what will come, will come
And right now we're in the sun
Sure enough, seasons change
But don't let today get lost
'Cause today the sun's on us

The years go by
Stars will rise and fall
Will you be by my side through it all?
There's no rain, there's no storm
Though the blue sky makes you wonder
Don't you fear what will come, will come
And right now we're in the sun
Sure enough, seasons change
But don't let today get lost
'Cause today the sun's on us
Today, the sun's on us
Today, the sun's on us
Today, the sun's on us
(Sure enough, seasons change)
But don't let today get lost
'Cause today the sun's on us
