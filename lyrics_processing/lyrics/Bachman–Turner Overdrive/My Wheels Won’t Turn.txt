Wherever his feet would tread
He asked me to El Paso
Said I could stay on his spread
He has horses and cows and tractors and plows
And all kinds of money to burn
But how can I get to Texas
When my wheels won't turn
How can I get to Texas
When my wheels won't turn
Mmmm, they just won't move
My wheels won't turn
They just won't move
There was a lady from Spain
Who had a fine frame
Then she moved to Hollywood
She said come and stay for a week and a day
I said I did not think I could
She said the sunshine's fine
I could spend some time
There are lessons I could learn
But how can I get to L.A
When my wheels won't turn
How can I get to L.A
When my wheels won't turn
Mmmm, they just won't move
You might also likeI'm standin' still
'Cause my wheels won't turn
I'm not in love
And my fuel won't burn for you
Yeah, my wheels won't turn, let's go
At a college of knowledge I tried to learn
All the tricks to beat the system
I'd hide in nooks and memorize my books
'Till I knew I'd never never miss them
Eventually I got my degree
But the real thing I did learn
You just can't hit your home run
If your wheels won't turn
You just can't hit your homerun
If your wheels won't turn, got to get movin'
There was a man in white
Who did things right
Now he watches from above
He said here is the way that I want you to pray
And the way to live and love
So I saw the light and did things right
But the candle would not burn
Tell me, how can I get to heaven
If my wheels won't turn
Tell me, how can I get to heaven
If my wheels won't turn
Mmmm, they just won't move
I'm standin' still
Cause my wheels won't turn
I'm not in love
And my fuel won't burn for you
Ah, my wheels won't turn
Won't turn for you
Ah, my wheels won't turn
My wheels won't turn
Hey, my wheels won't turn
My wheels won't turn
Hey my wheels won't turn
How can I get to Texas
How can I get to L.A
How can I hit my homerun
How can I get to heaven
My wheels won't turn
No, my wheels won't turn
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
Mama, my wheels won't turn
Ooh, won't turn
My wheels won't turn
My wheels won't turn
Ah, my wheels won't turn
Ah, my fuel won't burn
How can I get to Texas
How can I get to L.A
How can I hit my homerun
How can I get to heaven
When my wheels won't turn
Ah, my wheels won't turn
Mmmmbop mmmmbop
My wheels won't turn
Mmmmbop mmmmbop
My wheels won't turn
I'm spinnin'
Mmmm, you got me spinnin'
Whoo, got me spinnin'
Ah, got me spinnin'
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
Come on, my wheels won't turn
Come on, my wheels won't turn
Come on, my wheels won't turn
Ah hey, my wheels won't turn
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
My heart won't turn
I did get burned
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
Yeah, my wheels won't turn
