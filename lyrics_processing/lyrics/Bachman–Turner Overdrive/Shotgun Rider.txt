Approached me in his own saloon and said, "hey boy, sit down"
"Was I unemployed or would I like a job"
He said he owned the stageline, and were men who liked to rob
He offered me his daughter's hand, advance of salary
A fancy gun, a pair of boots, a share in the company
Now I ride shotgun on his stageline
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
Shotgun ... rider ... shotgun ... rider
There were outlaws who waited on the trail
For the stagecoach daily run with payrolls and the mail
They spied our dust and saddled up to ride
They saw the worried driver with me sittin' at his side
They circled 'round the stagecoach, it was their daily fun
Until they saw the driver smile and spied my trusty gun
Now I ride shotgun on his stageline
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
Shotgun ... rider ... shotgun ... rider
You might also likeWe caught the outlaws and took them back to jail
Sent for the county marshall and would not post a bail
Sent 'em up the river .... ha! ... that sure cleaned up the town
I was elected sheriff and the mayor asked me down
I now own half the stageline, and half the rest of town
I go to church on Sunday ... I think I've settled down
Now I ride shotgun on his stageline
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
I ride shotgun on his stageline
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
Shotgun ... rider ... shotgun ... rider ...shot
