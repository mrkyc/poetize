But I think I've had enough
For the sun came late this morning
And I sure am feeling rough
Been this way for hours
Just can't seem to clear my head
Thank you for the feelin'
But I should have stayed in bed
What a night I had
Never been so right
Find a pretty face
Stayed there most the night
Fed me wine and laughter
Dandied up so tight
I don't remember coming home
And I'm not going back tonight
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you for the feelin'
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you for the feelin'
(Give it some feelin')

But I think I've had enough
For the sun came late this morning
And I sure am feeling rough
Been this way for hours
Just can't seem to clear my head
Thank you for the feelin'
But I should have stayed in bed
Had a devil's face
Emotion that could melt
Why so many dozen men
A love they'd never felt
Took me home, shared a dream
Knew just what I'd like
I don't remember coming home
And I'm not going back tonight
I'd like to thank you
