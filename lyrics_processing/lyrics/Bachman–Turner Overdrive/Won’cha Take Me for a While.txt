And that old familar feeling started haunting me
There was something in the way she cried and I fell apart
So I reached out to touch her
She was meant for me, then she said
Woncha take me for a while
Woncha take me for a while
Need someone, need someone
To make me smile
(Lord ya know I'm going to need it) 1st time
(Yeah you know I do) 2nd time
(Lord you know I need it) 3rd time
Woncha take me for a while
Sunshine fades and so did I, outside in the rain
I needed someone to carry on and really care
My summer came with deep blue skies
When we met again and I reached out to feel her
Sitting next to me and she said
Woncha take me for a while
Woncha take me for a while
Need someone, need someone
To make me smile
(Lord ya know I'm going to need it) 1st time
(Yeah you know I do) 2nd time
(Lord you know I need it) 3rd time
Woncha take me for a while
