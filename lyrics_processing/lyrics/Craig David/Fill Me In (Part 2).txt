Late last night you were chillin' with your friends, baby
Drivin' all the goddamn guys crazy, hey
You said, "Now would you like to take me for a ride, honey?"
I said, "That would be just fine for me, for me, yeah"
You come around and you were willin' to drive
But it wasn't enough; I guess you wanted me to come your way
You wanna ride and then tell me you wanna stay
No way, ain't messing with the games you play
