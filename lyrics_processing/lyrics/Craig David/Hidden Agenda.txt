Now, baby
He keeps on sayin' that he tells you you're the only one
But everybody knows he's out there having fun
Behind your back
And that's a fact
And it ain't right
'Cause he's a fly guy acting like a gentleman
But back in the day, I can still remember when
He just turned around
Wouldn't look twice at you

And I'm
Just being straight with you
'Cause he
Takes you for a fool
So you
Should be on your guard
When he thinks you don't have a clue
And I
Think if the truth be known
That you'll
End up all alone
When he
Gets everything he wants
So girl, open up your eyes and see
With me

Now, lady
When he tells you that he loves you and won't give you up
Takes your car and it's your money that be fillin' it up
Look at what he's got
Thinks he's hit the jackpot
And it ain't right
'Cause your connections keep him sweet and that's so typical
He's only in it for himself and that's so cynical
He'd be out of sight, girl, if you lost it all

So I
Feel so bad inside
When he's
Cruisin' in your ride
'Cause I know
Baby, late at night
There's some other girl by his side
And I
Wanna let you know
That he
Really ought to go
And you
Should believe in me
