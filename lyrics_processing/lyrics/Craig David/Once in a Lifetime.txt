Once in my life, I have the chance to find
Once in my life, I have the chance to find

Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me

In the beginning trouble times in my life
I needed a shoulder to cry on (Just needed a shoulder)
Had no direction until I met you
Everything is gonna be alright
Looking out beyond the stars
Searching, always wishing
Often I thought that love would escape me
You got the key, babe

Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me

I was lost, couldn't find my way
You took my hand and chased my blues away
Your inspiration is guiding me through
I'm feeling brand new
Memories of days gone by
Hurting, always hurting
You've taken my pain away finally
You set me free, babe

Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime (In my life)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me (So good for me)
Once in a lifetime (One in my lifetime)
I have the chance to find the key to my dreams (The key to my dreams)
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime (I had the chance, baby)
