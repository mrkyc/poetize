Three, four, step inside the venue and (Yeah)
See, in the corner of my eye
This beautiful girl that's standing by the bar looking fly (Ah)
She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine, looked about nineteen
Five minutes talking, next thing it's her number being written (Yeah)

Kissin' and cuddlin' at my crib after the venue and I

Five minutes chillin', next thing it's my name she's callin'
