It's another day at school and he's just walking out the door
Got his rucksack on his back and his feet dragging on the floor
Always late, but when he's questioned, he can't think of what to say
Hides the bruises from the teachers, hoping that they go away
Even though his mom and dad they both got problems of their own
Caught in a catch-22 but he'd still rather be at home
Cries himself to sleep and prays when he wakes up things might have changed
But everything's still the same

(But didn't you say?)
You always said that I should speak up, mm
But it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all
Because...

I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
That's why I'm late for school (But you never listen)
Instead, you always seem to end up blaming me for things I didn't do (For what it's worth)
I didn't even wanna tell you anything incase it made things worse (Just so you know)
Every time I say that Johnny's hitting me
Hey, Mom and Dad, it hurts

Every day keeps on repeating like the record on replay
Slowly getting off the bus with Johnny waiting at the gates
Like a friend smiling and waving and called him out his name
Put his arm around his neck whisper now gimme all your change"
Too afraid to make a scene or plead with him to let him go
He just takes whatever coming, feels the pain with every blow
Tries in vain to make himself be heard as soon as he gets home
But everything's still the same...

You always said that I should speak up, mm
And to never be afraid to come and tell you if I needed to talk (If I needed to talk, yeah)
Well, I don't know the meaning of love, mm
'Cause it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all (Meant nothing at all)
Because....
