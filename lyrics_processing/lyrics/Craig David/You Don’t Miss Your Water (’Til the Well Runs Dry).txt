As I sail with you across the finest oceans
On our way to find the key to our emotions
Together we will move the clouds to brighter days
Some people question what I say
Tried to break up you and me

But I know this love between us is growing stronger
You can call me whenever from wherever
Just remember that
I'll be there
Through all the stormy weather
Us break up never
No, we'll be together
Forever

You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry
But I believe so strongly in you and I
Can somebody answer me the question why?
You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry

As I close my eyes
Sit back while reminiscing
Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing
There may be sad and painful times along the way
But in my heart, you'll always be everything and more to me
