One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

I got liquor in my system
Feeling kinda wavy, got me thinkin'
Of all the things we used to do
Back then when I was still with you
You were there for me from the start
When I didn't ever pain and steal with your heart
For me those feelings haven't changed
Need you back in my arms again

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing

Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

I wanna hold you, but it's from a distance
I don't know what to do, needed some assistance
I roll up to your mum's house, I don't even business
Cause I do anything, cause maybe she can help me fix this
So many mandem on your case, really shoudn't allowed it
I was nobody and you picked me out of the crowed
It took me this long just for me to figure it out
But the simple fact is I'm lost girl when you ain't around

One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

So tell me baby is there hope for you and me?
Cause I just wanna have you back in my arms
Kicking myself, it drives me crazy thinking 'bout you
Counting all the nights and days you've been gone
Oh yeah
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, so I'm not giving up no, no
