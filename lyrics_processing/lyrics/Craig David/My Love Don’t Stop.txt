I've been knowin you, you've been knowing me
But I ain't took the chance to tell you what i want
Girl, it's been too long
And I can't go on
Can't be actin' like I dont care

'Cause I rolled with you
I grew up with you
My momma used to sit you
When your moms weren't home
Always friends with you
Never stepped to you
But now it's time that I start makin' love to you

Time passes by for more than a lifetime
I want to be yours, girl
I would give up my life
To spend just one night with you
'Cause my love don't stop
I can't lie you bring out the best in me
I gots to be yours. girl
I would give up my life
Theres nothin' that I won't do
'Cause my love don't stop

There's a part of me that wants us to be
Just the way we are so we don't mess things up
But it's killing me
'Cause the rest of me
Wants to feel your body, baby
Wants to tear it up

(I'll do some things to you
No one else can do)
'Cause baby I'm the one to make you feel real good

Girl, I've watched you
Get hurt too many times
