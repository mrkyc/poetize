You say it's over, that you're leaving
Get out of my way
I'm blocking the door, what I say
I don't care if you stay, care if you stay
Seems like no matter what I do
The message just ain't getting through
Just when I think we've hit a wall
You look at me and say, at me and say

Baby, I'm sorry, I swear I didn't mean it
Mean it that way
Baby, don't worry cause love ain't easy
But at the end of the day

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
Nothing, nothing

Out with my boys, yeah we been drinking
Now you're calling me, why you calling me?
You asking where are you, it's late
It's quarter to three, are you kidding me?
Why can't you just chill out, be cool?
When you know I'm coming home to you
Just when I think you're 'bout to hang up
Girl, that's when you say, that's when you say

Baby, I'm sorry, I swear I didn't mean it
Mean it that way
Baby, don't worry cause love ain't easy
But at the end of the day

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
We were built to last
Built to surpass space and time
To let go would be a crime
How am I supposed to survive
Without you in my life?
Oh, you should know that

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
Nothing will ever change my love for you
I know nothing will ever change my love, oh no, yeah
Nothing will change my, nothing will ever change my
