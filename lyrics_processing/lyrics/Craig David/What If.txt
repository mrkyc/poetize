Must have been about 3 o'clock, girl, remember this
I was just walking out, minding my own biz
That's when I saw her standing there
We I laughed, she was smiling back
You know the crazy thing, she was all alone
But I was identical for to approach
And that's when she disappeared
And now I'm kicking myself so bad

What if I had simply just walked up to her?
I might now be walking hand in hand with her
Instead I'm asking myself

What if it was written, what if it was fate
Shouldn't have let her walk away
Cause now I'm kicking myself thinking
What if, what if, what if
And what if she was thinking just walk over to me
I only got myself to blame
Cause now I'm kicking myself thinking
What if, what if, what if, what if I did
What if, what if, what if

Find myself waiting at the same time and place
Wishing and hoping that I see her again
But she never turns up, no
Feels like I'm chasing a ghost
All my friends say that I've lost my mind
Cause I've only seen this girl once in my whole life
But it's the what if that's killing me
What if we were supposed to be

What if I had simply just walked up to her?
I might now be walking hand in hand with her
Instead I'm asking myself

What if it was written, what if it was fate
Shouldn't have let her walk away
Cause now I'm kicking myself thinking
What if, what if, what if
And what if she was thinking just walk over to me
I only got myself to blame
Cause now I'm kicking myself thinking
What if, what if, what if, what if I did

And it's always on my mind
What if she was 'posed to be the one by my side
Sometimes you live and learn
So if I had another chance and I saw that girl again
I would take her by the hand and ask her
What if this is written, what if this is fate
But I just let her walk away
And now I'm kicking myself thinking
What if, what if, what if
And what if she was thinking just walk over to me
I only got myself to blame
Cause now I'm kicking myself thinking
