Yo Craig, (Yeah)
There's some real jealous people out there, right, (Uh-huh)
Trying to say how you're whack (What?)
How your music's soft, and you ain't got nothing to say (What? What?)
Well it's album #2, right? (Yeah)
So you gotta let 'em know (That's right)
So do your thing, take your time, speak your mind (Yeah, yeah listen)

Ever since I first stepped up
They thought I wasn't good enough, no
They told me that I'd only last one song
That's foolish, man - what's it like now, sevel million albums? Ha
They said I wasn't from the streets (The streets)
When I was workin' behind the scenes
Shit like this don't happen overnight, no no

While they're tellin' me
About my imagery
How I'm so squeaky clean, whenever I'm on TV
Too much jealousy
In the industry
(Why are you watching me when you should just let me be?)

Some people say it's been too long (Too long)
That's why I'm here to prove them all wrong
So why do imitators want to bite my style?
Ladies and gentlemen, will the real Craig David please stand up?
You never had a problem at all
When I was havin' woman trouble
Somebody fill me in; didn't I serve my time?
Remember who gave you "Rewind"?

While they're telling me
That I'm too R&B
(How I turned right back up the whole U.K. garage scene)
Now they're stressing me
When I know there's much more to see
(Why are you watching me when you should just let me be?)

They keep stopping my flow (They keep stopping my flow)
Everywhere that I go (Everywhere that I go)

There comes a time (There comes a time)
When you've gotta take a step to do what's right
(As much as I like, I can't possibly please everyone)

Slicker than your average, singer serving garage
Busy trying to slam me cause I smashed it
Well they don't understand us, I'm hitting, I'm established
By taking British music to the masses
The gold diggers go bananas
The same ones that didn't show me no love when I was cashless
In the day when it really mattered
When I was pennin' competition no publishing hits for damage
Now the gold go to me, so minimal
I'm involved in the platinum plaques and records sold
Heaven knows that I've battle producer with ego
And there were those that were told exactly where to go
Somebody please stop these little kids
They wanna pull bumpers off my 2-0-6
Shouting outside of the block I used to live
They don't like my records, so why listen to this?
