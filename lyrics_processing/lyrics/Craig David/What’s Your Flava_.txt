I met this fly girl in a club
Went by the name of Pecan Deluxe
This ice-cream was high maintenance
When I took her out, nearly cost me twenty bucks
I met this chick named Walnut Whip
Nearly made me sick to the point of throwin' up
So I called Chocolate Chip
With the sweet toffee crisp and I still can't get enough

You're what I want (Uh)
You're what I need (Come on)
I wanna taste ya (Taste ya)
Take you home with me
You look so good (Oh)
Good enough to eat
I wonder if I could peel your wrapper
I could be your fantasy

Uh, I take 'em in the middle of July
With the drop top down and the park when it's simmering
These ice creams looking so fly that I just can't lie
It all seems too bewildering
They got these grown men running 'round
Screamin' out, acting worse than children
But who flow better, Know better, Stack cheddar
Get more tongues wetter
Than this ice-cream veteran? (come on)

You're what I want (I)

Hey, I'm takin' them apple and cinnamon
Girls, I'm feelin' them, can't stop licking them (Uh-huh)
Thats why they got me dribbling
Hot fudge sauce and its all over my Timberlands (Come on)
I take them caramel with a hint of vanilla
With a little chocolate sprinklings (Yeah)
They make me spend my dividends
These sweet things make me feel like a kid again
You're what I want (I)
