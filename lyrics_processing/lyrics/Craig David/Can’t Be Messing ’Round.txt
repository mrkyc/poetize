Gonna make ya, make ya dance to this
This is how we do it one time
Into the year two oh straight from nine nine

One day minding my own business
Girl from the back won't keep her distance
She was all over me
Just won't let it be, oh
So I said to her, "I got a girl at home."
This is so hard for me, but you gotta leave me alone
She said she didn't wanna listen to me
Knew exactly what she wanted to be, my baby
I must admit that she was getting to me, waiting for me
Wanting me to hold her oh so tightly
Together, forever, wherever, ha, whatever
She said she couldn't find nobody better
Wasn't gonna give up on me never
She said

"Ooh, you're looking so fly
Every time you pass me by
I like the way you move your body"
Girl, I must admit
You're looking real fit
Let's chill for a little bit
I know you wanna get with me
Girl ,you know I'm not free

It seems like every day girl you wanna be calling me
And when I step outside you always follow me
You said that you were really feeling Sisqo's song
About the thong th-thong thong thong; did I wanna see?

But I got a girl at home who'll do the same for me
And that's the way it's gotta be, gotta be
So listen now, lady

Ooh, I like your profile
The way you talk and your smile
But you gotta understand, lady

Ooh, you know this ain't right
