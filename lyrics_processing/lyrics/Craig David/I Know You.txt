I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you

This gonna be a heavy night
Way too many drinks, ain't even started
Never need to apologize
We already know we're far from perfect
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling

I can barely see in front of me
Strangers start to look like friendly faces
In the middle, I'm steady on my feet (you, you, you, you)
And carrying the world is overrated
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling

We're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds
I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
