I can't figure out the reason why lately
Youve been acting so cold
(Didn't you say)
If theres a problem we should work it out
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now
Like you dont want to talk to me girl
(Tell me)
Okay I know I was late again
I made you mad and dinners thrown in the bin
But why you making this thing drag on so long
(I wanna know)
Im sick and tired of this silly games
Dont think that Im the only one here to blame
Its not me whos been going round slamming doors
Thats when you turned and said to me
I dont care babe whos right or wrong
I just dont love you no more
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, youre gone, my fault, Im sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now its too late to turn it around
Im sorry for the tears Ive made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just dont love you no more
I know that Ive made a few mistakes
But never thought things would turn out this way
Doesnt make sense to me now that youre gone
(I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state
Giving my reasons but as you look away
I can see a tear roll down your face
Thats when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe whos right or wrong
I just dont love you no more
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, youre gone, my fault, Im sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now its too late to turn it around
Im sorry for the tears Ive made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just dont love you no more
Those simple words hit so hard
They turned my whole world upside down
Girl you caught me completely off guard
On that night you said to me
I just dont love you no more
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, youre gone, my fault, Im sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now its too late to turn it around
Im sorry for the tears Ive made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just dont love you no more
Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, youre gone, my fault, Im sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now its too late to turn it around
Im sorry for the tears Ive made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
