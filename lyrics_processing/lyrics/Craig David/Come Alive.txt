You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low, your skies a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside, but you can shake awake

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light, let it burn so bright
Reaching up to the sky
And it's open wide, you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie that you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door, but don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes
'Cause once you see it all, you'll never, never be the same
Little bit of lightnin' striking, bottle up to keep on shining
'Cause you can prove there's more to you
You cannot be afraid

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light, let it burn so bright
Reaching up to the sky
And it's open wide, you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive
Come on, come on, come on, come on
No more living in the shadows, no
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Shouting out

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light, let it burn so bright
Reaching up to the sky
And it's open wide, you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
