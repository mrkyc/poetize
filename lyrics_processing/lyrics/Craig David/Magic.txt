Let me break it down
Somethin' about the things you do
Baby, when I get next to you
If you're ever in doubt
Let me spell it out, girl
When I'm here next to you
It feels so magical

M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
G for the girl that got me good
I C the world the way I should, oh
M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
G for the girl that got me good
I C the world the way I should
