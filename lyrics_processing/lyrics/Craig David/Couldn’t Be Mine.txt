She said that she's a little late
She said that something's on the way
She must have hit the wrong number
With her thumb and called me
This whole thing must be a mistake
Maybe she thinks she's calling Drake
Maybe she met us in the same club
Must she's insane cause it's not me

I know we *boing* sometimes
Messed around once or twice
But ain't no way that it could be mine
Couldn't be mine cause I don't remember playing around with you at the time
Cause you was busy messing with some other guy
Couldn't be mine cause you came around only one time
And you said we should get a little drunk, but of fun
But now it's coming back to me, you got me thinking could it be mine?

So let me get this whole thing straight
There's been no one since you and me
Baby, see I was born to do it
But girl, I wasn't born yesterday
Heard you were talking to my mate
Same time you were messaging me
Guess this was written in the pages
Living dangerously

What if it turns out I was wrong?
And I'd be fooling myself all along
This couldn't be happening to me, no no no baby
But we can talk about this on the phone

Couldn't be mine cause I don't remember playing around with you at the time
Cause you was busy messing with some other guy
