If you're ever in doubt
Let me break it down
Somethin' about the things you do
Baby, when I get next to you
If you're ever in doubt
Let me spell it out, girl
When I'm here next to you
It feels so magical

M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
G for the girl that got me good
I C the world the way I should, oh
M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
G for the girl that got me good
I C the world the way I should

When I'm with you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ay, look into my eyes and make me feel magic
You know what I need you're so telepathic
You don't give me much choice but to keep options
Cause if you leave I can't be left here with nothing
You're the one, only one
Came back to realise you're the one
Put you first you'll be second to none
We'll crawl back on track don't you run
I know what I said, know what I did, but
It ain't over til we're done
I don't feel a thing when you're with me just
Love me good and make me numb

M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
G for the girl that got me good
I C the world the way I should, oh
M for the way you make me feel
A 'cause you always keep it real
