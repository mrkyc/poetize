Mm, I would take the stars out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling if you asked me to
I'd do anything for you, your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand, mm
Words cannot express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul, you know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you, I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power, girl
To keep me holding on
So now you've got the best of me
Come on and take the rest of me
Oh baby
You might also like
Mmh, though you're close to me, we seem so far apart
Maybe given time, you'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever, girl, then I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you, I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power, girl
To keep me holding on
So now you've got the best of me
Come on and take the rest of me
Oh baby

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing (You're the sweetest song that I could sing)
Oh baby, oh baby (Oh baby, yes, I need you, baby)
You to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby (You are everything to me, can't you see?)
You to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing (You're the sweetest song that I could sing)
Oh baby, oh baby (You're everything)
You to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing (You're the sweetest thing to me)
Oh baby, oh baby (You're the sweetest thing to me, yeah, yeah)
You to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing (You're the sweetest song that I could sing)
