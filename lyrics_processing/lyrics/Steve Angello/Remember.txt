Remember when you had a dream?
Remember when you had a heart?
Remember when it was so simple, this world, my fault, could ever scar?
Remember when you fell in love?
Remember when it fell apart?
Remember when you saw tomorrow of love you swore you'd never start?
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own

Remember then you fell hard?
(But now you're on your own)
(But now you're on your own)
(But now you're on your own)
Remember when you sold your dreams for nothing?
I've been thinking about that for so long
Keep running up a hill, fight back, don't stop
Oh, Don't you throw your hands in the air
I'd rather cherish all everything that I own
Than dream about something that I never had

Remember when you had a dream?
Remember when you had a heart?
Remember when it so simple, this world, my fault, could ever scar?
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own
But now you're on your own
Remember when you sold your dreams for nothing?
I've been thinking about that for so long
You might also likeBut now you're on your own
