Saw a sign I know I want to see again
Pretty young woman wearing skin-tight britches
And a t-shirt wetter than a snakeskin
Somebody said her name was Arlene
And her daddy is a shotgun toting kind of country man
I just said "what was that name again"
Ain't nobody gonna scare me away
Gonna hold my breath till I take her away
Arlene, hey are you comin' into town
Arlene, don't let your daddy tie you down
When you're sneaking out that window baby
Don't you make a sound
Do you want to boogie, are you into fool, fool, foolin' around
Well daddy ain't a working, he's a sitting in lawn chair
Chewin on a mighty plug of Redman
Pretty as a picture and he's got her chopping cotton
Like a convict sweating on a chain gang
Somebody oughta break her out of that scene
She's enough to make you wanna do the old man in
Hey, what was that name again
Ain't no use in tryin' to settle me down
I'm a fool, I'm a downright clown clown for Arlene

Arlene, don't let your daddy tie you down
When you're sneaking out that window baby
Don't you make a sound
Do you want to boogie, are you into fool, fool, foolin' around
Sitting in a bacco patch feeling like a weasel
I'm a waitin' on the lights to go dim
Wonderin' if my backside might be full of bullet shots
Before she gets away from him
Ain't nobody gonna scare me away
Gonna hold my breath till I take her away
(Repeat chorus)
When you're sneaking out that window baby
Don't you make a sound
Do you want to boogie, are you into fool, fool, foolin' around
Come on Arlene
I see you got that red dress on
