Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he cocked his head and he wore his gun all wrong
We had the same girlfriend and he never forgot it
She had a cute little Chihuahua till one day he up and shot it
He rode the hard country down the New Mexico line
He had a silver pocket watch he never did wind
He crippled the piano player for playin' his favorite song
Yeah, me and Billy the Kid never got along
Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he parted his hair and he wore his gun all wrong
He was bad to the bone all hopped up on speed
I would've left him alone if it hadn't been for that Senorita
He gave her silver and he paid her hotel bill
But it was me that she loved and she said she always will
I'd always go and see her when Billy was gone
And me and Billy the Kid never got along
Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he tied his shoes and he wore his gun all wrong
One day I said to Billy "I've got this foolproof scheme"
We'll rob Wells Fargo "It's just bustin at the seams."
I admit that I framed him but I don't feel so bad
'Cause the way I was livin' was drivin' me mad
Billy reached for his gun but his gun was on wrong
Me and Billy the Kid never got along

But I like the way he swayed in the wind when I played him his favorite song
Now my baby sings with me to "La Cucaracha"
She winds her silver pocket watch and pets her new Chihuahua
I moved in to the hotel got a room with a shower
We lay and listen to that watch tick hour after hour
Outside I hear the wind blowin' away so strong
