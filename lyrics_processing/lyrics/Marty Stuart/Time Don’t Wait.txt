Down on the desert sands
Well I reached down and touched the Earth
And held it in my hands
As the dirt fell through my fingers
The wind did seem to say
Don't put off until tomorrow
What you can do today

Cause, time don't wait on nobody
Time don't wait on nobody
Time don't wait on nobody
It just keeps movin' on
Time don't wait on nobody
Time don't wait on nobody
Time don't wait on nobody
It just keeps movin' on
And on ... and on ... and on
A thousand angels dropped matches
That lit up the desert sky
Well, a pillar of fire from East to West
Came slowly drifting by
A voice from the clouds like thunder
Said start lookin' for a ride
Said where yesterday meets tomorrow
Will get you to the other side
