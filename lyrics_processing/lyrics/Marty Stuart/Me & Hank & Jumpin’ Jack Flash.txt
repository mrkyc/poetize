St. Peter come up to me and he said "now Marty who do you want to see"
So I began to think
I said "why don't you call up old Hank Williams and see if he's free"
'Cause Hank saw the world from a Cadillac
And he carried them Lovesick Blues right on his back
Ah yeah
Sure as I was dreaming, sure as I was born
Around my neck came this long skinny arm
And he said, "Howdy Hoss, my name is Hank, now what brings you here"
So I began to think
I said "Hank brother, you've seen it all
You've seen 'em come and go and you've seen 'em rise and fall
And right now country music's got more singers than I believe I've ever seen
So many people got to follow out their dream"
"But I feel different," I said, "'cause I'm a natural born cat
I'm country to the bone, but I don't wear no hat"
Oh no, two three
Said "I started with Lester back in '72
All I wanted to be was a little different like him and you"
He said "whoa now, it just takes a little longer to make it if you're different, I guess
But you just sing what's in your heart and God's gonna do the rest
Just be what you are at all times and just tell the folks out there the truth
And that ain't gonna cost you a dime
But if you plan to be different son, you're just rolling the dice
And you know you ain't the first one to pay that price
'Cause there was me and Elvis and there was Bocephus too
There was Waylon and Willie and there was Bill Monroe
And I guess you know about ole Johnny Cash
And I think what the world needs right now is a Jumpin' Jack Flash"
See Marty Stuart LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also likeUp in Hillbilly Heaven I saw Keith Whitley, I saw Patsy Cline
I saw Reba McEntire's band, they were all friends of mine
And I began to tremble and I began look
I knew I was dreaming but I just couldn't wake up
Then out of nowhere came this long Cadillac
The driver said "Now come on there Hank we gotta take you back
Thirty minutes before your next show
We're running behind so we gotta go"
He said "Marty, I tell you what you do
You just go on back down there and you make us proud
And remember wherever you go
There's a little hillbilly in every crowd"
And he got in that old car and he drove off slow
