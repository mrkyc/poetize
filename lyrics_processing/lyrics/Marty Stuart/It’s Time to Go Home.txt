In first Thessalonians it is read
The 16th verse in chapter four
Now listen friend, let me tell you more
It says the Lord himself is gonna shout
And Gabriel will bring his trumpet out
He's gonna blow it loud from the Easter sky
And then the Saints and Christ shall rise
They'll be dancing on the clouds
They're gonna go first, to show us how
I'm talkin' about the child that's left behind
It will only be for a moment's time, then
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Oh child it's time to go home

Servin' Jesus day by day
Sometimes I drift and dream at night
The the heavenly world, such a precious sight
I wonder how long will it take
'Til Jesus steps out from those gates
And says, "Come on, now's the time
Friend don't you get left behind"
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Oh child it's time to go home
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Get up out of that ground
(Get up out of that ground)
Oh child it's time to go home
