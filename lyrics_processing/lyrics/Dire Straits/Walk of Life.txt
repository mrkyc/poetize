Woo-hoo

Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula," baby, "What'd I Say"
Here comes Johnny singing "I Got a Woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turnin' all the nighttime into the day

He do the song about the sweet loving woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-hoo

Here come Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down, my walking shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talking blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the nighttime into the day

There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mmm, they do the walk of life
