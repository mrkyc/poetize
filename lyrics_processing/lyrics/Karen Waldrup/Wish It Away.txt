Oh oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh
Here I go
Exit 161
Down this road
Darling, I'm moving on
I've gotta lotta luggage in my car
But no baggage on my heart

I wish I could hate you
I wish I was strong
I wish I could just stop turning up our song on the radio and singing along
But just like that, this feeling's in my face
I might've made a mistake
But I just can't wish it away

Oh oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh
You couldn't commit
So I walked away
But I'll admit
Your memory is hard to shake
And I just passed the Georgia line
And you're still on my mind
You might also like
I wish I could hate you
I wish I was strong
I wish I could just stop turning up our song on the radio and singing along
Cause just like that, this feeling's in my face
I might've made a mistake
But I just can't wish it away

Well I don't have a doubt
I know I'm about to turn this car around

I wish I could hate you
I wish I was strong
I wish I could just stop turning up our song on the radio and singing along
Cause just like that, this feeling's in my face
I might've made a mistake
But I just can't wish it away

I wish I could hate you
I wish I was strong
I wish I could just stop turning up our song on the radio and singing along
Cause just like that, this feeling's in my face
I might've made a mistake
But I still can't wish it away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can't wish it away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can't wish it away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
