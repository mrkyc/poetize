We'll find the stars
In all that we are
Lights we've displaced
These fast dreams, we can't chase

Don't look back
Home is not where you want to be
We can run
Run for all those memories

Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
Run run with me
