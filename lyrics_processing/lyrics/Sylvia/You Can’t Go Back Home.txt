Had a couple of hours to spare
I wanted to see the hometown again
It'd been years since I was there
A taxi took me by the old grade school
But on the playground
There was no sound
Windows boarded up
A rusty sign laying on the ground
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing
You can't change the changes going on
(Going on)
They say you can't go back anymore
Than you can stop the door from closing
Once you're gone
You can't go back home
Drove in front of the movie house
Where I spent my Saturdays
Quarter got ya in back then
Costed three and a half today

But Mr. Shipley had passed away
I got back in the cab
I saw that everything had changed
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing
You can't change the changes going on
(Going on)
They say you can't go back anymore
Than you can stop the door from closing
Once you're gone
You can't go back home
Taxi pulled up in front of your house
I started to get out
Then I saw a little boy open the door
I quickly turned around
I told the driver
Guess there's no one home
I think he understood
You've got a plane to catch, he said
The drive will do you good
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing
You can't change the changes going on, going on
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the door from closing
Once you're gone
You can't go back home
Once you're gone
You can't go back home
Be it ever so humble
