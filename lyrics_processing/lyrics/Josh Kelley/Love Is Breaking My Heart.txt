Mascara eyes and a threadbare dress
Said is it ok if I stay with you for awhile?
You were talking fast and feeling down
So you spent the week, he was out of town
Woke up alone, I should've known you'd be gone
I'm tired of being your other guy
I wanna be more than your good time
But your love is breaking my heart
Come on little pretty, let me out of your dark
Oh isn't it a pity?
In a Cadillac with the backseat torn out
Looking back I should have turned it around
Love is breaking my heart, so let me go little pretty
Oh tell me baby, what's your plan?
Cause I don't really understand
There's got to be a way for me to get to you
Yeah, I got you in when you lost your key
And scored some pills so you could sleep
I went home, woke up alone thinking about you
You might also likeI'm tired of being your other guy
I wanna be more than your good time
Because your love is breaking my heart
Come on little pretty, let me outta your dark
Oh isn't it a pity?
In a Cadillac with the backseat torn out
Looking back I should have turned it around
Love is breaking my heart
So let me go little pretty
Don't you call me up with you're in need
Don't you baby
Cause I'm in too deep, I can barely breathe
And I'm tired of trying to tell you
That your love is breaking my heart
Come on little pretty
Let me out of your dark
Oh isn't it a pity?
In a Cadillac with the backseat torn out
Looking back I should've turned it around
Now love is breaking my heart
Come on little pretty
Let me out of your dark
Oh isn't it a pity?
In a Cadillac with the backseat torn out
Looking back I should have turned it around
Love is breaking my heart, so let me go little pretty, yeah
So let me go little pretty, yeah
So let me go little pretty, yeah
So let me go little pretty, yeah
So let me go little pretty
