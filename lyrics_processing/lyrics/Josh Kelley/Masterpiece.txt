Early in the morning when we're lying in bed
Last night tossing and turning got your head in a mess
Something about the way that you understand
That sweet, sexy way that you hurt this man
Kissing those lips got me feeling so freaky inside
So if you want to be loved
I got it
And if you want to make love
I can do that too
And if you want to be touched in the right, right way
Baby, flip on the lights so I can see my masterpiece tonight
Sitting by the fire with a glass of wine
That fur coat got you looking so fine
And cheers to you honey
'Cause you look so money tonight
Oh I am crazy about the way
That you shake your thing
Make me want to give you a diamond ring
Let's finish what we started
'Cause, baby, you're a part of my life

I got it
And if you want to make love
I can do that too
And if you want to be touched in the right, right way
Baby, flip on the lights so I can see my masterpiece tonight
More and more each time (baby)
I realize our love's just a crime (though I want it)
You got me bending over backwards just to catch you
On the other side
If you want to be loved
I got it (you know I got it)
And if you want to make love
I can do that too (I can do that too)
And if you want to be touched in the right, right way
Baby, flip on the lights so I can see my masterpiece tonight (flip on the lights)
Flip on the lights so I can see my masterpiece tonight (you are my masterpiece)
