You still got her picture hanging on your mind
You wish you didn't need what you just can't have
But there ain't nothing you can do
There's not a second that you don't think about her
But she don't even think one single thought of you
Why does love got to be so unfair
Making you heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind
Making you hurt so bad no its just no right
Why does love got to be so unfair
Oh why does love got to be so unfair baby
Its such a sad affair
When you give your heart
And the one you give it to
Just goes and tears it all apart
You wish you didn't care
Didn't care at all
But all you do is care too much
There's not a single night you don't dream about her
But your the very last thing she'll be dreaming of
