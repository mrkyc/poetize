Take me down to New Lane Road
Barefoot in the river slow
Where the sun is warm, the fields are gold
Take me down to New Lane Road

Take me where I caught her eye
On blankets under mountain skies
Where the trees they whisper wind a-blow
Take me down to New Lane Road

This is my home
This is my life
Oh, I've read the Bill of Rights
And all the stories of the proud who've died for me and you
These are my kids
And this is my wife
I put before me every time I raise my stars under the red, the white, the beautiful blues
Yeah, we are the rivers carved of melted snow
Take me down to New Lane Road

We are the wild
We are the free
We are the earth beneath our feet
We take our time
We do it right
And we never back down without a fight

"Daddy always taught us if we would take care of the earth, the earth would take care of us
I would as a kid go with him on the tractor and he'd be plowing the field
He'd be digging up fresh dirt and there's this, there's a distinctive smell to a good rich dirt
You know, he could point out to me what was good dirt and what was bad dirt
And he would always say you basically get out of Mother Nature what you put back in
Remember if you're gonna fill the soil, you gotta give something back"

This is my home
