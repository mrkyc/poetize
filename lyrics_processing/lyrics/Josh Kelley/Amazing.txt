Cause you got a lot to tell me
But you dont think you can say it better, oh baby
You're bringin up times I can't recall
And I'm sure they make your point but
I just can't seem to remember, yeah
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination
So come on let me sing
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be, I will I will
Cuz I saw you walking down the hall
And I had a lot to tell you but I didn't think you could say it better, oh baby
You're good at making me feel so small
And I know you made your point but I just don't want to remember, yeah
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination
