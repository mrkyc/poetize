I feel like I'm standing on top of the sun
And even your temperature won't make me run
Being with you makes me feel
So alive
Mesmerized
I realize
That it's in your eyes
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we don't want to be alone
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we don't want to let it go
People ? they say 'you will never find love'
They say 'it's a myth
All you want is that touch'
But I disagree, cause I know I feel
So alive
Mesmerized
I realize
That it's in her eyes
You might also likeHoney, feel like I'm floating on that ecstasy

I'm mesmerized
Gonna blow your mind
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we don't want to be alone
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we can never let it go
I feel so high
Oh, my baby she makes me wanna touch the sky
Oh you never know unless you try
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we don't want to be alone
Hi oh, hey oh
This is how the story goes
And you know, I know
That we can never let it go
I realize that it's in your eyes
I realize that it's in your eyes
I realize that it's in your eyes
