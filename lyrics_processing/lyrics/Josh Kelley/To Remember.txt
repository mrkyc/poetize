Taking every opportunity, To give them everything you've got
Never will you surrender, Never will you fall
Never will you break down under the pressure of it all
You did it all with purpose, And we'll hollar as we stand
Cuz we'e so proud of you oh
Not just for the glory but for everything you do
Oh we're so proud of you
Oh you've given us a story that forever we will use
Because this is how we choose to remember
To remember, To remember
To remember, Just where we were
To remember, To remember
To remember, Just where we were
Repeat
Some go down in history
Destined from the start
I just hope I'm standing there when you're laying down your mark
Oh born to be hero above the rise of man
Beneath the breath of many there goes a greatest in the land
You did it all with purpose, And we'll hollar as we stand
Cuz we'e so proud of you oh
Not just for the glory but for everything you do
Oh we're so proud of you
