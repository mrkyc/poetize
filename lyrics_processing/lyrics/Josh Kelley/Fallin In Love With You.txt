Throwin signals in the wind
I got something I know you want it
I keep it simply what you need
Don't deny me the right to have it
You supply me with the things you do
Oh baby I'll be I'll be around the corner now
So afraid to talk to you
Say what you need I'll be down on my knees
Crying until you try
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
I've been writing you a letter
With answers wrote at you
Second chances don't come too easy baby
This ain't a game you wanna lose
Say what you need I'll be down on my knees
Crying until you try
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
You might also likeTo stop from fallin' in love with you
Sometimes at night I drift into a dream of you
And I like to find the dreams inside will come to life
When we glide into a world of perfect, glide into a world of perfect
Glide into a world of perfect love
Come on out
Oh i've been watching you baby and I love the things you do
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
You make me so hard
You make me so hard
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
You make it hard hard hard, hard hard hard
To stop from fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love with you
