Verse 1
Work a job get a raise
On a date gettin laid
Used to sell ketamine
What are you...kiddin me?
Now i drink the perrier
Cuz I am hella paid
Ate all the M n M's
Now they are MIA
In a maze , I'm amazed
In the sun in the shade
Into funds into fakes
Separate integrate
Buy the beach buy the lake
Buy the city buy the state
Freestyle I'm asleep
While I'm awake
You might also likeNow I'm waking up again
Girl breaking up again
Mistake with a couple friends?
Now we making up again
Your girl whirl pool
Something that Im jumping in
Last night real dope, but I can't remember it
I'm wavy blowing kisses to my babies
Hair on my chest to impress all the ladies
I'm wavy
Riding on a bike and not a mercedes
Blowing kisses to my babies wavy
I'm wavy
Blowing kisses to my babies hair on my chest to impress all the ladies
I'm wavy riding on a bike and not a mercedes  blwoing kisses to my baby's wavy

VERSE 2
Talking on the touch screen
Getting all the ice cream
Listening to ice cube
Sippin on my ice tea
Gangsta in my white tea
Looking out for wifey
Rolling dice poker cello
My adidas dios mio
Moe chicas less chicos
Pound for pound more kilos
Alphabet benjamin franlin more c notes
Bud light thuglife superbowl here weego
Supafly jimmy snuka crackhead dane cook up

Phone charger in the club
Merch table in the club
Kosha dillz been a thug
Hollywood live it up
South beach live it up
6 am i go to sleep and 2 pm i'm getting up
Chorus

Blowing kisses to my babies
Hair on my chest to impress all the ladies

Riding on a bike and not a mercedes  blowing kisses to my baby's wavy
