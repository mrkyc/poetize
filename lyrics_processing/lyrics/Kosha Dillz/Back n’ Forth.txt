Don't be so hard on yourself
Better yet, be harder
Hustlin' my whole life stupid
I gotta be smarter
Went from pushin' the stuff to sniff, now it's Spotify
Things are lookin' up in my life
You haters gotta die

Money grows, so does the ego
Hire more people, payin' more people
Get a new key, new house, and not the same keyhole
Nothing rhymes with orange
But I'll eat the Cheetos
What, figure out lyrics go along with the net worth
Business now is better, don't gotta be friends first
Politically correct? You can eat a dick
Not for the radio, these bars are hella sick
"Life is Good" t-shirt, yeah, then I send a text
#gratitude, attitude is hella blessed
Cut the bullshit, man, it's time to cut a check
Kosha, AT, lookin' for deals at 36, bruh

Lotta haters tryna' bring me down
It's a long road, I tell 'em I will see 'em around
Front desk in my head at the Lost and Found
Goin' back and forth and back and forth and
Your secretary said you just stepped out
Made a couple bucks and you wanna see me now
I'll tell you my availability when I'm in town
Goin' back and forth and back and forth and
You might also like
You get 10 to 15 percent of me for festivals
Now Vesily, but where the hell are you actually sendin' me?
You failed at your career, I won't let that get the best of me
And anyways, if I sold my tickets you'd have more respect for me
I guess I appreciate you representin' me
And if we have to meet for lunch, okay, sure, and I'll buy
If you don't like this business, that's the good side
The worst is yet to come
It'll get worse, then you'll die
At the end of the day, do nothing else
Except hustle
Lift weights and rap and travel 'round the map
I ain't got platinum album sales, I sent over
Three million unanswered emails and sometimes they get
Back to you with false details, circlin' back
Fake contracts and, "What can you sell?"
You sad and alone with no family
I'm onstage and don't talk for free
Unless it's freedom, muthafucka

Lotta haters tryna' bring me down
It's a long road, I tell 'em I will see 'em around
Front desk in my head at the Lost and Found
Goin' back and forth and back and forth and
Your secretary said you just stepped out
Made a couple bucks and you wanna see me now
I'll tell you my availability when I'm in town
Goin' back and forth and back and forth and
This thing could go many ways
Like Rick Ross hustlin' every day
They rob, steal, and make you wait
But I'm still doin' it, anyway
This thing could go many ways
Like Rick Ross hustlin' every day
They rob, steal, and make you wait
But I love it, I love it, anyway!
