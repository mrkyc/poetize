I'm a A+ at being a failure
Heaven sent me down to the earth will Hell words
Sex on a cross right there where I nailed her
Moses split the red sea but I will set sail first
40 ounce of steel reserve so you feel perturbed
Everyone got things to say so now I'm getting disturbed
Word?
Ugh!
Harry Potter and the Hogwarts
I make a million off the art like I'm Brainwash
Shhhh...

(chorus)
Think I think I got a hook?
For your face and the blood yo look
(smack!)
Listen up bitches ,I want 50 bucks on her I ain't talking bout stitches
I mean I'm talking bout stitches
Dig it uncle scrooge money bin and the riches
Im tupac gone fish in
What?

VERSE 2

I ain't rap bout things in space
I rap about things like the lead front in ya face .(yeah)
Hip Hop used to be so classic, nowadays too many kids is not getting they ass kicked
Ha yeah took a lotta acid
Ha yeah took a lot of mushrooms
Inhale the dust fumes thought I was Chucky like,,
Uh uh uh  uh oh
Tails from the crypt keeper
Feel the ether when I spit it up
Girlfriend grave im a dig it up
And I don't really give two fucks, everyone else could die before they get a chance to live it up
Flow is so, flow is so jersey
But you can see me in a desert in Albequerque
Slick like el gato
My people hold knives like Juarez across El Paso

(chorus)
Think I think I got a hook?
For your face and the blood yo look
(smack!)
Listen up bitches ,I want 50 bucks on her I ain't talking bout stitches
(ok!)
I mean I'm talking bout stitches
Dig it uncle scrooge money bin and the riches
Im Tupac gone fishin

Verse 3
Lee's motel party three chicks forgot a bible
Kick two out, 3 am decision final
Wake up 2 pm and she missing vitals
Ambulance do the dance, I ain't talk dance recitals
I ain't never had a fund  for a fund to trust
Tupac gone fishin' , slicing up the halibut
Amphetamine dream scheme, never had a cut
No money in my pocket? ha - damn that a suck
Life gettin better not (not)
Bait on the hook from a fiend on a block (block)
Beggin for that food outside the coffee spot (spot)
Crack laced not enough a chance with that fruity pebble rock
Straight and narrow path only way from a crooked cop
Stop go wait look it then I stop
One more hit than my career I pop
Kilo to a lot, ended up being something i'm not
(chorus)
Think I think I got a hook?
For your face and the blood yo look
Listen up bitches ,I want 50 bucks on her I ain't talking bout stitches
(ok!)
I mean I'm talking bout stitches
Dig it uncle scrooge money bin and the riches
Im Tupac gone fish in
(what?)
