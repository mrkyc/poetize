Swimming with no swimmies when I sing a song
By the end I hope all ya'll can sing along
Ding and dong back n forth like it's ping and pong
Every time I grabbed the mic i was already written off
Hustling coke survive and feed the family
I hustle to fill emptiness with more vanity
Two steps in restore sanity
At war with myself like will it be a man or she?
Fighting make sense if you not a man of peace
Freedom grasp let it ring
I dont want shit all i want is everything
Reality just settled in
I'm a figure out who I am and live life to never let the devil sing...

(chorus)
We are different we are different we are different
It's gonna be ok
We are different we are different we are different
It's gonna be ok

Verse 2 - MURS
You might also likeI walk to the beat of my own drum (own drum..)
I tribe called myself I'm the only one
The road least travelled hasn't always been the lonely one
I represent an independent army holding golden guns
Freak shows weirdos those are my heroes
Glitches standing out amongst the ones and the zeroes
Why be born in binary
Destroy the system, be different be daring!
I swear we'll never be programmed
Control your destiny build your future with your own hands
Never thought you hear Murs and Kosha on a slow jam
Forever free thinkers we will bow down to no man

(chorus)
We are different we are different we are different
It's gonna be ok
We are different we are different we are different
It's gonna be ok
Verse 3
Running from shame
Looking for a co-sign
Never dope enough so I started sniffing coke lines
Broke as a joke and I landed on a gold mine
February 5th you know Super Bowl time
And I'm no Naptown Colts or Green Bay
But my team Jersey Shore rebuild the beach great
I see peeps on streets that still gon' keep hate
Real people give back we real not real fake ayyyy
I can understand it
If it come and panic
Saw an orange chair when I was on the acid
Took a couple pills put em up the asses
Now i'm spitting these lines they so classic
Everyone wants to fight me
Middle finger up to all the people who like me
All i ever wanted to do was fit in
But that's why none of these clothes are fittin'

(chorus)
We are different we are different we are different
It's gonna be ok
We are different we are different we are different
