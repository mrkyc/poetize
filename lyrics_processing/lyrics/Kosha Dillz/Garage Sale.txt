If you feel,that it's real
I'm on trial
And I'm here
In your prison
:
Hey, call me up, you tryin' to chill sometime?
732-742-6469
Hey, life ain't bad, got off the phone with my dad
29 years in the crib and he copped a new pad
So to bounce, said everything must go it's out of control
I'm talkin' mattresses, dinner tables, even the dog bowl
About my biz,, gas, call my peeps
Overseas locked up, college grads, you know all these streets
Makin' signs you know about a paintin' skis
We just roll around and find me in the attic and just go around it
And I'm confused, what in, what out
I got friends like, "Kosha feels he gotta clean his house!"
Clown for a bargain, hit Summer Jam, fightin' free
Missing everything, sellin' fire crackers, ice tea
And it ain't the end
I know what it's like, I'll be your friend

We about to hit the road so everything gotta go
If you feel that it's real

Steve likin' Bens shoelaces tighten them, I'm always nice to them
Neighbors, we do each other favors

Talk about the nonsense
Walk around the block kid
Chillin' with Arnold, new pair of fly kicks
Nintendo, Atari, Sega CD
Let go my ? great adventure safari
Synagog God books, comics and my baseball cards
Old war stuff in the crib, why y'all play so hard?
Each shoe is who, each team was one we the nicest
Garage sale is here, you can't beat these prices
Tea spoons, picture frames, see my life before I'm gettin' fame
Marilyn Monroe, back when see the illest dame
If the shoe don't fit, wear it anyway, try it out
Garage sale is here, you might as well try it out

Put the ad in the classified
You know I'm camera shy
Craigslist, yes kidding
Cleaning house the next tip
Gotta weigh stress, whether in a weight set
Bench press old skis, VHS tapes, what's next?
How about the old fridge?
Used to hold the old food
Now I'm on the health tip
No need for old school
Tonka trucks, ?, bag of jeans for the kids
Bargain shoppers love it, old computer
M-16 bullet shells from Israel
I'm a straight shooter
Desk for the homework
Since 1984, love letters, plenty more
? kid that you never saw
Michael Jackson notebook
Box of old stuff, what up in here? Oh what?
About to move on for the next show
Staying clean, an inside job, everything gotta go
