Wake up in da club
But I feel asleep at 11 now its 5 whats up
Hey wait ok wait what's your name?
My name's KOsha Oy Vey The AGency
Drink away the pain
Only a sip left
Is there a cherry in this coke? yes
Do you like cherries? yes
Cherry coke drinking
What are we thinking about
Are we sleeping at your or my house?
We can watch tv
Ashkanizi Kamikazi told you I'm always down to talk to Paparazzi
But this ain't TMZ / this just me and you in the place to be
And it's plain to see that you really like me
Let me go get a taxi

Chorus
See me in the club like what /staying all night till the sun come up
Fa lalala lalalala lahhh fa la la la  la la la la lahhh
Meet me at the bar like what/ bartender see I gotta empty cup
Fa lalala lalalala lahhh fa la la la  la la la la lahhh
