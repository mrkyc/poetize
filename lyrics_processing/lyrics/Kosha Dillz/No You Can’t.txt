Kosha Dillz user friendly for the kids
Being stupid as hell the smartest thing I ever did
Got a bachelors degree
And rapping is the biz
If I get a pHD i'm a get it in hustling
See the these on my life, my life is the shit
Since a fetus i was tight i been writing these hits no one catching on yet but i guarantee this
That when I blow up everyone send a text say i'm so proud of you
I knew you can do it
I'm like
"Bitch you ain't even know that kosha dillz was jewish!
You ain't ever copped a cd or listen to my music!!"
So how you gonna front like you ain't useless?"
- oh kosha baby
Watched my first porno back in the 80s
My whole life all in and ya'll just maybe
I know i'm a success
Cuz all ya'll hate me
Woop!

Chorus

So when you see me why you always need something

Can i get a NO YOU CANT
And all of ya'll be buggin
Wanna book me but ain't got no budget?
Can I get a?... NO YOU CANT
Can I get a?... NO YOU CANT
Verse 2
Kim jong dillz dilly wonka and the dillzionaires
Got a couple aka's you know itshella rare
Well rounded with a narrow mind
Late to my own show yo I'm never running out of time
Wake up say a couple prayers
God grant me the patience to help the haters
Egg cheese croissant ketchup with the taters
Make a couple calls get a couple favors
See me at the mall and I' balling with the mayor a
Listen to metallica pantera slayer
Everybody be like ay ay ay I'm getting paper
Recycle every thursday I'm nice with my word play
I'm out in LA but i represent jersey
Chorus
This track don't mean nothing
So when you see me why you always need something
Can i get a NO YOU CANT
Can i get a NO YOU CANT
And all of ya'll be buggin
Wanna book me but ain't got no budget?
Can I get a?... NO YOU CANT
Can I get a?... NO YOU CANT

Can i get a NO YOU CANT
And all of ya'll be buggin
Wanna book me but ain't got no budget?
Can I get a?... NO YOU CANT
