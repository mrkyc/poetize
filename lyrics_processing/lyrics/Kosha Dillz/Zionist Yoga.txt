My body is a temple
Pilates in the jungle
Well I invented post-its I'm that king of the hustle
I used to order Summer Slam on pay-per view
All my friends would come over and they wanted Royal Rumble
I played baseball with an eye patch
Watch war movies in Chad with Paulie Shore like they was Iraq
Find fat on the chicken i'm a cut it off
19 ,frat parties, selling weed fucking raw but 
I ain't caught nothing
I'm clean at 23 and now Im 31 in
On tour for 4 years and I still ain't got nothing
Walkin to the bank with a blank check but the teller said
"Yo son you bugging!"
See my rapping now, yoga flame swag it out
Even thought I'm spiritual dont mean I'm whack as hell and lacking style
I met a girl in a white dress she put her hand on my chest and I felt a beam of light next

Chorus
You might also likeIf you wanna feel it breathe in (breath..)
If you want some healing breath out (out!)
I'm a beam of light and it's feeling kind of weird but I'm feeling kind of right
Meditating all night
If you wanna feel it breathe in (breath..)
If you want some healing breath out (out!)
I'm a beam of light and it's feeling kind of weird but I'm feeling kind of right
Meditating all night

Verse 2
I'm happy as a goon
Still feeling kind of doomed
Scared truth of a werewolf howling at the moon
I've taken all these shrooms
Mistaken for legumes
Now I'm feeling all alone, I'm feeling all alone
And I wish I had thrown for a princess to go share it with (hi)
Until then lemon juice, cayan peper carrot tips (hi)
Body cleanse, Gotty friends
See what Dalai Lama says
I'm so fucked up I don't know when Rosh-hash -hash Hashanah is
Indian style barefoot you know the posture kid
Green tea same color as the marijuana stick
And then came again the girl in the white dress
I prayed for you last night I knew you gonna write this!
Chorus
If you want to feel it breathe in (inhale)
If you want some healing breath out
I'm a beam of light and it's feeling kind of weird
But Im feeling kind of right
Meditating all night!

Bridge
I'm a Pico prince with the Zionist Yoga handbook but I dont know how to play
I dont care who you are or where the hell you from as long as you meditate and pray
I'm a Pico prince with the Zionist Yoga handbook but I dont know how to play
I dont care who you are or where the hell you from but tell me where you at today! (Right Here!)

Chorus
If you want to feel it breathe in (inhale)
If you want some healing breath out
I'm a beam of light and it's feeling kind of weird
But Im feeling kind of right
Meditating all night!
If you want to feel it breathe in (inhale)
If you want some healing breath out
I'm a beam of light and it's feeling kind of weird
But Im feeling kind of right
