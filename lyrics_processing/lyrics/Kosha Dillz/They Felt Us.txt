Oh Dillz chuck it
So many records my haters gotta suck  it
I'm in streets catching $2 bills in all my buckets
Whats in my bucket list
Rappers dont wan come for this
I was born different
Middle row that's on my comfort tip
Grateful for less so I always get more
20,000 streams I'm selling out shows at my local corner store
Merchandise I hope you order more
Need a verse from a legend like me?
You gon have to fill out this order form
No car i go thru stop signs that makes me unstoppable
Made hella mistakes in my life i get paid to tell you what not to do
Buy vintage don't cop it new
Solo in the club dont got the crew
Board last first class is not the move
Half the price one man miss now you rocking two
YEAH
Ok i'm brighter than that
Ya flow so loosey goosey ok i'm tighter than that
Sink my teeth up into this beef I hear the pain thru the flavor
Competing with myself don't compare me man it's so major

My growth is taking off not united or delta
I see a person down this year you know they getting helped up
From hawaii to dubai THEY know that they felt us
Hands up in the sky  flow so ice cold they can't melt us
My growth is taking off not united or delta
I see a person down this year you know they getting helped up
From hawaii to dubai YOU know that they felt us
Hands up in the sky  flow so ice cold they can't melt us

VERSE 2
I deserve to relax on an island
I deserve not to be on rehab or prison wyling
I could complain
Beren lower than low mein
Been higher than high octane
No gas in my gas tank dang
Riding trains find the pain its amazing
Been over.2 years since i been to meetings in basements
Back to the basics
News years show up early  and stay late kid
No matter what your mind state is
Consistency into me you don't gotta pay its free
Make decision who ya kidding alphabet you double down my g
Im gucci with that
Time to make movies in fact
The problem with keeping it real no one just know how to act ok
Remind ya self of whjat the work is and what is the purpose
Be careful who ya share ya blessing with and who ya work with
Make sure you keep ya head centered when you maneuver
Win slow right now , not too fast in future with losers
CHORUS
