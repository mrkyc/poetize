Been down probably stay here
No expectations just to make clear
My family saw me behind bars and outside standing with the same fears
So whats that mean?
We ain't steer in the right direction session that I'm in a blessing
No hashtag #blessed kid
Hashtag #yomylifesamess kid
Can't realte with relationships
Yo im not into hating
But I hate these kids
Stupid is and dumb it down make me rich
But im too complex for the basicness of
Getting press in a magazine
Not the music that  create a hit
Give you five since the 86
My whole life uncommitted maybe kid
Change the world not my message innner freedom let it ring
Biggest fear wake up in the morning and then forget everything
Change the world not my message inner freedom let it ring
Biggest fear wake up in the morning no one help me get up when I am

SAVE ME
You might also likeVERSE 2
All alone in the studio
Me vs me in the  mirror slow
Therapeutic slavery monotonous i can't hear it though
Put me on that lexapro
Fakesness is contagious placebo for people that struggle
And still think that they make it
But I know that I die inside every time that I take it
So if I really want future
I need to wake up create it
Lately Im taking mine along this journey with this bass
Laced by Baby Haim
In the marathon of life and Im racing time
Dont believe me just watch
Seen everything on the scene but dont stop
Why isnt that me on stage I need to rock
My urge to succeed and stay off the block
When the hell is my career gonna pop?
When the hell are my fears gonna stop
When the hell is my career gonna pop?
Whens my career gonna pop? Pop!
