You sure are looking fine
I just had to look you up
'Cause, you've been on my mind
It's been awhile, we've been apart
I've finally had a chance to search my heart
It doesn't seem to matter what I do
I still keep thinkin' about me and you
Let's pretend we're still in love
And the stars above, are shining for you and me
Let's pretend our love is kissed, on a night like this
Make it like it used to be
Just close your eyes (we're still in love)
And let's pretend (we're still in love)
We're still in love (we're still in love)
Looking back, we didn't have a care
When we were young and wild
And when I think about the time we shared
It always makes me smile
We had it good, we had it bad
I'm always thinking about the times we had
It doesn't seem to matter what I do
I still keep dreamin' about me and you, me and you

And the stars above, are shining for you and me
Let's pretend that there's still a flame
And it could be the same, exactly like a memory
Just close your eyes (we're still in love)
And let's pretend (we're still in love)
We're still in love (we're still in love)
I'm still in love with you, baby, yeah
If I could have you back, I'd surely pay the price
I'd do most anything, I'd make a sacrifice
I'd walk a hundred miles, down on my bended knees
I need your lovin' back, listen to me please
Let's pretend we're still in love
And the stars above are shining for you and me (they're shining, baby)
Let's pretend there's still a flame, and it can be the same
Make it like a memory (it's a sweet memory)
Let's pretend there's still romance, and take another chance
Baby just you and me (so, one more time)
Let's pretend that we're still in love, that we're still in love
Just close your eyes (we're still in love)
Just close your eyes, baby
And let's pretend (we're still in love)
Come on and go with me
We're still in love (we're still in love)
I'm still in love with you, baby, yeah
In the morning, in the evening, Ah-ha
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're still in love
