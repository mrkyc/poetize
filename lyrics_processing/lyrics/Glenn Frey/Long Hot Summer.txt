It's a hundred and ten in the shade
It feels like the devil moved here himself
To see the trouble he made
Everybody's 'bout to go insane
They're crazy from the heat
Nobody wants to go outside
There's danger in the street
It's gonna be a long, hot summer
People dream of leavin' town
Get ready for a long, hot summer
Feel the hammer comin' down, comin' down
You see the heat comin' up from the sidewalk
You can feel the temperature rise
All I see is a blazin' sun
Burning a hole in the sky
I never thought that it would be like this
24 hours a day
It's too hot to sleep, we're in trouble so deep
And you know there's no running away
It's gonna be a long, hot summer
This place is like a burning hell
Get ready fot a long, hot summer
There ain't no water in the well
It's a long, hot summer
A lot of sweat and misery
It's a long, hot summer
It's killin' you and killin' me
You might also likeSo you scream and shout, but there's no way out
You just live with a lock on your door
There's a fire in the sky and the earth is so dry
Like a cracking ground you can't take anymore
It's three o'clock in the morning (don't do it)
You wait for the sirens to moan (don't do it)
You stare at the trigger, but somehow you figure
You don't feel like dying alone (don't do it)
The mean streets are gettin' meaner
Everybody's got a gun
This ain't no city, it's a nightmare darlin'
We're all dying in the sun
It's gonna be a long, hot summer
People dream of leavin' town
Get ready for a long, hot summer
Feel the hammer comin' down
It's a long, hot summer
Haven't seen a drop of rain
It's a long, hot summer
