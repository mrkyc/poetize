When the sun refused to shine
Spent another sleepless night
Got so much on my mind
Think I finally know what's wrong
I think I've gotta leave this place behind
So I said wake up, Linda
I've had a dream
I dreamed we moved away from here
To a place I'd never seen
Where the nights were long and cold
And the air was fresh and clean
And there we were standing
Underneath the western sky
Beside a home we built ourselves
Way up in the mountains high
And we lived happy there, just you and I
On a river of dreams
There's no need to worry now
Cause I've got a plan
We don't need this modern world
I'm not a modern man
We're gonna get ourselves off these city streets
We're gonna get back on the land
You might also likeThere's a whole lot of people out there
Feel just like you and me
They'd love to pack their leavin' trucks
And say goodbye to all their misery
What'd ya say we pack up that Camaro, honey
And chase the sun until we're free
And if I could I'd lift you up on angel wings
We'd fly away and never worry about a thing
We'd know the joy and riches a simple life can bring
On a river of dreams, on a river of dreams
So get your things together now
I'll be getting mine
I've finally got the feeling girl
The sun is gonna shine
You know people don't run out of dreams
People just run out of time
Let's find that place out there
Underneath the western sky
We'll build a home ourselves
Way up in the mountains high
We'll live happy there 'til the day we die
On a river of dreams
And we'll have stars to wish on every single night
We'll build a fire and make love by candlelight
We'll do our moondance 'til we get it right
On a river of dreams, on a river of dreams
I can see us standing by the river
