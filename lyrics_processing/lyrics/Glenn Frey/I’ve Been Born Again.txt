I'm a brand new man (kind of brand new)
I've been born again
Saturday night in the city
Parties on every block
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party
But my party days had to stop
So brothers you can keep your street life
Changin' women like you change your clothes
Cause every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one
My love just grows and grows
Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
Oh, I'm not a casanova
My playin' days are over
I think I'm gonna start me a fire
Got my matchbox in my hand
Burnin' up the pages in my little black book
Start my life all over again
I don't need no women in excess
I can't afford to spread my lovin' around
Cause when my woman, she's needin' me by her side
I just don't wanna let her down

I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
Oh, I'm not a casanova
My playin' days are over
Now I don't need a lot of women
Just to prove my manhood
I got me one special woman
So I can be the man that I should
Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)
I've been born again (There's a change in me)
