Go ahead, some lies on your face
What about him? You didn't love him anyway
Look how much you made
Goes for you but not look shit, you got tricks up your sleeve
Take you to the Hills to fuck on your face
Love you more than the drugs that I take
Neglection from the underworld got you virally
Still falling from the same game you fell for privately
You ought to be where you say you are, but roses don't grow overnight
You took a few bites, I didn't think you was a'ight
I'll try to get over in my afterlife, this life right here ain't a'ight
