Seem like shit is getting worse
Before it's getting better
It's like the people got a curse
Can't nobody stay together?
I watch 'em gun my people down
Plus we're killing off each other, no, oh, no
Ain't no justice for the brothers, no, no

See the red lights behind his car
Only thing he thinking is this could be the end of me
Say "Officer, what's the problem?"
It's like every time I turn around you people always messing with me
He say "You look suspicious
And you fit the description of a call about a robbery"
Then some more cops came
I keep my hands where they can see 'em
I know this could be the end of me

They say that
We all created equal but ain't nothing about us equal
You know that
There could never be no justice when killing us is legal
Somebody's gotta take a stand
Sacrifice and be a man
Somebody's gotta take a stand, nah, nah, no, no

4 A.M. in the morning
Police's banging real hard on my mama front door
Screaming "Open this shit right now
You got twenty more seconds before we tear this door down"
Then they handcuffed my mama
Then they handcuffed my granny
Handcuffed my sister
Then some more cops came
Them crackers tore our ass up, never even showed a warrant
They say that
