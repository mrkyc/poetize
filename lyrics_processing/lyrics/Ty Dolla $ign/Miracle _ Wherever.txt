Another Midtown Classic

Life, life's a miracle and a blessing
Every trial and test is a lesson
Gotta seek the truth and stop guessing
Ain't got no room for doubts, so ask questions
Knowledge is the most powerful weapon
Gotta forward march, no half-stepping
I've learned, learned, learned, oh-woah, oh-woah
My momma really, really tried to keep me out the terrors
"Boy, stay up out the hood" (Yeah)
And everything they told me that I can't to show 'em that I could, oh, yeah
People always told me I was bad, I was misunderstood
But I admit that I was lost
Click, click, do ya, do ya (Yeah, do ya)
I had to learn to halt, smoke burnin' longer, oh, oh
It's a miracle I'm still standing (Still standing)
Fuckin' with the crosstown, beefin' in my own town, only in the mid-town
Never thought that I would make it, but on my momma, I'm on now

(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
It's a miracle, oh, woah, woah

I remember when they doubted us
Kicked us while we was down, don't want to help us up, damn
Indoctrinated and banging before I could bust a nut
Cuttin' up, couldn't shut 'em up, now I'm on my way upstate, locked up
Think gang things done changed, paying for wet up
This remind me of the time I survived
But in my mind, I knew that my date came up, knew it was God
Momma tried, but couldn't save him
And now, we on our way up
Auntie Em', now, that prison brick on the way
Anticipate and they say it like waiting on judgment day (Huh)
Now, they praise us
But we downplay fame and stay prayed up
Look, where we came from
Yeah, we caged up
But they couldn't enslave us, now, they're payin' us, yup (It's a miracle)

(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
It's a miracle, oh, woah, woah
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle
It's a miracle, oh, woah

It's a miracle
How they stayed hatin' on us, guess they didn't know
We them boys, we them niggas
Look at all this money and all these bitches
But it's the realness of a millions
Keep God first and fuck them niggas
That switched up and got caught up in they feelings
I kept my ten toes down like I'm s'posed to
Stay focused like I'm s'posed to
And stay away from them broke dudes
Like I'm s'posed to
Oh, yeah, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
'Cause on my momma, I'm on now

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) It's a miracle (Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle (It's a miracle)
(Oh, oh) It's a miracle (Oh, oh)
It's a miracle, ooh, woah, woah (Oh)

It's a miracle, oh, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

I, I wanna know what it do
How did we end up in this bathroom?
If you don't mind, I don't, either
Long as we can keep a secret, we'll be fine
Bend you right over the sink
'Til I make that thing leak
Drippin' down your leg
'Til it hit your feet, oh

Girl, we do it whenever
Girl, we do it whenever
Whenever, wherever
Wherever, babe (Wherever)
Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no (Whenever)
Wherever, baby (Wherever, whenever)
Oh (Wherever, ooh, yeah)

In the jeep when I pick you up
From your momma house (Yeah)

Couldn't wait 'til we got down the block (Shit), uh
Girl, you know I can't drive with you in my lap
You a beast, you an animal
Way you ride that pole (That pole), oh
You remind me of Aaliyah when you rock that boat (That boat), row, row
Lil' momma give me head riding down the highway (Down the highway), uh
Pull up then start fuckin' in the driveway (In the driveway), uh
Baby girl sex crazy (Crazy)
Everytime we fuck is so amazin'
She my lil' freak (Ooh, yeah)
She my lil' baby (Uh-uh-uh, yeah)
