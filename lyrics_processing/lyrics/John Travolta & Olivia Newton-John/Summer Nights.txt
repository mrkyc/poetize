Summer lovin', had me a blast

Summer lovin', happened so fast

I met a girl crazy for me

Met a boy cute as can be

Summer days driftin' away
To, uh oh, those summer nights

Well-a, well-a, well-a, uh
Tell me more, tell me more

Did you get very far?

Tell me more, tell me more

Like does he have a car?

Ah-ha / doo-do
Ah-ha / doo-do
Ah-ha / doo-do, doo-doo-doo

She swam by me, she got a cramp (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

He ran by me, got my suit damp (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

I saved her life, she nearly drowned (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

He showed off splashin' around (Doo-ba-ba-ba, doo-ba-ba-ba)

Summer sun, something's begun
But, uh oh, those summer nights

Well-a, well-a, well-a, uh
Tell me more, tell me more

Was it love at first sight?

Tell me more, tell me more

Did she put up a fight?

Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo  / Uh-huh, uh-huh
Doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, Uhhh-huh
Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo  / Uh-huh, uh-huh
Doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, Uhhh-huh

Took her bowlin' in the arcade (Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)

We went strollin', drank lemonade (Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)

We made out under the dock (Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)
We stayed out till ten o'clock (Doo-ra-ra, doo-ra-ra, doo-ra-ra)

Summer fling don't mean a thing
But, uh oh, those summer nights

Woah, woah, woah

Tell me more, tell me more

But you don't gotta brag

Tell me more, tell me more

'Cause he sounds like a drag

Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Shooda-bop bop
Yeah

He got friendly holding my hand (Shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop)

Well, she got friendly down in the sand (Shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop)

He was sweet, just turned eighteen (Shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, yeah)

Well, she was good, you know what I mean (Wow, wow, ooo, wow, wow)

Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But, uh oh, those summer nights

Woah, woah, woah

Tell me more, tell me more

How much dough did he spend?

Tell me more, tell me more

Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder, that's where it ends

So I told her we'd still be friends

Then we made our true love vow

Wonder what she's doin' now

Summer dreams ripped at the seams
But, oh, those summer nights
