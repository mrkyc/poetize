From the day you sang and stole my heart
And hey delilah still runs through my head
And every night i'm told to go to bed
I have my phone and talk to you instead
Still the rings under my eyes are
Rainbow color filled with sunlight
I can't get you off my mind and i
I tell all my friends to call me blue
I like kissing,standin,dancing in the rain
And screaming out my lung just to call your name
I hope everything's okay with you
With love from blue,with love from blue
Then you didn't always call that
Didn't mean a thing at all but then
I started sinking down and you
Weren't there for me
I don't know what happened you fell
Not attracted and this is harder then i ever imagined
Rainbow color filled with sunlight
I can't get you off my mind and i
I tell all my friends to call me blue
You might also likeI like kissing,standin,dancing in the rain
And screaming out my lung just to call your name
Rainbow color filled with sunlight
I can't get you off my mind and i
I tell all my friends to call me blue
I like kissing,standin,dancing in the rain
And screaming out my lung just to call your name
After all the magic was over
You wanted out and love doesn't last forever
Woah
But being friends just isn't enough for me
So i'm sorry that it's gone wrong
But because of you my life is still
Rainbow color filled with sunlight
I can't get you off my mind and i
I tell all my friends to call me blue
I like kissing,standin,dancing in the rain
And screaming out my lung just to call your name
Rainbow color filled with sunlight
I can't get you off my mind and i
I tell all my friends to call me blue
I like kissing,standin,dancing in the rain
And screaming out my lung just to call your name
I hope everything's okay with you
With love from blue,with love from blue
You still have that blue guitar
But you don't sing anymore and you broke my heart
