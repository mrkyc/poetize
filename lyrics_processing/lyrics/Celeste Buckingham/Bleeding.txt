I don't wanna fight you but aren't you a liar
I don't wanna be the man in black no i am not fighter
I don't wanna be your enemy but i just can't get higher
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need that sensuality
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need you for me to breathe
No it's not no it's not
It's not a way you'r hands control me
It's not a way i say i want you in my ear
You got me hooked i think you know
When you love me i just start to lose control
I find myself bleeding out for you
I know you don't love me cause you never said the words
But baby i just miss you and i love so much this hurts
I don't mean to critisize but there's nothing left to love
No i cannot sympathize in fact i've had enough
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need that sensuality
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need you for me to breathe
You might also likeNo it's not no it's not
It's not a way you'r hands control me
It's not a way i say i want you in my ear
You got me hooked i think you know
When you love me i just start to lose control
I find myself bleeding out for you
I 'm bleeding i 'm fading but i keep on holding on
Dependant defendant
But you still do whatever you want
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need that sensuality
And yes i'll try to use you like your using me
Now that i know i need you for me to breathe
No it's not no it's not
It's not a way you'r hands control me
