Take my edges away
And try to make me something different
You think you can mold me
Like I'm made of clay
And erase all my innocence
Don't put me in a box 'cause my soul is all I got
And I ain't getting another one
Oh I may feel a lot
But I'm not sorry
I'm not worried
I'm not ashamed to be the girl I am
I can't hide it
Not trying to fight it
I'm just doing the very best that I can
You want me to lie and apologize
For what's inside of me
But I'm not sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry, no, I'm not sorry
So go ahead and hate me
For who I am
Or love me for who I'll never be
It's not always pretty
I'll get black and blue
There's more to me than you'll ever see
You might also likeYou don't like what I am
You don't think that I can
Well I don't need your approval
No you won't understand
But I'm not sorry
I'm not worried
I'm not ashamed to be the girl I am
I can't hide it
Not trying to fight it
I'm just doing the very best that I can
You want me to lie and apologize
For what's inside of me
But I'm not sorry no I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry no I'm not sorry
It's not wrong when I make a mistake
So what do you want?
Do you wanna see me break?
But I'm not sorry
I'm not worried
I'm not ashamed to be the girl I am
I can't hide it
Not trying to fight it
I'm just doing the very best that I can
So I'm not sorry
I'm not worried
I'm not ashamed to be the girl I am
I can't hide it
Not trying to fight it
I'm just doing the very best that I can
You want me to lie and apologize
For what's inside of me
But I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry (sorry)
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
