Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mama's in a corner crying
Daddy's upset 'cause he's out of work again
We don't care, we just keep on pretending
'Cause nobody here seems to feel the need to complain
Oh, we're all made of the same material
We're all just variations of the same
But the way we live is beyond surreal
At least that's what they say
You need to stay sane

The lights are on but no one's home
Am I the only one who feels alone?

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
No, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Could you want to, would you even try to?
Nobody knows where this girl's been
No, nobody knows where this girl's been
Gonna fade into the wall
So don't catch me when I fall
Don't catch me when I fall
You might also like
Tell me why I gave up the believing, yeah
That lying is the only way for me
Yeah, I gave up a lot of dreaming
It took some time but now I finally see

The lights are on but no one's home
Am I the only one who feels alone?

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
No, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Could you want to, would you even try to?
Uh, nobody knows where this girl's been
No, nobody knows where this girl's been
Gonna fade into the wall
Don't catch me when I fall

I've fallen many times before
But I always got back up
And now I have no place to go
The only place is up

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
No, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Would you want to, could you even try to?
Nobody knows where this girl's been
No, nobody knows where this girl's been
Gonna fade into the wall
Don't catch me when I fall
