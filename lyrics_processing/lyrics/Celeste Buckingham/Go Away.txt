There's a reason we don't hang out no more
You've changed since I left this house and this home
This house ain't no home, uh
This house ain't no home
You tried my patience, you kept your mouth shut
Left my heart broken, no words are enough
To mend what you done, uh
To mend what you done, so...

Go away, leave me with myself
Go away, don't need this hell, so
Go away, just go away, now
Go away, now, go away
Go away, leave me with myself
Go away, don't need this hell, so
Go away, just go away, now
Go away, now, go away

You know our love was killin' me
But you took advantage of me anyway
And now you're just wishin' you did things differently
You did things differently
You know our love was killin' me
But you took advantage of me anyway
And now you're just wishin' you did things differently
You did things differently, differently
You did things differently, differently
You did things differently, differently
You did things
You're just wishin' you did things differently
You did things differently, differently

You got me twistin' myself out of shape
Tryna adjust to your conceited ways
Why you in my way? Yeah

Go away, leave me with myself
Go away, don't need this hell, so
Go away, just go away, now
Go away, now, go away

Screw you, yeah, ain't got time for these
These feelings, why you gotta be hatin' on me for me?
Know what I said, I always say what I mean
Why you gotta go and ruin everything?
Why you, yeah, ain't got time for these
You used to swear you gotta be all over me for me
Know what I said, and always say what I mean
Why you gotta go and ruin everything?
Go ahead, then, go now
I don't want you 'round no
It's enough that you keep comin' back like it ain't no thing
Go ahead, then, get out
I don't wanna know how
You keep crawlin' in
Despite me sayin' I want you to, to

Go away
Go away
Go away, just go away, now
Go away, now, go away

Baby
When did this get so crazy?
Why you be sayin', "Maybe"?
I don't like this, it's too messy
Too crazy
But, baby
When did this get so crazy?
Why you be sayin', "Maybe"?
I don't like this, it's too messy
