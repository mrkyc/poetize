All is fair in love and war
But all i do is love you more
Our love is crazy ,unhealthy
But i can't
Keep from you baby
So you said "why even bother
Set this love set me on fire"
How i wish
You'd be the victim
So you'd see
Just how I'm feeling

You better know know know
That i have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I I I want nothing less than
What i deserve
So you better run run run
Before i decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You might also like
Somehow i don't get the picture
Don't know why you are the winner
Our love is not what we wanted but baby
You finish just what you started
So you said "why even bother'
Set this love set me on fire"
How i wish
You'd know me better
So you'd see
What I'm trying to say

You better know know know
That i have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I I I want nothing less than
What i deserve
So you better run run run
Before i decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You are the cause of all this pain and
You are the reason I'm upset
You are the cause of all this pain
But you are the cause of all this love
You are the thing i can't forget

You better know know know
That i have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I I I want nothing less than
What i deserve
So you better run run run
Before i decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know know know
That i have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I I I want nothing less than
What i deserve
So you better run run run
Before i decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know know know
That i have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I I I want nothing less than
What i deserve
So you better run run run
Before i decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
