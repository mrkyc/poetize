I promised i would pay
My debts and my dues
I have no regrets
But you haven't caught me in no not in bed
But i have no excuse
Except hold me and tell me
That you'll be here to love me
Everynight
And that somehow you'll miss me
And all of my fooling around and fights
Our love is bittersweet it's tasty but it's weak
The morning kiss again still burns me on my cheek
No i dont need a mother i dont need a brother
To telling me what to do
But this dont matter
Hello stranger
I must confess that you are still the best
Cause the rest don't love me like you do
But this pain in my chest
That i feel when i ur
You got me thinking of you
Oh what should i do
It was easy before you said you loved me
Thats just sad
Now i want you to hate me
And tell me you're angry
When im bad
I'm bad ..
I'm bad ...
