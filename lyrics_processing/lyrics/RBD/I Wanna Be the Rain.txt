The rain
(The rain, the rain)

It's not enough to be the one who holds you
It's not enough to be the one you're close to
I want to be so much more
The love that you are living for
The air you breathe
I wanna be everything that touches you, everything

I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

It's not enough for me to be around you
I wanna be everything that surrounds you
The sunlight upon your skin
Each breathe that you're breathing in
Or that you need
I wanna be everything that touches you everyday
You might also like
I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away your pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

And even in your sleep, where you are dreaming
I wanna be the only thing you see
Won't you be there? In everything...

I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away your pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

(Washes away the pain)
I wanna be the ra-a-a-ain
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Rain)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ra-a-a-ain
