I'm down-folded on this roller coaster they call life
Keep trying to make it through the next turn
Knuckles white and holding tight

So here I go (So here I go), takin' a curve
But I know that I'm never alone
I think of you (Think of you)
Until you'd never let me go

I feel connected, protected
It's like you're sitting right
With me all the time
You hear me, you're near me
And everything else's gonna be all right
'Cause nothing can break this
Nothing can break this, nothin' can break this tie
Connected
Connected in time

It's not an accident, the time we spent apart
But now we are so close
I can always find you right here in my heart
You might also like
You're givin' me (Givin' me) somethin' I need
And I don't ever want it to end
Because of you (Because of you)
I know I've found my strength again

I feel connected, protected
It's like you're sitting right
With me all the time
You hear me, you're near me
And everything else's gonna be all right
'Cause nothing can break this
Nothing can break this, nothin' can break this tie
Connected
Connected in time

Everytime that I breathe, I can feel the energy
Reachin' out, *flowin' through*
You to me and me to you (Yeh-eh)
Wake or dream, walk or stand
You are everywhere I am
Separate souls, unified
You are always in my mind
You're givin' me (Givin' me) somethin' I need
And I don't ever want it to end
Because of you (Because of you)
I know I've found my strength again

I feel connected, protected
It's like you're sitting right
With me all the time
You hear me, you're near me
And everything else's gonna be all right
Connected, protected
It's like you're sitting right
With me all the time
You hear me, you're near me
And everything else's gonna be all right
'Cause nothing can break this
Nothing can break this, nothin' can break this tie
