I find you standing there
Telling me you're sorry
A lonely tear rolling down your face
You hold me
Then time stops
I struggle to kiss you
And you just take my breath away

Just hold on for a second, my love
Just to tell me this whole thing is wrong

Won't you please just keep it down low?
Spare me five minutes
I wanna feel your sweet and soft touch
All over me
Let this kiss to last forever
We're both off limits
As we wrap it up, we'll both know
That the end it's just right here

Right here, woah, woah
You might also like
I'm feeling too scared now
Just trying to understand
Why this love couldn't be crystal clear? (Crystal clear)
Your lips feel so freezing
Demanding sweet kissing
Is it the air? 'Cause I just can't breathe

Just hold on for a second, my love (For a second)
Just to tell me this whole thing is wrong

Won't you please just keep it down low?
Spare me five minutes
I wanna feel your sweet and soft touch
All over me
Let this kiss to last forever
We're both off limits
As we wrap it up, we'll both know
That the end it's just right here

Please hold my hand, love
My breath won't come back again
Say that you love me
That you're not the one to blame
At least for just one second
I believe your words are true love
Won't you please just keep it down low?
I wanna feel your sweet and soft touch
Let this kiss to last forever
As we wrap it up, we'll both know
That the end it's just right here
Won't you please just keep it down low?
Spare me five minutes
I wanna feel your sweet and soft touch
All over me
Let this kiss to last forever
We're both off limits (We're both off limits)
As we wrap it up, we'll both know
