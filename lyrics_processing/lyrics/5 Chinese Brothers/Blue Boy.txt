Ain't nothing illegal about his work
Police detective, he's getting impatient
Says "I'm going to bust that irresponsible jerk"
Cause he picked him up in the park the other day
Took him downtown and all he would say was
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Ooh, it's gone
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Ooh, it's gone
One day the Blue Boy might punch a one-way ticket
So the detective pays a visit to the crime lab
The scientist says, "This is powerful stuff, you may not lick it
That Blue Boy's running up one hell of a tab"
And Blue Boy he's getting farther out of sight
You know where I saw him? (Where?)
Lost is space last night, singing
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Ooh, it's gone
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Ooh, it's gone

But Blue Boy knows he holds the world in the palm of his hand
Blue Boy thinks that he's a masterpiece for all
In a museum, that's where he belongs
Police detective says "He's more like a gopher ball
I mean he's going, going, gone!"
And the kids they watch the Blue Boy on tv
And they suspect that he's not real and say
"That's the way I want to be" singing
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Ooh, it's gone
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
Look at that train
Look at that train, look at that train, look at that train
