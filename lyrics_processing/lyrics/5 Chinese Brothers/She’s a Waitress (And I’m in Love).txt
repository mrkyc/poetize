When she brings you your food and she takes it away
She smiles at you when you clean your plate
Makes you feel like a big strong man
Is she winking at you or is that something in her eye?
Are you making too much of her giggles and sighs?
The only thing you've talked about is coffee and fries
But she's a waitress so she understands
So, you take my order, I'll take my time
I'm looking you over while I'm making up my mind
Put on the skillet, put on the bread
I'll pretend I'm home, getting breakfast in bed
She don't leave me fed up, she just leaves me well fed
She's a waitress and she understands
In her tight uniform with a low-cut neck
And the way that the grease mixes with her sweat
She smells as good as the inside of a new Corvette
She fits your dreams like a baseball glove
And when she smiles at you, that's when you realize
That's not the way she smiles at all the other guys
You see her sneak a peek from behind the pies
She's a waitress, and you're in love
You might also likeNow you see her give the fry-cook a secret kiss
And the ring on her finger that you previously missed
Maybe you're not the guy she can't resist
And your breakfast is almost done
So you swear that you'll never fool yourself anymore
Then you remember as you're walking out the door
There's still lunch and dinner and a thousand meals more
With a waitress at every one
She smells as good as the inside of a new Corvette
She fits your dreams like a baseball glove
And when she smiles at you, that's when you realize
That's not the way she smiles at all the other guys
You see her sneak a peek from behind the pies
