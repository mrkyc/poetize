Don't know where I'd go but I sure know that I'd go far
Head a million miles from here, find myself a new home
What if that place turns out to be the same as the place from which I came?
What if I've got it good here and I don't even know?
What if that's why I'm still here when I really want to go?
I want to get away, I want to stay
I want to be free, I want you to build your world around me
I wish I could understand the meaning of my dreams
I wish I could write a song as good as Visions of Johanna
When I do will the heavens open and the angels sing hosanna?
I mean, how will I know I've done it? How will I realize?
When I sing it will a vision of you dance before my eyes?
And having something like that I'd have to try to top
Might be even worse than never having not NO!
I wish I could hear what I'm saying now and smile
All the same, I haven't finished a song in a long, long while
I want to get away, I want to stay
I want to be free, I want you to build your world around me
I wish I could understand the meaning of my dreams
I dreamed the world was crumbling all around me
There in the rubble on the ground you found me
And I pull you tight I want to hold you close
At the same time I can't stay, I've got to go
You might also likeAnd there's that car but it's all out of gas
I can tell by the speedometer it's the kind that goes real fast
I could be someone, be someone, you know I surely could
If I could stand on the rock where Moses stood
I want to get away, I want to stay
I want to be free, I want you to build your world around me
I wish I could understand the meaning of my dreams
I want to get away, I want to stay
I want to be free, I want you to build your world around me
