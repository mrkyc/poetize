I've been waiting for you
No, please, don't say anything
There's something I want to say to you
Remember
When I said someday we'd be together?
Well, someday is tonight

Here we are, just you and me
Got something for you, baby, wait and see
No need to worry, come follow me
I don't want you to think about anything else tonight
We've been together for quite sometime
Now I know that your love is mine
No more fantasizin' of how it would be
'Cause tonight, all your dreams come true

Ready to give all my love, won't hold back
Someday is tonight
Let me make your dreams come true, don't hold back
Someday is tonight

You know I promised I'd be worth the wait
Now the wait is over, baby, please don't hesitate
Boy, you make me tremble with your warm caress
I never knew I could feel this way
No more fantasizin' you'll ever have to do
'Cause tonight, baby, all your dreams come true
I want you so bad, I can taste it
I'm yours, if you want me
