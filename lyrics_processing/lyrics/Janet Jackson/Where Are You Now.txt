Love, my love
I regret the day you went away
I was too young to understand, my love
But now I realize my mistakes

Where, where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else's?

Love, oh, my love
I wonder sometimes, were you just a dream?
I sit in the dark wondering if our paths will ever cross again
Oh Lord, I need to know
I sit and wonder

Where, where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me
Or does your heart belong to someone else's?

If I close my eyes and make a wish
When they open, will you be right here with me?
Where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then

Could it be that two people were meant to be? Yeah, yeah
In my dreams, that's what I feel
Could it be that I'll never see you again?
My love, that was so true
Still, I sit here waiting all alone
By the phone for you
Now I understand (Now I understand)
You said "I love you"
I sit and wonder

Where, where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me
Or does your heart belong to someone else's?
(If I close my eyes)
If I close my eyes (If I make a wish)
And I make a wish (Tell me baby, tell me, baby)
When they open, will you be right here with me?
(Where are you now?)
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Now that I'm ready to (Ready to, ready to)
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
(I keep looking for you) Where are you now?
(Looking, searching for you) Do you still think of me
(I keep looking for you)
Or does your heart belong to someone else's?
(Well, my baby, you know what you do to me)
