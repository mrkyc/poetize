Baby, I like it when it feels this good
You always seem to make me smile
And can't nobody do what you do
When you love me just a little while
I, I know you got somewhere to go
And I got somewhere to be right now
I'll make them wait all day long
If you wanna get a little wild

I don't want to be a distraction to you, no no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I wanna make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while

I, I like sleeping in your clothes
To smell you makes it all come down
When I think about me and you
Sometimes I get a little loud
Baby, I know we did it all night long
And I didn't want to burn you out
'Cause you know how much I like to do it
In the morning it's another round

I don't know if you have other things to do, no no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I'm gonna make it like a dream for you
And turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while
My passion flows like a river that has no end
I wanna know everything you'll let me do to you

Tell me what you like, baby
You wanna play with my strawberry?
Sometimes when I think about me and you
I can get real loud

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I wanna make it like a dream for you
And turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while

Just love me
Just love me for a little while (I'll take it anywhere for you)
Just love me for a little while (You make my juices flow)
Just love me for a little while (Tell me everything you'll let me do to you)
