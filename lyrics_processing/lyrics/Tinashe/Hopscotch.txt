Alright, we got another beautiful day here in sunny Los Angeles, California
Let's take a look at our seven day forecast
We're seeing lots of sunshine all week long
Temperature's in the mid to upper 70s
And don't forget, it's Taco Tuesdays
We got blow, hoes, and indo

Hey, when I'm lonely, I always go up
Top dropped, feel like Otis, I always pull up
Two time, never on me, assume the shit is nice
I love when you notice, you know I go nuts
Dip-dip like a donut, I'm hard to locate
Lipstick on a soda, gon' pour it on your face
Move, bitch, bitch, I'm Luda'
Assume the shit is nice
Cash, cash, I got too much
Hold some just in case

Hopscotch, block's hot, pop rocks, off top
Like I know it
Nonstop, bop-bop, bops, drop top
'Cause I own it
Block's hot, pop rocks, hopscotch, off top
Like I know it
Nonstop, bop-bop, bops, drop top
'Cause I own it

Block's hot, pop rocks, hopscotch, off top
