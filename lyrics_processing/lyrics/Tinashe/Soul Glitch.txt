Couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Don't blame me, you the reason why your soul glitch (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Cold, cold (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Coldish, oh (I'm so cold)

Why you turn me to a monster?
Why you faded at my concerts?
Why don't you just let me love you?
Make me feel like underwater
I'm so sick of bein' a crutch, you would too
I'm alone, makin' clouds in my room

Even when the sky turns cold
As my eyes get low, uh
On the pedestal is a diamond
Better fix, fix your shit, 'fore your time end

Couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Don't blame me, you the reason why your soul glitch (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Cold, cold, cold (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Cold, cold, coldish, cold (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)

(Why you turn me to a monster?)
(I'm so cold)

Leadin' stars open, now the door closin'
Shut out my emotion, but you never noticed
Left me layin' on the table with the letter open
Only feelin' solid nowadays 'cause my heart frozen
My heart

Why you turn me to a monster?
Why you faded at my concerts?
Why don't you just let me love you?
Make me feel like under water
I'm so sick of bein' a crutch, you would too
I'm alone makin' clouds in my room

C-couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy (What?)
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Don't blame me, you the reason why your soul glitch (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Cold, cold, cold, cold (Glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch)
Cold, cold cold, coldish, cold, cold (I'm so cold)
Stuck in a world where we could be perfect
Sick of the heartache under the benefit
Me, and it's only me, you, and it's only you
Simple as it could be
Too good to have it be true
Too good to have it be true
Me, and it's only me, you, and it's only you
Simple as it could be
Too good to have it be true
