Oh-oh-oh
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Blue hundreds all on the mattress (Ah)
We gon' role play like an actress (Oh)
Money's a mess on the table (Table)
Eyes on that Essex and cable (Cable)
Wanna ride you like a wave (Ayy)
Baby, I'm feeling your wave
You could get this anyway
I don't think it's just a phase
Count up that money, we sexin' in
Count up that money, we sexin' in
Count up that money, we sexin' in
Count up that money, we sexin' in
We spendin' quality time now
I'm takin' issues aside now
I'm gon' run back on your mind now
I'll make you mine, make you mine

It's not my M.O. to fall in love
But fucking around with me is dangerous
The lines are blurry now, this isn't lust
But you like it (But you like it)
And I like it (And I like it)
You might also like
Never known you had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right (So right, so right)
Never felt this feelin' so fast (Never felt this feelin' so fast)
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice (Sacrifice, sacrifice)
Never known you had it so bad (So bad, so bad, bad)
Never knew I'd do you so right (So right, right, right)
Never felt this feelin' so fast (So fast, fast)
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice (Ayy)

Second round, can you last tonight?
Spin me 'round and leave it inside
E-e-extra loud, every time we play
Watch me dance around all over your face, uh
I'm, yeah, I'ma ride shotgun with you
I took a shot with just you
He gon' pull up in the Chevy
He gon' blow up like a levee
We gon' lay up like a headboard
Do all the shit that you ask for

It's not my M.O. to fall in love
But fucking around with me is dangerous
The lines are blurry now, this isn't lust
But you like it (But you like it)
And I like it (And I like it)
Never known you had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right (So right, so right)
Never felt this feelin' so fast (Never felt this feelin' so fast)
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice (Sacrifice, sacrifice)
Never known you had it so bad (So bad, so bad, bad)
Never knew I'd do you so right (So right, right, right)
Never felt this feelin' so fast (So fast, fast)
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice (Ayy)

Sacrifices
Sac-sacrifices

I'm gonna touch you if you let me keep you up
I'm gon' show you what it's like to be loved
I'm gon' treat you just the way that you deserve
I'm gon' touch you just the way that you deserve
I'm gon' take you where you've never been before
I'm gon' hold you like you wanna be held
I'm gon' kiss you, pin you up against the wall
I'm gon' give you some place warm to lay your head, oh
