Lately, I ain't been in my feelings
'Nashe, I've been minding my business

Lately, I ain't been in my feelings

Throw it in your face you gon' feel it
Throw it in your face you gon' feel it

You still stuck in the the past
I don't get mad, I get bags (Big bags)
Pussy, best you done had
Now you won't get this back, no
If that nigga acting up, put his ass out
If a nigga can't fuck, put his ass out
I ain't going back and forth with none of you bitches
Got his ass on a rope, now he tapped out
Had a vision when I started, had it mapped out
Private jet, you in coach, that what you mad about?
Ain't no pressure, ain't no smoke, I'm just ashed out
Smokin' on Keisha, Ca$h Out, yeah

Hey baby, look what you do
You give me shivers all over my body
Fuck if I'm acting a fool
You got me way better off than you found me
Don't be too proud to admit that you need me
It's not what I'm used to
Coming for number one, let 'em talk
Fuck 'em up, bet your ex so sick
Level up from the jump, she was a super slump
Baby, I'm that bitch, oh, oh
Don't be too proud to admit that you need me
It's not what I'm used to, believe me
Ooh, look what you do
Ooh, look what you do
