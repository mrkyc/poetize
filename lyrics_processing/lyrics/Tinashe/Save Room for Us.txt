Heart goes numb when the days turn to weeks
Only blank shadows of the way we used to be
All these times zones between us have grown
Oh, they've grown
But these nights don't get easier
When I see ya with her

Just save room for us
Just save room for us, somewhere
Just save room for us
I trust you'll come back for us, someday
Oh, you know it's not the end
We'll fall in love again
'Cause we were built in dreams of gold
Just save room for us
And it may not be today
True love will find a way
Just save a space for me
Oh, woah

And I know you've moved on
She will never love you
Oh, the way that I do
Now I'm dancing solo
Slowly disappearing
It still hurts when I see you with her
You might also like
Just save room for us
Just save room for us, somewhere
Just save room for us
I trust you'll come back for us, someday
Just save room for us

And I know you've moved on
She will never love you
Oh, the way that I do
Now I'm dancing solo (Solo)
Slowly disappearing
It still hurts when I see you with her

Just save room for us
(I know you feel it somewhere, somewhere)
Just save room for us, I trust you'll come back to us someday
(I know you feel it somewhere, somewhere)
Just save room for us
Oh, you know it's not the end
We'll fall in love again
'Cause we were built in dreams of gold (I know you feel it somewhere, somewhere)
Just save room for us
And it may not be today
True love will find a way
Just save a space for me
Just save room for us
