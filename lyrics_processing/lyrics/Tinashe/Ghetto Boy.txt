Nothing I can say while I'm drifting
Slipping in and out 'til I see you
Don't wake me 'til I'm holding you
Still shaking from the fear of waking

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna live without you
Can I keep us locked in my room?
Can I keep us locked in my room?

I was running through the meadows
Through the meadows with my ghetto boy
Come and see me in the shadows
I've been waiting in the corners for you
Come on, baby, lift your head up
Look around and see that we're alone
Don't you think it's time you noticed
This is everything that's waiting for you
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
What you say? What you say?
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
What you say? What you say?
You might also like
Lights shine in an instant
It makes it clearer to see you
For a moment it's been overdue
But then I see just what I'm missing and know

I don't want to live without you (No without you baby)
I don't want to live without you
Can I keep us locked in my room?
Can I keep us locked in my room?

I was running through the meadows
Through the meadows with my ghetto boy
Come and see me in the shadows
I've been waiting in the corners for you
Come on, baby, lift your head up
Look around and see that we're alone
Don't you think it's time you noticed
This is everything that's waiting for you
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
What you say? What you say?
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
What you say? What you say?
No one needs to ever know
Just how deep our feelings go
No one's gonna tell them nothing
Nothing's gonna keep me from running, oh

I was running through the meadows
Through the meadows with my ghetto boy
Come see me in the shadows
I've been waiting in the corners for you
Come on, baby, lift your head up
Look around and see that we're alone
Don't you think its time you noticed
This is everything that's waiting for you
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
What you say? What you say?
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Nobody's gonna do this for you
