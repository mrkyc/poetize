Sunburn in my eyes, I've been looking up
Need to come down, it's been fun
Got sunburn in my eyes, I've been looking up
Trying to hold on to this feeling
Is this where you run?
Is this where you left me?
Is this where you leave me all alone, hmm?
My tongue has turned to gold
When I tried to tell you
I got paper cuts in my cheeks now

I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
(Blue sky, blue sky)
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky

There's a picture frame of us in the corner just gathering dust
Funny how time doesn't move quite the same
Sunburn in my eyes I've been looking up
I feel no pain
This is where you're wrong
This ain't what you're used to
This is like that rose in the thorn bush
My tongue has turned to gold
Baby, can you help me
If I can turn my fear into beauty
That's what I'll do
