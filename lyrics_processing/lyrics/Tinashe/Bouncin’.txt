Ayy, yeah, watch it bouncin' on the ground
Got my edges sweatin' out
Turn it up extra loud (Uh, oh-oh)
Yeah, tonight, we steppin' out
Been a minute since I found
Someone who could hold it down (Uh, oh-oh)
What you really talkin' 'bout?
I been sendin' dirty pics
Hope they make it to the cloud (Uh, oh-oh)
Watch it bouncin' on the ground
Got my edges sweatin' out
Boun-bouncin' on the ground

(Boun-bouncin' on the ground)
Uh, oh-oh (Boun-bouncin' on the ground)
Uh, oh-oh

Cuban links
All the gold on my neck
Shinin' brighter than a spotlight
Might intimidate ya
Don't, I'ma see you later
Callin' me
All of these hoes on my neck
Lately, I don't even call back
Might intimidate ya (Boun-bouncin' on the ground)
Don't, I'ma see you later

Just like this
Got that magic touch, you can call me Midas
This is what it's like when you're on my list
Shoot don't miss
Love it how it feels when we're just vibin'
Don't fight it
Canceled all my plans, all the side chicks
I know what I want, so come try this
Baby, read my lips
Let me make your night, top it off with a kiss
