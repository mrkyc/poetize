Fooled me twice, if I fall for you
If I go there, forget it (Oh)

Yeah, you better keep up, player
'Cause tonight is a game changer
So you better stay up, player

Playin' with fire, if I burn, you do
If I hurt, you won't let it (You won't let it)
Stacked my deck like I ain't gon' lose
Like a victim, forget it

Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator (Ooh)
Rollin' 'round in the bed, smackin' her on her ass
