Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do? Mmm
Tears from your little sister
Crying because she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
(It's a good thing, ouch)
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
You gotta walk into town to find a job
(What's it now?)
Trying to keep your hands warm
(It's so cold)
When the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
(Brrr, cha)
Somehow you'd better go home where it's warm
You might also like
Where you can live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can

Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
(The closer the knit)
And the chills stay away
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
Just to take 'em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
(Ooh, now, ooh, now, ooh, now)
With a whole lotta love and a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
(Forget to pray)
Just making it strong where you belong

And we're living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
(You're so cold)
And she can
Yes, we're living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
(You're so cold)
Living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
(You're so cold)
Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard on a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
