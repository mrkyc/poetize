She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
So fragile, yet so devious, she continues to see
Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
Enter the night that she came home, forever

Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad

She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic
My dahlia bathed in possession, huh, she is home to me
I get nervous, perverse; when I see her, it's worse
But the stress is astounding
It's now or never, she's comin' home, forever

Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad
(What am I doing here?)
(She's my imagination come alive)
(What am I doing? What am I doing here?)
(She's my imagination come alive)
(My imagination come alive, come alive)

Hard to say what caught my attention
Fixed and crazy, aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face (Carve my name) to recognize
Such a pheromone cult (Terrorize) to terrorize

Yeah


Oh, I'm a slave and I am a master
No restraints and unchecked collectors
I exist through my need (I exist) to self-oblige
She is something in me (I despise) that I despise
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
I can't make her real
She isn't real
I can't make her real
She isn't real (She isn't real)
Can't make her real (Can't make her real)
She isn't real (She isn't real)
