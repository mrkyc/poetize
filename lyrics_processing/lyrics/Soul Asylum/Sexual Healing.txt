Hot like an oven
Baby, can't hold on much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
Honey, I know there is one thing I can do
I can get on the telephone, I can call you up, baby
'Cause, honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
'Cause what you're dealing will heal me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Let's make love tonight
Get up, get up, get up, get up
'Cause you do it right

A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, they got capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps relieve my mind, it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Oh, it's good for me
It's so good for me, my baby, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just grab a hold
Well, just take control of my body and mind
Soon we'll be making it and doing fine
I never said open up and let me in
Oh darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait, I can't wait for you to operate
When I get that feeling, I want sexual healing
When I get that feeling, I want sexual healing
Sexual healing
Sexual healing
Please don't procrastinate
