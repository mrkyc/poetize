But I suppose you've seen it all before
There's something I'm trying to tell you
But then again you've heard it all before
I survived another week just like the one before
When everything you wanted somehow leaves you wanting more
And I looked beneath the carpet, behind each and every door
Trying to find you something like you've never had before
And it seems we're just beginners
No previous experience at all
Just the last original sinners
And if you need me just be sure to call
And they tell you which way not to go and so you go that way
One child plays with what another throws away
Like a kite without string, go anywhere, do anything
I'm trying to take you someplace you've never been before

I see something new in each and every move
From your old, old hat to your blown-out shoes
It's tried and true, and it's all I do
And I hope it's not all the same to you

Is that something I've never seen before?
Or just a brand new shine?
Now they're cranking 'em out by the millions
They look and act exactly just the same
And each one's one in a million
And each has got its own elusive game
It's the same old dusty atmosphere just like the other place
I see something familiar in each and every face
Seems to me I've seen you, been here, said this once before
I'm trying to take you someplace you've never been before
I see something new in each and every moon
From your old, old hat to your blown-out shoes
When I dropped it and broke it I thought of you
And I hope it's not all the same to you
And the old and new, they get mistaken all the time
