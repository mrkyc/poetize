There's a giant sleeping and his pants are undone
He shows no pity for anyone
He's sure to be killed before the morning comes
Twiddle my fingers and I twiddle my thumbs
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til my work is all done
I'm a high society skid row bum
Well on my way to kingdom come
Well, I twiddle in the middle of the moon and sun
I'm wishing and dreaming I'm a special someone
Ain't laying my load on anyone
It's way too high and it weighs a ton
Do re mi fe fo fi fum
I'm a slave to the music, it's my father and son
I never force it on anyone
Can't keep it a secret so I keep it on the run
They may say what they say
'Bout the way that we stay
They may do what they do
'Bout the things that we do
Hey diddle diddle, did you spill your rum?
Ain't worried about the dumb things I've done
Ain't worried about the dumb things to come
When I smell the blood of a little bit of fun

Sometimes I wanna be friends with everyone
My friends tell me it can't be done
And some days I feel I don't know anyone
Now what goes up doesn't always come down
You'll never believe the things I've found
Amazing what you learn just hanging around
Can't put a square peg in a hole that's round
They may say what they say
'Bout the way that we stay
They may do what they do
'Bout the things that we do
Hey gabba hi gabba do da day
Ain't for winning or for losing it's the pleasure to play
Work all night and I sleep all day
