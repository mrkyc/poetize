Well, I ran my way, I walked a fine line
Wasted time only to find
You were calling, I think, my name
To remind me I am fine
What you are is what you see
And you see me and we can be
Something you can call we
We are, we are, we are

Doing what we can
We're working without a plan
I'm beginning to understand
It's getting out of hand

I have seen these closing doors
I've woke up on this floor before
Picked it apart for hours and hours and hours and hours
Of turning, tossing, and looking and listening
To you and all the fucked up things you do

But you're doing the best you can (You can)
With every grain of sand (Of sand)
Just trickling through your hand (Your hand)
Can't catch me if you can

If someday comes early
Comes whipping, comes whirling
To take you for all you have learned
The tables are turning
Your bridges are burning
My destination's sometime to return

Throw away your calendar
And saddle up your salamander
Get up and get down
Ride into town and look around
Get up and do something
Your time to choose it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

Doing the best I can (I can)
With or without a plan (A plan)
I'm taking what I can get (I can)
I haven't seen nothing yet

If one day, you wake up
And find what you make up
Come and get me, come and take me there
Into your illusion
I make my intrusion
Any time, any place, anywhere
The hourglass is draining fast
It knows no future, holds no past
And all this too will come to pass
Never, forever, whatever

If someday comes early
Comes whipping, comes whirling
To take you for all you have learned
The tables are turning
Your bridges are burning
My destination's sometime to return

Sometime to return
Sometime to return
