You've got that smile, you've got it all
I know I'm right, you think I'm dead wrong
You've got that face, you've got that laugh
I know you're shy and girl I like that

Can't find a mirror to see what I see in you
But I will follow you until you see it too
I know I can't help but love everything you do
But you can't see that and girl I like that
I, I, I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that

So take my world, just take it all
I'd cross the earth, to break your free fall
I'd run the streets, to show you that
I'm so in love, and girl I like that

Can't find a mirror to see what I see in you
But I will follow you until you see it too
I know I can't help but love everything you do
But you can't see that and girl I like that
You might also likeI'll be there when you don't know what you should do
If you heart breaks, I'll be there to fix it too
I know I can't help but love everything you do
But you can't see that and girl I like that
I, I, I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that

You got glasses on
I, I like that
Sing this song
I, I like that
Girl it's on
I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that
No makeup on
I, I like that
Sing this song
I, I like that
Girl it's on
I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that
I, I, I

Can't find a mirror to see what I see in you
But I will follow you until you see it too
I know I can't help but love everything you do
But you can't see that and girl I like that
I'll be there when you don't know what you should do
If you heart breaks I'll be there to fix it too
I know I can't help but love everything you do
But you can't see that and girl I like that
But you can't see that and girl I like that
But you can't see that and girl I like that
I, I, I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that
I, I, I, I like that
