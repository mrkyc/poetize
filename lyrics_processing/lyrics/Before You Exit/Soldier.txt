You got holes in your jeans
And few in your heart
You don't know what it means to me
To watch you fall apart
Cause you're broken and bruised
But I can hold you close

I'll take you in my arms tonight, just me and you

Baby, in a heartbeat
I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you
You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe
I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart
I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield
I will fight on the field
Baby, when life gets colder
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
You might also like
Just put up your arms
You'll be alright
'Cause the world is like a battlefield
But I'll be here to fight
I see your scars and your wounds
I'll try to heal them too

I'll take you in my arms tonight, just me and you

Baby, in a heartbeat
I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you
You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe
I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart
I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield
I will fight on the field
Baby, when life gets colder
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
When you're feeling low
I can take you higher
When the world is cold
I can be your fire
I'll be there
When you need a shoulder
We can win this war
I will be your soldier

'Cause baby, in a heartbeat
I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you
You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe
I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart
I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield
I will fight on the field
Baby when our life gets colder
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
