We could make this moment last forever
Laying with you, laying with you
You're spinning 'round and 'round just like a record
I don't wanna move, I don't wanna move

I say you're perfect, you start blushing
Got all we need and so much more
Could take on the world or just do nothing

All I know is
Baby, even when you wake up
Laying with no makeup
You're beautiful, beautiful
I know you think I'm crazy
For loving all your features
Even in your T-shirt
You look like, you look like
You look like a model
Model, model
You look like, you look like
You look like a model

We could make or break this thing together
Getting it right, we're getting it right
Heart has got me beating under pressure
Coming alive, coming alive
You might also like
Now that I never saw it coming
Something I wasn't looking for
Now that I found you, I'm not running
I say you're perfect, you start blushing
Got all we need and so much more
Could take on the world or just do nothing

All I know is
Baby, even when you wake up
Laying with no makeup
You're beautiful, beautiful
I know you think I'm crazy
For loving all your features
Even in your T-shirt
You look like, you look like
You look like a model
Model, model
You look like, you look like
You look like a model

Oh, you think I'm crazy
For loving all your features
All I know is
Baby, even when you wake up
Laying with no makeup
You're beautiful, beautiful
I know you think I'm crazy
For loving all your features
Even in your T-shirt
You look like, you look like
You look like a model
Model, model
You look like, you look like
You look like a model
Model, model
You look like, you look like
