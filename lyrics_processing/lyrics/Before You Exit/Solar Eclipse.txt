Show me some pure intoxication
I know I've waited for my whole life
Restless, I woke up on a redeye
Hands feeling cold
Waist deep in mental medication
Always feel like you don't belong here
Sunlight was bleeding through your window
Turned into rain

Don't think it's forever
Don't think it's forever
Don't think it's forever
This pain won't last forever

It's only a solar eclipse, love
It's only a solar eclipse, love
Sun is coming back again
Sun is coming back again
It's only a solar eclipse, love
It's only a solar eclipse, love
Sun is coming back again
Sun is coming back again

Please don't forget

Is heaven just another vacation?
Sir, do you have a reservation?
Sun sets, you're riding on a train
It's taking you home

Don't think it's forever
Don't think it's forever
Don't think it's forever
This life won't last forever

It's only a solar eclipse, love
It's only a solar eclipse, love
Sun is coming back again
Sun is coming back again
It's only a solar eclipse, love
This is not as good as it gets, love
Sun is coming back again
Sun is coming back again

Please don't forget
Whoa, oh whoa
Whoa, oh whoa
Whoa, oh whoa
Whoa, oh whoa-ah
Hm-nana-ah
Ah-na

It's only a solar eclipse, love
It's only a solar eclipse, love
Sun is coming back again
Sun is coming back again
Oh, please don't forget

And as I'm sure you've heard
This life can be a bit absurd
The twists and turns
The bends and curves
You may have felt hurt, wronged, cheated
No doubt you've experienced
Your own personal version of sorrow
Regardless of your desire to go back, you can't
We're all playing with the hand we've been dealt
Left to experience the results of our choices
But remember: within the darkest of days
The biggest dreams are formed and come to light
A light otherwise never discovered were it not for the dark
A new love exists because of the pain
