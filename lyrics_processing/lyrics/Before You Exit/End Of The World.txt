Hey girl watcha say
Why you pushin' me away
Wishin' we were closer
But we're not
Do you want me to go away now
Or to stay
You can't have it both ways
You're like a rollercoaster
'Cause you're up
Then you're down
Can't you see?
I'm all in
It's just not like me
To want you, want you
Want you to love me
Like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's our last day, girl
Want you to love me like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's the end
Love me like it's the end of the world
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Hey, girl
What's it take
To get your heart
Before mine breaks
I've been giving my all
Don't leave me on
To let me fall
Can't you see?
I'm all in
It's just not like me
To want you, want you
Want you to love me
Like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's our last day, girl
Want you to love me like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's the end
Love me like it's the end of the world
Like it's the end of the world
End of the world
We can't afford to fake it
This is our time to make it
Like it's our last few seconds
Why can't you give us a chance?
Want you to love me
Like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's our last day, girl
Want you to love me like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's the end
Love me like it's the end
Want you to love me
Like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's our last day, girl
Want you to love me like it's our last day, baby
Love me like it's the end
Love me like it's the end
Love me like it's the end of the world
