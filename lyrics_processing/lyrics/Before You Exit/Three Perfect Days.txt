The first day is always the best
It could be love or a beautiful mess
But you just don't know so you
Gotta go along for the ride
(Along for the ride)
Day 2, she's so into you
And the first kiss feels like it's something true
And you know it's real
Everything you feel so deep inside

Day 3 comes, you tell everyone
How much she means to you
A picture perfect night
Everything goes right
Until she says, "We're through"

I was the one for a minute
Two for a second
Three days later you told me to forget it
Three perfect days, three perfect days
Thought it was love, we were in it
You said it was over
And now I'm looking for
Somebody's shoulder
To make me feel okay
And how could I let her get away
In just three days?
Just three days

And day by day I replay it again
Guess I should've know she
Was leaving
When she forgot my name
(Forgot my name)
And she took me down
Yeah, when I found out
I was just another weekend fling
It was a beautiful mess in the end, I guess
Because it didn't mean a thing

I was the one for a minute
Two for a second
Three days later you told me to forget it
Three perfect days
They were three perfect days
Thought it was love
We were in it
You said it was over
And now I'm looking for somebody's shoulder
To make me feel okay
How could I let her get away
In just three days?
I'd do it all again
Even if I knew it would end
And I still remember when
I was the one for a minute
One for a minute
One for a minute
I was the one for a minute
Two for a second
Three days later you told me to forget it
Three perfect days
Three perfect days
Thought it was love
We were in it
You said it was over
And now I'm looking for somebody's shoulder
To make me feel okay
How could I let her get away
In just three days?
Just three days
