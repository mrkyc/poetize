Whoa
No, no-no, no-no

First kiss, start of the New Year
First that I told all my real fears
We were gin and coke
But lately we've been broke
First text down on the runway
Got me so low when you run away
Don't know how to cope
Sleeping with the ghost
Of all I used to know
(All I used to know)

And I know we'd fight
Stay up all night
Six in the morning
The sun on the rise
But somewhere inside
Do you still hold onto me?

Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it love or lust?
How long have we been slowly
Floating from the rush
Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it kiss or touch?
How long have we been slowly floating
Away from us?
You might also like
First fight came out of nowhere
Stepping outside for some fresh air
Are we letting go?
Is that just how it goes? Oh
First row seat for the breakdown
Still got your things back at my house
Don't know how to cope
Sleeping with the ghost
Of all I used to know

And I know we've not spoken for weeks
Heard from your friends you don't get too much sleep
But somewhere inside
Do you still hold onto me?

Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it all for lust?
How long have we been slowly floating
From the rush?
Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it kiss or touch?
How long have we been slowly floating
Away from us?
Was it just, was it just a buzz
Between the two of us?

Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it all for lust?
How long have we been slowly floating
From the rush?
Or was it just a buzz?
The feeling, was it kiss or touch?
How long have we been slowly floating
