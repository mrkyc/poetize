I feel so empty without it
Twisted, addicted, I'm gone, gone, gone
Help me, I'm just being honest
Promise I don't need too much, much, much

Just another dose of
'Nother dose of
'Nother dose of you
Come on, can you pull me
Can you pull me
Can you pull me through?
I just wanna feel it
Wanna feel it
Wanna feel it, too
I feel so empty without it

Light in the dark
I'm a little bit, a little bit lost
You're the
Painkiller for my broken heart
Painkiller for my broken heart
Fight to survive
Oh, the way you bring me back to life
You're the
Painkiller for my broken heart
Painkiller, painkiller
You might also like
You are the feeling I'm craving
Rush in my veins is so pure, pure, pure
All of my fears had me shaking
You kept me still at the core, core, core

Just another dose of
'Nother dose of
'Nother dose of you
Come on, can you pull me
Can you pull me
Can you pull me through?
I just wanna feel it
Wanna feel it
Wanna feel it, too
I feel so empty without it

Light in the dark
I'm a little bit, a little bit lost
You're the
Painkiller for my broken heart
Painkiller for my broken heart
Fight to survive
Oh, the way you bring me back to life
You're the
Painkiller for my broken heart
Painkiller, painkiller
For my heart, heart
For my heart, heart
For my heart, heart
Painkiller for my broken heart
Painkiller, painkiller
(For my heart, heart)
(For my heart, heart)

Light in the dark
