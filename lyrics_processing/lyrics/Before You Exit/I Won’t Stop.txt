When we were younger we used to dream
We used to dream big
All of the scars you left up your sleeve
Heart so deceiving

Take aim before you know who you're shooting
This game that you play but you're losing
Pretend like you know what you're doing
But I'm letting you go, I'm letting you go

No, I'll never be somebody else
Just to make it, to make it
No, I'll never go living a lie
Just to fake it, to fake it
My mind's taking over me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
So hold me down, keep taking your shots
I won't stop until I'm on top

Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
You might also like
You used to fly too close to the sun
But now you're burning
Lost with the words that shot like a gun
Broken illusion

Take aim before you know who you're shooting
This game that you play but you're losing
Pretend like you know what you're doing
But I'm letting you go, I'm letting you go

No, I'll never be somebody else
Just to make it, to make it
No, I'll never go living a lie
Just to fake it, to fake it
My mind's taking over me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
So hold me down, keep taking your shots
I won't stop until I'm on top

Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
Oh, whoa
For you
Oh, whoa
I won't stop for you
It's wrong when you feel
It's fake when it's real
I know what you're doing you'll never reveal
It's wrong when you feel
It's fake when it's real
I know what you're doing you'll never reveal

No, I'll never be somebody else
Just to make it, to make it
No, I'll never go living a lie
Just to fake it, to fake it
My mind's taking over me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
So hold me down, keep taking your shots
I won't stop until I'm on top

Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
Stop
No, but I won't stop
No, but I won't stop
For you
Stop
No but I won't stop
No but I won't stop
For you
Stop
No but I won't stop
No but I won't stop
For you
Hold me down, keep taking your shots
I won't stop until I'm on top
Hold me down, keep taking your shots
