There's a certan little girl
That's on my mind
Great gosh almighty
She looks so fine
She's the best girl
That I've ever had
But sometimes she sure
Makes me feel so bad
Na na na na...
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but
I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not ashamed now

I want it and I need it now

Got to, go to have it
She's got loving like quicksand
It only took one touch of her hand
She blew my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat, y'all
And I can't sleep
Na na na na...
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but
I love her just the same now

I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not ashamed now
