*Scatting*

Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York

I and I come to claim what was wrongfully taken
Have no ribs or no bone broken
So if you love Jah set a better example
'Cause in the city, there is no pity (Well)

Hey, chill out, chill out, chill out, New York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York

Penetrate the masses, you got to talk to the bosses
Pure top ranks up the ranks
Cool runnings in a-Brooklyn, and-a nuff cool chill pill
Me and machine in the Queens

Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York (Yeah)
Chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York (Yeah)
Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York (Hey)
I say, chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York
See Black Uhuru LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
A knife and a fork, a bottle and a cork (Say what?)
That's New York, skyscraper, heart-breaker
Subway they-they, they-they

Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York (Hey)
Chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York
I say to chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York

On 42nd Street, that's where the boys meet
You can get what you want
From reefer to a sniff, from a joint to a point
Any kind of reef

I say, chill out, chill out, chill out, New York (Hey)
Chill out, chill out, chill out, Boo-York
Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York

Chill out, chill out, chill out, New York (Yeah)
