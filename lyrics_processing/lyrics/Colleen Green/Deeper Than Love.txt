Someday, I hope for a lover to kill me
It's the closest I can hope to get to anybody
It's the closest I can come to being really free
And there's a ring of questions on my mind lately
Like will I find a love that lasts as long as my life?
Or will I die before ever becoming a wife?
And I'm wondering if I'm even the marrying kind
How can I give you my life when I know you're just gonna die?
Is there anything stronger than biology?
Is love being ruined by technology?
Nowadays, commitment seems like a burden to carry
I don't wanna think about it

I don't wanna (I don't wanna)
Think about it (think about it)
I don't wanna (I don't wanna)
Think about it (think about it)
I don't wanna (I don't wanna)
Think about it (think about it)
I don't wanna think about it
It's too scary

And the closest I can come to being really free
Is letting my lover perform experiments on me
Observe and analyze
And empirically hypothesize
'Cause I wanna know real love so desperately
But I think it's gotta happen scientifically
'Cause I'm scared, afraid of real intimacy
You know, the kind they say happens psychologically
Dressed up like a surgeon, you cut open my heart
Remove the brain and leave the body in charge
No more emotions taking control
We'll pick a part and play out our roles

And the only best friends I ever made
Were people I knew I didn't have to see every day
The closest to true love I ever came
Was with someone I kept many miles away
'Cause I'm wary of eliminating distance
This could surely be the death of any romance
'Cause I'm shitty and I'm lame and I'm dumb and I'm a bore
And once you get to know me, you won't love me anymore
And that possibility worries me the most
Not harm or abuse or becoming a ghost
It's the closeness, the intimacy
I'm afraid it might kill me

Further than fantasy
Deeper than love could ever be
