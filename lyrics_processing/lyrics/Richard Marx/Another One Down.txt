Wondering if all of what you said is what you meant
I guess it's over now, but you never gave a reason why
I guess I wasn't worth the work 'cause you never even said goodbye
And I should just give you up 'cause I'm just another one down
Baby the truth about us is all just a little too loud
I'm looking back too much
When I know I should just give you up
'Cause I'm just another one down
Just another one down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just another one down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just when I thought you were giving in and getting close
You turned away, found a way back to what you know (what you know)
Even when it's just begun, now you always find a way to run (always find a way to run)
I really thought you were the one but to you I'm just another one
And I should just give you up 'cause I'm just another one down
Baby the truth about us is all just a little too loud
I'm looking back too much
When I know I should just give you up
'Cause I'm just another one down
Just another one down
