It only took a moment, a solitary glance
And I could hear the voice of rapture call
I've loved you from a distance, afraid to take a chance
But now, it seems I can't help but to fall

Imagine my surprise
To open up my eyes
And find that you were looking back

And suddenly, I cannot remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I long to wake beside you and bathe in love's abyss
Washing all that's come before away
Ooh, and in that frozen moment, as I receive your kiss
There will not be words enough to say

I wanna make you melt
Touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly, I cannot remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, da, doh, yeah, day

I wanna make you melt
Touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly, I cannot remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here, baby, in your arms
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
