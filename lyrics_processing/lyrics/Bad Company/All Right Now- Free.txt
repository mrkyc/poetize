There she stood, in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said, "Hey-now, what is this?
-Now baby maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss."
I said, "Hey! what's you're name baby?
-Maybe we could see things the same."

Baby it's a-all right now-oh oh ooh

I took her home, to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look-ah, what's your game baby?
-Are you trying to put me in shame?"
I said, "Slow-ooh-oh don't go so fast
-Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love? Lord above!
