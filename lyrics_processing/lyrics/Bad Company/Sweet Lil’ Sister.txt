Rode up on Rush Street (?), I was looking for some kicks
We was getting higher, looking for some action
Dayton Ohio, ain't got nothing on this
We was going crazy when I saw her coming
Dancing with the Devil in her eyes
I could feel a fire, my body started burning
Baby, don't you say goodbye
Back on the road, up in New York City
Low down blues hit me, sitting in my room
Long distance operator, get me Chicago
I got to get a message, got to see my baby soon
We was going crazy when I saw her coming
Dancing with the Devil in her eyes
I could feel a fire, my body started burning
Baby, don't you say goodbye
Sweet little sister
You know you can't resist her
She got it made in the shade
Lord yeah, sweet little sister
Your Momma never missed her
'Till she got laid, laid, laid, alright
We was going crazy when I saw her coming
Dancing with the Devil in her eyes
She was too good looking, so I started running
'Til she took away her disguise
