So let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

You packed the bag
I guess that your mind is made up
You take a drag off of the cigarette
You said you're quitting now
Take a step back, when all I want is to hold you
Drive away fast
This ain't the movie scene I thought we'd be in, nah

You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you

So let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
You might also like
You cut your hair, remember how I used to love it
Now I gotta stamp the boxes of shit that I thought we could fix
And I wanna be fair, but then I'd be working for nothing
Then you drive away, blasting the music that we used to make out to

You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you

So let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

(So let me keep)
You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you
(So let me)
You, oo-ooh
You, oo-ooh
Lost myself to you
You left your smokes by the window
I'm gonna wait by the door
Somewhere in me, I got some hope
A hope that you find what you're looking for

So let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
So let me keep the last piece of my heart
(You, oo-ooh, you, oo-ooh)
Before you tear it all apart (lost myself to you)
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
(You, oo-ooh, you, oo-ooh)
