I've been a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
I understand if you leave, I understand if you leave me
I'll understand if you leave me, just go

Just don't go before I show you what's behind all of my sorrow
What's inside all of the bullets I throw (oh, oh)
Don't go before I get to say I'm sorry I caused you sorrow
Tonight I really want you to know

I'm a bad woman
But I'm still your woman
I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
(Don't you go, don't you go)

It's a sad story but it's still our story
Such a sad story, I know
You can say you don't love me, but don't walk away from me
We need each other more than we know
(Don't you go, don't you go)

Just don't go before I show you what's behind all of my sorrow
What's inside all of the bullets I throw (oh, oh)
Don't go before I get to say I'm sorry I caused you sorrow
Tonight I really want you to know

I'm a bad woman
But I'm still your woman
I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
(Don't you go, don't you go)

(Don't you go, don't you go)
You used to love, you used to love
Even the bad, the crazy
Don't walk away, don't give me up
Don't you know?

I'm a bad woman (I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman (I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman (I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman (I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman, but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman, I know
