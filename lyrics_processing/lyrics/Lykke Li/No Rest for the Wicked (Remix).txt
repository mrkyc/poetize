You love me too much
Don't let me do much
She love me too much, at least she use to
Then I used her, I abused her
Never thought I'd ever lose her
I confused her, but I refuse to
Be so wicked, hallelujah

My one heart hurt another
So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away?

Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
You let them win without a fight

If one heart can mend another
Only then can we begin
So won't you hold on a little longer?
Don't let them get away
You might also like
Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
You let them win without a fight

I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart but I broke it every time

Pretty motherfucker from the north pole
Jiggy motherfucker but my heart cold
And the rest washed up like bar soap
Tell her read between the lines like a barcode
GET IT?
Wicked, see my style, see my smile too wicked
Oh wicked me, tell her wiki me
When she wiki me, she gotta Lykke Li
Eazy-E riding on the big spokes, on the 6-4
They say I switch hoes how I switch clothes
Little nigga now doing big shows
But I'm heavy in the streets like I'm Big Pun
Reckless, no resting, for the wicked, nigga I'm flexing
Anti-depressants, couldn't help you with the lesson
If you didn't get the message, only weight is digression
(I don't give a fuck little nigga)
No question, If love don't work it's just gone hurt
It all goes bad, it just gets worse
I can't describe with just 1 verse
Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no home for the weary
If you let them win without a fight

I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart but I broke it every time
