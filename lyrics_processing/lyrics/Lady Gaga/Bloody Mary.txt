Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

Love

We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountaintops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir toute seule

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

Love
