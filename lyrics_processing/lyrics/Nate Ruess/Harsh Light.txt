The barkeep's in a bad mood, playing with his change
Talking 'bout a blood moon, asking how I found this place
My eyes are drained from the one that got away
So tonight I'm going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out
In walks eighty long boots, looking for a date
I would make the first move, but I'm too drunk to enunciate
Never been one to want to hear about someone's day
So tonight I'm going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out

And it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line between the things you want and the
And the things that you need
So I'm not going to sleep

I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show 'em
We all got scars, we all got scars
We all got scars, we all got scars, so what?
I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light
And nothing here is bringing me down
No, nothing here is bringing me down
You might also like
And my heart is always breaking for the ghosts that haunt this room
We fall asleep to revolution, but wake up next to a sad excuse
Oh, what a shame how we got in our own way
So tonight I'm going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out

And it's so hard not to scream (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's such a fine line between the things you are and the
And the things that you've been

I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light
And nothing gets me down
Up above the past loves I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show 'em
We all got scars, we all got scars
We all got scars, we all got scars, so what?
I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light
And nothing here is bringing me down

(We all got scars, we all got scars
We all got scars, we all got scars)
I'm scared that I'm becoming a satellite (We all got scars)
On the sadder side of the moon (We all got scars)
Convinced that if you'd ever stood by my side (We all got scars)
Now you're on the other side of the room (We all got scars)
But I get this funny feeling that tonight is going to end (We all got scars)
Much better than it's been, ooh (We all got scars)
I find it hard to keep my eyes open (We all got scars)
And let the lights shine in, ooh (We all got scars)
And it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line, such a fine line, such a fine line
But I'm not sleeping tonight

I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show 'em
We all got scars, we all got scars
We all got scars, we all got scars, so what?
I'm slipping into midnight under harsh light (come on)
And nothing here is bringing me down
No, nothing here is bringing me down
Nothing here is bringing me down, down, down, down, down down down down
