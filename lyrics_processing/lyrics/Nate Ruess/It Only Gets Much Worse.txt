I was born before the storm
My mother placed a dozen thorns
The "sorry"s and the "take it back"s
Lay silent in her folded hands
And head to headstone I just danced
Oblivious to consequence
As a mourning sank into the ground
The highest branch
I sought it out, oh

I didn't mean to let it go
I didn't mean to bruise
But I lost control
And what she said to me
It still echoes

All your love
May fade away
All you'll become
May all go to waste
So I can't stand
To hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse
You might also like
Oh you caught me come to life
The moment when
Your eyes met mine
And from your bed, the sun came in
And till this day it never set
But years of this and used to it
I stepped out for some cigarettes
The neon lights they called me in
Her eyes like yours
Just different enough

I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to bruise
But I lost control
What didn't mean a thing
Destroyed us both
Darling

All your love
May fade away
All you'll become
May all go to waste
So I can't stand
To hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse
I couldn't quite believe
The ways to pull me down
And take its toll
I survived
The laws of gravity
These jaws of brevity
I will not let them sink their teeth
Into my soul
Whoa-oh

All my love
May fade away
All I'll become
May all go to waste
So I can't stand
Hear and say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
All our love may fade away
All we'll become
May all go to waste
So I can't stand
To hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
