Im more I'm more than the money I spend
Im more im more than what I do with my friends
Oh yeah oh yeah
Im more im more than the way my night ends
No wake up sound alarm no crashing my bends
Cause im more I'm more than the money I spend
(Pre-chorus)
You say im confused cause thats not what it means
Yeah its' more like spend your money drink away your dreams
I see so clearly now!
You just wanna be... happy
Searching for love I see so clearly now!
You just wanna be... happy
Searching for love
(Chorus)
I hope you find him
Find him
Find him
The truth When he finds you
I hope you find him
Find him
Find him
The truth When he finds you
I hope you do
I hope you do

Im more im more than some ice on my wrist
Cha ching cha ching cha ching
Im more im more than the party I missed
Like so what so what Im more im more than the way my night ends
No strangers in my bed
No making no sense
Im more im more than the money I spend
And I know that the radio keeps telling you
Throw you life away like you dont got a clue
You think im confused for telling you the truth
But everything you see them do wanna do?
(Pre-chorus)
I see so clearly now
You just wanna be happy
Searching for love
I see so clearly now
You just wanna be happy
Searching for love
(Chorus)
I hope you find him
Find him
Find him
The truth When he finds you
I hope you find him
Find him
Find him
The truth when he finds you
I hope you do
(End)
I hope you do
I hope you do
I hope you do
I hope you do
I hope you do
I hope you do!!!
I hope you do
I hope you do
