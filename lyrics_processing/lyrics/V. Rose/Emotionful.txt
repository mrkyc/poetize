Ask me how I'm feeling
I'mma tell you that I'm chilling
But my temperature could be through the ceiling
You wanna be the villian
Like ooh-ooh killem/ ooh killem (Me in my feelings)
'Cuz oh no, don't speak on things that they don't know
It's so hard trynna let it go when tweet hit my phone
Made me wanna act crazy but I can't say that they made me

We be like (eeyoooh)
I love my haters
Then we let'em dictate us
Then we look like a fool
When we lose our control flying off of the radar

When your emotional, emotional
No don't, don't/No don't, don't, don't
You might be going through it yourself
But don't lose it
Oh no no no
Okay

Takin eveything back when the conflicts over regretting the line you stepped over

We be like (eeyoooh)
