I feel so dirty
I feel so dumb
I fell for temptation
Lord what have I done?
I never meant for this to get so out of hand
But he lied to me
And he told me that You'd never understand
But it was never in my plan
(pre-chorus)
To become the liar
Become the cheater
Become the murderer
I know you've heard of her
Become the dealer
Become the user
Become the hater
Become the abuser
And after all of my failure and sinning
Jesus still wants to save me and live in me
So if Jesus can
Then why can't you...
Forgive me
(chorus)
Forgive me
Forgive me
I was so guilty
Now I'm repenting
Lord will you fill me
I'll go where you send me
Forgive me
You might also like(verse 2)
I was so lonely
He was so kind
He said that he loved me
How could I deny?
I never for this to get so out of hand
But he lied to me
And he told me that You'd never understand
But it was never in my plan...
(pre-chorus)
To become the liar
Become the cheater
Become the murderer
I know you've heard of her
Become the dealer
Become the user
Become the hater
Become the abuser
And after all of my failure and sinning
Jesus still wants to save me and live in me
So if Jesus can
Then why can't you...
Forgive me
(chorus)
Forgive me
I know what I did was wrong
But how long will you let this go on?
Everyone else has moved on
But you still won't let it go...
Man I can't let go and this is my cry for help
To forgive myself
So please help me forgive me
(end)
You showed me You loved me
Don't have to feel guilty
I fall on my knees now
