You can see the scars on my heart, if you knew where to start, if you knew of the part when I was told I wasn't worth the gold
I thought I was strong until I met you, and I thought you would run when you saw it was true, but no, you love me through all
'Cause I fall down and you're not proud, but what stands out
Is every time that I get up, yeah

So as the story goes
I might look fit for the ball, but I'm not perfect at all
Not afraid of the midnight
You love me although
This dress ain't even mine who cares if I'm out of time

Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight

I spent so much of my life
Trynna be someone you could love
So many little birds in my ear tellin' me I wasn't good enough
But, I never needed a carriage
Yeeah, a slip was made of glass
You're teaching me how to live and love like you love; I'm gon' save the rest
And I still fall down and you're not proud, what stands out
Is every time that I get up, oooh yeeah

Not afraid of the midnight

This dress ain't even mine who cares if I'm out of time

Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of...

Please let me never forget
There's no shoe that I can fit to gain your love Because you gave your love (no no no no)
