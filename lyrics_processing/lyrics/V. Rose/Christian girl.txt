Hey! Okay, okay
Hey! Okay, okay, uh-huh
I'm a Christian girl, I jump it up
Whoever's by the radio, hey, turn it up!

Turn up the bass! Hello, Mr. DJ!
Can your radio station spin that new track by Flame?
Then I throw up my hands, start my day with some praise
Gotta show the world where I get my confidence!

I'm a Christian girl, not of the world
Jesus is my Banner and I show it on the camera
Make Him popular, popular
I give Him the publicity, publicity!
Tellin' all of my friends I'm born again!
Be done with the sin! Let me show ya how to win!
I'm rockin' out, I jump it up!
Whoever's by the radio, hey, turn it up!
I rock 'em out, I lift Him up!
Whoever's by the radio, hey, turn it up!

Turn up the bass! Everyone in the place
Time to wake up this party! Play that song by Third Day!
Let's just throw up our hands and give God all the praise!
Gotta show the world where we get our confidence!!
