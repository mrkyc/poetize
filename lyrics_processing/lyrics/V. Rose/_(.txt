What do I do?
I looked at your picture yesterday
Haven't seen you in a while it's been a minute
I'm so busy looking up ahead
Forgive me that I never call I've been forgetting
We grew up just the same, then we grew apart the same way
And that was a sad day
Period, sad face
You were everything a sister's for
And I never could have asked for more
And I know it wasn't fair, how one day I wasn't there, but I needed you the same
And sometimes I still get angry
And I know you still get angry
How they pulled us apart, crazy
What happen was crazy
But we can't keep on blaming
No, no-oh
Can't keep on blaming, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
Cause we gotta pray
And we gotta face
What we gotta face
And we gotta stay
No we can't runaway from all our problems
From the one who can solve 'em
There's only one who can solve 'em
And take out your sad days
Put it into the sad face
And I know
That it's difficult to let go
Seems impossible, don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
And I know
Why should you forgive what you know
When you have to live what you know
You kno-o-ow
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
I guess you tell that you are gonna need
You couldn't take it anymore, you couldn't breath
Freankly now I'm begging you to stay
I was only 7 when you ran away
I remember on that day
I prayed you were okay
That was my sad day
Bury a sad face
You were everything a brother's for
And I never got to ask for more
And I know it wasn't fair
And one day you wasn't there
But I needed you the same
And sometimes I still get angry
And I know you still get angry
I have pushed you away baby
What happened was crazy
But we can't keep on blamin'
No aaaa-haaa, we can't keep on blamin'
They gotta move on
And we gotta pray
And we gotta face
What we gotta face
And we gotta stay
No we can't runaway from all our problems
From the one who can solve 'em
There's only one who can solve 'em
And take out your sad days
Put it into the sad face
And I know
That it's difficult to let go
Seems impossible, don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
And I know
Why should you forgive what you know
When you have to live what you know
You kno-o-ow
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
There is something that I gotta say
To everyone I lovin', I hope you listen
And prayin' they will open up your eyes
I'm prayin' that you open up and pay attention
Cause you stand before his face
And if he turns I know your name
That'd be a sad day
Period, sad face
I don't wanna see that day
Cause I know
That is difficult to let go
Seems impossible
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
(I know) Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-ow
And I know why should you forget what you know
When you have to get what you know (when you have to get)
You kno-o-ow
Don't I know
Don't I kno-o-o-o-o-ow
Don't I knoooow
Don't I knooooooow
Don't I knoooow
