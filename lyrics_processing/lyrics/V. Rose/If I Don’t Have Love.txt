Had a full tank of gas but nowhere to go
Had to buy all your friends so you'll control the show
Hope that it will make you happy but you know that it won't
I use to think all I needed was stake it and paid
I could wake up and buy a smile everyday
Then somebody told me that happiness does not break in the bank
You'll never find a thing greater than love so make a mistake
Now I know
I could get a mansion on top of the world
And I could have it all, yeah
Diamonds and pearls
Be so rich and famous you'd think that'd be enough
But none of that matters if I don't have love
Love love love
Have you ever been to the top but was still feeling low
And you way up but there's nowhere to go
I mean climbing up the ladder was flattering
But when I went to sleep at night none of it was mattering
Just keeping me way up
Feeling way down
Getting getting getting
Just getting paid out
And all these boys in my life is like
Credits cards, that have expired run them marathons
But I been top, but you've been saying this whole time
You might also likeI could get a mansion on top of the world
And I could have it all, yeah
Diamonds and pearls
Be so rich and famous you'd think that'd be enough
But none of that matters if I don't have love
Love love love
Nowadays everyone trying to get they fame up
Put some money in they face and watch them change up
Money just simplifies that's how you see what they made of
Got everything still ain't enough
Wow
Cuz I wanna be the one who stays the same through it
Wether I'm on a front page or they remain clueless
They don't need to know my name
That's not why I make music
Got everything cuz I got love, oh yeah
I could search the world forever and ever
Buy things trying to make myself feel better
But all those things don't matter if don't have You
If I don't have nothing but love
I could get a mansion on top of the world
And I could have it all, yeah
Diamonds and pearls
Be so rich and famous you'd think that'd be enough
But none of that matters if I don't have love
