I let my highlights grow out like for 6 months
That has nothing to do with the song, does it?
Start over...

I used to think that one day I would find love, yea, (right?)
And just like Cinderella it woule be too good to be (true... true story, me though)
Cuz who could love if they saw who I was (probably nobody)
And if they love me it must be too good to be (true)

/
So grab somebody's hand tonight, tonight
Tell them that it's gonna be alright
You've just gotta come through as you are
He don't care how bad you think you are
Hands up singin', Oh
Hands up singin', Oh

Its nothing for love
(8x)
You might also like
I used to think that one day I would become (perfect... I think... perfect yea)
And then maybe I'd finally be good enough to be... (good)
Like God was waiting for that day to come (made sense to me then)
But I know now he doesn't about that stuff (He cares about you)

So grab somebody's hand tonight, tonight
Tell 'em that its gonna be alright
You've just gotta come through as you are
He don't care how bad you think you are
Hands up singin', Oh
Hands up singin', Oh

Its nothing for love
(12x)

Live, laugh, love
Thats what we say in America
Happily forever after endings
Thats whats hot and trendy
And you're not on the right plane
Unless you're on board with us
Unless you've grown bored with us
Does this thing fly? Of course it does
Livin' outta my suitcase
Runnin' outta my travel toothpaste
I reach down and tie my shoelace
I catch this plane before its too late
In every way I am not perfect
I eat ice cream before dessert and
I don't worry 'bout the rest cuz

Its nothing for love
(4x)



It's nothing for love!
