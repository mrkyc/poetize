I saw you fall down
You know you messed up and
Though you tried to you
You couldn't get up so
You push shades up yeah
You pull your hood down
You put your guard up and
You keep your head down
(Chorus)
Please don't run away
I know you feel ashamed
You're the reason why I came
(Dear Adam)
I just wanted you to know
You can fly with wings as eagles
I can do the impossible
Dear Adam, dear Adam
And because I love you so
I have chosen to trade places
So now you can come back home
You might also likeDear Adam, dear Adam
(verse 2)
So depressed and you
Always stressed and you
You're overwhelmed by what your circumstances do
You turn the lights down
Don't want to look up
You let the blinds down and
You want to give up
Please don't run away
I know you feel ashamed
(chorus)
You're the reason why I came
(Dear Adam)
I just wanted you to know
You can fly with wings as eagles
I can do the impossible
Dear Adam, dear Adam
And because I love you so
I have chosen to trade places
So now you can come back home
Dear Adam, dear Adam
(verse 3)
I'm writing you to let you know
The price that I have paid
But you could never understand the cost
Adam you can rise again
Believe the son can shine within
Receive the crown I paid for on the cross
(chorus)
(Dear Adam)
I just wanted you to know
You can fly with wings as eagles
I can do the impossible
Dear Adam, dear Adam
And because I love you so
I have chosen to trade places
So now you can come back home
Dear Adam, dear Adam
(end)
Once upon a time
The lullaby of you and I
Buzzing bees falling leaves birds that sing and massive seas
You believed the lie
And from inside began to die
A misery symphony my harmony
Is gone from me
So where's my happy ever after
I came to live, I knew no sin
I died for you to live again
