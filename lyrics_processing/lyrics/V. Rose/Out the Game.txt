I had a real conversation with my heart for the first time
And I asked for a truce
I said, "I know that you give everything you have, and you hate when you lose"
And you think that I can't understand you
I just tell the hands what the hands do
But you force me to feel when we can't move
Cause you lost everything on a gamble
I need you to stop holding back
I need you to know what's a lot
I need to retire all these lies
And I need to replace all the lights
You can't just tell me to cry
That doesn't make it alright
I got to deal with the whys
So I need to take you to Christ
So don't tell me wrong is the right
For once could you be on my side
Could you be on my side

I'm so sick and tired of her
Will He be your Savior
Or will He be your player
Not trying to be a hater
But what does this
What does this say about my savored heart
I can't let her play no part
Take her right out the game, oh Lord, oh Lord
Take her out the game

All my life I always let you make the decisions
We only came together when we asked forgiveness
You never looked me in the eye and listened
You never called on me just to forget him
I gotta clean up the mess you made are you kidding
You say we are going insane, but you ain't tripping
We gotta start working together, both of us are in this
You gotta stop saying that you're minding your own business
Cause I don't want to lock you away
But you just don't know how to behave
And I'm not really looking for apology
I'm just trying to get rid of the misery
You know that I really don't love company
But then again we don't agree on top of cup of tea
And now I see how it's supposed to be

I'm so sick and tired of her
Will He be your Savior
Or will He be your player
Not trying to be a hater
But what does this
What does this say about my savored heart
I can't let her play no part
Take her right out the game, oh Lord, oh Lord
Take her out the game
Oh Lord, I'm talking to You cause I can't do this alone
Will You take my heart and plant it by Your throne
And don't let it go
