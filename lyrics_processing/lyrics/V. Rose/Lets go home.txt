I just can't explain, i just can't explain
I've been to a place like the yellow brick road
But it's nowhere in the world
You can't find it on the globe
I saw him paint the rose red
Turn the violets blue
Put me in a daze
(chorus)
But then i lost my way
I asked the cheshire cat but he led me to this maze
And gotta go back
It's just not the same
You've gotta come with me, it's too hard to explain
Nobody's angel, you don't need a halo
It's not implossible if you trust in his name, trough
It's not alice in wonderland
It's not dorothy and oz
It's not peter neverland
But it's called the kingdom of god
Do you know where we are?
Cause i don't wanna be lost
Back to where we started from
I believe you are the son
No place like home
You might also like(verse 2)
I've played in the snow
But all you see is a wardrobe
And your lord is the rain (?)
Your precious earth is a war zone
My god can show you how to live
And we don't have to wait, his kingdom is at hand
But there's a choice you have to make
And you can choose to stay and build your castle in the sand
(chorus)
But i'm going back
It's just not the same
You've gotta come with me, it's too hard to explain
Nobody's an angel, you don't need a halo
It's not impossible if you trust in his name, though
It's not alice in wonderland
It's not dorothy and oz
It's not peter in neverland
It's called the kingdom of god
Do you know where we are?
'Cause i don't wanna be lost
Back to where we started from
I believe you are the son
No place like home
(bridge)
(Gotta go back)
Gotta go back
(Just not the same)
It's just not the same
(Gotta come with me)
You gotta come with me
(Hard to explain)
Hard to explain
(Nobody's an angel)
No one's an angel
(Don't need a halo)
You don't need a halo
It's not impossible, you know, if you trust in his name, though
You and i don't have to stay lost, we got decisions
We can find our way back to the kingdom
(end)
I gotta go back
It's just not the same
You gotta come with me, there's no other way
Back to where we started from
I believe you are the son
