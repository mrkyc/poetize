I'll be on a little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway
I'll be on a little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway

I can't hear you when I'm on the phone
Why am I scared to be all alone
Like I'll be so fast to look at the last text when it's the past
I see myself's destination
Where is that contemplation
It's like we send our thoughts straight to voicemail
And act like we ain't by the phone
And I be stressing enough
Learned my lesson it's a blessing if I'm gone off the cuffs
Somebody point me to the exit I'm in need of His love
V I'm on a little getaway
V enough is enough
Lock up all the doors
Hide me in a safe
I'll be on my face
Throw away the keys, yeah
God, I'm so amazed I wanna see Your face
Ain't no telling how long I'm gonna be here

I pull finessing on my stressing when I rap uh-huh
I wast tested learned my lessons in the trap uh-huh
It's like confession on my blessings ain't no cap uh-huh
Now I skrt-skrt through the city like I'm Japanese uh-huh
Did it with ease
Didn't even roll up my sleeves
Balling like a hot boy
Hah boy they can't handle these degrees
Yelling at God come and help me from these people on my jeans
With Jesus I cannot be defeated please
Distractions in my life gotta get free from these
Sometimes I pray to God, "Why do they get me so greasingly"
???
They wanna know how we jump back so easily
Trust me it was a breeze
We got the keys, the keys, the keys
You cannot tell me that we made hell flee
Swear I got so close to God cause of failed dreams
Well I'll be
I'll be on a little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway
I'll be on a little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway
A little getaway

I'll be on a little getaway
Fore the world crash over me like a tidal wave
I don't know, but I know that I gotta play
