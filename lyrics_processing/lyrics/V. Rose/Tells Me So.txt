Comin' to steal and kill and destroy your
Your life
You've been getting hit from left and right
One step forward, two steps back
And people don't know all that you go through
And you've never quite been so under attack

He would love for you to not know, not know who you are
So he can get in your head and break down your heart, ouh
Take down the message, we gon' teach him a lesson
For all the times he had you broken-down and stressin'
Say, "I know Jesus loves me 'cause I heard Him tell me so"
It's you that gotta go
You that gotta know your place
It's you that gotta get out of my face

Yes
Am I loved? Yes
Is there a plan for me? Yes
Do I forget sometimes? Yes but
God doesn't forget about me though
He always lifts me high up like the eagle
I could be goin' out of my mind
In a second, turn to Him and I will be fine
It doesn't have to make sense
The truth will set you free, no matter what you see
Said, it doesn't have to make sense
The truth will set you free, no matter what you think
'Cause who the Son sets free is indeed
So get this truth into your heart and breathe, breathe, breathe
'Cause
You might also like
He would love for you to not know, not know who you are
So he can get in your head and break down your heart
Take down the message, we gon' teach him a lesson
For all the times he had you broken-down and stressin'
Say, "I know Jesus loves me 'cause I hear Him tell me so"
Ouh-oh
Hear Him tell
I hear Him tell me so
He tells me so
He tells me so
He tells me so
He tells me so
Get out of my face
Out of my space
Out of my mind
Out of my life
Life
