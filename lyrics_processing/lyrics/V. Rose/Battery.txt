On my knees, making a plea
Lord, I'm ready! Use me!
The people in the world need a way
I'll tell them what You want me to say
And I'll keep my hands in the air!
Jesus, Your Name is power!
You're the outlet I plug into!
I just want to be used
I want to be electricity just for Your city, yeah!
I feel His energy charging me like a battery
Every time my hands go up, up, up, up, every time my hands go up
I feel His energy using me like a battery
Every time my hands go up, up, up, up, every time my hands go up
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Keep 'em up high, where them hands at?
If you know Jesus stood in your place giving you grace
Then don't take it for granted, no
See, I cannot be purged (Purged)
When I'm feeling the surge (Surge)
And I'm getting the urge (Urge)
To go give 'em the Word
Yes, I gotta rejoice
'Cause with my voice, I was screaming at chicks
Rapping 'bout money and tryna get rich
Looking at Heaven and shaking my fist (But uh)
I want the Lord to use me
Like I'm a tool, like I'm Moses' rod
Screaming give me Jesus!
Give me Jesus!
Give me Jesus!
Give me God!

I feel His energy charging me like a battery
Every time my hands go up, up, up, up, every time my hands go up
I feel His energy using me like a battery
Every time my hands go up, up, up, up, every time my hands go up
Can you feel the power when you say the Name?
Like turning a light on, and all the darkness fades
But we don't deserve it, it's only by grace
It's only through faith that He uses me!
Yeah!!
