I got You, got You, what else?
What else I'm gon' do, what else?
Wasn't raised a fool, what else?
What else to prove? What else?
I got You, got You, got You
I got You, got You, got You
I don't need no new, new, new
I got You, got You, got You, got You

Ain't no more stressing now
Found Your love and I'm resting now
And everyday is a gift
With You I found every reason to live
And I don't need nobody else, no
'Cause who can compare? (Who can compare?)
Who can tell the sun and the moon, "Stay there"? (Stay there)
Who else can open my heart and make all of my fear disappear?

Yeah, It's only the Almighty One, keeping me safe in His love
I never have to give up
I know He'll never let up
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Never let up
Never let up, never let up, never, no
'Cause I got You
You might also like
I got You, got You, what else?
What else I'm gon' do, what else? (What else?)
Wasn't raised a fool, what else?
What else to prove? What else?
I got You, got You, got You (You)
I got You, got You, got You
I don't need no new, new, new
I got You, got You, got You, got You

I'm going up on the waves
I ain't playing no games, here to stay
It took me some time to be confident
Oh, with the one that I serve, it's just common sense
Yeah, I got You nobody else
And I know You'll always stay with me
You're selfless for givin' Your love
Making me new
There's nothing better than You

And I know I can hit You up
Middle of the night, screwed up
You gon' have my line blew up
Ain't nobody else gon' be enough
I don't even look when they pull up
'Cause I got You
Yeah, (Yeah, yeah), ooh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

What else to prove? What else?

I got You, got You, got You (Got You)
I don't need no new, new, new

Late at night when all the world
Is sleeping
I stay up and think of You
Yeah, 'cause there is none like You, ooh-woah
No one else can touch my heart like You do
Yeah
I got You (I got You)
