Put your, put your hearts up
Put your hearts up
If you feel amazing, show some love
To be honest, when you're waking up
With a face full of makeup, all made up
It really ain't glitter all the time
Million things are on my mind
And we may never know why we have crazy days
Might not understand this place
But God made who He meant to make
And He meant to make who He meant to make, yeah
And I wish I would've known
Times when I felt I was the only one
Million girls on the same page I was on
Searching like I'm on Amazon (Amazon)
Every day, we be having a battle
Pressure to live life like a model, not a model though

But that's the result, I was watching the throne
Let me, let me tell you where my mind been at
Let's spit back to the future (Al-almanac)
I was found in the rough where the diamonds at
But this may change, no one know what diamond's what!
I shot for the moon
Now I'm at the sun
So now I can't lose
I already won

A smile is always so suitable
