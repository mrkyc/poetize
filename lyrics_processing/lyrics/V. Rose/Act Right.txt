Act right, right, ri-right, right (Right)
Act right, ri-ight (Right)
Act ri-i-ight
Act right, you better act right (Where you going?)

Whatever you do, just know that I see
I'm the type to pay attention so jealously
Don't make me out to be a fool
You know who you be runnin' to
You know who texts you right back
Even when nobody messin' wit' you like that
When they was gone, you know I was there
And who, who let you vent and cry your tears?
So if you wanna get real then you want me
Then you better get down on that one knee
Tryna' see you make rules at enough speed
If you gonna act right, there's a few things

Don't ever lie, lie, lie
Don't ever make me cry
Don't ever say bye bye, bye, yeah
It's in your timeline, better write it in the skyline
If you love me then act ri-ight, yeah, yeah

'Cause you met my mom and my dad
That's somethin' no one else has
That's why you makin' me mad
You know that I don't do that
You know what it was for me, babe
It was the way that you praise
I could tell you been through some things
And God was still great
Now I know you all on my own
Playin' Bonnie and Clyde, we're eight years old
And I know we might go through the most
But we got God in our lives so we really know what's up, though

Don't ever lie, lie, lie
Don't ever make me cry
Don't ever say bye bye, bye, yeah
It's in your timeline, better write it in the skyline
If you love me then act ri-ight, oh yeah, act right
So baby, don't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
So baby, don't cry, cry, cry, cry, cry-y
Baby, don't say bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Try to love me like my cry, cry, cry-y
So baby, don't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
So baby, don't cry, cry, cry, cry, cry-y
Baby, don't say bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Try to love me like my cry, cry, cry-y
