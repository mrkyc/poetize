You'll never have to be alone
If you would trust me
It's the way I always wanted us to be
I and you and you and me
Ooh I I know with you I really wanna change
I hear everything that you're trying to say
But I don't have the time now
Sometimes I cry no matter how hard I try
I just can't seem to love you right
That's why I gave you my life so even though you are unworthy
You can still come to me
No I'm talk ashamed of me
But my love can cover all
But how could you still love me after all that I've done to you
That's why I gave my son for you
But what if my heart should stray
Than I pursue you with love and grace
I remember the day when I gave my life for you
You don't have to run away no you don't have to be proud
Ooh but god I I'm trying to wait until I'm perfect
I know that you deserve it
Hmm but I'm only human
Sometimes I cry no matter how hard I try
I just can't seem to love you right I
That's why I gave you my life so even though you are unworthy
I have a plan to love you forever
But I keep falling down god over and over
And I don't know what to do I do want to please you
Ooh
Sometimes you cry (Ohhh) but if you give me your life
I'll never leave from by your side
I can't believe you love me so much
This kind of mercy is so good to me
Now tell me I am your god
Jesus you are my god
Do you believe that I rose again yes with all power in your hand
So now will you live for me
Lord I promise.with every breath I breath
But what if my heart should stray
