I'm never shy but this is different
I can't explain the way I'm feeling tonight
I'm losing control of my heart
Tell me what can I do to make you happy
Nothing I ever say seems to come out right
I'm losing control of my heart

And I wish that I could be
Another better part of me
Can't hear what you're thinkin'
Maybe if I just let go
You'll open up your heart

But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's defended I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
No no no no no
No no no no no

I like you so much I'm acting stupid
I can't play the game, I'm all intense and alive
I'm losing control of my heart
I'm not supposed to be this nervous
I should play my hand all cool and calm
I can't breathe
I'm losing control of my heart
Heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
And I wish that I could see
The other better parts of me
Feel this fire I'm feeling
Then you'd see me in control
And baby, then you'd know

That I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
Can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind

And I wish that you could see
The better parts of me
Feel this fire I'm feeling
And you'll see me in control
And baby, then you'd know

That I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you, your heart's defended, I get left behind
I can't read you, I wish I knew what's going through your mind
I can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
I can't read you, I wish I knew what's going through your mind
I can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
I can't read you, I wish I knew what's going through your mind
I can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind
