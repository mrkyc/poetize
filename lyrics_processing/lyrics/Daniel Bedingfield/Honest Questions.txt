Can you see
The honest questions in my heart this hour?
I'm opening like a flower to the rain
And do you know the silent sorrows of a
Never ending journey through the pain

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day? A day?
Do you wonder what's in store for me?
The cure for me? The way?

Oh, look down and see the tears I've cried
The lives I've lived
The deaths I've died
But you died them too
And all for me
And you say:

"I will pour my water down
Upon a thirsty barren land
And streams will flow from the dust of
Your bruised and broken soul
You will grow like the grass
Upon the the fertile plains of Asia
By the streams of living water
You will grow
You will grow"
You might also like
Do you know
My story from the start?
And do you know me
Like you've always told me?
Do you see
The whispers in my heart against your kindness?
My eternal blindness
Do you see?

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day? A day?
Do you wonder what's in store for me?
The cure for me? The way?

Oh, look down and see the tears I've cried
The lives I've lived
The deaths I've died
But you died them too
And all for me
And you say:

"I will pour my water down
Upon a thirsty barren land
And streams will flow from the dust of
Your bruised and broken soul
You will grow like the grass
Upon the the fertile plains of Asia
By the streams of living water
You will grow, oh
I will pour the water down upon a thirsty barren land
And streams will flow from the dust
Of your bruised and broken soul
And you will grow

Like the grass upon the fertile plains of Asia
By the streams
Of living water you will grow
