Her mama told me, if I want her, I gotta take it slow
You just can't just tell her, you gotta find other ways to let her know
But I don't understand this game
This is so new to me
I wanna tell her
I wanna take her in my arms

Give her time (Give her time)
And maybe one day she'll come around
And see the love I am offering
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl
Heaven knows every day I pray
That someday she will belong to me
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl (The girl)

She is my sunshine
But her heart belongs to another man
She looks right through me
She only ever thought of us as friends
But I'll keep holding back my heart
I will not let her see
I'm gonna bide my time
Until the day she comes to me

Give her time
And maybe one day she'll come around  (Maybe she'll come around)
And see the love I am offering
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl
Heaven knows every day I pray (Heaven knows, every day)
That someday she will belong to me
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl
Give her time (Give her time)
And maybe one day she'll come around (Maybe she'll come around)
And see the love I am offering
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl (I don't wanna live without the girl)
Heaven knows every day I pray (Heaven knows every day, I, I, I)
That someday she will belong to me
'Cause I don't wanna live without the girl (Without the girl, without the girl)

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Without the girl
Mmm, mmm
Without the girl
Without the girl
No no no no no no no, oh no
Without the girl
Mmm, mmm
Without the girl
Without the girl
Heaven knows every day (I don't wanna live without the girl)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Without the girl
