I feel like a song without the words
A man without a soul
A bird without its wings
A heart without a home
I feel like a knight without a sword
The sky without the sun
'Cause you are the one

I feel like a ship beneath the waves
A child that lost its way
A door without a key
A face without a name
I feel like a breath without the air
And every day's the same
Since you've gone away

I gotta have a reason to wake up in the morning
You used to be the one that put a smile on my face
There are no words that could describe how I miss you
And I miss you every day
Yeah

And I'm never gonna leave your side
And I'm never gonna leave your side again
Still holdin' on, girl
I won't let you go
'Cause when I'm lyin' in your arms
I know I'm home
You might also like
They tell me that a man can lose his mind
Livin' in the pain
The call in times gone by
The cryin' in the rain
You know I've wasted half the time
And I'm on my knees again
'Til you come to me
Yeah

I gotta have a reason to wake up in the morning
You used to be the one that put a smile on my face
There are no words that could describe how I miss you
And I miss you every day
Yeah

And I'm never gonna leave your side
And I'm never gonna leave your side again
Still holdin' on, girl
I won't let you go

I lay my head against your heart
I know I'm home (I know I'm home, I know I'm home)
And I'm never gonna leave your side (Gonna leave your side)
And I'm never gonna leave your side again (Never)
Still holding on, girl
I won't let you go
'Cause when I'm lyin' in your arms
