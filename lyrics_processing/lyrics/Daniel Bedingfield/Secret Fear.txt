That I will love you still
Maybe all my life
There are no secrets here-
Maybe I love you still
Maybe all my life
I fear that when I lie
Beside the woman I will call my wife-
Then I will hear your voice
Your heart will call to me-
Maybe all my life
All my life-
All my life
Dark flame of mine-
Light of the morning
Dark flame of mine-
How do I, how do I
How do I know?
Dark flame of mine-
No destination
Dark flame of mine-
How do I, how do I
How do I get over you?

Imagination or a lonely heart
Am I the victim of manipulation or-
The woman part?
And when my dying day reaches my open arms-
I know I'll find-
It will contain my fear-
It will assuage the torture of my mind-
Of my mind-
In my mind
Dark flame of mine-
Light of the morning
Dark flame of mine-
How do I, how do I
How do I know?
Dark flame of mine-
No destination
Dark flame of mine-
How do I, how do I
How do I get over you?

I can't dream without your love

I can't breathe without your love
I can't be without you, baby
I can't swim without your love
I can't eat without you, baby
