This changes everything
I wish I knew that before I found your heart-
Light has consumed my eyes
This changes everything
No way to see you as I did before-
Nevermore
I, I pulled you in
Now I'd like you out of my life-
You're not welcome here
I kissed a star-
May it grow to be so hot it burns you from me

It's not me, it's you
(You make the flowers die)
It's not me, it's you
(I fail to realize)
It's not me, it's you
(You are a closing door)
It's not me, it's you
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

This changes everything
I wish I knew that before I made my bed-
Lightning inside my head
This changes everything
I'll never love you as I did before-
Nevermore
I, I pulled you in
Now I'd like you out of my life-
You're not welcome here
I kissed a star-
May it grow to be so hot it burns you from me
You might also like
It's not me, it's you
(You make the flowers die)
It's not me, it's you
(I fail to realize)
It's not me, it's you
(You are a closing door)
It's not me, it's you
I don't love you anymore

Don't tell me what I need to hear
I know you want a way to hear me say-
I'll blow you all away
I'll blow you all away
I'll blow you all-
Don't tell me what I need to hear
I know you want a way to hear me say-
I'll blow you all away
I'll blow you all away-
I'll blow you all away
I'll blow you all-

It's not me, it's you
It's not me, it's you
It's not me, it's definitely you
It's not me, it's you
It's not me, it's you
(You make the flowers die)
It's not me, it's you
(I fail to realize)
It's not me, it's you
(You are a closing door)
It's not me, it's you
