Don't want you looking at the stars tonight
I just want your eyes on me
I wanna be the only thing on your mind
I'll be all you need
Don't want you talking on the phone, don't go out
I just want you here with me
Don't want you spending time alone
Stay around, I'll be all you need
Can't you see you hold my heart in your hands
You own me, you own me
I need you to survive
I know I'm alive when you hold me
Hold me

Don't want to share you with the stars in the night
I only want you to only want me
Now, then and forever
I'm even jealous of the sun in your eyes
I want you looking at me, only me
I want all your attention

Forgive me if I seem to need you to much
You illuminate my soul
Don't think that I could breathe without your touch
You could never know
When I'm with you I've got nothing to hide
You know me, you know me
I need you to survive
I know I'm alive, when you hold me
Hold me
You might also like
Don't want to share you with the stars in the night
I only want you to only want me
Now, then and forever
I'm even jealous of the sun in your eyes
I want you looking at me, only me
I want all your attention

Can't you see you hold my heart in your hands
You own me, you own me
I need you to survive
I know I'm alive when you hold me
Hold me

Don't want to share you with the stars
Don't want the moon to touch your heart
I only want you to only want me
Now, then and forever
I'm even jealous of the sun in your eyes
I want you looking at me, only me
I want all your attention
I want you looking at me, only me
