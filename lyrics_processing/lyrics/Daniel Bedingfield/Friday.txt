I live in an ice house, yeah
I never do dance salsa
I'm livin' in Jamaica
I live in an ice breaka
I'm livin' in Africa
I never do know where, ah
Where I'm livin' but I'm livin' in a free fall
Whenever she goes away
Might as well be in San Jose
'Cause I never can tell where my
Where my heart's gonna spend its time
Half of me's missin'
I miss her kissin'
I don't know nothing but I know

She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday

My head is a hurricane
My heart is a touch insane
And my body can't sleep to dream
And my eyes open up to scream
And my mouth is a thin straight line
As I'm struggling to pass the time
And my crime is that I'm livin' live without her
And the morning soon will come
And the day's nearly almost done
And the clock says it's half past five
But the sun is still in the sky

Disorientated
Insatiated
How long I've waited but I know

She's coming back on Friday

She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
