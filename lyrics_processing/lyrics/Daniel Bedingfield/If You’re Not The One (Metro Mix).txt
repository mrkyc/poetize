I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna run away

If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
Share my life with
Share my life with
Share my life with

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?
You might also like
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
Share my life with
Share my life with

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

Body and soul so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Body and soul so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Body and soul so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Body and soul so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
Stay in your arms
