He don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

Tell me I should not be feeling what I am today
Tell me to silence my heart
Tell me we've been here before
And I will walk away from your love

For there is a wall between you and I
And he hasn't been treating you right
I've been watching it all
I've seen you cry
And I just gotta tell you tonight

That he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

Tell me this love's just a feeling and
Will pass away
Tell me your heart is a liar
Tell me you're not what I know you are
All that a man could desire
You might also like
And he doesn't know
Darling, what he's got
But I would treasure you
If you give me a chance
I will make you smile
I will give you a love that's true

But he don't love you like I love you...
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you

So why can you not see
The place in your heart that was made for me?
Why must you hide yourself away?
And why must you fight
The way that I'm holding your hand tonight?
Take a chance and give your heart to me

But he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you
He don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children
He don't wanna build his life around you
He don't love you like I love you (For there is a wall)
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't wanna have your children (And he doesn't know)
