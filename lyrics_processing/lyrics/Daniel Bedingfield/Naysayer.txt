You were the closest friend I ever had-
I ever had
I'll never meet someone like you again-
Like you again
You cut me deeper than any friend
I've had the guts to stab
So how am I supposed to heal from that?
I can't imagine
You will never know the extent of
The damage that was done
You will always bear the burden of
The thing that you've become
Many times a day I find myself-
Missing my best friend
I'll never give you the opportunity-
To do this again

Now here we are-
'Cause you know me so well
You pulled me down
Burning down in your hell
Before you know it
You'll be on your knees
That's what you get
When you do what you please
You picked me up
Now I throw it away
I never listened to a word you said
Tomorrow night, you'll be on your own
How does it feel
To be an empty throne?

I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe-
Your lies over me
Naysayer-
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe-
Your lies over me

I'm a believer in friends for life-
If I find them
I have to put them under the knife-
To find out if their heart is true
Indelibly scarred by memory of what I had to do-
And now every time I look at her I think of you

I will never know the extent of
The damage that was done
And I will always bear the burden of
The thing that I've become
Many times a day I find myself-
Missing my best friend
I'll never give you the opportunity-
To do this again
Now here we are-
'Cause you know me so well
You led me on
Took me down to your hell
Before you know it
You'll be on your knees
That's what you get
When you do what you please
You picked me up
Now I throw it away
I never listened to a word you said
Tomorrow night, you'll be on your own
You think of that
When you're on your throne
