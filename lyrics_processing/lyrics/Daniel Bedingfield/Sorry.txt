You're my best friend
No you're not
You're my sister, stay in your place
I can't pretend that you're not
Threatening to me,l need my space
I'm not lying, I value survival
Over you
I'm on my own
No I'm not
I've my sister to fight for me
I can't pretend that you won't
Cause you love myself more than me
I'm not lying, so often you choose me
Over you
And I've tried to heal the wounds
Make it as if it never was
And I know I've done my best
But I can never heal the scars

I wanna say I'm sorry but I know I'll do it again
I'll do it again
I know what I did but I still don't know the reason
I wanna say I'm sorry but I know I'll do it again
I'll do it again
I'll do it to you
I don't wanna hurt you anymore
You might also like
I pull you close
Feel your love
Then I push you away from me
Protect myself
I'm not safe when my boundaries are violated
And it's kill or die
So I choose me
Over you
ADD is my excuse
And with my excuse I shot you down
And I know I've got to change
But I can never work out how

How can I say I'm sorry when I know I'll do it again
Do it again
I know what I did but I still don't know the reason
I wanna say I'm sorry but I know I'll do it again
I'll do it again
I'll do it to you
I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Lash out in anger
Hit the wrong target
My little sister
No matter what I say
I love you so much I cannot leave
But when family get too close
I always find it hard to breathe
How can I say I'm sorry when I know I'll do it again
I'll do it again
I know what I did but I still don't know the reason
How can I say I'm sorry when I know I'll do it again
I'll do it again
I'll do it to you
