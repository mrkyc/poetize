You say you love me, but you always try to change me, girl, ooh
I fell in love with you, I did not join a new school girl, ohh
Yesterday, I liked myself, all footloose and fancy free, ohh
Now today I find myself wondering what's wrong with me, ohh
Change comes slowly; give me time to try

You put me down, and you wonder if this can work
And you're wondering if this can work
And you're wondering if it ever could be
You fought the things I like about myself
And you wonder if this can work
And you're wondering if this can work
And you're wondering if I could be
You fought the things I like about myself
You fought the things I like about myself

It makes me wonder if this can work
And it makes me wonder if this can work
And it makes me wonder if this can work
And it makes me wonder if this can work
You say you love me, but you always try to change me, girl, ooh
I fell in love with you, I did not join a new school girl, ohh
Yesterday, I liked myself, all footloose and fancy free, ohh
Now today I find myself wondering what's wrong with me, ohh

Peace of love and the scent of blood
And you get locked out
And you know it
You're running for the
Peace of God and the son of blood
You forgot to love
And you love it
You're gunning for the
Ease of mind
When you get knocked down
And the floor is wet
And you're running before you know it
You lucked out
And by the time
And the peace of mind
Got the better
The better of it
You put me down, and you wonder if this can work
And you're wondering if this can work
And you're wondering if it ever could be
You fought the things I like about myself
And you wonder if this can work
And you're wondering if this can work
And you're wondering if I could be
You fought the things I like about myself
You fought the things I like about myself

It makes me wonder if this can work
And it makes me wonder if this can work
