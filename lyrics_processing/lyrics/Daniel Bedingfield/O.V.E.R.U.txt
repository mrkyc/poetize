La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Don't think I'm lost
Don't think I'm struggling to mend, no, no, no
Don't think I've left you only to come back again
Some things have got to end now

(O-v-e-r)
And everything you were to me has got to be over
(O-v-e-r)
Before the fight, there was the night but this the day after
(O-v-e-r)
We spent the night to take a chance, I won't be that stupid
(O-v-e-r)
We bit the dust, the both of us, I'm done and I'm over you now

I'm mine, I'm moved, I'm over you now
So light, so good, I'm over you now
I'm free, I'm alive, I'm over you now
The truth always said
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la
Don't get me wrong
What we had was wonderful for a time
But then goodbye was something I had to say
It was either yours or mine
You might also like
(O-v-e-r)
And everything you were to me has got to be over
(O-v-e-r)
Before the fight, there was the night but this the day after
(O-v-e-r)
We spent the night to take a chance, I won't be that stupid
(O-v-e-r)
We bit the dust, the both of us, I'm done and I'm over you now

I'm mine, I'm moved, I'm over you now
So light, so good, I'm over you now
I'm free, I'm alive, I'm over you now
The truth always said
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la

And everything you were to me has got to be over
Before the fight, there was the night but this the day after
We spent the night to take a chance, I won't be that stupid
We bit the dust, the both of us, I'm done and I'm over you

I'm mine, I'm moved, I'm over you now
So light, so good, I'm over you now
I'm free, I'm alive, I'm over you now
The truth always said, I'm over you now
I'm mine, I'm moved, I'm over you now
So light, so good, I'm over you now
I'm free, I'm alive, I'm over you now
The truth always said
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la
I don't miss you anymore, la, la, la, la, la
I don't miss you anymore
(O-v-e-r, o-v-e-r)
I don't miss you anymore
(O-v-e-r, o-v-e-r)
I don't miss you anymore
