1,2,3 hit it
Now listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week, yeah
Saturday night I'd like to do my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet, no
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get away from the same old same old
I need my chance, I get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
(We came to party, we came to party)
How can I resist?
(We came to party and have a good time)
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
(We came to party, we came to party)
And it don't get better than this, yeah
(We came to party and have a good time)
I spend my money on women and wine
I could not tell you where I spent last night, no
I'm real sorry about the shape I'm in
Just like my fun every now and then

See I was born in the land of the free and of the brave
And I just wanna rock my roll from the cradle to the grave
