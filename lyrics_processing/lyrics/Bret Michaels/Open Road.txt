Living the perfect life
Jesse was told what to think, what to wear
What she could and could not buy
Her parents too busy to listen
Never give her the time of day
All Jesse wanted was someone to listen
To what she had to say
She said, "They gotta let me be
Gotta let me live my life"
She packed her bags and slammed the door
For the very last time
What Jesse wants is an open road
Her favorite song playing on the radio
Cranked up loud, singing out of key
Tell the whole world who she's gonna be
Foot on the pedal, just a letting it go
Letting it rock, letting it roll
An open road to chase her dreams
I think what Jesse really wants is to be young, wild and free
Now Jimmy lives on the other side of town
Struggling to stay on his feet
Pulling away at some dead end job
Just trying to make ends meet

His father ain't never around
And just because he's a poor boy
Everybody thinks they can keep him down
Boss man there to remind him
A whole new 9 to 5
Jimmy looked down at his calloused hands
Then he realized
What Jimmy wants is an open road
His favorite song playing on the radio
Cranked up loud, singing out of key
Against the wind, screaming, "This is me"
His foot on the pedal, just a letting it go
Letting it rock, letting it roll
Open road to chase his dreams
Jimmy really wants is to be young, wild and free
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Two lost souls are traveling
Down that road of life
A little bit of faith
About to cross their paths tonight
A lonely exit, East L.A
Just to stop to watch the sun go down
There was Jimmy on the hood of his car
Thinking about turning around
And somewhere in that moment
Before the sun surrendered to the night
Like some famous final scene
Jesse caught Jimmy's eye
Out there on that open road
They found a life to call their own
Living young and wild and free
Just the way it was meant to be
Jesse and Jimmy on an open road
Favorite song playing on the radio
Cranked up loud, singing out of key
Young and wild and finally free
Foot on the pedal, letting it go
Letting it rock letting it roll
On that open road they found their dream
'Cause what Jesse really wants, what Jimmy really wants
What we all really want is to be young, wild and free
Oh yeah, yeah
