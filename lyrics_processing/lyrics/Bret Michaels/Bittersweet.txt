That she don't love me anymore
She packed her bags and her cell phone
And moved right next door
She called and told me
She was moving in with my best friend
This is where the party ends
I used to love her bad
But she didn't love me
Used to kiss her lips
Now I watch them bleed
Gave her a diamond ring
Now I want it back
Besides she sucked in the sack
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Sucked in the sack
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Want my ring back
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
My heart is black
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Screw my friend Jack

With my ex-friend Jack
She broke my heart
So my guitar and me wrote this crap
I don't care if their love affair ever lasts
'Cause I'm about to kick his ass
I used to love her bad
But she didn't love me
Used to kiss her lips
Now I watch them bleed
Gave her a diamond ring
Now I want it back
Besides she sucked in the sack
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Sucked in the sack
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Want my ring back
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
My heart is black
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Screw my friend Jack
One day Jack came over to apologize
He told me my ex which is his new girlfriend
Was out every night
Jack said, "I think she's been cheating
With my new friend Jim"
Say you love her too bad
'Cause now she loves him
Pulled a Jerry Springer on me
Now you're outta luck
My new girlfriend thinks you all suck
I used to love her bad
But she didn't love me
Used to kiss her lips
Now I watch them bleed
Gave her a diamond ring
Now I want it back
Besides she sucked in the sack
I used to love her bad
But she didn't love me
Used to kiss her lips
Now I watch them bleed
Gave her a diamond ring
Now I want it back
Besides she sucked in the sack
Sucked in the sack
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
Want my ring back
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
My heart is black
(Bittersweet, bittersweet)
