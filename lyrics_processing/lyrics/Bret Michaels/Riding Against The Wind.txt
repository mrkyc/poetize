An airport bar, there you sat all alone
I said, "hello, How've you been?"
"God girl, it's sure good to see you again"
Remember of Panama City
You were fall down drunk
But you still looked pretty
We made love all night
On the beach that September
Told my friends it was great
But you still can't remember
Well...
That was then
This is now
Lookin back i wouldn't change it anyhow
This is now
That was then
Life rolls on
We're still riding against the wind
As for me
My life's been up and down
Playing night to night
Moving town to town
You said you had a daughter, I've got two of my own
They're the love of my life
They sure helped me grow up

I've made a few friends who didn't make it back
Yea I danced with the devil and
Cried with the saints
I broke all the rules
So it's wasn't all in vain
That was then
This is now
Lookin back i wouldn't change it anyhow
This is now
That was then
Life rolls on
We're still riding against the wind
Somedays I'm smiling
Somedays I'm sad
Somedays I still wake up fighting mad
Yea there's a part of me that wants to go back
Then I remember I'm good right where I'm at
It's getting late baby so let's raise a glass
One to the future
And one to the past
Those photographs
Pictures of
The friends we lost
And here's to the ones we love
That was then
This is now
Lookin back I wouldn't change it anyhow
This is now
That was then
Life rolls on
We're still riding against the wind
It's all right
It's okay
Yesterday's gone
I'm living for today
It's ok
It's all right
Somehow we all made it through the night
Life rolls on baby!
And it's rolling
We're still riding against the wind
It's all right
It's ok
