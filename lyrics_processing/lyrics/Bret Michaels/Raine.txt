When I hold you in my arms, I can feel you breathe
When I look into your eyes, makes me believe
In a God, in a place, that brings me hope, gives me faith
Before our time is done, I want to be the one to
Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my Raine
If I ever let you down, I didn't mean to do that
If you need me and I'm not around, I am sorry for that
Sometimes life is strange, some days it pulls me away from you
But on my soul I swear, for you I will be there to
Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years through the pain
Times of heartache times of change
I'll be your sun you be my Raine
