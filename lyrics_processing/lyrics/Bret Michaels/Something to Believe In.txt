When I wrote the lyrics to Something to Believe
In it truly was the hardest lyrics I ever had to write
It was a time in my life that, uh
When Kimo passed away it was just such a devastating time
And I remember being home at the Christmas break
And I went upstairs into my sister Nicole's room and I just wrote these lyrics
And they just poured out of me and it turned into many different things
And it was my way of releasing all that pain
Rikki and Bobby and C.C. allowed me to just keep the song the way it was
Which I'm very thankful for and a very good friend of ours
Bruce Fairburn, who produced this song just let it the way it was
He loved it and it was beautiful and also
Bruce Fairburn had recently passed away
So this song, while doing this really, really means a lot to me
Song (5:18)
Will I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised land
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hand
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah

Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried "Forgive me for what I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did"

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home
I drive by the homeless sleeping on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read JESUS SAVES
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

You take the high road
And I'll take the low road
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
