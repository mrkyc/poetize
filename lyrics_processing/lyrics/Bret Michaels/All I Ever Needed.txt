He knelt down on his knees and took her by the hand
We've seen some good times, been through some bad
But somewhere between the laughter and the tears
We sure had a lot of great years
He said, we didn't need fortune, didn't need fame
Just a little shelter from the rain, your hand to hold on to
When times got tough you pulled me through
(You pulled me through)
We didn't need a castle made of stone
Just you there as I grow old
Your heart to hold on to
All I ever needed was you, was you
Remember our first dance and our first kiss
I pictured my life with you to be just like this
You stood by me
(Oh, you stood by me)
I stand by you
(I stand by you)
We share the laughter, joy and pain
But it's a moment like this I hope it never ends
(Oh, it should never end)
