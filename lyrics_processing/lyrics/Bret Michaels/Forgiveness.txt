Honeymoon is over seems love has lost its thrill
He blames her and God knows that she blames him
Loves not about killing time this ain't no way to live
Just can't up and walk away
Knows that wouldn't be right
Instead he hangs out at the local bar
Drowns his problems every night
He says forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
I think I'm losing you
Forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
'Cause I don't know what to do
He comes home late falls into bed and closes his eyes
He pretends to sleep while she lies there and cries
Sometimes she gets so angry she just wants to scream
A prince no longer charming it wasn't like this in her dreams
Someday she wants a change of life
Get in that car and leave but deep down she loves him and the kids
She's got them mouths to feed
She cries forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
I think I'm losing you
Forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
'Cause I don't know what to do

Where the hell did it go wrong
Where's it start and where's it end
Lets both keep holding on
One day it hit him hard
Laid his head in her hands
Looked up said, I don't want to lose you I hope you understand
So he looked into her eyes said this is what we'll do
If you give a little bit baby then I'll give a little bit too
And they said forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
I still believe in you
Forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
Let love pull us through
Forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
We'll take it day by day
Forgive me, (forgive me) forgive me
