It's bumper to bumper down town
Thinkin' up excuse I ain't used
When. the bossman comes around
Workin', slavin', bustin', hump, minimum wagin
Pushin', shovin', givin' my all and I'm gettin back nothin'
(chorus)
Hey, hey what time ya got?
It's Saturday night and it's twelve o'clock
Hey, hey where ya wanna go?
Where the music's loud and the beer is cold
Hey, hey what are now?
A little too rowdy and way too loud
We ain't too pretty and we ain't too proud
We're a hard rockin', foot stompin'
Lookin' for a good time now
Under the gun workin' overtime
Just to earn that extra dollar
Uncle Sam takes one, the state takes two
Sometimes I don't know why I bother
Workin', slavin', bustin', hump, minimum wagin
Pushin', shovin', givin' my all and I'm gettin back nothin'

Hey, hey what time ya got?
It's Saturday night and it's twelve o'clock
Hey, hey where ya wanna go?
Where the music's loud and the beer is cold
Hey, hey what are now?
A little too rowdy and way too loud
We ain't too pretty and we ain't too proud
We're a hard rockin', foot stompin'
Lookin' for a good time now
Now I ain't gonna waste my tears
On things that I can't change
As long as I got my good friends
You'll never hear me complain
(chorus)
Hey, hey what time ya got?

We ain't too pretty and we ain't too proud
We're a hard rockin', foot stompin'
Lookin' for a good time now

Hey, hey what are now?
A little too rowdy and way too loud
We ain't too pretty and we ain't too proud
We're a fun lovin', foot stompin' beer drinkin'
