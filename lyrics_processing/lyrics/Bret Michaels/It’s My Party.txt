Let 'em all bitch, I don?t give a shit
I?ll throw the biggest parties in this town
I watch all the girls shake their booties around
Smoke the ganja, let the party rage
Good girls turn bad, when they come to play
I use them and they use me
In the morning they know they're history
Well, it?s my party
I could cry if I want to
It?s my party
Do what I want
It?s my party
I get high if I want to
It?s my party
I do what I want
My car?s real cherry, yeah, it?s real bad ass
I?ll snap your head off when I step on the gas
It plays music so loud you can feel it coming
Makes all the virgins horny
Sends all the preacher running
See Bret Michaels LiveGet tickets as low as $15You might also likeSome fool?s always racing me
He gets too close my dust is all he?ll see
When you see red lights, I see green
It?s hard to be good in such a bad machine
Well, it?s my party
I could cry if I want to
It?s my party
Do what I want
It?s my party
I get high if I want to
It?s my party
I do what I want
I grow my hair right down to my feet
Nobody fucks with me on this here street
There ain?t no one tell me how to live
You learn to respect when you come in my crib
Well, it?s my party
It?s my party
Well, it?s my party
I could cry if I want to
It?s my party
Do what I want
It?s my party
I get high if I want to
It?s my party
I do what I want
Well, it?s my party
I could cry if I want to
It?s my party
Do what I want
It?s my party
I can die if I want to
It?s my party
I do what I want
It?s my party
I could cry if I want to
It?s my party
Do what I want
It?s my party
I get high if I want to
It?s my party
