We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
(Loretta Lynn)
Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did?
Did my words not come out right?
(Bret Michaels)
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried but I guess that's why, they say
(Bret Michaels & Loretta Lynn)
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its, yeah, it does
(Loretta Lynn)
I listen to my favorite song
Playin' on the radio
(Bret Michaels)
Hear the D.J. say
"Love's a game of easy come and easy go"

But I wonder, does he know
Has he ever felt like this?
(Bret Michaels)
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow
(Bret Michaels & Loretta Lynn)
I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorns
(Loretta Lynn)
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
(Bret Michaels)
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
(Bret Michaels)
I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways
But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
(Bret Michaels & Loretta Lynn)
I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
