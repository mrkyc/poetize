Now listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week, yeah
Saturday night I'd like to do my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet, no
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get away from the same old same old
I need my chance, I get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
I spend my money on women and wine
I could not tell you where I spent last night, no
I'm real sorry about the shape I'm in
Just like my fun every now and then
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need my chance, I get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time

Alright Michael, lay that groove down
See I was born in the land of the free and of the brave
And I just wanna rock my roll from the cradle to the grave
So I raise a toast to all of us
Bustin' our backs every day
If wantin' this good life's such a crime
Lord, then put me away, yeah
Here's to ya
Oh, play it, Ace
Guitar

Ooh, don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
