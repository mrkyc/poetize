I like my cigarettes and alcohol
Usually I'm so loaded I don't think
This si the one that's got me tied
This is the one that blows my mind
I've quit the drugs and now I think I'm jinxed
It's all these angles in my mind
Keep on taking all my time
I wish they'd just let me be
I've been scared for sometime
About this job I have in line
I think it could be my final feat
Here I go again
I have a feeling this could be the end
Now everyone is looking right at me
Every stunt I've always met it
I'm the one who deserves the credit
But lately the directors don't agree
It's all these angles in my mind
Keep on taking all my time
I wish they'd just let me be
I've been scared for sometime
About this job I have in line
I think it could be my final feat
You might also likeI don't know who to turn to
I don't know who to tell
I don't know if I can handle
I don't know if I can show
I keep thinking crazy things
And I don't know what they mean
But for now I guess I'll just have to fake it
You can call me fall
I like my cigarette and alcohol
I've almost taken everything I could
I'm the one taking all the dives
I'm the one who never dies
But lately I've been wondering if I should
It's all these angles in my mind
Keep on taking all my time
I wish they'd just let me be
I've been scared for sometime
About this job I have in line
I think it could be my final feat
I don't know who to turn to
I don't know who to tell
I don't know if I can handle
