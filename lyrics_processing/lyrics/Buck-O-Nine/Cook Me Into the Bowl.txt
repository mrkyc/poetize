I was up all night
And it feels so good
But I can't decide
I've been drinkin' like a monster
If or ever, when can I?
Your givin' me the flu
Less soul, imagination
Lets stroll down the middle of the road
One shot of desperation
Cook me into the bowl
Write it all down
On a fuckin' piece of paper
It doesn't mean a thing
I want to sail around the world
Fever! Fever!
What's the lesson, not my turn
Pushing every button
Not sure if I'll ever learn
That I don't know about anything
I don't know what to do
So I gotta get away
Away from something
Gotta get away
Don't know what to do
Gotta get away
Away from something
It might as well be you
You might also likeSo I'll lie again, lie again
What's the use in suffering
Cook me up higher
Than I've ever been before
Got a migraine and I'm
About to fuckin' go insane
Just gotta kick it
Say that I'm bored
That I don't know about anything
I don't know what to do
So I gotta get away
Away from something
Gotta get away
Don't know what to do
Gotta get away
Away from something
It might as well be you
Got a fever, got a fever
I was up all night
And it feels so good
But I can't decide
I've been drinkin' like a monster
If or ever, when can I?
Your givin' me the flu
Less soul, imagination
Lets stroll down the middle of the road
One shot of desperation
Cook me into the bowl
That I don't know about anything
I don't know what to do
So I gotta get away
Away from something
Gotta get away
Don't know what to do
Gotta get away
Away from something
Ohh shit
So I gotta get away
Away from something
Gotta get away
Don't know what to do
Gotta get away
Away from something
