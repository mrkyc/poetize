Once I had a little dog, I called him Cracker Jack
He had a spot around one eye that looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long and he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at but he looked alright to me
I found him by the river bank just wandering about
He was cold and hungry and his ribs were sticking out
I snapped my fingers, whistled, when he came, I picked him up
I was just a kid and Cracker Jack was just a pup
I took him home and fed him 'til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room and put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers I'd pray the lord his soul to keep

Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack would run to meet me after school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail and look at me as if to say
"I love you and I've missed you and I'm glad you're home again"
I knew just how he felt 'cause me and Cracker Jack was friends
Through the woods and fields we would often roam about
And when we got in trouble we would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common and we had a lot of fun
He was always with me when I was growing up
We shared each other's good times and we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now but often I think back
To the days of childhood, the days of Cracker Jack
