Oh-oh

Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around

Now, I ain't one for speakin' out much
But that don't mean I don't stay in touch
Everybody's trippin' over this or that
What we gonna do when we all fall flat?

Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What we gonna do when it all burns down?

I don't know what to think about us
When did we lose "In God we trust?"
God almighty, what we gonna do?
If God ain't listenin' and we're deaf too

Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around

Don't get me started on politics
Now how are we to live in a world like this?
Greedy politicians, present and past
They wouldn't know the truth if it bit 'em in the ass

(What you gonna do?) Now tell me, what is truth?
(What you gonna do?) Have we all lost sight
(What you gonna do?) Of common decency?
(What you gonna do?) Of wrong and right?
How do we heal this great divide?
Do we care enough to try?
But liar, liar, the world's on fire
What we gonna do when it all burns down?

Billy got a gun, Joey got a knife
Janie got a sign to carry in the fight
Marchin' in the streets with sticks and stones
Don't you ever believe words don't break bones

Oh, can't we rise above?
Can't we show some love?
Do we just give up or make a change?
We know all too well
We've all been through hell
Time to break the spell in Heaven's name
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher (Fire, fire)
Still got time to turn it all around
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around
