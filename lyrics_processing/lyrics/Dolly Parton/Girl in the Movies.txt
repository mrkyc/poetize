Popcorn, soda, box of Raisinets
Velvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests
Best seat in my favorite movie house
Start my dreaming as the lights go out
Up on the silver screen, I picture me
Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies

I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful, with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after
I want to be the girl in the movies

Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me

I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes)
She gets the roles she chooses
She can laugh or she can cry
Acting in her story
Standing in her glory
Always happy endings
I want to be the girl in the movies

It's time I show the world just what I'm about
I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out
I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud
I want to be that girl

I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm
I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm hmm

Gonna stand up
And I'm gonna matter
'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered
And I've had enough of my tears being splattered
I've already been that girl
Oh, I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to be (I want to be)
Hey look at me (Hey look at me)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to shine (I want to shine)
I want to shine (I'm gonna shine)
It's my time
And I want to shine
I want to be happy, I want to be free
