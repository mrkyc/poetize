It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatting old time country place
Ain't nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers, local business men
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
But pay day would get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry

It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatting old time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty going on

I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away

Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say "hi" on the street
Mind your P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools
Because every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yeah every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Ruby Rae, start 'em!
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Beatrice!
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands belong on cattle, and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's

Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid of right now
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave oughta be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell
You better get here double quick

And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening good?
Keep them leeches and blood suckers off the back roads
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't gripe and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that-a-way

She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
 
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see

Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
