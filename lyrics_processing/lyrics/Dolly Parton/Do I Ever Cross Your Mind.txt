Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me
Do you, darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
Oh, and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were with me
Do you, darling?
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close

And when I think of you and the love we once knew, how I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all, or do I ever cross your mind?
You might also like
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me, do you darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
Oh, and do you ever miss the feeling and the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?

Or do I ever cross your mind?
Tell me, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Darling, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Tell me, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
