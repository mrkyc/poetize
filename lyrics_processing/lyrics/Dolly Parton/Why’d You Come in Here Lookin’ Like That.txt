In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy, who says love is blind?
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a soft-hearted woman, he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine
