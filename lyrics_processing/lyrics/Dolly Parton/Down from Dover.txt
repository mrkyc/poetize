I have tried concealing
When he left he promised me that he'd be back
By the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow
Over the fields of clover
And time is running out for me I wish
That he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long
When he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass
And now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself
Because waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give
It if he doesn't hurry down from Dover
From Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding when they found out
They sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out
He'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool
And she did not believe it when I told her
That everything would be all right
Because soon he would be coming down from Dover
You might also likeI found a place to stay out
On a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin'
So I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a message to my mom
With a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information
When he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything
And I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved
And I just can't believe that he was using me
He couldn't leave me here like this
I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone
Oh he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here
It's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born but something's wrong
It's much too still I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew
She'd never have a father's arms to hold her
And dying was her way of telling me
