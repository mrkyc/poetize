Last night I had a dream about God
He was standing on a mountain top
Looking down, around in such dismay
And in my dream I heard him say

"Don't make me have to come down there
My children, you had best beware
If you don't pay attention, consequences will be dire
Don't make me have to come down there"

I've told you time and time again
You can't disobey and hope to win
I am still the boss here, in case there's any doubt
You know I put you in this world, and I can take you out

Don't make me have to come down there
You've always been my cross to bear
I've let you try my patience as all good fathers do
You're on my last nerve, I have had it up to here with you

I gave you a book, you didn't read it (You didn't read it)
I gave you my word, you didn't heed it (You didn't heed it)
Gave you a map, you said you didn't need it (You didn't need it)
And now you've lost direction, and you're wandering aimlessly
You might also like
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me)
This is not a game of truth or dare (Don't make me)
Now, I don't want to punish you, but if it has to be
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me

Don't make me have to come down there
Bridge this great divide and make repairs
Go to your room and pray 'til you can learn to play fair
Don't make me have to come down there (Come down there)

Politics, earthquakes, erratic weather
Pandemics, war, and hate, still, you'd rather
Turn a deaf ear, a blind eye; I am wondering whether
I should take my Bible belt and whip you into shape

Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me)
My children, you had best beware (Don't make me)
Clean up this mess and put on something decent to wear
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me have to come down there)

Don't make me have to come down there
My children, you had best beware (Don't make me)
Why can't you learn to listen and learn to love and share?
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me come down there
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me come down there
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me, don't make me
