Lovin' you, my pride and joy
I'll defend you, I will mend you
When you're broken like a toy
When your burdens get too heavy
When you're weary to the bone
I will help you hold it steady
Pack it up and head for home
I will love you come whatever
I will be there when you call
I'll encourage each endeavor
Be the first one to applaud
I'll correct you when you're sideways
I will praise you when you win
I will be there for you always
With a love that never ends
I will always (I will always)
I will always (I will always)
I will always (always) be lovin' you
Midst the chaos and confusion
I am never far behind
My love is your transfusion
To restore your soul and mind
I will nurse you back to freedom
Doctor up your shattered parts
Two arms here when you need 'em
And one lovin', open heart
You might also likeAnd if the world should end tomorrow
And we both know that it might
'Mongst the darkness and the sorrow
I will be your guiding light
And if God sees fit to let us
Be together ever more
If I had one question granted
That's what I would ask him for
And I will love you come whatever
I will catch you when you fall
I'll encourage each endeavor
When your back's against the wall
I will hold you when you're fragile
I will always let you in
I will rock you like a sweet child
Like a lover and a friend
I will always (I will always)
I will always (I will always)
I will always (always) be lovin' you
I will always (always), I will always (always)
Yes, I will always be lovin' you (lovin' you)
Lovin' you (lovin' you), lovin' you
Lovin' you
I'm lovin' you
(Lovin' you, I'm lovin' you, lovin you)
I will love you come whatever
I will always let you in
I will rock you like a baby
Be your lover and your friend
I'll defend you, I will mend you
I will always see you through
