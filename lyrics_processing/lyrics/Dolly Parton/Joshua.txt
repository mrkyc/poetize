Mm, mm-mm

Well, a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walkin' down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog layin' out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say, "Well, who are you?"
Oh, and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke, his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said, "What you doin' snoopin' around my place?"
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said, "Come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you're already here"
And he said, "You can call me Joshua"

Joshua, Joshua
What you doin' livin' here all alone?
Joshua, Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own?
No, no, no, no

We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talkin' when it come daylight
There was just so much we had to say, hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him, I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh, we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack, it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sittin' down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua

Joshua, Joshua
Why, you're just what I've been lookin' for
Joshua, Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No, no
Yodel-e-odel-e, hey, del-e-hee
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-da
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua, yeah, yeah
