So many categories styles and ways that we've used it
To keep you in tune with the sound track as the mood switches
Emphasizing emotions to amplify the notion thus
Electrocute it
I execute it so it's therapeutic
Innovation improves it but never abuse it
Leon Scott found a way to rotate a plate on a pin
Creating tracings of vibrations made while it spins
Time Frame
1877 to 1876
Using this Thomas Edison improved a bit
See he invented a machine that played a two-minute disk
After Bell invented the telephone in '76
Time Frame
After World War I a wide range of signs came
Music retail was a wise aim
In the early 20s blues defined the game the time frame
That black music was segregated and jazz climbed to fame
From pop philosophy you know get the lock and key to grow
From any prophecy truth grows
See many comedy duos like Harris and Harris recorded rhymes over blues beats
In 19 two 3 like Kool Keith bugging on looseleaf
To introduce heat we use speech
Eighty years ago they used what we now know as hip-hop to move streets

Now or never power measured by violent terror
Allowing a sense of the vibe that ties it together
As clever interventors found treasures to make the world better
Working under pressure to step up aggressors were searching to get an edge up

With these components ease the soul with the poet that captures the moment
And adds the exponent of madness in motive and after the focuses clear

For the first time in the next decade of the century
Malcolm X and Dr. King were both assassinated
It acts of hatred that aggravating folks, immaginate it

In 82 came the cd in 83 Ad the the Technics
SL 100 MK2 was released
DJs increased faster than folks knew the passion was global
Three years prior the nuclear accident in Chernobyl
Businesses used COBAL and biophysics
Fused with robiotics in experiments back in 1986 too
Creating the vibe for me to demonstrate dope facts
Discussing debatable concepts to quote back
88 was so fat and that is a known fact
Self-destruction and yo mtv raps
Captured the inner city spirit you heard it and now you see it
Believe that it's reaching out representing the youth
Speaking out as a voice of the streets reaching out
Odds were evened out
We rap when it's hard to speak about things the local news were leaving out
Rhyme writers would feel it out out, speaking clout
Weaker speakers be seated deleted and weeded out
Political bouts leads to problems that's bleeded out
I'm teaching now so see me out
Insight's free to shout
Other's they deal in doubt
Remember that the worlds always under pressure and music can ease it out

Listen, crime and pain signs of the dying age

Liers reign, control and power is the prime aim
Time Frame
Rhyme games though the art is a crying shame
