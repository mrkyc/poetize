Concentrate before you make any moves
I'll guide you in spirit to make sure that fate doesn't lose
Power penetrates, I take less than hours to meditate
Shower in thoughts,  vibes I accelerate
Speeds that exceeds needs in the fist of greed
One of your own mine, I insist you read
Feel the mystical, miss ease
Through sound waves
Around streets like breeze
Through the trees to influence rhythm
As soon as it hits
One, two, three they're victims
Listen, ideas change and thoughts spawn
You're thinking, sporadic decisions are gone
Now they can make you lose, die or stay confused
In any case, I'll be there to break the news
When there's no one else to believe in
Seek within-sight, AKA the voice of reason

So many options to choose many ways to lose
Everyday you move hoping things go smooth
When times are rough, decisions sometime get tough
And they call for quick reaction, so many distractions
Stabilize your mind for traction
In front of your friends
It's lights, camera and action
Some try hard to impress them
Maybe by becoming an icon
Or throwing something fly on
This concept extends to doing crime and time too
And it's easier notice, as time goes by you
Violent because you have nothing to lose
What if you had a house on the  you'd be suffering too
There's a gun on your back, no sudden moves
That's advice to believe in
I'm speaking, hear me out, it's the voice of reason

The one that you should believe in
(Who's that?)
The voice of reason
