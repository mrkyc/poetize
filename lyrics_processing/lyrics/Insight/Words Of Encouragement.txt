Growing up I wasn't rich but I had enough
Nor was I poor yet times were tough
According to the news, gang violence was up
And my cousin got shot because the streets were rough
Rest in peace, I learn to respect life at a young age
And unleashed rage on page in many different ways as well
So I succeeded to excel, defeated steps of Hell on Earth
Demons of death that lurk
I learn to spot 'em when I see 'em
I can sense they smile, I feel 'em sneaking
Disguise as a friend, look, they're peaking
So they can never catch me by surprise
I'ma stay on point and never close my eyes
Out of the truth, unfolds lies
It takes time for some to realize and get wise
When I was five I had dreams that have rised to reality
Jealousy outweighed support from so called friends
Who entered where they exited in the end
They fade away...when memories disappear
Now you can think clear as thoughts flourish
And then, vibe
These are words of encouragement

I'm your mentor that's what I was sent for
Realize I'm here to open up doors
I present more to help your mind grow
A lot of this advice you should already know
You might also like
I know I do a lot of things at once
I be talking on the phone, walking and eating my lunch
Cause I'm always on the move, that makes me feel comfortable
I get into a groove and forget about problems
I was told I didn't have realistic goals
And nothing will get done unless I focused on one
I never listened to that now, or when I was young
I'm self employed but yo, my jobs are fun
I cut a lot of suckas off and they ain't even around now
They give me dap and try to act like they down but
They stab me in the back before and think that I'm strange
Cause I don't look out for them now, yo they think that I change
I won't explain nothing
I let them think what they will
Step off, you ain't paying my bills, chill
Fade away
Yo, friends come and go
In any event these are words of encouragement


In life you're told yes less than no
Can't before could, stop before go
And as you grow, should becomes won't
And many of your possible do's become don't
You gotta be a prize fighter with the eye of a tiger to rise higher
Support expires when you step into the fire
Liars, leeches, snakes and anyone fake
Will say what sounds right just to slice the cake
I take, extra moments to carefully decide where I'm going
Or which one to choose there's no time to lose
Ask yourself if you'd rather see me lost and confused
In the local street news, we cool right?
What's up then?
If you're fronting you don't have to say nothing friend
Just keep to yourself, these are words of encouragement
