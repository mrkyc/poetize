You learn from mistakes to avoid aggravation
Lack of patience leads to frustration
I evolve 360 degrees,trees touch the space station
Lust is a safe haven craving to work its way in
Love caves in the notion thus changing emotions
Evolve
Oceans dissolve snakes and fish crawl
Young bully told a boy he couldn't play kick ball
Never think small or risk all, skip all pit falls
Evolve
Think dense six sense miss sit tall
A thief?s son grows up to be a crook in a shop
Is looking shocked when computers transform into cops
'Cause they evolve and learned a lesson a confession was called
When you adapt come back, only when troubles resolved
With any one involved dissolve the good from the bad
Homeless man finds cloths in a nook and is glad
See we observe what's around us to grow to step two
'Cause I evolve into a leader slow and so can you
Be a believer, 'cause people tried to hold me back
Told me what I couldn't do but I knew better than that
So I evolved into a Jack of all trades
That's how I succeed these days
The mainstream is a phase
Dark skin that we've evolved blocks out sun rays
Thick eye brows of mine size down the glaze
I painted murals in the eight grade & girls were amazed
As I evolved to do the same by using words on a page
Wasn't the most popular cat in Curley Sharon or Latin
Seaside High school in Cali I started a group rapping
Emcees wanted to fight us
Teachers would break up ciphers
I hated English, yet I evolved into a writer
And in spite of the fact that I had lack of support
From friends or relationships, I traveled up north
Lived in Boston an visited family in New York
Got my licence at 15 a studio was a dream
And yo I started with a profit 2000 keyboard
But that evolved into the laboratory where I record
Spilling acid on cats I burn scraps of irrelevance
Intelligence is evidence that?s suggested by a specimen
Success is when you evolve and the puzzle is solved
See I surpass obstacles cause I can walk through walls
You might also likeSee I evolve into a man from a baby
Braided little girl with dolls evolve into a grown lady
Who leaves when she feels like a situation is shady
Notice she could spot a player whose picture painting like crazy
She evolved now because she sees it all like the matrix
In calculus Insight skipped to advanced from basic
I evolved yes y'all and stand five feet tall
I use speech to bust rhymes through a concrete wall
By now I can assume you know the title of the song
But if you had to ask the question something highly is wrong
You should evolve smarten up an now the problem is solved
When the mind can reverse from what is solid and small
Pay attention and change habits
If you?re in a maze, map it
For headaches take tablets that?s placed in the gray cabinet
But don't blame anybody for doing what's wrong
You should evolve and move on just like your head to the song
Cause see we're changing everyday either to be a better person
Or shady cause it's crazy in the crevice that you work in
Whatever but I?m certain if you know it's closed curtains
