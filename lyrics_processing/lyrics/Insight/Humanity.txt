Souls are lost when humanity fails
During hard times, for peace, the family ails
Emotions bring worlds closer
Indeed without support, windy situations seem colder
You understand when you're older
With humanity always at risk, you were born a soldier
Your heart pumps the blood in your veins and you breathe the air
Beware, freedom's in fear, are you there?
Don't just listen because it's convenient
Seek within you'll find a reason
I conversate in the form of MCing
Concentrating on what I believe in
The goals I'm reaching, seeking
Hope for unity is dreaming
Can peace exist without war?
Rich without poor?
Has anything man touched remained pure?
These are questions of humanity now can we lift up every voice
Rejoice

What do you do when humanity is inhumane
Who's to blame? It's easier to complain
I know it's hard to seek change on such a small level
But generations of  creates rebels

An innocent man with a vision, planning a future for his children
Made a living saving lives becomes the victim
With other individuals, each one in a million
I wish four minutes was enough to list 'em
Freedom of the pain, changing yourself first to help hurts
Some say these are the signs of the time
I'm changing mine, rearranging minds, seek and you shall find
Methods that outline, ways for all of us to shine
All of us combine to form a spine
Strong enough up to lift the weight of the world
With all the problems that unwind
Through six degrees of separation
Every man becomes a nation
Society has reshaped them
Patience
Where faith goes, hope follows
Memories fill the heart that goes hollow
Lost souls include people just like you
Ignorant thinkings believe this pertains to a few


What are we doing if we can't come to terms?
Then every tragic moment becomes a lesson that we learn
Returning pages of history, mazes of victory
Through misery, age is a mystery
Rage, sympathy
If you ignore solutions endure the cost
Confusion doesn't always stem from one source
Foresight, gain insight to understand each other
That goes to every father and mother
All sisters and brothers
Scriptures uncovered, twisted by man has made many suffer
Still we haven't learned how to love one another
And even as I speak some hate me for my color
Don't be afraid to talk about the problems undercover
When it's time to move up we can talk about the future
And divide each other more as categories are tuned up
Let's discuss it
What answers can you come up with?
