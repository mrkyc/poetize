I start to lose control
The sweetest sound I've ever heard
The sweetest song that I've known
I get lost in your whispers
As you crawl across my bed
All my 25 Decembers
More I love you's ain't be said
I'm like a preacher when he prays
I'm on my knees to leave your name
But it's painted blue right on my front door
I've been broke down and I've been fooled
By time and age and some by you
So I just lay here with a bottle on the floor
So when the pain starts to creep in
I just pour another shot again
So I don't have to miss you anymore
While this poison just seeps in
My mind just runs in place
I've been hanging by a close pin
Time stands still on my clock's face
I'm like a preacher when he prays
I'm on my knees to leave your name
But it's painted blue right on my front door
I've been broke down and I've been fooled
By time and age and some by you
So I just lay here with a bottle on the floor
So when the pain starts to creep in
I just pour another shot again
So I don't have to miss you anymore
You might also likeMy voice has had too many cigarettes
And too much alcohol
I'll be damned if I don't leave all this mess
I'll get away, if I have to crawl
You're still the dream that I remember
You still have God on your side
My love is still a burning ember
Too bad you traded, your love for your pride
I'm like a preacher when he prays
I'm on my knees to leave your name
But it's painted blue right on my front door
I've been broke down and I've been fooled
By time and age and some by you
So I just lay here with a bottle on the floor
So when the pain starts to creep in
I just pour another shot again
