A tin roof on an A-framed house
A barren field with a horse and cow
A white, worn road church
Where people say their vows
Naked trees and evergreens
A hitchhiker walks in holey jeans
A big yellow school bus
Is loaded down with dreams

I drove a mile, this is what I've seen
I've gone through all these places
Like a door without a screen
I've been to Nashville
Through Bowling Green
There's nothing like the line that runs
From here to One-Fourteen
If the road was a song
This is what it'd say
When you drive the mountain parkway
Yeah, when you drive
The mountain parkway

Wooden crosses and exit signs
Road construction and faded lines
Place where all of these flat lands
Turn to mountain skies
I know a barn where tobacco hangs
Farms where folks were born and stayed
And every house that I pass by
Has a worn flag that's raised
You might also like
I drove a mile, this is what I've seen
I've gone through all these places
Like a door without a screen
I've been to Nashville
Through Bowling Green
There's nothing like the line that runs
From here to One-Fourteen
If the road was a song
This is what it'd say
When you drive the mountain parkway
Yeah, when you drive
The mountain parkway

I know it like the back of my hand
We're close just like kids
I could drive it with my eyes closed
But I wouldn't wanna miss
At my marker twenty-two
Where the hillsides show their face
Right there, on the mountain parkway

I drove for miles, this is what I've seen
I've gone through all these places
Like a door without a screen
I've been to Parkville
Around Twenty-Three
There's nothing like the line that runs
From Sixty-Four to One-Fourteen
If the road was a song
This is what it'd say
When you drive the mountain parkway
Yeah, when you drive
