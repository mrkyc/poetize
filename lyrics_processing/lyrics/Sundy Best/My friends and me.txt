That's where you'll find us, all my friends and me
Sittin' by a campfire drinkin' all our beer
I grew up in a holler right off 23,and
That's where you'll find us, all my friends and me
Sittin' by a campfire drinkin' all our beer
Talkin' about the stuff we've done and where we'll be in 20 years
Oh oh woah that's right
My friends and me
One will be a doctor that'll save a lot of lives
One will be a husband but will have 3 ex wives
And we'll all sit around with a life of our own
Been here since we were kids and now we're all grown
Oh oh woah that's right
My friends and me
Football games on Friday night and afterwards in a drunken fight
Yeah they'll be there 'till the end
Chasin' girls and skippin' school, oh man we all thought we were cool
Yeah that's where it all began
With me and my friends
Now I'm a little older and a little more wise
Things don't change
There's things you can't disguise
Just put on some Hank, a little Lynyrd Skynyrd too
My neck will be red as hell in about 2.2

My friends and me
Now from time to time
I make it back to town
We'll all get together and see what's going down
Heading down to the village
We'll grab a couple pints
Build us a campfire we'll be 17 all night
Oh oh woah that's right
My friends and me
Football games on Friday night and afterwards in a drunken fight
Yeah they'll be there 'till the end
Chasin' girls and skippin' school, oh man we all thought we were cool
Yeah that's where it all began, woah
With me and my friends
Me and my friends
