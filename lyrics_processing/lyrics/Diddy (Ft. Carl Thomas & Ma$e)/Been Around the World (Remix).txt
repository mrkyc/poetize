Yeah, turn me up a little bit more
Uh-huh, uh-huh, we like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Yeah kid, Harlem on the rise
This the remix, '98

Let's go

I've been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
I've been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
I've been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
I've been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
We ain't gon' stop
I've been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) 
I've been around
We don't even know how to stop
I've been around the world, yay, yay
You might also like
Yo, now trick what? Lace who?
That ain't what Mase do
Got a lotta girls that'll love to replace you
Tell it to your face, boo, not behind your back
Cats talk slick, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, puff dime sacks
Write hot stuff that make people say 'Rewind that'
People know, you go against the Harlem gigalo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make your girl trick your dough
I represent honeys with money, fly guys and gents
Ride with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay, so I look both ways
Cops say it's okay, my tint smoke gray
No way people leave without handing me my chips
Got plans to get my land and my 6
People outta town don't understand these hits
Pop champagne like I won a championship

I've been around 
I've been around the world 
I've been around 
I've been around the world 
I've been around 
I've been around the world
Can't stop the power
I've been around 
I've been around the world
(Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) Yay, yay
I was a one-bedroomer, dreamin' of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman livin' in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Mens
Now my dividends be the new Benjamins
Chicks of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Ma$e, you got some girls? Well playboy, send 'em in
What you waiting for? Let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, come here, baby
You don't like it where it's hot and hazy, never shady?
You must be crazy
It's ridiculous how they put they lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switchin' V's with a wrist full of G's
Player please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

I've been around
Yea-yea, yeah, yeah
I've been around the world 
I've been around 
I've been around the world 
I've been around 
I've been around the world
Can't stop the power
I've been around 
I've been around the world
(What, what) Yay, yay
You don't know who the hell I be? (Can tell I be?)
Now hasta la vista (C'est la vie)
Now what have we? A cat in a Bentley waggy
That keep cats aggy, roll with P. Daddy
Some be wanting to bag me, girls be wanting to stab me
I be more than gladly to tell a foe
Yo, you ain't offending me
It ain't like he the third son of the Kennedy
Or even in a mob where you can send for me
But all this Willy talk, you don't ever spend a G?
I know how it be
You know me from before when I used to detour
Down to B-more, push the E or
Days I just kick it
My crew buys Cristal just so we can spit it
All the expensive stuff just so that we can shit it
And be a lot of places that you niggas can't visit
Don't talk it 'cause I live it
Repeat Chorus

The remix
9-8, B.I.G. forever
Can't stop and we won't stop
We don't even know how to stop
Let's go, come on
Big Nash, Hitmen, baby
Big Harve, yeah, let's stop playin'
Harlem on the rise
And you don't want no problem with us guys
L-O-X, Little Justin
I see Quincy
Ha ha ha, ahh, 9-8 we got a game
We gon' keep puttin' it on your ass
And we won't stop, we don't even know how to stop
Chorus: Puff Daddy & 
I been around
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
I been around the world 
I been around 
I been around the world 
I been around 
I been around the world
Can't stop the power
I been around
