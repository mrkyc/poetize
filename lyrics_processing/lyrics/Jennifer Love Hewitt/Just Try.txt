Didn't want to, then we kissed
I didn't want you, but I did
I said it's gone too fast but baby I lied
If I do some things I never would
Doesn't mean I'm not so good
What about the way I feel inside?

If I run away it's not gonna work this time
I gotta stay, everything's gonna be alright

Don't talk about it, worry so much
Try to figure out what's gonna
Happens gonna happen here tonight
Don't think too much don't try too hard
It's alright if it goes too far
Now is not the time to question why
Just try
Just try

It's time to throw away the plan
Whatever happens depends
I don't need to know the end this time
I've played it safe with u before
Aren't you tired of leaving wanting more
I think tonight we're seeing eye to eye
You might also like
I thought I'd run away
It's not gonna work this time
I want you to stay
Everything's gonna be alright

Don't talk about it, worry so much
Try to figure out what's gonna
Happens gonna happen here tonight
Don't think too much don't try too hard
It's alright if it goes too far
Now is not the time to question why
Just try

I'm a little afraid of where this is gonna lead
But I've made up my mind
Tonight is the night

Don't talk about it, worry so much
Try to figure out what's gonna
Happens gonna happen here tonight
Don't think too much don't try too hard
It's alright if it goes too far
Now is not the time to question why
Just try
Just try
Don't talk about it, worry so much
Try to figure out what's gonna
Happens gonna happen here tonight
Don't think too much don't try too hard
It's alright if it goes too far
Now is not the time to question why
Just try
Just try
Don't you talk about it
Just try
