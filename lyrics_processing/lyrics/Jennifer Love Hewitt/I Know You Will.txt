Baby, baby, drive me crazy, walking on the edge
The way you touch yourself has got me hanging on a ledge
Is it me? Is it you? Something that I didn't see?
I walk away, but there you are, standing next to me

Don't tell me that you won't go there, baby
'Cause I know that you will (Hey, hey, hey)
Don't tell me that you won't do me, baby
'Cause I know that you, I know that you
I know you will

Mister Mister, I'm a sister that you cannot play
If I gave it up to you, you know you'll take it all the way
You can try, you can scheme
You know that chemistry don't lie
'Cause the way you move the body has given me the vibe

Don't tell me that you won't go there, baby
'Cause I know that you will (Hey, hey, hey)
Don't tell me that you won't do me, baby
'Cause I know that you, I know that you
I know you will
Oh, I know you, I know you, I know you will
I know, I know, I know you will
Tell me, baby

Don't tell tell me that you wouldn't do me, baby
Don't tell me that you wouldn't do me real now
Don't tell me that you wouldn't do me, babe
Don't you tell me that you wouldn't do me
Tell me, baby

Don't tell me that you won't go there, baby
'Cause I know that you will (Hey, hey, hey)
Don't tell me that you won't do me, baby
'Cause I know that you, I know that you will
I know you will, will, will, will
Don't tell me that you won't go there, baby
'Cause I know that you will
I know, I know, I know you will
Don't tell me that you won't go there, baby
Don't tell me that you won't do me, baby
