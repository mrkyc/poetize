Na,na,na,na,na,na na oh oh won't you be mine
Na,na,na,na,na,na na whew!!
I believe in the very best and
You know it's true, and boy that means you
I don't think you really know what
I've been feeling, I've got to get through it
Being friends just ain't good enough
I'm so alone without you here baby
Toinght's the night, I am building my nerve
So baby believe when I tell you the way that I feel
Oh, oh. . 
Na, na, na, na-baby Won't U B Mine
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
(I'm calling on the nightline)
Na, na, na, na-we'll have a good time
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
(Baby won't you be all mine)
Na, na, na, na-baby Won't U B all Mine
When your near me, I get so silly
I lose control, I need you so
Is there a potion for this emotion
My heart's alive, I want you to know
You make me smile, you make me feel good
All I want, is you tonight baby
The time is right, I'm building my nerve
I've got to let go, got to let you know just how I feel
Oh oh. . 
Na, na, na, na-baby Won't U B Mine
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
(I'm calling on the nightline)
Na, na, na, na-we'll have a good time
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
(Baby won't you be all mine)
Na, na, na, na-baby Won't U B all Mine
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine
Being friends just ain't good enough
I'm so alone without you here baby
Toinght's the night, I am building my nerve
So baby believe when I tell you the way that I feel
Oh, oh. . 
Na, na, na, na-baby Won't U B Mine
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
(I'm calling on the nightline)
Na, na, na, na-we'll have a good time
(Nothing's gonna stop me now)
