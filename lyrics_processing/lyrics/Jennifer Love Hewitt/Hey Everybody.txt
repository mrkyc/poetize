We've all got troubles, we all make mistakes
But let's not take a little river, turn it into a lake
We've all been humbled, we've lost and we've found
But it can never get the best of us if we're not lookin' down

And I wonder
Are there others like me?
Yeah, I wonder
I've got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now by stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean?
We can get it dirty while we're keepin' it clean
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na

You've got it bad
Well, she's got it worse
She's got no chocolate in the bank account
No cheese in the purse
You feel neglected with no self esteem
Just when you've finally found your glitter
Someone's taken the gleam
You might also like
And you wonder
Why is life always this way?
Yes, you wonder
Could there be a brighter day?

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now by stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean?
We can get it dirty while we're keepin' it clean
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na

And I wonder, wonder now (Can we work it, work it out?)
And I wonder, wonder now (Yes, you wonder)
(It's gonna be a brighter, be a brighter day)
Everybody, won't you help me sing it one more time
So that everyone can hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now by stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean?
We can get it dirty while we're keepin' it clean
Hey everybody
If we're gonna take a stand
Now let the world hear you now by clapping your hands
(Hey hey) Hey hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
Let the world hear you now by stomping your feet
I said hey
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Let's celebrate here
Let me hear you stomp your feet one more time
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na
