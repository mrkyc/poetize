When I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
And wrote our song on the way to New Orleans
Now I pulled my harpoon, out of my dirty red bandana
And I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom was just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', I mean nothin honey, if it anit free
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
Now Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Now Bobby, baby, help me from the whole world
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all o' my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom was just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
And oh, feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
