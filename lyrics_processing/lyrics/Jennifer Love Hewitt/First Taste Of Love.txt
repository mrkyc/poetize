I can see you passing by
With you, it's right where I wanna be
I wanna call your name but I'm too shy
This emotion is strong
I've had a crush for so long
What should I do?
Whenever I see you
I wanna be near you
I think that I'm feeling
My first taste of love
Whenever I'm dreaming at night
It's only about you
My first taste of love
First taste of love
(I can handle this)
My friends tell me you're thinking
That you're thinking about me too
I got your number, sittin' by the Telephone
What will I say if I get through?
Why do I hesitate?
Tell me what will it take
To get next to you
