I had no reason to
You gave the best of your love, sweet love, to me
So unemotional
I just undid it, oh
Now I would do anything
To get back with you, baby
What I had with you, baby
Foolish pride don't fill the space
Where you used to be
Last night I looked, I prayed
Last night I cried for yesterday
'Cause I let your love walk away
I can't sleep alone in this bed I made
I never thought about
What it meant to turn you out
I told myself that your love was too much for me
I was just blamin' you
For what I was goin' through
Just too afraid to say
If I could feel inside me
Just one touch to remind me
Foolish pride won't get you back in these arms again
No, it won't
You might also likeLast night I looked, I prayed
Last night I cried for yesterday
'Cause I let your love walk away
I can't sleep alone in this bed I made
I've been thinkin' all night
Been thinkin' all night
I should have trusted your love
It's so twenty/twenty fine in sight(?)
I've been thinkin' I don't want to leave it to fate
So I'm gonna pray just a little
But is it too little, too late
I can't sleep alone in this bed I made
Last night I looked, I prayed
Last night I cried for yesterday
Can't live without you
No, I can't, baby
Last night I looked, I prayed
Last night I cried for yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday
'Cause I let your love walk away
Don't walk away
I can't sleep, I won't sleep
Last night I looked, I prayed
Last night I prayed for you, baby
Last night I cried for yesterday
Can't live without you, no, no
'Cause I let your love walk away
So many tears
I can't sleep alone in this bed I made
Last night I looked, I prayed
I prayed for yesterday
Last night I cried for yesterday
For yesterday
'Cause I let your love walk away
