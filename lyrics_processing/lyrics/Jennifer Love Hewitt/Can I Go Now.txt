What's the point of tryna to meet you in the middle?
You got your point of view, there's nothing I can do
Can't change your mind, can't leave it all behind
You're livin' in the past
We talk and talk; this goes on for hours
About how I should be, why is it all on me?
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna waste my time
Baby, this can't last, I'm movin' on, movin' on

Can I go now?
You said what you had to say
Happy you got your way, there's nothing to discuss
(Can I go now?)
Well, you're givin' your point of view
Said what you wanted to, what's the point in us?

Oh, say what you had to say
Happy you got your way, what's there to discuss?
(Can I go now?)
