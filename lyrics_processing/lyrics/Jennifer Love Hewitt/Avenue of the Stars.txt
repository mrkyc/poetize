Welcome to Hollywood!
What's your dream?
Everybody got a dream

Standin' on the star of Marilyn Monroe
I've got a dream and a map of some stars homes
Down on the boulevard, all the kids look like me
Faith in my pocket and my Saturday's free
No time for all my insecurities
But, nobody knows
The fight inside I will never show

I've got a backpack filled with what I own
Everybody's watin' for me to come home
She didn't make it, she didn't take it so far
On avenue of the stars

I made a deal with God that I will win
If I don't make it in a year, I'll pack it in
I just wanna be anywhere but where I've been
With all of your doubts
I'm not gonna let you count me out
You might also like
I've got a backpack filled with what I own
Everybody's waitin' for me to come home
She didn't make it, she didn't take it so far
I've got nobody, but I'm not alone
One world of dreamers that will never go home
We may not make it, we're gonna take it so far
On avenue of the stars

There is no way I'm backin' out
I'll find an angel here somehow
If it's good or bad, it's my town
Never gonna go home
Never gonna go home

She didn't make it, she didn't take it so far
On avenue of the stars
I've got nobody, but I'm not alone
One world of dreamers that will never go home
We may not make it, we're gonna take it so far
On avenue of the stars
On the avenue of the stars

What nobody knows
I'm gonna take it so far
She's gonna make it
She's never gonna make it
A world full of dreamers that will never go home
(I'm gonna make it this year on my own)
I've got a backpack filled with what I own
Everybody's watin' for me to come home
She didn't make it, she didn't take it so far
On avenue of the stars
She didn't make it
