And the beat goes, and the beat goes
And the beat goes, and the beat goes
And the beat goes, and the beat goes

You ought to be careful with your promises
The first rule of love is to believe you
Words come so easy from a thousand miles away
And on the telephone line, so baby

Tell me, where you gonna run to?
When we're finally standing face to face
A promise can never take the place
Of kissing goodnight and never leaving
You afraid that love will slow you down
So where you gonna run to now?

It's easy to keep safe at a distance
Protecting your world the way that you do
But safe isn't love and lovers can't be made
If they were never given the chance, so baby

Tell me, where you gonna run to?
When we're finally standing face to face
A promise can never take the place
Of kissing goodnight and never leaving
You afraid that love will slow you down
So where you gonna run to now?
You might also like
Get into your heart
Just get out of your head
Nothing comes easy when you are afraid
Then we can start
To see what our lives would be if we're not apart

And the beat goes, and the beat goes
And the beat goes, and the beat goes
And the beat goes, and the beat goes

Tell me, where you gonna run to?
When we're finally standing face to face
A promise can never take the place
Of kissing goodnight and never leaving
You afraid that love will slow you down
So where you gonna run to now?
(So where you gonna run to now?)
Tell me, where you gonna run to?
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
Tell me, where you gonna run to?
When we're finally standing face to face
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
Tell me, where you gonna run to?
(Na na na na na na, na)
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
(And the beat goes, and the beat goes)
Tell me, where you gonna run to?
Tell me, where you gonna run to?
