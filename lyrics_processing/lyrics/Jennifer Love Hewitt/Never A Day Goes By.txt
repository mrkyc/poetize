Even though we're heart to heart
I know you wonder when we part
Do I start to lose my desire for you?
Will tomorrow be like tonight?
Will I always treat you right?
Will love go on forever?
Well
Never a day goes by, not a night that I
Could live my life without you
Never a day goes by, theres no time when I
Can ever forget what you mean to me
Never a day goes by that your not on my mind (never)
I see the doubt there in your eyes
You wonder if I realize there will come a time when
I'll be tired of you ,you say attraction's temporary
This passion momentary
And that won't keep us together
But baby...
Never a day goes by not a night that I
Could live my life without you
Never a day goes by theres no time when I
Can ever forget what you mean to me
Its the purest affection could ever be
Never a day goes by
When your not on my mind
You might also likeOn my mind
Every day and every night
That comes I wanna be in your arms
Cuz what I say is true, this love is for you
All for you, I want this love to go on forever
Never a day goes by not a night that I
Could live my life without you
Never a day goes by theres no time when I
Can ever forget what you mean to me
Its the purest affection could ever be
Never a day goes by when your not on my mind
Never ou ou never a day goes by that your not on my mind
When your not on my mind ohh no
Never a day goes by that your not on my mind
