Everybody's trying to tell me somethin'
All about the way to live my life
I don't wanna be nobody's prisoner
Chained and sittin' on a couch until I die
Tryin' desperately to be somebody
An independant personality
You're not exactly rollin' the red carpet
I've learned I have to fight to be free
Ooh, yeah
I just want to be free to be a woman
Free to do what I choose
Free to feel the way I want and change my attitude
Free to be a woman
Free to have a plan
Free to find the best in life and be all that I can
I don't want no artificial sweetners
No, no, no, no
I'm lookin' for a man to feed me limes
No, no, no, no
If you want to check out my body
No, no, no, no
Well first just show an interest in my mind

Play the funky keys
