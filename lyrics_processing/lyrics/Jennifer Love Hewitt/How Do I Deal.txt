To another day gone by
Nothing but the open road
And a never ending why
Anything can happen yeah
But nothing ever does
I try to change It's kind of strange
The same as it ever was But look at us
How do I deal with you
How do I deal with me
When I Don't even know myself
Or what it is you want from me
How do I deal with us
How do I know what's real
When I don't even trust myself
Or what it is I feel
How do I deal
Every night in the dark I lie awake in bed
How am I supposed to dream
With all the static in my head
(Torn in all) torn in all (in all)
Directions (directions)
And I pray for some relief
What can I do but feel the
Weight I'm underneath
And grit my teeth
You might also likeHow do I deal with you
How do I deal with me
When I Don't even know myself
Or what it is you want from me
How do I deal with love
Why do I why do I have to choose
Everybody's telling me
What the hell I have to do
How do I deal with us
How do I know what's real
When I don't even trust myself
Or what it is I feel
Now how do I deal
(How do I deal with you)
How do I deal with you
(How do I deal with me)
When I don't even know myself
Or what it is you want from me
(How do I deal with love)
How do I deal
(Why do I have to choose)
When everybody's telling me
What the hell I have to do
(How do I deal with you)
How do I deal with you
(How do I deal with me)
How do I deal with me
When I don't even know myself
