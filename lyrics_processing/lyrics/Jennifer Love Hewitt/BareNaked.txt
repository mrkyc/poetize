Do you ever have that dream
Where you're walking naked down the street
And everyone just stares?
Do you ever feel so deep
That you speak your mind, you put others straight to sleep?
You wonder if anybody cares

Sometimes I think I'm the only one
Whose day turned out unlike it had begun
And I feel

Barenaked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No, I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm barenaked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day

You ever go downstairs to start your day
But your car's not there?
Yeah, you know the joke's on you
You ever try your luck with a pickup line, but you just sucked?
You tell yourself it wasn't you
You might also like
And I know it's hard to hold it inside
It's days like these I run and hide
When I feel

Barenaked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No, I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm barenaked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day

It's all a state of mind
But I don't mind trying to find a way
To keep my head above the mess I make
What the world creates
Sometimes it feels so good to let it all fall
As the world fall
I may fall, we all may fall
But then the world comes tumbling
Down, down, down, down, down
Barenaked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No, I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm barenaked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day

When I feel (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Barenaked
Oh-dum-dum-dum
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
I feel (Barenaked)
You feel, we all feel
La-la, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Barenaked (Ooh)
Oh-dum-dum
Barenaked
