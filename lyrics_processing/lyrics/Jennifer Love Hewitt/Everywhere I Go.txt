Did you understand
How I trembled inside
When you held my hand
And do you know
When I'm alone
I always pretend
That we are more than friends
And I'm dreaming of your kiss
When I lie awake in the dark
How I'm wishin' I could share
The secrets of my heart
You're there
In my heart
Everywhere I go
In my soul
In every face I see
Along this winding road
Endlessly
In my heart
I'm so lost in love
In my soul
I wish that you could know
I want you
Everywhere I go
You might also likeI hear your voice
Going 'round in my head
No matter who's talking to me
I hear you instead
So here we are again
But not like before
I want to give you so much more
If you're feelin' that my touch is growin' stronger
Maybe it's true
I cannot hide it from myself
I cannot hide it from you
You're there
In my heart
Everywhere I go
In my soul
In every face I see
Along this winding road
Endlessly
In my heart
I'm so lost in love
In my soul
I wish that you could know
I want you
Everywhere I go
I'm so happy now
You finally found out
Tonight this love is letting go
Whoa, oh, baby
If you're feelin' that my touch is growin' stronger
Maybe it's true
I cannot hide it from myself
I cannot hide it from you
You're there
In my heart
Everywhere I go
In my soul
In every face I see
Along this winding road
Endlessly
In my heart
I'm so lost in love
In my soul
It's time for you to know
I want you
Everywhere I go
In my heart
Everywhere I go
In my soul
Every face I see
Along this winding road
Endlessly
In my heart
Everywhere I go
In my soul
I need you
I want to see you
Hear you
Feel you
Everywhere I go
I want you to know
