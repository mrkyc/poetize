CHORUS
Just let me take it, my mind can't make it without ...
I can't take it, said I just can't make it
Just let me take it, my mind can't make it without ...
I can't take it, so you best not take it
I've been waitin' for such, such a long, long time
To tell you all about these feelings of mine
Something tells me there just has to be a better day
And that's why I came here to say ...
CHORUS
Growing up, I was free in my childhood years
And now they tell me I can wash away my tears
These tears explain the way, it's the way that I feel
Because the freedom they give me ain't real
CHORUS
CHORUS
I want freedom, the kind that they promised me
Just for livin' in this country
I want the freedom, the kind that makes me feel strong
But, let me tell you, something is wrong
CHORUS
