Oooo, oooo, oooo
Oooo, a storm is threatenin', my very life today
If I don't get some shelter, oh, I'm gonna' fade away
War, children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Oooo, see the fire sweeping up every street today
Burns like a red-coal carpet, mad bull lost it's way
War, children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Oooo, a storm is threatenin' my very life today
If I don't get some shelter, oh, I'm gonna' fade away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
I said a love, sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away
