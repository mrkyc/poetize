Well, I guess he's kind of big and fat
He can see us wherever we do ... whatever we do
He has such powerful eyes -- he has to have millions and thousands and billions
And he can still see us when we're bad
He could be sitting on the table right now, but you can't see him
He can't be everywhere at once doing everything for everybody
Everybody can't get what they want
Well, his job is to make us good and to make us happy and make us parents happy
Good is the right thing and bad is the wrong thing
When I'm good my mother never yells at me, when I'm bad she does
Good means to obey your mother and father, to do what the teacher says -- the things right
I feel miserable when I'm, when I'm bad, I feel miserable on the inside but, on the outside, I just feel like I ... I feel now
I think that ... um, um ... there are more people that are bad than there are good. And, um ... if you're good, you'll live forever
And, if you're bad, you'll die when you die
And, if you're bad, you'll die when you die
And, if you're bad, you'll die when you die
And, if you're bad, you'll die when you die

Let me feel the pain and the coldness, the loneliness that there must be
Whoa, can't you see their dreams, as they go drifting by?
Whoa, can't you see their faces, and their tear-soaked eyes?

I can hear him in the morning, tellin' me what I got to do
Got to make a new world, ought to make the old one right
I can see him in the morning, I can see him in the stars at night
Take me out to the battlefield, let me hear the shells flying by
Let me hear the sound of the cannons, let me hear them scream and cry
Whoa, can't you hear their dreams, as they tumble to the blood-soaked ground?
Whoa, hear them scream for shelter, from the world they never found
I can feel him in the morning, I can feel him in the evening too
I can hear him in the morning, tellin' me what I got to do
Got to make a new world, ought to make the old one right
I can see him in the morning, I can see him in the stars at night
