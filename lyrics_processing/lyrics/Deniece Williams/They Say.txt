That He was just a man
They say
He had the strangest plan
That His love would set the captives free
And He would give life eternally
They say His words just can't be true
And they say
"How can He make us new?"
But I know that I've been born again
He washed my soul and from our sins
I'm cleansed
So let them say that it's a passing thing
Oh, but my life has changed
No, I'm not the same
The seasons pass and the flowers fade
But what I found in Christ shall never pass away
Never pass away
They say thousands can be fed
And they say with a few fish and some bread
But I know His miracles are true, oh, yes
And what He's done for me
Only Christ can do

But what I found in Christ shall never pass away, yeah
