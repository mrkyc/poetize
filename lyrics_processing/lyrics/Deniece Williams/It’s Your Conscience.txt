That's what daddy told me long ago
I didn't know your kisses sweet would be bad for me
Don't give your love to strangers
He's looking for a way to capture your heart
Bellman, please
I'm checking in at the heartbreak inn
When I finally looked into your eyes
Much to my surprise
I found to you
Love's a game to be played
Yes, played from time to time
I'm swallowing my pride
Come back, you're blowing my mind
Listen to me, listen please
It's your conscience
He don't love you, he don't care
This is nonsense, nonsense
Listen to me, listen please
It's your conscience
He don't love you, he don't care
This is nonsense, nonsense

With fantasies and make believe
