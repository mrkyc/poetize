Late in the morning
The boss is throwing his hands all in the air
I'm given a warning
He says I'm losing my good position there
But right now I don't care

Tell you what I did this morning
Tell you what I did last night
Looked into my baby's eyes
And kissed and hugged and held him tight

And I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it
I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it
(I can't wait)
Ooh, ooh, to be in my baby's arms
(I can't wait)
Gotta be right here where I belong

It's late in the evening
You know they're jammin' at parties all around, and oh, oh, oh
Rockin' and a-reelin'
And all of my friends are going out to paint the town
But I won't be around

Baby's gonna be right over
Told me that he won't be long (He won't be long)
Got to light a candle up
And be right here where I belong

'Cause I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, uh-huh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it
I tell you that I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, ooh, ooh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it
(I can't wait)
Ooh, ooh, to be in my baby's arms
(I can't wait)
To be right here where I belong

Baby's gonna be right over
Told me that he won't be long (He won't be long)
Got to light a candle up
And be right here where I belong

'Cause I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, yeah, yeah
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it
I tell you that I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, yeah

I can't seem to help myself, oh no
Never, never, never, never, never, never
No, no, baby
(Never can wait) Uh-huh
(Never ever can wait) No, I can't wait here
For those crazy nights, ah

To spend another lazy night (Oh, no)
In my baby's arms, oh yeah

Gonna be in my baby's arms, uh-huh
