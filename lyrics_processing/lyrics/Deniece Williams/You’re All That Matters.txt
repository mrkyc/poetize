You're always there to light my cigarette
You send me flowers that say you won't forget
When we're walking hand and hand, you seem so proud
And the tender words you say to me out loud
They leave no doubt
It's almost time to slip into a dress
I comb my hair, I want to look my best
And I'll have your favorite meal when you get home
'Cause your lovin' makes me feel so safe and warm
It's in your arms

You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
Together (Together), forever
My love, my love

I must confess at first I felt unsure
I'd kept old heartaches
But your love was the cure
All the happiness we share is like a dream
And my dreams are coming true
Because of you, only you
You might also like
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
Together (Together), forever
My love


You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
You're all that matters to me, my love (Oh, baby boy)
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
Together (Together), forever be my love
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
Together (Together), forever be my love
You're all that matters to me, my love
You're all I've wanted, you're all I've needed
You're all that matters to me, my love
