But that don't mean that I had everything to say
But then I saw you in L.A
And it was there that things began to change
Baby, I feel there's something in your heart
That is trying to get through to me
You know now, honey
You know you caught me by surprise
'Cause I see it coming through your eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes
And so I started hanging 'round
But then I felt that I was getting in the way
So I started to leave
You turned around and looked me in the eyes
Baby, you know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do
You know now, honey
Yes, I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes
You might also likeHeaven in your eyes

Baby, you know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do
You know now, honey, yes
I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes
You know now, baby
You know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do
You know now, honey, yes
I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes
It's just the way you look at me
Heaven in your eyes
It's just the way you smile at me
Heaven's in your eyes
It's just the way you call my name
Heaven's in your eyes
It's just the way you walk toward me
Heaven's in your eyes
Baby, I feel there's something in your heart
That is trying to get through to me
(Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, yeah)
Honey, you know you caught me by surprise
