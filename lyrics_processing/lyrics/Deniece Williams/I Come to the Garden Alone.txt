While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
He speaks, and the sound of His voice is so sweet
That the birds hush, they gotta hush their singing
And the melody that He gives, gives to me
Within my heart is to ringing, ringing, ringing
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
And He tells me that I'm his own
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
And He talks with me and He tells me I'm his own
I stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me is falling
But He bids me to go through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling, calling, calling
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
And He tells me that I'm His own
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
And He tells me that I'm His own
I wanna spend more time with Him
Just gotta have my time with Him
He's all I need, He is my best friend
Said, I'm talking about my Jesus

And He tells me that I'm His own
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
And He tells me that I'm His own
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
In the garden, in the garden He tells me that I'm so special
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
'Cause I'm His own
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
In the garden, in the garden, having a one on one
Oh yes, He walk with me, oh yes, He talks with me
