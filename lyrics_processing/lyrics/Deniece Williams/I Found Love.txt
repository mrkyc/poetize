Said I wouldn't be bothered with lovin' no one else
Oh, I took my heart and soul and put 'em on the shelf
Well, I was so low that to me the ground was high
I was about to let life just pass me by

There you were one day standing in front of me
Asking me if you could have this heart of mine
Opened my eyes and somehow made me see
Now this rusty, dusty heart of mine
How you've made it shine (Shine)
I'm so glad you're in my life
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine

I found love (I found love)
I found love
I found love (I found love)
Now I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine

I was so wound up in love 'til it had me blind
The writing on the wall couldn't read between the lines
Well, I was dressed in silk and satins on the town
I was always lost, but never ever found
You might also like
There you were one day standing in front of me
Asking me if I would give your love a try
Opened my eyes and now I know why
And this rusty, dusty heart of mine
How you've made it shine (Shine)
I'm so glad you're in my life
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine

I found love (I found love)
I found love, ooh, ooh
I found love (I found love), oh yeah
Now I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine
I found love (I found love)
I put my heart up on the shelf
Said I'd love nobody else (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (I found love), oh yeah
Now I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine

Your love, your love, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
(Ooh, ooh) I found love (I found love)
So glad I found your love, baby
So glad I found your love
I found love (So glad I found your love, baby)
So glad I found your love
So glad I found your love, baby
So glad I found your love
Ooh, ooh, I found love
So glad I found your love, baby
So glad I found your love
