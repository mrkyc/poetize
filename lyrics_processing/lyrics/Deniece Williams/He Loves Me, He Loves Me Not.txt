His curiosity open the door to romance
He's a lot to see, but his personality
Opened the door to slow dance
I don't usually dance with a man
That I barely know
He had a way of making me stay
When I had to go
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and see
Is he really the one for me to love
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and pray
Gonna have a little talk with the one above
The author of love
Every time we meet
He sweeps me off my feet
I can't begin to tell you
Everything seems right
It happened overnight
I can't believe that it's true
I don't usually fall for a man
That I barely know
If it's true love I'm willing to give
It's time to grow
You might also likeThough he's so appealing
There is one thing I realize
Been deceived by my feelings
But true love, true love tells no lies
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and see
If he's really the one for me to love
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and pray
Gonna have a little talk with the one above
The author of love
He loves me, he loves me not
(Ooh-hoo...)
He loves me, he loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
(Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know)
He loves me, he loves me not
Oh, though he's so appealing
There is one thing I realize
Been deceived by my feelings
But true love, true love tells no lies
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and see
Is he really the one for me to love
I tell you, he loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and pray
Gonna have a little talk to the one above
I said, he loves me, he loves me not
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and pray
Gonna have a little talk to the one above
He loves me, he loves me not
Yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh, oh, yeah
He loves me, he loves me not
Gonna take a little time and pray
Gonna have a little talk with the one above
He loves me, he loves me not
