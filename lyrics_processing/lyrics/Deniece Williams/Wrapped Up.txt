Baby
Oh-oh-oh...
I'd like to go to Nassau or Jamaica
Take off on a place for Paris, France
But if I could do only one place, baby
It's with you that I'd take my chance
It's you
That I long for
It's you
That I'm dreaming of
It's you
Satisfying me
I got this feeling
Cause you make me feel loved
Wrapped up in your arms, baby
That's where I wanna be
Wrapped up in your arms, sweet darling
It's the only place for me

The only place for me, uh-huh
I wish that I could always have you near me
I wish that I could be right by your side
Well, at least this love affair has never pleased me
Too many lonely nights I've cried
But, baby
It's you that I long for
It's you that I'm dreaming of
Baby, it's you satisfying me
I got this feeling
Cause you make me feel loved
I wanna be...
