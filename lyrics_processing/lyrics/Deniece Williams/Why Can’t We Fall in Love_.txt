Feeling like I always knew we would
Seems as though my heart just touched the sky
Never knew that we could feel this good
The joy of you and me
I'm hoping you will see
Just reach out to me
Why can't we fall in love?
Why don't we fall in love?
In a world that's rushing by
And where love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
Can't you feel it, too?
Don't be afraid to let your love come through
Few of us will never see the moon
Or even stop to hear our own love song
Before you know it's over all too soon
I hope that's not the way we move along
Playing foolish games
When no one wins the prize
It's right here in our eyes

Can't you feel it, too?
Don't be afraid to let your love come through
Why can't we fall in love?
Why can't we fall, why can't we fall in love?
In a world that's rushing by
And where love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
Tell me
Why can't we fall
Why, baby, why, honey

Tell me, tell me, tell me, honey
