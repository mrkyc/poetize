Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
There was a time when we were lovers
Each time we'd meet ecstasy
We'd discover
But we're strangers to each other now
Strangers to each other now
You were so free and so willing to fly
Now you're all changed
This new you can't be right
What we shared is over now
I guess this is our fate
Can we part at least friends for now
And the love, and the love I will wait
Ooh, strangers to each other now
Strangers to each other now
Ooh, memories of love
And the fun that we had
Haunt me at night and my days are so sad
What we shared is over now
I guess this is our fate
Can we part at least friends for now
And the love, and the love, baby, I will wait

We're strangers to each other now
Ooh, darling
We're strangers to each other now
There's no more you
There's no more me
There's no more love
There's no more love
And this is where the story ends
Strangers
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Strangers to each other now
Oh, baby, you let the love slip away
Ooh
Strangers
There's no more you
No more me
There's no more love
There's no more love
And this is where the story ends
Strangers to each other now
Well, I can't pretend
That love's the same no more
Ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Strangers
Oh, ooh
The love slipped away
There's no more me
There's no more you
There's no more love
There's no more love
And this is where the story ends
Oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
(There's no more me
There's no more you)
(There's no more me
There's no more you)
(There's no more me
There's no more you)
We're strangers to each other now
Memories haunt me at night
All I can do is hold my pillow tight
