Now, you are a miracle as you are marvellous
So, be proud of what you are
You are a superstar
And, you've got the magic touch that we need so much, oh yes
A symbol of liberty, you set the captives free

Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Didn't you know you were created of Him?
Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Yes, you should know just as I do
That he is the mirror inside of you
And it's good to know that we still got the seasons
And it's good to know that we still got some hope
It's good to know that life still has a meaning
And love, sweet love, is as strong and as bright as it can be

You are the reason for the moon to glow
The sun and stars to shine
You are the witness of what comes and goes
You are the hands of time
You are the echoes of his masters voice
The vision of his eyes
You are the book in which all things are told
The mysteries you unfold
You might also like
Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Didn't you know you were created of Him?
Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Yes, you should know just as I do
That he is the mirror inside of you
And it's good to know that He still got the power
And it's good to know there is sun, wind and rain
It's good to know that time still owns the powers
And the gift of life embraces all that are new and are free

Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Didn't you know you were created of Him?
Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Didn't you know you were created of Him?
Didn't you know you are a child of the universe?
Didn't you know you were created of Him?
