Ever since the abolition of slavery, all nations
Scarred by the great sore, has revolutionized the
Ideological errors of their forefathers, creating a
Civilization where human beings of whatever color, race
Or creed, should be born with the equal privileges of
The Fundamental Humans Rights, as established by The
League of Nations with respect to all human beings
But if human beings are what they are supposed to be
Then surely this cannot be seen in Botha, and if the
Beast was discovered in Adolph Hitler and Mussolini
The Antichrists, evidently, this can be seen in
President Botha, the mosquito

Hey!
President Botha is the mosquito
Who annihilate Africa
President Botha with the deadly bite
Spreads the disease of apartheid
President Botha is the mosquito
Who annihilate, annihilate Africa
President Botha with the deadly bite
Spreads the disease of apartheid

It was Columbus, Drake, Hawkins, Raleigh and Scott
Who established colonialism
This aspired Livingston, Rhodes and Smith
Who brought about a sub-human regime
With the aid and support from mystery Babylon
Started the buying and selling of Africans
It became a marketplace for human cargo
And the burial ground for the inhabitants
With men like

Marcus Mosiah Garvey of Jamaica
Prophesied of a liberated Africa
When the East and the West and the North together
Unites to liberate South Africa

For violation of the Fundamental Humans Rights
Could cause racial confrontations
