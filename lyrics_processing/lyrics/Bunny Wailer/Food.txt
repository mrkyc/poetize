If food is the staff of life
Should there be famine, wars and strifes?
For like the ant should man proceed
To fulfill his want and need

And that is food!
And without it you're in a devastating mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
And that is food
And without it you're in a malnutritious mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
You better give it just as much as you could

If bread is for man to eat
Why should he die from lack of meat?
For in the multitude of wine and laughter
He's suffering from hunger

From want for food
And without it you're in a devastating mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
And that is food
And without it you're in a malnutritious mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
You better give it just as much as you could
You might also like
Now, if food is the staff of life
Should there be famine, wars and strifes?
For like the ant should man proceed
To fulfill his want and need

Now don't forget the Ethiopians
Their afflictions should the world take a lesson from
For if today is for them then tomorrow is for us
For in arms do we put our trust

Instead of food
And without it you're in a devastating mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
And that is food
And without it you're in a malnutritious mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should

And that is food
And without it you're in a devastating mood
Oh yes that's food
You better treat it like you know you should
And that is food
And without it you're in a malnutritious mood
Oh yes that's food
