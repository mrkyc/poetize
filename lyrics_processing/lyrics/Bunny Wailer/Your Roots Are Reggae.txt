Now the roots are the inspiration of the people oh yes
And without them all would be gone astray
I can hear the voices of the radicals in the cities
Grab on, brother! To the rock I said
Rastafari, he leads the way
And reggae is the music which sends a message
Tells of history, the truth, and the right
Leading the cause of the innocent ones
To come forth be afflicted and keep them from wrong
Let the aged be protected and the infant be strong yes oh yeah, yeah, yeah
