Tikya the Blackheart Man, children
I say, don't go near him
Tikya the Blackheart Man children
For even lions fear him
Tikya the Blackheart Man, children
I say, don't go near him
Tikya the Blackheart Man children
For even lions fear him

Growing in a neighbourhood for such a long time
That is filled with fear
I can't go here, can't go there
And I ain't supposed to go anywhere, anywhere at all
When I ask my Mom if she could let me, let me go out and play
She said be careful of the stranger
Giving candies to children
And then take them away, yeah
He lives in the gullies of the city
He's the Blackheart Man, y'all, the Blackheart Man
Even in the lonely parts of the country
Mind the Blackheart Man, y'all, the Blackheart Man
He ain't got no friend, no home, no family
He's the Blackheart Man, y'all, that's the Blackheart Man
He is famed to live just like the Gypsy
He's the Blackheart Man, yeah
Growing and learning and gathering, for myself a little more
Experience jumping over the fence
Curiousity has brought me, yes, it's brought me
A little common-sense, yeah
Trodding the road of life, I've come to this one conclusion
That everything is equal under the sun
All that is created by Jah mighty hand, yeah
And he said knock and it shall be opened
Seek and ye shall find
Wisdom is found in the simplest of places
In the nick of time
Knock and it shall be opened
Seek and ye shall find
Wisdom is found in the simplest of places
In the nick of time
And now I trod the same road of aflictions
Just like the Blackheart Man, just like the Blackheart Man
Getting my share of humiliation
Just like the Blackheart Man, y'all, just like the Blackheart Man
You'll find me in the prison of the dungeons
Just like the Blackheart Man, yeah, like the Blackheart Man
I even get blamed without a reason
Just like the Blackheart Man, just like the Blackheart man, y'all

No cross, no crown, no sorrow, no trial and crosses inna I way
But the hotter the battle is the sweeter Jah Jah victory
Ancient children use to say
If you want good, your nose got to run, run, run
How could the world go free, and let Jah bear the cross alone
And them that drink of the old wine hath no place for the new, for the new
And the stones that are head of the corner are the same ones that the builders refused
Hear me when I say now

Now, it's the Blackheart Man, children
Who've become the wonder of the city
