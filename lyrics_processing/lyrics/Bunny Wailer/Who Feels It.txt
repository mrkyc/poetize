Who feels it knows it, yeah

No don't sit by your window
Gazing at the streets
Sorrying for your self 'cause you've got nothing to eat
There's a light within you, so let it shine, shine
Git up and move and start trying, trying, trying

Just get up and move
Come on, get up and move
Get right in the groove
Don't you just sit there in the grove
Just get up and move
Get right in the grove

For linger you linger, cry you must cry
Now don't point your fingers and you'll get bye
Don't be no moonshine, darling and sit down and cry
Please don't you give up now 'fore you give it a try
