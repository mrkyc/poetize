Jah loveth the gates of Zion
More than all the dwellings of Jacob
Glorious things have been spoken of thee
O city of Jah, Selah
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon
To them that know thee
- JAH RasTafari!
Of Philistia and Tyre it shall be said
This man was born there
And of Zion it shall be established
That this and that man was irated in her
And the Highest himself shall establish
That Jah RasTafari is the head creator
Haile High Selassie High
Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah
Elect of all creation
Master
