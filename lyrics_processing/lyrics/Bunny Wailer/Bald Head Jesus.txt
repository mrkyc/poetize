I have never seen the image of a bald head Jesus yet
I have never seen the image of a bald head Jesus yet
He's a humble and dreadlock Nazarene man
Look in yourselves and try to understand
Why you've never seen the image of a bald head Jesus yet

All ye bald head Jesus followers start to fret
All ye bald head Jesus followers start to sweat
He said to follow Him and He will make thee fishers of men
But you've just left the barber shop and gone back again
And you've never seen the image of a bald head Jesus
Yet

There is no synagogue that was built by Jesus Christ
There is no synagogue that was built by Jesus Christ

Performing miracles and didn't get no pay
No synagogue that was built by Jesus Christ, sing along
