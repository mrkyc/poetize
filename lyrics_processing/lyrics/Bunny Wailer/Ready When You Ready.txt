Hey
Mi ready when you ready fi go chant down Babylon, dutty system

Dem nah do it like how dem say dem plan
Dem just a dash it out dey in a foreign land
A hungry nation is a angry one
And it is bound to cause a revolution
Power struggle a bubble, it a bubble
And starvation is on the double
The ghetto children don't seem to stand a chance
Instead of opportunity it's self reliance

Mi ready when you ready fi go tear down Babylon, dutty system
Mi ready when you ready fi go fling down Babylon, inna rhythm
Mi ready when you ready fi go chant down Babylon
Mi ready when you ready fi go lick down Babylon

The rise in prices is rising every time
And unemployment is making people turn to crime
A bare promises and a bagga tricks
While you kill each other over politics
You want unity inna you community
Though you don't belong to high society
We hear of problems over the media
About the black man's struggle inna Africa
You might also like
So mi ready when you ready fi chant down Babylon
Mi ready when you ready fi go tear down Babylon
Mi ready when you ready fi go lick down Babylon
Mi ready when you ready fi go chant down Babylon

Is it because of the book and pencil
Why you try to sidestep the treaty?
Is it because of the pen and paper
Why you keep the chains on me?
Is it because of the book and pencil
Why you try to avoid the treaty?
Is it because of the pen and paper
Why you keep the chains on me?

If I had to fight for emancipation
Then I shall resist for my liberation
And with truth and right I shall win my liberty
We shall unite to secure the victory
Cudjoe and Nanny, their courage and their bravery
Cuffy and Quashy, delivered their race from slavery
Marcus Garvey and His Imperial Majesty
Luther King and Marley, voices the oppression of humanity
So mi ready when you ready fi go chant down Babylon, dutty system
Mi ready when you ready fi go tear down Babylon, inna rhythm
Mi ready when you ready fi go lick down Babylon
Mi ready when you ready fi go mash down Babylon

The school graduates turn into loafers
Educated children turn into beggars
The underprivileged nah go have no privilege
Mentally handicaps what a disadvantage

Mi ready when you ready fi go lick down Babylon, inna rhythm
Mi ready when you ready fi go mash down Babylon
