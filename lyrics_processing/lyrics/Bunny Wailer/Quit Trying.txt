You better quit trying to live my life for me
You better quit trying stop nagging me so constantly
You better quit trying, I just want for you to let me be
Cause I've got who I want to show me the way
Don't need sympathy so please go your way

Go away you hypocrite (Go away, oh)
Promise is a comfort to a fool
You hypocrite (Go away-o)
I dont need no sympathy you hypocrite (Go away)
And please don't you sorry for me you hypocrite (Go away, oh)

'Cause since I've seen the light
You dont know what its done for me
And its such a fight only who'se
Got eyes to see can see
Since I've seen the light
You dont know what its done for me
And its such a fight only who'se
Got eyes to see can see

You better quit trying
And give the little youth a chance
You better quit trying
For they can make this place a better land
You better quit trying
I hope you elders understand
They got their own mind
They too can lead the way
They can make the garden red, gold and green for little children to play
