If you are living in a market place
And you're no buyer or seller
You'll find yourself left in space
Subject to be bought or sold
If you are living in a tenant yard
And you are not the land owner
You'll get a notice from your landlord
To leave sooner or later

So what you need is (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)
The young and old they need (Liberation)
Lets come together for the (Liberation)
If you are in bondage (Liberation)
If you are not free you need (Liberation)
Lets unite for the (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)

If you are dwelling on a piece of land
And are not the land owner
You can be sure that the government man
Is gonna label you a squatter
If you are an alien in a far country
And you are treated as a stranger
You don't belong to that society
You could a end up in danger
You might also like
So what you need is (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)
The young and old they need (Liberation)
Lets come together for the (Liberation)
If you are in bondage (Liberation)
If you are not free you need (Liberation)
Lets unite for the (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)

If you are caught between church and state
And you are feeling the pressure
You got to get out before it's too late
Or you got to work without pleasure
And if you borrow and you can't pay
Don't bother sit there and wonder
Your revenue and budget could be taken away
And you belly could a end up with hunger

So what you need is (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)
The young and old they need (Liberation)
Lets come together for the (Liberation)
If you are in bondage (Liberation)
If you are not free you need (Liberation)
Lets unite for the (Liberation)
Everyone need it (Liberation)
If you are working on a plantation
And you are not the boss-man
Don't ever rest from being tired
Or you could get fired
If you don't belong to one party
And you belong to another
You are subversive to unity
