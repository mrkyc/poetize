Come and hear what I have to say
Come and listen and I will tell you
What is the talk of the town today
And every corner that you may walk
You see a group of people balk
They're not skylarkin' they're talkin'
'bout what's happening here in Jamaica
Can't get no work off hustling
And man, when you take a stock
Can't cook no rice and dumpling
And will soon end up in a shack
Can't pay no rent, 'cause you don't have a cent
No government account, it's already spent
So you end up borrowing, begging or stealing, here in Jamaica
Some a dem long, long treat bad
And they don't care a thing about that
Desperation is getting so bad
You either bite the bullet or get flat
And if a-you should die before his day
Who are responsible don't want to pay
I am not jokin', I'm talkin' 'bout what's happening here
In Jamaica
You might also like--Whoa Yea--
Why don't you take us onward to Africa
Where we can sit and eat and chat
For it is no use dying in Jamaica
'cause we can't afford a burial spot
Remember Marcus Garvey predicted that day
When all black people shall be going away
To the land of our forefathers, and our mothers
Right here in Ethiopia
Oh what a glorious morning
When we shall leap out of Babylon
There shall be singin', dancin' and rejoicing
With the dawn of the rising sun
And all the Africans, home and abroad
Just like the Israelites we shall be glad
To leave our worries, trials and crosses, here in Jamaica
So, come along every goodie
Come and hear what I have to say
Come and listen and I will tell you
What is the talk of the town today
And to every corner that you may walk
You see a group of people balk
They're not skylarkin' they're talkin'
'bout what's happening here in Jamaica
I am not jokin' , I'm talkin' 'bout what's happening here in Jamaica
