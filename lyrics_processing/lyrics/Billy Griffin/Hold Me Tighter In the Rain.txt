Many times we've been this way
Just two lovers walkin' in the rain
But you know it isn't like before
No, because it's over, you said it's over
Can't we hold each other near?
Remembering the time when love was here
Why can't we make it feel the way it did?
No, don't say it's over, won't you think it over?

Hold me tighter in the rain
When it's through
Won't you hold me once again?
Hold me tighter in the rain
'Cause I love you
Say you love me if you can

Let me kiss you one more time
The pitter-patter keeps love on my mind
Remember how we used to play the games
Stealin' kisses, walkin' in the rain
Oh, can I hold you one more time?
Let me convince your heart that you were mine
Take my hand and whisper that you'll stay
Help me pass this lonely night away, oh
You might also like
Hold me tighter in the rain
When it's through
Would you hold me once again?
Just hold me tighter in the rain
I love you
Say you love me if you can, oh
Hold me tighter in the rain
When it's through
Would you hold me once again?
Oh, come hold me tighter in the rain
'Cause I love you
Say you love me if you can, ooh

Stay-ay-ay, just say you'll stay (Stay, stay, stay)
Hold me tighter in the rain, my baby
Stay-ay-ay, just say you'll stay (Stay, stay, stay)
Hold me tighter in the rain

Hold on to love, hold on to me
Don't leave me in the rain
Won't you stay with me?
Hold on to love, hold on to me
Don't leave me in the rain
Won't you stay with me? Please
Stay-ay-ay, just say you'll stay
Hold me tighter in the rain, my baby
Stay-ay-ay, just say you'll stay
Hold me tighter in the rain

Hey, yeah, just hold me, baby (Shoo-doo-doo)
Hey, yeah, just let me, lady (Ah)
Hey, yeah, won't you love me, baby (Shoo-doo-doo)
Hey, yeah, that's why I'm sayin'

Hold me tighter in the rain
Hold me tighter in the rain, my baby
Hold me tighter once again
I love you
Say you love me if you can, yeah

Hold me tighter in the rain
Hold me tighter in the rain
Hold me tighter in the rain
