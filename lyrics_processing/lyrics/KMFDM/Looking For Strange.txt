Jetlag limbo, can't decide
Like molten rock, I turn to stone
Take me outside myself, do it nice and slow
Somewhere beyond the great unknown

Get ready, set
All systems go

Good life, godlike
Wanna see it from the inside
Bow down, gun shy
Looking for strange
Go on, give it to me
Don't stop, let me feel it
Looking for strange
Faster, harder, more
Last chance, no return
Looking for strange
You might also like
Down here in the underbelly
No words are used to speak at all
The mind goes somewhere, comatose from lack of sleep
Will I ever learn to talk?

Get ready, set
All systems go

Good life, godlike
Wanna see it from the inside
Freefall, swan dive
Looking for strange
Go on, give it to me
Don't stop, let me feel it
Looking for strange
Faster, harder, more
Last chance, no return
Looking for strange

Echoes scream without a sound
Mirror pond reflects no face
Shellshock, avalanche, dialed out, can't be reached
No failsafe, panic at close range
Get ready, set
All systems go (Come on, give it to me!)

Good life, godlike
Wanna see it from the inside
Bow down, gun shy
Looking for strange
Go on, give it to me
Don't stop, let me feel it
Looking for strange
Faster, harder, more
Last chance, no return
Looking for strange

Girls and boys, guns and noise
Beat by beat
Be the best that you can be
Best to your ability
Your future bright and ours to take
Do exactly as we say
Step right up, sign right here
Your name in blood, have no fear
Good life, godlike
Wanna see it from the inside
Freefall, swan dive
Looking for strange

Looking for strange
Come on, give it to me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Looking for strange
