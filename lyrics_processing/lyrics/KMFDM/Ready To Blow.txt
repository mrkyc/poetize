I can hardly breathe
Lost and hopeless
Down so low
Something died inside
I just can't believe it
Violent tendencies
Murder, madness
Good gone bad
Try to talk about it
Nobody believes me

Static in my head
Lines blur red
Got my mind made up
And my trigger finger ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
I'm ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
You might also likeLife draws out of me
Spent and broken
All mixed up
Crying out in vain
Somebody release me
Evil speaks to me
Caustic rage, I've no control
A living hell of hate
Sinister, deceiving

Static in my head
Lines blur red
Got my mind made up
And my trigger finger ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
I'm ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Out of my mind in this fucked-up head
I want everything that I never had
A little something, a reason why
Ready to blow, I'm ready to die
Depart this world on a silver bullet
I never believed I would ever pull it
Now's the time, here's my show
Ready to go, I'm ready to blow
Time stands still for me
Black and blistered
Drown my sleep
Let thy will be done
Make it quick and easy

Static in my head
Lines blur red
Got my mind made up
And my trigger finger ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
I'm ready to blow
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
Finger on the trigger, I'm a barrel of a gun
