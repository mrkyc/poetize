Under a stone
Skin and bone
The children of fear are not alone
You might also likeRivers of tears
Flesh and blood
An eye for an eye
That's all we've got
Time will be ending
Life's a crusade
For a consciousness rising
Out of desperate state
We got the power

Power and truth
Desire and trust
Like the wind and the rain
Ashes and dust
Into light and the future
Education is work
Into violent peace
That will conquer the world
