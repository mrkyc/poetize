Conquer your world
Study you quietly
Count the ways
I'll do anything you say
There will be no holding back
Legions of me
So cruel
Longing eternally
Bittersweet possibility
A tiger on the attack
Ready to leap

Tragically yours
Obey and submit to me
I will find you
Wherever you hide
Got a thrill for the hunt
A skilled criminal mind
So calm
Tracking your every move
Unrelenting, my conscience clear
Beyond a shadow of doubt
A force to be feared

Wretched and pure
Tricky and dangerous
Do not question
Or challenge your fate
A promise written in blood
Take life for pay
