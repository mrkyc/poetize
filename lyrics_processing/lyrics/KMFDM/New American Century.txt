Walk the line
Don't move too fast
Or fall behind
There are rules you must obey
They get rewritten by the day
Don't do this - don't say that
Your every move is logged and tracked
By the all-oppressive eye
Spy satellites in friendly skies
The new American century
Has only just begun
No one exempt from the tragedy
Counterattack, start pushing back
Fight the power
That chokes your speech
Fight the power
That makes you bleed
Fight the power
That propagates lies
To keep you weak
Keep you in line
No one dares to say a word
Our panic drives all human herds
In the land where cash is king
Our silence bought and sold for free
The future's banging on our door
When RealID will be the law
Love thy neighbor and turn him in
It's called patriotism
You might also likeThe world is watching in disbelief
Chanting, "Shame on you
How can you stand by so quietly
Letting them rape your liberties?"
Fight the power
That chokes your speech
Fight the power
That makes you bleed
Fight the power
That propagates lies
To keep you weak
Keep you in line
Fight the power
That reigns you in
Divides and conquers
Defines your sin
Fight the power
For one and all
Before the power
Swallows us whole
"Those who cannot learn from history
Are doomed to repeat it!"
You can't be bothered or concerned
You see no reason for alarm
Prejudice, religion, hate
Usher in new mandate
Absolute and resolved
One nation under one god
Lack of interest has its price
As we're stripped of all our rights
The new American century
Repeat it!
Repeat it!
The new American century
Repeat it!
Repeat it!
Fight the power
That chokes your speech
Fight the power
That makes you bleed
Fight the power
That propagates lies
To keep you weak
Keep you in line
Fight the power
That reigns you in
Divides and conquers
Defines your sin
Fight the power
For one and all
Before the power
Swallows us whole
