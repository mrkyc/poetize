So it's time to die
Kill the Emperor
Your turn to fry
Eye for an eye
Up goes the temperature
Resource denied
No recourse in mind
We're three bullets from fine
You might also likeFortified certifiably hardcore
Mortified by politics as an art form
No hearts warn
Guards prepare for the dark storm
Raining blood on
American shores
Kill motherf-other fuckin', kill motherfuckin' kill motherfucker, kill fuckin' kill fuckin' motherfucker

"Everything is either owned, or controlled, by the state."
(Bing bing, bong bong)
"Believe me."
"You will do what you're told to do."

"Believe me."
"You will do what you're told to do."
Who's the man that plans
To take over
Rip the system
Become the soldiers
Revolution's what I'm giving you
Freedom is what they sold ya
Power to the people
And power is how they mold ya
The seven-headed dragon
In an act of cannibalism
Eye for an eye
Still is cannibal living
Abandon the living
We're banished for sinning
Never forgiven
Inhumane
Just products of the system
