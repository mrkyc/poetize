Psycho fucking pricks
The art of becoming is the beginning of the end
Bastard child from a rabid bitch
Suicidal tendencies, born high risk
Go to town with a pump gun up your
AK-47, 92 Beretta
Don't give a good god damn what you think
Of me or what I do
H&K MP5
Smith & Wesson Model 29
SPS Glock 17
A one-man army I was born to be
Do it for kicks
Do it for fun
Do it for love
Like hand in glove
Me and my gun
No prior violation
Let thy will be done
Give praise to this motherfucking white trash scum
Without provocation
Kill anyone
Ready for action
Whatever may come

SPS Glock 17
A one-man army I was born to be
Do it for kicks (Show and tell)
Do it for fun (Shotgun shell)
Do it for love (Raise hell)
Like hand in glove
Me and my gun
I hate Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, every-day, always
Just an ordinary girl at war with the everyday world
You can blame it on the media circus for the stars
Music, movies, or the man in mars
But I am what I am
Just as before
No fear or remorse
Evil to the core
Do it for kicks (Show and tell)
Do it for fun (Shotgun shell)
Do it for love (Raise hell)
Like hand in glove
Me and my gun
Now listen up, kid
It ain't cool to shoot up your school!
