Racist bigots on the beat
History on repeat
Leaders fail, failures lead
Learn - what you did not know before
Dig - 'til you find what's at the core
Kick down every Goddamn door
Burn - like you have not burnt before
How much more can you take?
Ain't no law they won't break
Security breach
Disturb the peace
Bring the fight to the street
Disturb the peace
Corrupt elite
Disturb the peace
That con-game shit show never sleeps
Disturb the peace
Disturb the peace
To idiots belong the power
Preaching the gospel of righteous men
Milk of human kindness gone sour
Fascism is in fashion again
