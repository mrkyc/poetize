The things that I have seen
I wouldn't expect you to
You've never been asleep
You wouldn't believe
The things that I have seen
How could I expect you to
You've never been asleep

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
Across the sea
With perfect symmetry
There's an island just like this
A person just like me
You might also likeYou couldn't conceive
The possibility
That though he loves all of us
He's given up on me

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
This a lively death
That possesses me
And there's a shortness of breath
There's weakness of knee

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
But what if we're dead
But what if we're dead
And there's nothing more
