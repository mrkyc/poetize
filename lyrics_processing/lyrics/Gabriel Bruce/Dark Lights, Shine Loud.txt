You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all)
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil
And that's all right
Now I'm there depending on where you've been
And the future's for you to see, and doubt in your mind
You may be unsettled by what you see
What actually comes to be
In your life
There's things that none of us can control
There's fish that could eat you whole
Without even trying
And I may be just like Claudius
And I'll take your crown; I'll take your queen
Suffocate myself in incestuous sheets
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all)
And that's all right
You might also likeIt's this way no matter what you say
With the nightmare that it is today
But it's been alright
There's nothing worse than picturing what I've seen
One of the many screens
They continue to shine
I've seen a house on fire and swept out to the sea
Yeah whilst you're struck with fear
I'll pour this poison in your ear cause...
I am just like Claudius
And I'll take your crown; I'll take your queen
Suffocate myself in incestuous sheets
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all)
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all)
Dark lights
Dark lights shine loud
The dark lights are out
Lights lights away
Lights lights away
Summon all your villagers and just take my life 
You got to rid yourselves of evil 
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all) 
Summon all your villagers and just take my life 
You got to rid yourselves of evil 
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and that's all) 
Dark lights
Dark lights shine loud
The dark lights are out
Lights lights away
