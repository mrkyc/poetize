I'm still thinking about the war
And I might love you
But you're somewhere else with someone new
And I don't need to be that fool
Who's run about lying and lying and lying and lying
To myself and you
It's almost summer anyway
I'll be the one
Who follows my own fantasy
I'll not be undone by your attitude
Cause you're so cool
You know what, your old gods mean nothing
Your Buddha, your Lamassu
To Allah, to Jesus
Bamiyan Buddhas
These statue is dying
At the Ishtar gate
There's a legion of lions
And  the gate of Babylon
But nothing at all
Is set in stone
There's bullet holes
Across Berlin and Rome
And I never saw bullet holes
In doors before
You might also likeLike there's roses on your everything
I can't forget about the war at all
But some gods get tortured, some gods get trained
Some gods are destined for the hotel or the cane
Some gods get blown up, some gods get maimed
Some gods get sacked, dispatched to Pakistani bazaars 
I know my reason
My Lamassu
I'm gonna put up a wall
And know what you all are gonna do
The gates of Babylon
They're at the Pergamon
And even the wall fell
And even the crow's flown
And even just that is bigger in fact
Yeah, who are you anyway
Anyway, why would I need your advice at all
If you're so great and I'm so small
But nothing at all
Is set in stone
There's bullet holes
Across Berlin and Rome
And I never saw bullet holes
In doors before
Why would you say that?
Why would you say that to me?
And why would you lie?
Why would you say that to me?
And why would you lie? Why would you lie?
Why would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you?
But nothing at all
Is set in stone
There's bullet holes
Across Berlin and Rome
And I never saw bullet holes
