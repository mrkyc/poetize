Some blood on the tissue you left in my room
And I don't know why I didn't say goodbye
But I had to leave
Like a woman greaves
Each time she bleeds
I'm mourning each day as it goes by
I entered the room
And called out to soon
And I scared the moment and it died?
I can take the pain but the pleasure was worse
When I asked for an ambulance
You called me a hearse
What's a little death in the scheme of survival
I know that it's true cause I read in the bible
That it's I have left of you
Some blood on the tissue you left in my room
And I'm sorry that I didn't say goodbye
But I had to leave
You wanted nothing
But you asked for too much
And you drowned out my voice with your asking
Now the hourglass is broken
And the ribbon is burned
And the moment we feared is passing
I think of you now
All beauty and shame
And I want for your body
And I curse your name
What's a little death in the scheme of survival
I know that it's true cause I read in the bible

Some blood on the tissue you left in my room
And I'm sorry that I didn't say goodbye
But I had to leave
The moon in rhythm joins land and the sea
But was it the moon that brought you to me?
In a bed in France, instead of sleep
We signed a contract of blood on the sheet
I had your voice, your bones undressed
I learned to read your alabaster flesh
And I had your kisses, you whispered to me
That cost me so much though you gave them for free
I've seen you lying, uncaressed on the floor
What's the point of weapons if we can't have a little war?
Now that it's all that I have left of you
Some blood on the tissue you left in my room
And I'm sorry that I didn't say goodbye
