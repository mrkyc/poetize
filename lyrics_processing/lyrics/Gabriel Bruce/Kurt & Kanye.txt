On my knees and I see
Kim and Courtney
Kurt and Kanye
Guess you caught me watching blindly
They don't mind me looking in
Cause I have sinned
Kim and Kanye
Crushing candy as the whole world watches in
We need a new vocabulary
To describe a world so goddamn scary
Need new medication to keep us sane
Keep us slim
We'll hold our position
Draw a line in the sand
Find ourselves a new Christ who we can misunderstand
We'll swallow herds of cattle with our teeth
With the trees
Cause we are giants
We are tyrants
And we'll do as we damn well please
We'll groove to the murder baby
Groove to the screams
Groove to the groovy grind
Of the cogs in the machines

Are we so easily tamed?
I'm gonna push it up higher
Higher (higher)
If we're so easily damned (higher)
I guess we best celebrate (higher)
I'm gonna push it up higher (higher)
(Then we just) groove to the murder baby
Groove to the screams
(Then we just) groove to the murder baby
Groove to the screams
I spent my nights staring through your window
Heaving breathing as you dream
Kurt and Kanye
Kim and Courtney
I'm just doing what they taught me
And they don't mind me looking in
It's not a sin
Kurt and Kanye cutting shapes
As all the cunts go marching in
Higher
If we're so easily damned (higher)
I guess we best celebrate (higher)
I'm gonna push it up higher (higher)
Higher
Did we forget how to stand?
Are we easily tamed?
I'm gonna push it up
Did we forget how to stand?
Are we easily tamed?
I'm gonna push it up
Higher
If we're so easily damned (higher)
I guess we best celebrate (higher)
I'm gonna push it up higher (higher)
Higher (higher)
If we're so easily damned (higher)
I guess we best celebrate (higher)
