Mama messiah
Don't you admire, me?
I got my panties on
I wear my Elvis ring
I got my uniform
 my HIV
Got my predator drone
I drew my Arab spring
I'm a Jesus drag queen
Jesus drag queen
Mama messiah
Mama messiah
Don't you admire, me?
I built my castle with the blood in the sand
Fed my children off the fat of some foreign land
Why start trying, why show remorse
The worlds already dead and now we're fucking it's corpse
Yeah the worlds already dead and now we're fucking it's corpse
Yeah what was that you said?
What, you want a divorce?
I guess it's just like father like son
I gave myself to god
And god gave me a gun

Mama messiah
Don't you admire, me?
I got my panties on
I wear my Elvis ring
I got my uniform
And checked my HIV
I'm a Jesus drag queen
Jesus drag queen
Jesus drag queen
I'm like a white flight
And the Mike Tyson
And the  bosoms
Applesauce
I craved depraved shit
So I came and then I ate some
Framed my dick pic
It's like veins on a tree trunk
Now let me debunk that I've sunk into a hole
With your dead eyes and your cum caked cunts
I don't know what's more obscene
My dreams or all the porn I stream
And I don't know why I'm being so mean
Shouldn't drink so much on fluoxetine
Shouldn't think so much about who you're seeing
Shouldn't look so much with eyes so green
That every tweet you send or receivin'
I'm so fucked I could be pregnant
I can't have this conversation
Mama messiah
Mama messiah
Don't you admire, me?
I got my panties on
And I keep them clean
I wear my uniform
I got my Elvis ring
I'm a Jesus drag queen
