This is your fault
This is what comes of your disrespect
I told you Skylar
I warned you for a solid year, you cross me, there will be consequences
What part of that didn't you understand?
Maybe now you'll listen, maybe now you'll use your damn head
You know, you never believed in me
You were never grateful for anything I did for this family
