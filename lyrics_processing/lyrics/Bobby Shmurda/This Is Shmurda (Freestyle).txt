She was rolling with them niggas so I had to do it
They like Chewy why you shoot em?
Them niggas killed my nigga Kaine so we had to do it
They like Chewy why they shoot em?
He was talkin to the jakes so I had to do it
Shoutout my nigga Locaine my nigga really do it

In and out of drive bys, boy this shit been real
Tell me what you know 'bout wiping shells off the windshield?
Way before Kaine left, boy my shmurdas been killed
Way before we joined the gang all my hots been real
Everybody know my name, local bitch I been ill
Single shot, .22, spinning like a windmill
Hit a nigga and his bitch, fly them out they 
You don't really want it with my hitters when we in field
Real shit, mommy money wasn't 'doin it
So I grabbed some crack, hit the trap and started movin' it
A lotta niggas my age, they ain't know what to do wit it
They was busy playin' in parks, goin to school and shit
I was busy totin that thang, tryna shoot some shit
So every time you hearing my gang, you thinkin' ruthlessness
Real shit, we really do this shit
These niggas jackin savage whatever these niggas new to it

This is Shmurda, this is not music

This is Shmurda, this is not music
I had the flow 10 years ago I just didn't abuse it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well I do it like it ain't nothin to it
