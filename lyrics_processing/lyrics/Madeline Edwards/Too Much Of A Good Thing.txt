What if the road we're on don't have a dead end?
And the prayer you pray is a one time scent
What if it don't unravel with the pull of a string?
And you can't have too much of a good thing

What if the truth you know ain't a well dressed lie?
And the hope you got gets to stay up high
What if the sweet don't have to turn to sting?
And you can't have too much of a good thing

Life don't always work like that
And hearts don't have to break
And God don't give to take it back
And dreams don't have to fade
You can fly too close to the sun
And never melt your wings
And you can't have too much of a good thing

What if the love you want is the love you find?
And it only grows like a live oak over time
And forever don't end up a pawn shop ring
And you can't have too much of a good thing
You might also like
Well, life don't always work like that
And hearts don't have to break
And God don't give to take it back
And dreams don't have to fade
You can fly too close to the sun
And never melt your wings
And you can't have too much of a good thing

What if fear turns into scared of nothing?
You don't have to let go of what you always wanted

And you can fly too close to the sun
And never melt your wings
And life don't always work like that
And hearts don't have to break
And God don't give to take it back
And dreams don't have to fade
And you can fly too close to the sun
And never melt your wings
And you can't have too much of a good thing
