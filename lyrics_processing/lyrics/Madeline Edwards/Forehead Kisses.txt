Don't need a dozen roses, I can't keep them things alive
Ain't gotta have the finer things in life your money can buy
I like catchin' all the feels
From the moon glow through the window of your truck
You leanin' in, me lookin' up (Then I fall into your)

Forehead kisses, just a few more inches
Have me meltin' into him and take me to another planet
Let the stars get jealous, starin' down here at us
Don't have to make it to my lips to catch my attention
Ooh, baby, you got my attention

You can walk me to the car like a southern gentleman
And in the heat of the night, tear the sheets right off the bed
When the night fades into mornin' and the sun rolls off our skin
Oh, damn, I'm feelin' like a woman (When you give me those)

Forehead kisses, just a few more inches
Have me meltin' into him and take me to another planet
Let the stars get jealous, starin' down here at us
Don't have to make it to my lips to catch my attention
Ooh, baby, you got my attention
You might also like
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me

Now give me those forehead kisses, just a few more inches
Have me meltin' into him and take me to another planet
Let the stars get jealous, starin' down here at us
Don't have to make it to my lips to catch my attention
Ooh, baby, you got my attention

Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me (Oh)
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me, lay it on me
