If you been wondering
Just what has made us grow
A generation hard as stone
My father's father
May God rest his soul
He taught me something you should know:

Selfless, relentless
Don't let their memory fade away
No, I won't, won't let 'em leave us
Don't leave us

Remember what made us great

You put your nose to the grindstone
You work your fingers straight to the bone

I won't, won't let 'em leave us
Don't leave us
Selfless, relentless
Don't let their memory fade away
No, I won't, won't let 'em leave us
Don't leave us

I am forever grateful
I am the man I am today
(Don't leave us)
I am forever grateful
For your hand in making me this way
(Don't leave us)
Remember what made us great
Now's the time to
Remember what made us great


Remember what made us great
Now's the time to
Remember what made us great
