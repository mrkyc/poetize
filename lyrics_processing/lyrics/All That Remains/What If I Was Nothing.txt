Just let it go, don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure, I know just what we're fightin' for
I know you're scared and that you're thinkin' I may go
I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin'

And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question
You might also like
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you


And we can keep this goin' on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it makes us
Stronger every day

And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true? (What if I was nothin'?)
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you (What if I was nothin')
So what if I was angry? (What if I was nothin') What did you think I'd do?
