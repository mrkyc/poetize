One, two, three, go

Make me your Scarlett whore, just make me your fiend
I'll be your bastard son, I'll be your unclean
I won't deny I'm everything that you hate
The lie is what's remembered anyway

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built
See things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I spill

Won't disappoint, I'm every demon you seek
And yes, my silver tongue will prey on the weak
So hide your children, tell them not of my sins
As I said, the ugly truth is I'm what you might have been

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built
See things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I
Won't cry for the blood I spill
You might also like
I'm what hides in the dark
I'm what grips at your heart

Make me your Scarlett whore, just make me your fiend
I'll be your bastard son, I'll be your unclean
So hide your children, tell them not of my sins
As I said, the ugly truth is I'm what you might have been

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built
See things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I
I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built
I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I spill

I'm what hides in the dark
I'm what grips at your heart
I'm what hides in the dark
