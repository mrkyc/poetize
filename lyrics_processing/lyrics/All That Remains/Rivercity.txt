All the lights out in Rivercity
All the phone lines are dark and gritty
Every half home is up late waiting
I can't leave here till you come get me

I keep picking up the line
To hear you on the other side
Can you hear me?
Every time you say goodbye
I'm left here waiting for a sign
Can you hear me?
Hear me, hear me, hear me
No

Can't tell you to be safe
Can't tell you to be strong
Can't tell you that I love you
So, don't put down the phone
Too far away to hold you
Too close to let you go
But I can't fight this for you
So, don't put down the phone
You might also like
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone

All the ghosts live in Rivercity
Check my pulse; is my heart still beating?
Focus hard on your face; it's fading
I can't leave here till you come get me

I keep picking up the line
To hear you on the other side
Can you hear me?
Every time you say goodbye
I'm left here waiting for a sign
Can you hear me?
Hear me, hear me, hear me
No

Can't tell you to be safe
Can't tell you to be strong
Can't tell you that I love you
So, don't put down the phone
Too far away to hold you
Too close to let you go
But I can't fight this for you
So, don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone


Hear me, hear me, hear me
No

Can't tell you to be safe
Can't tell you to be strong
Can't tell you that I love you
So don't put down the phone
Too far away to hold you
Too close to let you go
But I can't fight this for you
So don't put down the phone

Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
Don't put down the phone
Don't! Don't!
