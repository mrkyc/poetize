Your plane is boarding
Got to cross the ocean all alone
My heart is stone
You need to figure out the things
That plague you here at home
I'll carry on

Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this

So, say something
I'm not holding back
Before the scene we've made
Goes and fades to black
'Cause I can't wait
While you think this through
We don't have endless time
Remember who left who
'Cause I won't wait
Won't wait for you
You might also like
Your lifeless eyes don't hold the
Same desire anymore
I can't ignore
So long I've wondered
But I think now I know
You're not coming home

Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this

So, say something
I'm not holding back
Before the scene we've made
Goes and fades to black
'Cause I can't wait
While you think this through
We don't have endless time
Remember who left who
'Cause I won't wait
Won't wait for you
Put my heart in your hands
Committed my whole life to you
And all you had to say:
"See you in a few days"
But days turn into months
This isn't what you promised me
I've gotta let you go
Or just find another way

(Say something)
(But I can't keep waiting
Can't keep waiting)
(We have to get through this)

So, say something
I'm not holding back
(I needed time to work it out alone)
So, say something
I'm not holding back
Before the scene we've made
Goes and fades to black
'Cause I can't wait
While you think this through
We don't have endless time
Remember who left who
'Cause I won't wait
