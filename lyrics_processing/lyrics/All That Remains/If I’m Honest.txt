You'll probably see this in the headlines
And let me tell you: almost all of it's true
But we both know that I'm dead right
And I don't know what else you want me to do
I've been saying this a long time
Not a lot of people hear what I say
So, when you see it in the headlines
Maybe then, you'll see it's always this way

They'll try to twist and turn
'N' try to drown me out
But that won't change my mind

If I'm honest, I'm not afraid to die
Not afraid to live, not afraid to try
If I'm honest, you couldn't change my mind
Couldn't break me down
So don't waste your time
If I'm honest, I'll, I'll be all right

You can put me in the spotlight
And the world will try to pull me one way
But it's gonna be a long night
I've been around the block, and I know this game
I won't wait until it feels right
'Cause the truth is something long overdue
You could put me in the spotlight
Maybe then, my words would finally break through
You might also like
They'll try to twist and turn
'N' try to drown me out
But that won't change my mind

If I'm honest, I'm not afraid to die
Not afraid to live, not afraid to try
If I'm honest, you couldn't change my mind
Couldn't break me down
So don't waste your time
If I'm honest, I'll, I'll be all right


They'll try to twist and turn
And try to drown me out
But that won't change my mind

If I'm honest, I'm not afraid to die
Not afraid to live, not afraid to try
If I'm honest, you couldn't change my mind
Couldn't break me down
So don't waste your time
If I'm honest, I'll, I'll be all right
