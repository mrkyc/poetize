You think if you call someone
The Devil's gonna leave
You think if you write a song
And someone else believes
Maybe if you find someone
And ask them "Pretty please"
They'll help you to understand
This Devil never leaves

Step out to the unknown
I'll catch you on the way down
Aim high, look out below
We're on our way, together into the unknown

I'm gonna try and right my wrongs
Before I up and leave
Land on the final chord
It's the sweetest sound I heard
And now all that weight is gone
Does it bring you sweet relief?
You're lookin' down upon
The sum of you and me

Step out to the unknown
I'll catch you on the way down
Aim high, look out below
I'll be there with you wherever you go
Jump out to the unknown
I'll catch you on the way down
Hold tight, I won't let go
We're on our way, together into the unknown

Innovation, celebration, adoration, give me more
If only for a day
You can fake it, infiltrate it, corporate it, little boy
Sell your baby teeth

Isn't it time that we made up our minds?
This is insufferable
We can't avoid all troubles
Bury your head in the sand all you want
A billion vibrations surround you at once
We're on our way, together into the unknown

Deviation, mutilation, self-abasement, what a chore
For only one more day
Sometimes I purr, sometimes I growl, sometimes I squeak
I can roar, it'll shake your teeth
Isn't it time that we made up our minds?
This is insufferable
We can't avoid all troubles
Bury your head in the sand all you want
A billion vibrations surround you at once
We're on our way, together into the unknown

Step out to the unknown
I'll catch you on the way down
Aim high, look out below
I'll be there with you wherever you go
Jump out to the unknown
I'll catch you on the way down
Hold tight, I won't let go
