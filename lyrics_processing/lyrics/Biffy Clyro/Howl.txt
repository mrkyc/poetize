Lately it's hard to let you know that I'll never learn
I am explosive and volatile, I'm on the turn

It's time to squirm, I've backed into a wall
My cage has spilled it's contents on the floor
My grave concern's I can't ignore the past
I'll look into the future to make it last

I'm never gonna sleep again (I'm never gonna sleep again)
I get to do it all wrong (I get to do it all wrong)
I'm never gonna sleep again, again again, again...

'Cause lately it's hard to let you know that I'll never learn
I am explosive and volatile, I'm on the turn
So I'm gonna howl like an animal
'Cause lately it's hard to let you know...

There's no return and there's no-one to call
I picked a phone connected to the gods
My stitches burst but don't produce a scar
Why can't I see this time what's done is done?
