I see a choir coming down the hill
They're singing devil songs
I love a twisted melody
They don't ask but still they come around
They're sweeter than I wanted
I don't want you to ruin it

They had eyes like a backwards sunset, a golden curve
They gave me armbands made of concrete, I have to swim, I have to swim

'Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you (Friend as good as you) who needs enemies?

I took a road I didn't recognize
And waited for a call to help me get her stabilized
I nursed her and then she came around
I prefer her conscious, than dreams within a dream

Her eyes were described as deep set cigarette burns
Please keep me in the right context, I have to learn, I have to learn

'Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you (Friend as good as you)
Who needs enemies?
Was it that bad?
(Let me tell you 'bout the truth in us)
Am I really that venomous?
(Let me tell you 'bout the world)
With a friend as good as you (Friend as good as you)
Who needs enemies?
I guess we all make mistakes
And time is gonna tell
Or maybe it never will...

Friends as good as you, friends as good as you
Friends as good as you, friends as good as you
Friends as good as you (Let me tell you 'bout the truth in us)
Friends as good as you (Let me tell you 'bout the world)
Friends as good as you (Let me tell you 'bout the truth in us)
Friends as good as you

'Cause you were not right
You were just righteous
With a friend as good as you, who needs enemies?
Was it that bad?
(Let me tell you 'bout the truth in us)
Am I really that venomous?

With a friend as good as you (Friend as good as you)

With a friend as good as you (Friend as good as you)
Who needs enemies?
I guess we all make mistakes
But we're growing
