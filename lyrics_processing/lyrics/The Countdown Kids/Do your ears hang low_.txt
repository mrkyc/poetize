You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smelled so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
Ah baby
(The way you do the things you do)
(The way you do the things you do)
As pretty as you are
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby, you're so smart
You know you could have been a schoolbook
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
(The way you do the things you do)
Ah, baby
(The way you do the things you do)
Yeah
You made my life so rich
You know you could have been some money
And baby, you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
(The way you do the things you do)
You really swept me off my feet
(The way you do the things you do)
You made my life complete
(The way you do the things you do)
You made my life so bright
(The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel all right
(The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel all right
