I've been weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up, yeah
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile to get outta my head, yeah

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and, baby, don't you give up, yeah
Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move to show me where we can stand, yeah

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

We all bleed, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it out of the frame, yeah
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess and don't forget that life is a dance, yeah

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and, baby, don't you give up, yeah
Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move to show me where we can stand, yeah

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness, yeah
