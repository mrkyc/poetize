In search of a dream and a destiny
Every race and creed with a desperate plan
Found hope waiting in a brand new land
Working together, we can get along somehow
We came on different ships but we're all in the same boat now
You can live in the city or a country town
Yeah but we all stand on common ground
You can speak your mind because we're all free
And you can still fit in if you disagree
It takes a lot of roots to grow a family tree
But it don't take much to unite you and me
White collar Wall Street or a working class crowd
We came on different ships but we're all in the same boat now
All in the same boat now
All in the same boat (all in the same boat now)
All in the same boat now
Spoken:
The red and the yellow, the black and the white
The rich and the poor, the left and the right
The meek in the mind, the strong and the bold
The hip and the straight, the young and the old
The weary, the hungry, the lost, the left out
The legal and free makes everyone count
The east and west, the north and south

Oh, It takes a lot of roots to grow a family tree
But it don't take much to unite you and me
Working together, we can get along somehow
We came on different ships but we're all in the same boat now
All in the same boat now
All in the same boat (we're all in the same boat now)
All in the same boat now
All in the same boat (we're all in the same boat now)
All in the same boat now
