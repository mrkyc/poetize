When a silver Eldorodo, pulled up on the right
I was looking for adventure, I was looking for a ride
And both of my prayers were answered when she motioned me inside
She said, "Where you going, cowboy?"
I said, "Anywhere, but here!"
She looked me squarely in the eye
And said, "Well have no fear
I'll get you there in half the time. I love to fast
She winked at me, the light turned green
And the world went flying past
(CHORUS)
She said, "Boy, I'm gonna give you the ride off your life
We're only gonna do it once, but we're gonna do it right
If you're into taking chances, you better hold on tight
Cause I'm gonna give you the ride of your like
We were screaming through the traffic, flying through the night
I was thinking it was cool, passing everything in sight
She took a right on Sunset, then a left on Canyon Drive
And I began to wonder, if I'd make it back alive
Like a demon had possessed her
She kept picking up the pace
My heart was beating faster
And the blood drained from my face
A death grip on the armrest, my knuckles turning white
Why is it when you need a cop
There's never one in sight?
You might also like(CHORUS)
Now my thirst for adventure, had long since disappeared
And any thoughts of passion, were now overcome by fear
I was praying through anther curve; when suddenly ahead
I saw an intersection, and the light was turning red
I was planning my escape, as she was gearing down
When she came to a screeching halt, I jumped out and kissed the ground
The light turned green, I heard her laugh, As she drove out of sight
I realized just what she meant, and was she ever right
