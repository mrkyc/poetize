She had a long line of lovers, mostly the gambling kind
I didn't want to be like the others and get left behind
I heard about her bad reputation and how she had a heart of stone
How she'd give a man a moment of pleasure to get what she want

I had a weakness for her kind of woman, I could never deny
I knew I would never see it coming 'til I was lost in her eyes
The more I tried to keep her at a distance, the more I became aware
She was breaking down my resistance 'til I no longer cared

Tonight I saw a red, red rose in the yellow moon
Shining on a silhouette lying in the shadows of my bedroom
I knew it when we made love and I couldn't quit calling her name
That I'd been hit by another fast movin' train
I've been hit by another fast movin' train

I wondered as I laid there and held her, why can't this be real?
Why the fear wouldn't let me tell her how good she made me feel
I doubted if she would even be around when the morning comes
I waited 'til she fell asleep to whisper, "Baby, look what you've done"

Tonight I saw a red, red rose in the yellow moon
Shining on a silhouette lying in the shadows of my bedroom
I knew it when we made love and I couldn't quit calling her name
That I'd been hit by another fast movin' train
I've been hit by another fast movin' train
