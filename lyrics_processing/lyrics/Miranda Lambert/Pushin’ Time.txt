Are we fools for rushing in?
'Cause I already dread the end
Lonely ain't no place to start
I guess that's just where we are
Oh, how I remember well
The sunset on September 12th
I disappeared to get a drink
You still kept your eyes on me

Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time

I didn't plan on falling fast
I didn't know I could be kissed like that
Now I'm trading miles for minutes
This bed's too big without you in it

Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
You and I are pushin' time

And they say only time can tell
You already know me well
If it has to end in tears
I hope it's in 60 years

Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
