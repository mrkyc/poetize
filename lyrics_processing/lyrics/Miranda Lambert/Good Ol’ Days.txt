Oh, southern breeze knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can
The religious and the rest, they've all tried their best
Well I guess some things you just don't understand

Oh, Lord, when will the road run out
I'm on the road but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why, still I second guess my pace
If I stand to lose from winning
To find the truth I'm willing
To start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days

Oh, southern pines reaching for the sky
I'm convinced that I can fly beneath your shade
Oh, and its all overdue spending time just me and you
Mmm, the pulpit and pew where I was saved

Oh, Lord, when will the road run out
I'm on the road but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why, still I second guess my pace
If I stand to lose from winning
To find the truth I'm willing
To start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days, yeah
