If you wear a white shirt to a crawfish boil
Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it

'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin

You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk-dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A1 Sauce on her table cloth
Don't sweat it, a Tide stick will get it

It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
And it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
You gotta put that sucker on spin

And the laundry list goes like this
Every teardrop, every white lie
Every dirty cotton sheet, let it line dry
All the mistakes, all the wild streaks
That's why the good Lord made bleach, oh-oh

'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
Yeah, put that sucker on spin

Yeah, you put that sucker on spin
And around and around and around and around we go
