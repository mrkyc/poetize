Fuck with the wave
Fuck with the crew
We been them boys, since like 20-02
Paper chasin', findin' greatest
Come on baby this is the move
Seen us comin', now we stuntin'
Baby there is nothin' to prove
X2

Fresher than an alto, stackin' up my downloads
Came up from the down low, now I'm doin' house shows
Ya!
Stayed fresh to deaf and I got him wit me
Came wit that crack ain't no bob and whitney
Boppin' at gettys they vibin' wit me
Don't try it wit me
Ob-vious-ly
I'm due for it all
If they niggas tryna hang, got a noose for em all
Drop a duece for em all!
Shittin' on the record
Let me sit here for the second
Ain't no tissue in this motherfucker, hope you get the message
Man apollo, I'ma do like they never did it
U' N' all them niggas steady hatin', ya'll ain't F' in wit it
No FUN, for these niggas claimin' my competitiors
Feed the game higher learning droppin off these edibles
Woah, woah, woah, slow it down
All them bars, nigga they can't hold em down
Bitch it's over now
Got the game on my shoulders now
Need a soap and towel
Cuz the way I fucked the game
Legs shakin, they so emotio-nal
Got me feelin like Chris you the GOAT for now
Here's a toast for ya'll
Finna' do it coast to coast for ya'll
Way I rock it, got me close to Yao
I'm the poster child
Got me drunk on the sofa now
You'll never win til I sober down
Bitch plz!

[Verse 2 - Apollo Fresh)
WAVlengths the WAV
WAVlengths the crew
I got them flows
Cause waters my muse
All it took was little patience for greatness
Watch them green numbers come like the matrix
Add it add it up im good with the basics
Minus and subtract the fugazi fakeness
Hunter Hunter got the green like gon
Do it do it to them Daniel San
Wax em off wax em off and on
You can't hold us back from getting on
Have you ever tried to box atomic bombs
Bound to blow Vakabon vagabonds
Wait need to speed it up
Take a sip and leave disease in cup
Young nigga sick as fuck
Wait leave the beat in dust
Grease the beat and leave it leaking up
Tweaking up it guts
Hit it from the back make it back twitch
Imma crack the eggs in the back of ya basket
Take a shut.tle to main campus just to pass shit
Then slide back to the crib and make magic
I'm a bright kid like a light yea I'm that lit
Water bend water whip the ship till the WAVe hits
{Chorus - Both]
Fuck with the wave
(Waaaaaaaaave)

We been them boys, since like 20-02
(Boooooooys, 20- oh toooooooo)
Paper chasin, findin' greatest
Come on baby this is the move
(Moooooooooove)
Seen us comin', now we stuntin'
Baby there is nothin' to prove
(Prooooooooooove)
