I ain't focused on that drama really
2-4 if you pop a wheelie?
Damn it philly, dawg free meek milly
Ride wit those, that been ridin' wit me
I been talkin' like they sided wit me
And I'm drunk as fuck, that's a lotta' henny
My fam proud, like I bodied penny
When the bass drop, got you noddin' silly
If it wasn't rap, I'd be like off in the himalays
Witta' ukalaylee and a different cadence
Wit' some fly gators, talkin' shit like I was signed wit a fuckin' label
Boy it's nothin' major
Wylin out wit no fuckin' nieghbors
Fort Myers need a fuckin' savior
Don't know why they think I'm fuckin' playin'
I'm a fuckin' saiyan
I been fuckin' sayin
You might also like
They wanna take my soul, but I won't fold
I had to get my own, follow the code
And in this like I know, you'll never know
But all I know, all I know is that...
