This boy wants to play, there's no time left today
It's a shame, 'cause he has to go home
This boy's got to work, got to sweat
Just to pay what he gets to get left all alone

Well, let's step outside
Let's go for a ride, just for a while
No, we won't get caught
Well, that's what I thought, until we cried

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared for this emotion
For years, I've been holding it down
For years, I've been holding it down

This girl tries her best everyday
But it's all gone to waste, 'cause there's no one around
This girl, she can draw, she can paint
Likes to dance, she can skate, now she don't make a sound

We'll play in our park
'Til it's too dark for us to see
Well, we'll make our way home
With mud on our clothes, she won't be pleased

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared for this emotion
For years, I've been holding it down
And I love to forgive and forget
So I try to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get, the more that I know
Well, it's time to let this go

I got to let it go, I got to let it go
I got to let it go, I got to let it go

I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy
I'm sure that you had your reasons
I'm scared for this emotion
For years, I've been holding it down
And I love to forgive and forget
So, I try to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get, the more that I know

And I love to forgive and forget
So, I try to put all this behind us
Just know that my arms are wide open
The older I get, the more that I know
