Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Tell me why you hold yourself like that, you look so sad
But don't tell me that you're giving up when I got your back
Still hiding from those people you can't forgive for what they did
You can hold it on your own but that's no way to live

Don't be scared 'cause there's no doubt
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll mend your heart, I'll heal your wounds
I'll do what no one else could do
I've told you once, I've told you twice
I'll tell you this a thousand times
Like the burning of the sun
Just like the river runs

My love goes on
Oh, when everything has changed
I'll be the one thing that remains
My love goes on
Oh, when your whole world has shattered
I'll be the only one who matters
My love goes on

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
My love, my love goes on, goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

It's easy to buy into what you've been sold, but there's no soul
And I swear that Hell would freeze over in this world so cold, now
So lift up your hands and rest your weary feet (Mmm)
'Cause you're here with me
And I'll hold in my open arms and set you free (Set you free)

Don't be scared 'cause there's no doubt
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll mend your heart, I'll heal your wounds
I'll do what no one else could do
I've told you once, I've told you twice
I'll tell you this a thousand times
Like the burning of the sun
Just like the river runs

My love goes on
Oh, when everything has changed
I'll be the one thing that remains
My love goes on
Oh, when your whole world has shattered
I'll be the only one who matters
My love goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
My love goes on, oh, my love goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
On and on, on and on

Just like the beating of a drum
That's the way my love goes on
Just like the birds will sing their song
That's the way my love goes on
On and on, on
On and on
Like the burning of the sun (Mmm)
Just like the river runs

My love goes on
Oh, when everything has changed (Everything has changed)
I'll be the one thing that remains
My love goes on (Love goes on)
Oh, when your whole world has shattered (Has shattered)
I'll be the only one who matters
My love goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
On, on, 'cause my love, my love goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, my love goes on, oh, yeah, my love goes on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
