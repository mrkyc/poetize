It's out of sight, yeah, it's out of mind
And if it doesn't keep you up at night
Then let it go, let it go
If you feel like it's got you bad
And it's the scariest thing that you ever had
Then let it flow, let it flow
You got to keep it as you find it
Oh, you gotta let it take you over

So don't push it aside and watch it burn
If there's one thing I've learnt
No, you don't mess with love
Oh, don't walk away just to save the hurt
If you know what it's worth
No, you don't mess with love

If it's good then it ain't gon' be easy
It cuts you deep inside your soul
Inside your soul
And if it's real then it hurts when you hold it
And you can't help lose all control
All control
You got to keep it as you find it
Oh, you gotta let it take you over
You might also like
So don't push it aside and watch it burn
If there's one thing I've learnt
No, you don't mess with love
Don't walk away just to save the hurt
If you know what it's worth
No, you don't mess with love

The harder they come, yeah, the harder they fall
Ooh, after all
No, you don't mess with love

And if you're gonna get hurt, you're gonna get hurt
It's better to have loved and lost then not at all
And if you're gonna get burnt, you're gonna get burnt
And if you don't, you'll never know how far you can fall
I guess it's a lesson, a lesson I learnt

So don't push it aside and watch it burn
If there's one thing I've learnt
No, you don't mess with love
Don't walk away just to save the hurt
If you know what it's worth
No, you don't mess with love
The harder they come, yeah, the harder they fall
Ooh, after all
No, you don't mess with love
I said the harder they come, the harder they fall
Ooh, after all
