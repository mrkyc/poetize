I feel your sunshine when you're deep in shadows
You say you give me nothin' but it still feels good, though
You think you're worthless but I think you're incredible
Don't say it's empty when to me it is plentiful

Don't underestimate your power, you're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul, I told you before
Don't underestimate your power
You're stronger than you know
You're stronger than you know, ooh, ooh, know

You say you're strugglin' and your life's been wasted
You don't wanna get back up but you can take it
It's not the same as it was when, when you were 17
But fuck it, you're a woman now and you're stronger than you've ever been

Don't underestimate your power, you're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul, I told you before
Don't underestimate your power

So much power in store
Tell me what the hell you waiting for?
You're about to explode
You got this again, like you know you should
You might also like
We both know you can take me down when you're at your weakest
We both know how I lean on you, better keep that a secret
You think it's hard, yes it is, what you want to be givin' is
I'll give you something from me
You should sing a little louder
Here comes your line, you should sing it in the shower

Don't underestimate your power, you're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul, I told you before
Don't underestimate your power
You're stronger than you know
Said you're stronger than you know, oh oh
You're stronger than you know

Listen, baby
Don't let 'em fool you
Let 'em fool you, oh
You're stronger than you know
Woo-hoo
You're stronger, you're stronger
You're stronger than you know
