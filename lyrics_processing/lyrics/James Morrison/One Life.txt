I was living for the moment
The world was wide open
I had every choice
But with so many choices
I just didn't know what to do now
All I say is forget it
If you tell me I'll regret it
Just let it be what it is
Coz it's so easy to say
If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I won't let my soul slide away, I'd do whatever it takes
Coz this time's only borrowed
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it right
Verse 2:
My daddy sat me down, he said
"Son it's probably time to start making some plans"
And I said, "No, not right now"
With so many choices
I just didn't know what to do now

Just let it be what it is, coz it's so easy to say
If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I won't let my soul slide away, I'd do whatever it takes
Coz this time's only borrowed
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it right
Bridge:
You say the more you think you know what's right
The less you do what you feel inside
So I won't pretend that I always know
I just follow my heart wherever it goes
And I may not always get it right
But at least I'm living coz I've only got this
One life, one life, one life, I've got this one life
If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I won't let my soul slide away, I'd do whatever it takes
Coz this time's only borrowed
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life and I'm gonna live it right
Outro:
When I'm an old man, hope I'll be rocking in my chair
Smiling to myself
I'll tell my baby girl
