How can I find you
When you're always hiding from yourself?
Playing hide and seek with me
'Till it gets too dark
Too dark, inside your shell
Why do I even try
When you take me for granted?
I should know better by now
When you call I already hear that crashing sound
As it all falls down

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up, up, up
The only way is up, up

I watch your spirit break
As it shatters into a million pieces
Just like glass I see right through you
And your parade of excuses
Feels like groundhog day
You say the same things over and over
There's that look in your eye
And I hear that crashing sound
As it all falls down
You might also like
It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up, up, up
The only way is up, up

It's your love that's strong (Hmm)
It's the only thing that keeps me holding on
It's your heart that's weak
But it's not too weak to bring you back to me, yeah

(Hm-hm)
It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah I know you can
Don't bury your demons deep in the ground
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
It's never too late to turn it back around (Never too late, never too late)
When it all falls down
The only way is up (Yeah, yeah)
The only way is up, up, up
The only way is up (Up) (Up)
