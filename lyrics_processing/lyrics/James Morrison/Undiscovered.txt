(Mmm-mmm)

I look at you, you bite your tongue
You don't know why or where I'm coming from
But in my head, I'm close to you
We're in the rain still searching for the sun

You think that I wanna run and hide
I'll keep it all locked up inside
I just want you to find me

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone, we are all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face
You might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no, no, just undiscovered

Well, the time it takes to know someone
It all can change before you know it's gone
Before it's gone
So close your eyes, feel the way, I'm with you now
Believe there's nothing wrong
Nothing wrong
You might also like
You think that I wanna run and hide
I'll keep it all locked up inside
But I just want you to find me

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone, we are all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face
You might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no, no, just undiscovered

I'm not running, no, I'm not hiding
If you dig a little deeper, you will find me

I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered
When we're alone, we are all the same as each other
We are all the same, you see the look that's on my face
You might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no, no, undiscovered
Sing it, singin'

(I'm not lost, no, no, I'm undiscovered)
Don't you know that's what we are?
(And when we're alone, we are all the same as each other)
We're all the same, you see the look that's on my face
You might think that I'm out of place
