Since you've gone
Nothing seems to fit no more
Nothing's as it was before
Everyday
Is a battle that I just can't win
I know I won't see you again
But I keep waiting for the night
I close my eyes and hope you'll find me sleeping

Coz in my dreams
We can spend a little time just talking
In my dreams
We are side by side just walking
Oh well the feelings that we used to know
The places we used to go
Are all still there
In my dreams
On the front of the crossbar of your bike
We can go anyplace, anywhere you like
In my dreams
And as hard as it seems
Till then I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams
You might also like
Now don't you wake me up
I don't wanna go nowhere
I could wait here for a zillion years
You're gone too soon
I know I'll never get the chance
To say the things I never said
But I keep waiting for the night
I close my eyes and hope you'll find me sleeping

Coz in my dreams
We can spend a little time together
In my dreams
You can live a little longer
Oh well the feelings that we used to know
The places we used to go
Are all still there
In my dreams
On the front of the crossbar of your bike
We can go anyplace, anywhere you like
In my dreams
I hope someday this pain I feel will fade
Till then I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams
Yes I'll wait, I'll wait
To see you again
In my dreams
I'll see you again
In my dreams
Well I don't know where and I don't know when
But I know I'll see your face again
