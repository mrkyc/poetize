Ooh

It's a sad song that has no end
It's a bleeding heart that never mends
A minor miracle we can still pretend
After so long
And did the apple fall too far from the tree?
And id we get lost in the space in-between?
But the roots that we buried so deep
Will always be strong

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall
Oh, yeah

Love burns when it's in the blood
And God knows I burnt you the best I could
How can three words be so misunderstood?
We got it so wrong
Yeah, the greatest gift that you ever gave to me
You don't know your strength till you've faced defeat
So when everything's just out of reach
You keep holding on
You might also like
Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by learning to fall

We built a brick wall, but it's all for nothing
Only bridges will cross this divide
We both know this road leads to nowhere
There's nothing left for you to hide

Too late for lullabies, too soon for it alright
But love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
You taught me to fly by love, by learning to fall
Too late for lullabies (It's too late), too soon for it alright
Love takes its toll sometimes
Let's start a clean slate, mistakes are moments in time
For every time you ever raised up your hand
I'll give you mine to show you I understand
