Ooh, ooh

How can I fill this empty space?
Is this a love that can't be replaced?
Where am I going to find myself?
Oh, so far from you
Watch the whole thing fall so fast
Thought we had something to last
Now there is nothing I can do
If I can't feel your touch

Tell me, who's gonna love me if you don't? Ooh, ooh
Who's gonna want anybody feeling this torn?
How can someone shine? Where you have been?
Satisfy this heart you've been living in?
Who's gonna love me if you don't?

Who's gonna love me now?
Love me now, love me now, love me now
Who's gonna love me now?
Love me now, love me now, love me now
Who's gonna love me now?

If you wanna go and find someone
Just leave me here to be the lonely one
I'm trying to fool myself that I'm alright
Oh, so far from you
Lit the fire and watched us burn
Now it's over, lesson learned
Now there is nothing left that I can do
If I can't feel your touch

Tell me, who's gonna love me if you don't? Ooh, ooh
Who's gonna want anybody feeling this torn?
How can someone shine? Where you have been?
Satisfy this heart you've been living in?
Who's gonna love me if you don't?

Who's gonna love me now?
Love me now, love me now, love me now
Who's gonna love me now?
Love me now, love me now, love me now
Who's gonna love me now?

(Who, who, who, who?)
(Who, who, who, who?)
(Who, who, who, who?)
Who's gonna love me if you don't?
(Who, who, who, who?)
(Who, who, who, who?)

Who's gonna love me now?
Who's gonna love me if you don't?

How can someone shine? Where you have been?
Satisfy this heart you've been living in?
Who's gonna love me if you don't?

Who's gonna love me now?
