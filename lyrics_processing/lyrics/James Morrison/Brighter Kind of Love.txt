I roll up another one 'cause it helps me to forget
How I'm lying all alone in this half-empty bed
'Cause every day, I'm waking up with the darkness closing in
I got to try and find a way to start again
And so I knock back another one like the answer's in the glass
I need to find a little happiness, is it too much to ask?
I'm so tired of coming home with the darkness as my friend
It's getting so much harder to pretend

Everybody's looking for a brighter kind of love
Something that'll get us through the night and light us up
Something that'll last beyond the morning when you're gone
Love don't fade away, love don't fade away
Everybody's looking for a brighter kind, a brighter kind of love kind of love

Is there something beautiful hiding way beyond the clouds?
Maybe soon it'll shine down, I just can't feel it now
I won't stop 'til it's bright in me, it can never be too much
But all I know is nothing's not enough

But everybody's looking for a brighter kind of love
Something that'll get us through the night and light us up
Something that'll last beyond the morning when you're gone
Love don't fade away, love don't fade away
Everybody's looking for a brighter kind, a brighter kind of love kind of love

And only for a moment I feel satisfied, but then
Something always brings me crashing back to earth again
And I'm tired of having darkness as my friend (Ooh, yeah)
It's getting hard, it's getting harder to pretend

But everybody's looking for a brighter kind of love
Something that'll get us through the night and light us up
Something that'll last beyond the morning when you're gone
Love don't fade away, love don't fade away
Everybody's looking for a brighter kind, a brighter kind of love kind of love
