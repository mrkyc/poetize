I guess I fooled myself, thought I'd be okay
It didn't take too long
For me to see that we don't work that way
'Cause our love is raw
Yeah, we wear the scars
Sometimes we get so close
That we can't help but tear ourselves apart

I convince myself it's over now and it's the end
But you know that I'll come back again

Every time that you hurt me so bad
I tell myself I can't do it no more
Each time is the last time, every time is the last time
And I die when I try to walk away
But you keep me coming back, coming back for more
When you let me back inside, still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
And I swear it still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
You got me on my knees, it still feels like the first time

We go 'round and 'round like a carousel
You got me oh so dizzy
That I can't tell if this is Heaven or this is Hell
Yeah, your angel smile is a thin disguise
You wear it well but I can see the devil in your eyes
You might also like
I can't help myself, I'm going down, I'm falling in
When you cast your spell, I'm back again

Every time that you hurt me so bad
I tell myself I can't do it no more
Each time is the last time, every time is the last time
And I die when I try to walk away
But you keep me coming back, coming back for more
When you let me back inside, still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
And I swear it still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
You got me on my knees, it still feels like the first time

Oh, don't leave me lonely
Come on and help me
Oh, you cast your spell, I'm back again

Every time that you hurt me so bad
I tell myself I can't do it no more
Each time is the last time, every time is the last time
And I die when I try to walk away
But you keep me coming back, coming back for more
When you let me back inside, it still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
And I swear it still feels like the first time
And you, you do something to me
You got me on my knees, it still feels like the first time
Well, baby, I can feel it
Tell my you still feel it, baby, oh
Girl, you got me on my knees
So tell me darling, please
