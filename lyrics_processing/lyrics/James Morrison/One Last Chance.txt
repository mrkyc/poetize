In my life I don't mean much to anyone
I've lost my way, can't go back anymore
Once I had everything, now it's gone
Don't tell me again 'cause I've heard it all before
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try
I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time, it's now or never
And I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one last chance to get myself together
The time has come for me to change again
I can't carry on like this, I will lose my friends
Don't say that you have given up on me
Just give me the time and space to heal my head
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
I guess I'll give it a try
I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time, it's now or never
And I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one last chance to get myself together

I've got to take this chance and make it into something good
Ohh...
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try
I've got, I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never
I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never
And I try to remember who I used to be
I've got one last chance to get myself together
I've got one last chance...
Well you know it's all I need..
Just one last chance...
