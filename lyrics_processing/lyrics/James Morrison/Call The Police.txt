I think it's time to take it back to where we started from
Your pain, my pain
I'll write it down and tell you exactly how I feel again
And all I see is a mass of confusion
Who I am and what I gotta be, yeah
Closed eyes, big lines
I guess you'll tell me just to let it ride sometimes
Looks good, tastes bad
Makes me wonder where I buried all the dreams I had
All I see is a less good version of a man I don't wanna be
All I feel is you tie me down to something that just isn't real
All I need is some truth God help me
Before the devil buries me, yeah
And I, I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way
Well, I must be crazy if I follow every word you say
When the shit comes down, you'll be the first to walk away
Call the police cause I've lost control
And I really wanna see you bleed
I'm awake, why wait?
I don't need someone to tell me who to be today
I'm quite sure, unlike before
Came off the road and I forgot what I was looking for
All I see is a less good version of a man I don't wanna be
All I feel is you tie me down to something that just isn't real
All I need is some truth God help me
Before the devil buries me, yeah
I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way
Well, I must be crazy if I follow every word you say
When the shit comes down, you'll be the first to walk away
Call the police cause I've lost control
And I really wanna see you bleed
(I know)
You can't just hack at me, you know
You might just, have to let me go
Close in, I need some room to grow
You don't, know what you're thinking of
Hiding behind you're pop sheet
So you can make someone else's dream
Call the police cause I've lost control
And I really wanna see you bleed
(Can't just hack at me, you know)
I can't do nothing, if I can't do something my way
(Close in, I need some room to grow)
Well, I must be crazy if I follow every word you say
(Hiding behind you're pop sheet)
When the shit comes down, you'll be the first to walk away
Call the police cause I've lost control
And I really wanna see you bleed
All I feel is you tie me down to something that just isn't real
All I need is some truth God help me
