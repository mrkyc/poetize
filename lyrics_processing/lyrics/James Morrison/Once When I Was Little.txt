I was the one who would always jump in first
I didn't think twice to look behind
Got such a good feeling just from playing in the dirt
Once when I was little

We could build a rocket, fly to the moon
Leave Tuesday morning and be back for noon
And there was nothing, nothing that we couldn't do
Once when I was little
Yeah, once when I was little

Yeah, I could dream more then
And I believed more then
That the world could only get better
Yeah, I was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life would only show me good times
Once when I was little

There was a time when I trusted everyone
There was no place that I would not go
Spend all day on the hillside
Next to the barley mow
Oh, once when I was little
Yeah, once when I was little
You might also like
Yeah, I could dream more then
And I believed more then
That the world could only get better
Yeah, I was free more then
And I could pretend more then
That this life could only show me good times
Once when I was little

I used to feel so strong
Even when they'd tell me, tell me I was wrong
That I can't live in a magic world
'Cause it's time for me to grow up
And I've got to be like the rest of them
Well, I know things have been lost

Yeah, I could dream more then
And I believed more then
That the world would only get better
Yeah, I was free more then
And I could pretend more then
That this life would only show me good times
Once when I was little
So here comes the next one, next in line
Stay as young as you can for the longest time
'Cause those days flew by
Like a breeze just passing through
