I was so lost, didn't know what to do with myself
I was my own worst enemy
I was lost and know I needed help
Then you came along and saw the state I was in
You picked me up, when I was down
Showed me how to live again
I say thank you for pulling me through, I'm a lucky man
I didn't know what life was but now I, I understand

This is precious love, precious love
No, I can't let it go
This is precious love and it's teaching me
Everything I need to know
This is precious love, oh it's precious love
No, I can't get enough
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please
Give me some more of that stuff
Oh, it's love, love, love, love, love, precious love
Oh, it's love, love, love, love, love, precious love

Oh, I got so distracted by people all around
Whispering sweet nothings, filling my head with doubt
So I gave up, it didn't take long for me to see
The one thing that I was missing was standing in front of me
I took you for granted, thought the grass
Was greener on the other side
I was wrong and it's taken so long
For me to finally realize
You might also like
This is precious love, precious love
No, I can't let it go
This is precious love and it's teaching me
Everything I need to know
This is precious love, oh it's precious love
No, I can't get enough
Oh, Im down on my knees, begging you please
Give me some more of that stuff

I say a prayer and send it to you
That my heart will always be true
Life won't be the same without you
So I say thank you, mmm, I'm a lucky man
I didn't know what life was but now I, now I understand
Understand, understand

Oh, this is love, love, love, love, precious love
This is precious love and it's teaching me to be a better man
This is precious love, precious love
No, I can't get enough
Oh, I'm down of my knees
Its there that I see, it must be from heaven above
Yeah, it's love, love, love, love, precious love
Its is love, love, love, love, precious love
Love, love, love, give me love, give me love
