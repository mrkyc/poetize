Pt. I
I drink a lotta whiskey, smokin all the time
I'm gettin fucked up every god damn night
Everybody's doin cocaine and startin up fights
And I'm livin fast and hard and dyin hard with my god damn
Loaded fists of fury, doin what I do
And I'm spittin in your face because I'm dominatin you
Livin hard and doin time cuz I don't give a fuck
I've been beat down and thrown around and now you're out of luck
Punch...Fight, Fuck
Punch...Fight, Fuck

Punch, Fight, Fuck
Well I'm always gettin loaded on the evil side of town
That's where I'm hangin out cuz I'm always feelin down
Livin fast and lonely, doin what I do
And I'm lookin for a whore gunna fuck her black and blue

Til I make you see a side that you never ever knew

And I'm doin dope and smokin smoke and now I'm stealin cars
