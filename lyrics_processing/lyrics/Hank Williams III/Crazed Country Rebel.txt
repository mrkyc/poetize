Went down to Memphis, Tennessee
And I was lookin' for a guy who had a mullet and no teeth
And I was trippin on some acid
A latino gave to me
Hey, I was smokin morphine
Til it knocked me off my feet
Then I got some "H"
From my old Uncle Pete
Now I'm startin to feel
Like I might've ODed
On an overdose of drugs
Overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest
Like I'm on ten
And I love gettin high
I hate bein low
And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel
And I'm driftin state to state
Somehow I made it up to Texas
With a carload full of grass
And I'm seeing all these pigs
Who wanna bust my ass
And I'm always livin hard
Always smokin weed
Now I'm hangin out in Texas
Drinkin mushroom tea
And I'm fucked up on the floor
And I think I know why
Must've been some of that
Boone county moonshine

And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel
And I'm driftin state to state
I tried to get up off the floor
Tried to get myself in line
Cause the ceiling's talkin to me
And the pisser's flushin fire
That's why they call me 'full throttle'
I like a good time
It all started at a bar
With a friend of mine
Well she had to hook me up
She said she'd blow my mind
I've been up for four days
So cut me out another line
Of an overdose of drugs
Overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest
Like I'm on ten
I love bein high
I hate bein low
And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
