I been beat up bad, I been kicked around
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town
In this old town
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun
Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run
Yeah, I'm a-runnin' an' a-gunnin' an' a-lookin' for a damn good time

I done so much trip, I can't look you in the eye
You know I's tryin' to find that ultimate high
An' I was hangin' with my good friend, an' his name is David Allan Coe
Well, I was runnin' real hard an' he was runnin' real fast
An' we got caught-up, up there on the pass:
And we ended up back at this bar on the side of that road

I been beat up bad, I been kicked around
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town
In this old town
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun
Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run
An' I'm a-runnin' an' a-gunnin' an' a-lookin' for a damn good time

I done so much trip, I can't look you in the eye
You know I's tryin' to find that ultimate high
An' I was hangin' out with my friend Mr, er, George Jones
Well, I was messed up bad an' he was messed right
An' me an' George, well we sat an' talked all night
About the good times an' how country music's lost it's soul

I been beat up bad, I been kicked around
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town
In this old town
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun
Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run
