Well, the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore
Did you know Hank Williams ain't a member
But they keep em outside their door
Hell, they didn't even really want Johnny Cash back in '74
Said the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore

Well, they were nervous about Waylon
'Cause he had a crooked smile
For many, many years they never wanted Bocephus
'Cause hes too god damn loud
Did you really think they ever wanted
Johnny Paycheck hanging around
Hell naw 'cause their too up tight wild
For real rebels like to get down


To most people listening to this
It might seem like I'm talking shit
But if you look behind the scenes of who's pulling the strings
Well, goddamn it, it'll make ya sick
Hank Williams still ain't reinstated
And I'll tell you, that's fuckin' bullshit
And the King Jimmy Martin; if he was still here
He'd tell 'em all to suck his dick

Johnny Paycheck hanging around
Hell naw 'cause their too up tight wild
For real rebels like to get down

And the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore
Well they done fucked off the people
That made it when it wasn't shit before
Hell, they didn't even really want Johnny Cash back in '74
Said the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore

Naw, the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore
Did you know Hank Williams ain't a member
But they keep em outside their door
Hell, they didn't even really want Johnny Cash back in '74
Said the Grand Ole Opry ain't so grand anymore

You know it makes me wonder folks: Has the Opry sinned?
