Hell I've been feeling cold as stone
And them long hard days've been movin slow
At least I got my dogs to help me sing my songs
I'm doin what I can tryin to get along
Hey boy
Been tryin to get out of this state of mind
But sometimes you know there just ain't no light
Everybody has them dark and lonely days
Maybe one day soon all of that will change
Hey boy
In that evenin' time when that sun don't shine
I cut a little wood and make me a fire
Some people might put their guns to their head
But I'll tell you right now life is better than dead
Hey boy
I hate it when I gotta make that dreadful drive
In the city where the things just ain't goin right
At least my sea bee keeps me satisfied
And listens to the sound of my loud straight pipes
Hey boy
I been feeling coldamine down in Tennessee
I ain't got no lover whos a wantin me
I take another shot of my misery
To make me feel better than I used to be
Hey boy
Somethin bout drivin my 4 by 4
Ain't nothin like hearin that motor roar
I love bein jacked up way to high
You know it's cause I'm always full of that rebel pride
Hey boy
I'm just a skinny man they call me 3
Now my younger he's a little bit taller than me
I been known to be on the rowdy side
And I'll hit the freight train when it's passin me by
Hey boy
I got me a feelin like I'm cold as stone
Them long hard days've been movin slow
At least I got my dogs to help me sing my song
I'm doin what I can tryin to get along
Hey boy
Been tryna get out of this state of mind
But sometimes you know there just ain't no light
Everybody has them dark and lonely days
Maybe one day soon all of that will change
Hey boy
In that evenin time when that sun don't shine
I cut a little wood and make me a fire
Some people might put their gun to their head
But I'll tell ya right now life is better than dead
Hey boy
Hey boy
Hey boy
