Tryin' to get that woman off my mind
Hell, I'm down in Houston
Tryin' to get myself off my mind
I've been workin' hard
And I'm ready for a damn good time
Yeah, I'm down in Houston
And lookin' for a light
And I'm rockin' hard and fast
And I'm always ridin' high
And I'm huntin' all around
Doin' what I can
I pack my loaded gun
Cause I'm a wanted man
And I know how to fuck
And I know how to fight
I love raisin' hell on a Saturday night
So let's party
Let's get tore up and get loud
Let's party
Let's raise some hell in the South
Let's party
Let's get tore up and get loud
Let's party
Let's raise some hell in the South
And we'll break the rules
And do it all night long
Yeah, we'll break the rules
And show 'em how it's done
You might also likeOh, rebel pride, son
I've been strung out in Texas
And clean in Tennessee
And I've had that devil's daughter
Drop me to my knees
And I'm gunnin' all around
Shootin' up the land
And I've done my time in jail
To have an upper hand
And I know how to be country
And I know how to be rock
Hell, I was even busted by ol' Ozzy
When I was smokin' pot
So let's party
Let's get tore up and get loud
Let's party
Let's raise some hell in the South
Let's party
Let's get tore up and get loud
Let's party
Let's raise some hell in the South
And we'll break the rules
And show 'em how it's done
Yeah, we'll break the rules
And do it all night long
Show me how they do it
Down in Houston, boys
REBEL ROCKIN' PRIDE
REBEL ROCKIN' PRIDE
REBEL ROCKIN' PRIDE
REBEL ROCKIN' PRIDE
Double damn, hallelujah
Praise the fuckin' lord
After fourteen years
I'm finally motherfuckin' free!
