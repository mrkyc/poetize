I've been right there flirtin'
With the danger that's headin' my way
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there hurtin'
For a lover that don't like my ways
One day I might be feelin' all right
When I ain't got these blues
That's a-hurtin' my mind
Maybe one day I won't feel cold
But right now I'm carryin' that heavy load
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the danger that's headin' my way
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine
One day I might understand why she don't
Wanna be with a rebel like me
I don't get it, but maybe I'm not
Supposed to be sittin' there in a lover's tree
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the danger that's headin' my way
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the whiskey, misery and pain
One day I might be feelin' all right
When I ain't got these blues
That's a-hurtin' my mind
Maybe one day I won't feel cold
But right now I'm feelin' so damn low
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the danger that's headin' my way
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there hurtin'
For a lover that don't like my ways
Hurtin' for certain
Hurtin' for certain
One day I might try to figure out life
When I ain't got this heart of pain
I don't get it, but that's all right
'Cause I got me another lonely day
Hurtin for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the hard times comin' my way
Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine
Hurtin' for certain
