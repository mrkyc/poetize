I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up the next morning and I grabbed my gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow -
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joint, takin' the pill
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said "Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown"
"You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
Yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my doddered carcass in that county jail
The next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff comin' down the line
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat
He said "Come on you dirty hack, to the district court"
Entered the courtroom, and my trial began
Where I was held by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about
You might also likeIn about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read "In the first degree.."
I hollered "Lordy, Lordy - have mercy on me!"
The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
"Ninety-nine years in the Folsom State Pen"
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen up to me
