The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
And the hard times are trying it's best to win
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
So let's get down loud and show the rebel within'
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
So do yourself a shot and let's start to sin
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
So let's light up a smoke and live hard 'til the end

Yeah I'll do it right and you can do it wrong
Just look out darling 'cause you know I'm cock strong
You can do me right and I'll do you wrong
Look out darling 'cause I'm showing you the rebel within'

I'm drunk (again)
And stoned (again)
Let's fuck (again)
Till dawn (again)
I'm drunk (again)
And stoned (again)
Let's fuck (again)
'Til dawn
You might also like
The more I try to keep on hangin' on
It makes me feel like I've lost everything I've owned
Maybe it was all the hell I raised
Or it might've been the whiskey that I drank for days
Was it cause I don't fit in?
Or maybe it was 'cause I had the Devil as a friend
Hell, I know I never made momma proud
So let's live it up and you can shoot it down again

I'm drunk (again)
And stoned (again)
Let's fuck (again)
Till dawn (again)
I'm drunk (again)
And stoned (again)
Let's fuck
I'm showing you the rebel within (Rebel Within)
Rebel within

The more I try to do right, it just seems wrong
I guess that's the curse of livin' out my songs
Born of bad blood since day number one
Hell, I was worse off than a loaded gun
The life I leaded has always been fast and mean
But I never let the hard times make me weak
The bottle's gettin' lower again again my friend
So let's get down loud and show the rebel within'
And I'll do it right you can do it wrong
Just look out darlin' cause you know I'm cock strong
You can do me right and I'll do you wrong
Look out darlin' 'cause I'm showing you the rebel within'

I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
The rebel within
The rebel within
The rebel within
