And im looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
Well I ain't proud of the things I've done
So I've got to change it now
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
I got an 18 wheeler and a worn out dog
And I ain't got nothing to say to the law
I got 10 more miles and I'm hittin' that county line
And I ain't got no more worries on my mind
Well I'm leavin mississippi
And im looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
Well I ain't proud of the things I've done
So I've got to change it now
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
Well my worn out jeans didn't fit no more
Had long hair on my back
I guess that's not the best 'pearance
To that judge in black
