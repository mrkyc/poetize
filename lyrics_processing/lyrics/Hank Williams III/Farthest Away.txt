How it burns in your mind when there's nothin' left to say
When the closest one is the farthest away
Is there anything I can do to help you wanna change
When the closest one is the farthest away
It'll break down your mind with those lonesome feelin' ways
When the closest one has nothin' left to say
Just keep on truckin' through another broken day
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
When the closest one is the farthest away
How much longer will you take those dark and lonely days
When the closest one is the farthest away
Will there be another chance for us to feel a little change
When the closest one don't look at you the same
Has she forgot the spark that you always used to bring
When the closest one is the farthest away
How it burns in your mind on those tough and lonely days
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
You might also likeWhen the closest one has nothin' left to say
Well, do your best to make her feel wanted every day
When the closest one is hatin' all your ways
Well, let it be and do somethin' to help it go away
When the closest one don't look at you the same
Just try to think about some o' them good lovin' days
When the closest one don't like callin' your name
Remember back when you were once both on the same page
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
When the closest one is the farthest away
How it burns in your mind when there's nothin' left to say
When the closest one is the farthest away
Ol' time will work against you when you start to fade away
When the closest one is the farthest away
Will there be another chance to try to heal our hurtful ways
When the closest one starts lookin' the other way
How it burns in your mind when she says that you're to blame
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
