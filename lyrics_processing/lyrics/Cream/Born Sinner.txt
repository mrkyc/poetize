I'm on the precipice, feeling devilish
Got they heads turning like exorcist
Heads a get severed like terrorist, effortless
Beat end up dead I'm the specialist, bread is a terror
L- Label me weirdo, Mr. Anti-Hero
Yes Cream is a zero degenerate
Never get out of it, slumped in the cloud of his blunts while he's Down in the cup of his medicine
I only smoke on the best
Unholy ghost I am death, baptize a girl without holding my breath
Shit I feel like the only one left

Feel like I'm stung by a killer bee, come by with newer breeds
Best friend to enemies, more head than tempead-ic
So your best bet is let her leave, or she probably gonna leave with me
And if I shoot my shot she probably gonna go
Me and Cream plug like Tommy and ghost
I ain't at the crib then I prolly on roll with ya shorty on hold
And if I shoot my shot she probably gonna go
You was on fire but you probably got cold
Spitting like a young DMX on coke, with your ex on hold, hold that

S-S-Six-One-Seven-Twenty-One guns for my brethren
Come from what is young sons in the cemetery
Felt he had to stash a weapon daddy had a Mac-11
Caught a rap and did a stretch and he came back when I was seven
Thank god for my gang, feel the scars when it raise
The drank help with the pain, made a call it's on the way
My demons keeps haunting me, prophecy keeping the broccoli up in the frontal leaf
Pardon me, they want no part of me
Possibly cause I'm not on your wave ,I'm barely on the beach, I am a loser I have no future
Walking with zombies, I am their ruler
They heard the rumors, we are not human
Xany consumer, show up in Uber's, I told her I came from the dirt
Came over left stains on her shirt, my soda go great with the perk
I don't need no plug I came with the work
Revenge of the introvert, heaven is dead witness his revert
Bass make her kitten purr, we are not similar
Me I just fuck her you live with her guess I'm just sinister
