Baby, I've been waiting, waiting so long for you
Lately, don't even know myself, who I've been turning to
One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed
Never knew that I could love somebody, out of my head this way

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do

You smile, that smile so sweet and I'm completely gone
I surrender, woah oh, you play me just like a song
One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed
Never knew that I could love somebody out of my head this way

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do
You might also like
I don't need money, I don't need anything
I got all I ever needed everytime you say my name
Baby I just can't believe that you're mine
One look and I was gone and tattered, left forever changed
Never knew that I could love somebody out of my head this way

And I can't stop, you're all I ever think of
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Couldn't let go even if I wanted to
No baby I can't sleep, your love's got me by, yes I'm in too deep
Every minute, every hour, I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do
I'm just so crazy about every little thing you do
