It's 1:00am and I'm on my way home
I left there before it came to shouts, just in time to see him spit his apple out
Left your door and made a beeline for my own
I tell you it's alright but I'm thinking fuck you anyway
You blame you for breaking promises, but I blame me for ever believing a word you'd say
I got what I need but it's not with you, and for what I want, I don't have the nerve
So I guess again it comes down to I got what I deserved
And oh, don't be afraid just look around
Go on and say it, it's just a breath with a sound
And oh don't be afraid to fall
When we're on the shoulders of giants after all
You smile as if I had nothing better to do, as if you were one of the chosen few
As if there were nothing cooler than you
Still I know you by touch and I know you by smell
And I know you by ways too vulgar to tell
See, I guess I know you a little too well so that smile is fitting for you
And oh, don't be afraid just look around
Go on and say it, it's just a breath with a sound
And oh don't be afraid to fall
When we're on the shoulders of giants after all
I don't sleep with my politics, I choose not to hate
'Cause I don't wear my heart where my knees separate
It's crotch propaganda, bat for both teams, and it's me not choosing sides standing in between

It's 2:00am and I've found my way home
Well it's giants in slumber but it's sleep that won't stay
It's singing harps that got away
