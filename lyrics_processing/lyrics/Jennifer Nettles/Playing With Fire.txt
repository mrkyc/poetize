Well, I'm tired of being perfect
And I'm bored of being good
And I've done my time, and had my fill
Of acting like I should
I've colored right inside the lines
Now I wanna make a mess
And I don't care if it offends you
Cause I ain't trying to impress

I wanna flirt with my own fear
Wanna dance with my desire
Playing with fire

I wanna walk down every street
In that dress I shouldn't wear
Just to show the whole damn world
Just how little that I care
If I see something that I want
Gonna reach right out and take it
And if this service don't bring smiles
You know I ain't gonna fake it
You might also like
I wanna flirt with my own fear
Wanna dance with my desire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire

I'm choosing door number four
If they're offering me three
I wanna make a choice
That's got nothing to do
With no one else but me
And I'm tried of scripted lines
That have been so well rehearsed
And for just one god damn time
I wanna put my own self first

I wanna flirt with my own fear
Wanna dance with my desire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
You know I just might learn
That I really like to burn
Playing with fire

Here's the way the world sits to me
Good girls rarely make history
Gotta take a risk if you want a story
There's a real fine line
Between content and boring
Break the bar don't just raise it higher
You done the work you get to play with
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
You know I just might learn
That I really like to burn
Playing with fire
You know I just might learn
That I really like to burn
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
