Sometimes I don't like it
But that don't mean I don't love it
Sometimes I get down so low
But that don't mean I can't rise above it
Sometimes it's the vast unknown
As far as I can see
And sometimes it feels like I'm touching everything
And everything is touching me
I've lost people and money
To become the woman I am today
And I'll still be becoming tomorrow
Maybe losin', but still choosin' her anyway

And oh, it's a lot to look at all that I got
It's a lot to see who I am and am not
But I can laugh and I can love and I can dream
And I can do hard things

I look at my baby
I wouldn't trade him for the world
And I've gained joy like I've never known
But lost the lightness when I was a girl
We're told to say that it's better
And it is and it isn't, and I know
That there's little black or white
There's little wrong or right
And mostly it's both
You might also like
And oh, it's a lot to look at all that I got
It's a lot to see who I am and am not
But I can laugh and I can love and I can dream
And I can do hard things

Sometimes I can hold it all
I know where I end and where I start
And sometimes it's all way too heavy
And I weigh more than the sum of all my parts

And oh, it's a lot to look at all that I got
It's a lot to see who I am and am not
But I can laugh and I can love and I can dream
I can win or I can lose, it's all the same
I still dance, and I'll sing in the pain
