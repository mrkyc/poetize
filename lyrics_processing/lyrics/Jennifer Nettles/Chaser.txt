I wanna be the one
Not the one after the one
That breaks your heart
I wanna be the fire
Not the cool
That soothes your tongue
After the spark
Don't wanna be an after thought
Don't wanna be the aftershock
When you've had double shot of her
I wanna be the taste you crave
Not just some call you make
When you're dying of thirst

And I know, I know, I know, I know
That I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Ever learn
And if you go, you go, you go, you go
But I wanna be the one

That makes you burn
And never burn out
Wanna make you burn
All the way down
Are you feeling me now
You might also likeI don't wanna be your chaser, chaser
Standing in line waiting on my turn
I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser
Wanna be the one that makes you burn

I wanna be the name
The only name that's on your lips
When you're alone
I wanna be the first
Not the next one on the list
In your phone
Don't wanna be the old fallback
The one you never did call back
Even though I waited all night long
Straight up or on the rocks
Don't wanna take the edge off
When the drink is too strong

And I know, I know, I know, I know
That I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Ever learn
And if you go, you go, you go, you go
But I wanna be the one
That makes you burn
And never burn out
Wanna make you burn
All the way down
Are you feeling me, feeling me
Burn and never burn out
(I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser)
Never burn out
(Chaser)
Are you feeling me burn
(I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser)
(Chaser)
All the way down
(I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser)
(Chaser)
Are you feeling me now
I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser
Standing in line waiting on my turn
I don't wanna be your chaser, chaser
Wanna be the one that makes you burn

Burn, burn, like an old scotch whiskey
Drink it down slow, pour it all night long
Burn like a heat everytime you kiss me
