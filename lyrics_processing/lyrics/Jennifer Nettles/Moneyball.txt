Don't want to change
Don't wanna play that moneyball
I've been here a long time
I'm here for the long haul
This ain't no text
It's a long distance phone call
It's bigger than you
Oh, bigger than me
Do as you want, now do as I please
We all change with the wind or the bank man sneeze
Mother nature and the market, they make no apologies
It's bigger than you, bigger than me

And the sun shines down on New York City
And the Lord smiles down on us all
And a thousand years will pass
And we'll be memories and food for the grass
And another baby girl will wait down south and answer the call

Come into this world with a will to survive
Facebook emoticon replaces the high five
Seven billion people, turns out the world is a beehive
It's bigger than you, oh bigger than me

If you lose the receipt, you can't make the return
We all earn our keep but can't keep what we earn
It's bigger than you, bigger than me

And the sun shines down on Music City
And the Lord smiles down on us all
And a thousand years will pass
And we'll be memories and food for the grass
And another baby boy will wake up north and answer the call

"You've been Youtubed"
The revolution said to a song
Read it on the radar
Tell you right from wrong
Headed down the rabbit hole, so just sing along
It goes on, on, on, and on

And the Lord smiles down on us all, oh
And a thousand years will pass
And we'll be memories and food for the grass
Watching our futures turn into our past
Hold on tight, if it all goes so fast
