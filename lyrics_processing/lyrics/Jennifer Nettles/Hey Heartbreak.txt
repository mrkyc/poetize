Hey sleeples, my eyes are red
Why don't you get out of my bed
I don't wanna watch the fan no more
And hey crazy, that's enough
I'm sick of tripping on all your stuff
Scattered across my bedroom floor

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you it's not me
Oh you only bring me
Down, down, down, down
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back
Around, round, round, round
Hey heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
(Breaking up with you)
You might also like
Hey laughter, where's your smile
I haven't seen it in a while
And I miss the drunken nights
Hey lonely, won't you leave me alone
If you call me, ain't nobody home
Go find somebody else
Cause I'm going out tonight
Hey

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you it's not me
Oh you only bring me
Down, down, down, down
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back
Around, round, round, round
Hey heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
You, you, you, yeah
Hey heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you, oh

Every little thing that I thought
That I needed cause I don't have
Every little thing that I thought
That I wanted I'm getting back
It's starting again
It's beating again
Every little thing that I thought
That I needed cause I don't have
Every little thing that I thought
That I wanted I'm getting back
It's starting again
It's beating again

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you it's not me
Oh you only bring me
Down, down, down, down
(Oh, you only bring me down)
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back
Around, round, round, round
(Oh, it's coming around)
Hey heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
You, you, you, yeah
Hey heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
Heartbreak I'm breaking
Breaking up with you
You, you, you, yeah
Heartbreak, I'm breaking
(Breaking up with you)
Heartbreak, I'm breaking
Heartbreak, I'm breaking
