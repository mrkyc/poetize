Saw them holding hands
Knew he was a married man
Did she forget the ring on her own finger?
His wife has a baby on the way
Friends all said he had it made
Gave it all up for a huzzy country singer
It's on every dot com, so it must be true
The internet wouldn't lie to you
So sit back and watch the winners lose

Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)

Smile sweet from a magazine
Perfect fit in skinny jeans
Knows damn well the message that she's sending
I heard her secret to a nice size four
Is what goes on behind the bathroom door
But she don't care long as Twitter says she's trending
But the smile's not quite so bright
In the picture that came with the DUI
Watching them fall can really get you high
You might also like
Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
(Know you wanna know)
(Know you wanna know)

When things get tough in Tinsel Town
There's no career that's so far down
That a little sex tape wouldn't turn around

Everybody wants to know everybody's business
Everybody needs a ticket to the show, whoa whoa whoa
Everybody claimed to be an eyewitness
Feel bigger when they're small and act like you're above it all
You wanna know, know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
Know you wanna know (know you wanna know)
