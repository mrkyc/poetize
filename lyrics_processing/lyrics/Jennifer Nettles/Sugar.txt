Sugar
Sugar (Oh)
Sugar (Come on)
Sugar

They like their Domino's, their Sweet'N Low
Their cookie cutter queens
Simple syrup overdose
And the cotton candy dreams
Little pink package you put me in
Servin' it up like saccharine
Always had a bitter taste to me

And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar (Sugar)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they're beggin' for a taste of my cherry pie
But I'm never, never, never, never ever gon' give 'em a piece (Uh-uh)

Mama always told me that it takes a little bit of honey
If you wanna attract yourself a bee
But I kinda like it with a little sting
I'm gonna make 'em buzz when they hear me sing
And they'll swarm around me like I was a queen
You might also like
And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar (Sugar)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they're beggin' for a taste of my cherry pie
But I'm never, never, never, never ever gon' give 'em a piece

Hey, hey (No, never)
Hey, hey (Never)

Don't you go a-changing
'Cause they only like you one way
Oh, but this girl you see
She's just pieces of me
And I'm more than just a type and not your marshmallow frosting
On your Betty Crocker chocolate cake

And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar (Sugar, sugar, woo)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet (Sugar)
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they're beggin' for a taste of my cherry pie
But I'm never, never, never, never ever gon' give 'em a piece
No, I'm never, never, never, never ever gon' give 'em a piece
No, I'm never, never, never, never ever gon' give 'em a piece
(Sugar, sugar)
No, never (No, never)
