Ahh, ahh
Uhh

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need and...
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you need it
Tell me what you want
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you need it

I'll give you everything that you want
Everything that you need, and ask for
I'ma roll play through the back door
Like the task force
I can tell you what I seek
Babe, I got you so weak
Weak in your knees
You can hardly breathe, hardly speak yeah
I was never trying to be politically correct
I'm not preaching
This ain't Church but I want you to invest
In my healing
I'm the Man in Black one flash and you forget
What you believe in
I want a clean slate baby let's start fresh
Like we're in Eden
You might also like
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need and
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you want it
Tell me what you want
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you need it

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need me
Tell me, I'll provide it
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need me
Tell me, I'll provide it

At first, you were just teasing
Even though you gave me a reason
You look real hard for what's perfect
But I'm here to break the news, that's a disservice
You're looking for someone to reel in
The runarounds no relay
I know they love to raise your heart rate
You're the latest version of the update
When you coming back from Kansas State?
I'll never make another mistake again
If we fall off for the moment
Then I'ma find a way to make amends
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need and
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you want it
Tell me what you want
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you need it

You should package, all your un-sayings
Can we manage
If we can't don't nod like you agree
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
I know that, I know that this could be an issue, girl
I want it, I want it I'm only looking at you
I got you, you paint the way for me to pursue

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need and
Tell me you like it, tell me you love it, tell me you want it
(Tell me you want it, baby, tell me you want it, girl, tell me you want it, baby, tell me you want it girl)
Tell me what you want
