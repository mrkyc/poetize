Baby girl do you remember? (woah)
It all started off a one night stand (woah, oh)

And now you're here and it's sincere, baby, baby
Laid up, 'til like three, yeah
Starin' at me, 'cause I know you want the goodie
You might also like
Smoke, vibe, kick up (woah)
Let's hit the world then relax (woah)

You wasn't texting (oh, no)
But I got the message
You, you and I was so (so) expected
Drove an hour just to see me
And I told you that I'm feelin' you
I know you don't believe me
Is it 'cause of who I am?
Or what I do?
Is it 'cause I'm always out? Out with the crew
Or maybe it's 'cause I got options to choose
But I really want you

Smoke, vibe, kick up (woah)
Let's hit the world then relax (woah)
But you know where you're supposed to be
Right here sexin' me
