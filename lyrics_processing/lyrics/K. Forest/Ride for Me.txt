This that time you gotta ride it (woah-woah)
This that time you gotta ride it (uh-uh)
This that time you gotta ride it (for me)
This that time you gotta ride it
Oh you better be, riding (riding), riding
For a G' (riding)
Riding, (riding), riding
For me (are you riding)

Girl you know where I been
When you want it, this moment
I'm not yours, you're not mine
We strong, we got opponents
I know that we all want the same things
I know that we all want the same things
But I hope, for the best, and expect the worst
Just watch, what you say, some words will hurt
I know that we all want the same things
But it's so hard, to change things
Take your frustrations out on me
Bring more aggression baby, to the table
Are you able to?
And I want to, to be, your obsession
Favor for me, and lean to me when you're not strong, shawty

This that time you gotta ride it (woah-woah)
This that time you gotta ride it (uh-uh)
This that time you gotta ride it (for me)
This that time you gotta ride it
Oh you better be, riding (riding), riding
For a G' (riding)
Riding, (riding), riding
For me (are you riding)

It's a late night flex
On a late night drive
You gimme those late nights
Type you wanted ah
But that's no surprise, all the strings attached
Cause I'm Marshawn Lynch, I'll have you running back
Word to Microsoft girl I'm bold like that
Babe I'm ten toes down when I'm by myself
I'm gon' navigate get to your address now
So let me demonstrate what I'm gon' do now
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
You live in a life where you gotta choose, what you want 'cause
They hit it and quit it and then chuck a deuce
Deuces, you be useless
You call me, you call me, you call me tonight
I fly to Dubai then you catching a flight, where am at cause
I don't trust no girl, like I trust you
I don't put no one above you
Riding
Riding (you know I'm always riding)
Riding
Say you better, riding
You better be
Riding you better be, riding
You better be, riding
Riding
Better be, riding
Riding
