Yes
Baby, you left me for dead
How could I ever forget?
Still say you have no regrets leaving me, guess we gon' see what you meant
Baby, you left me for dead
How could I ever forget?
Still say you have no regrets leaving me, guess we gon' see what you meant

Tryna get you to wait up
Didn't think that you would change up
How'd a break turn to a break up?
But I somehow feel it's on me
Sometimes, I get really sick of
Dealing with all the fake love
Never feel like I'm ever good enough
And I always put that on me

So forget me, I'll just go ghost
Forget me, I'll just go ghost
I feel like I'm doing the most
The most, baby

And I might be going crazy, baby, baby, baby, without you
I was caught up in the chaos and lost when I found you
You were all that I needed when it was pouring outside
Said you was ready for rain, was that just a lie?
You might also like
Yes
Baby, you left me for dead
How could I ever forget? Oh
Still say you have no regrets leaving me, guess we gon' see what you meant

Left when I really needed you
Got me thinkin' what I ever seen in you
Hear your name, then I try to clear the room
Shouldn't be like this in the first place
Remember anything you ask for
Came through, never with the back and forth
Tryna tatter your passport
Hoping you would stay off a one way, way
Hoping you would come to me some day, ayy
When I chase too hard, then you run away, ayy
Looks like it's your way or the highway, oh

So forget me, I'll just go ghost
Forget me, I'll just go ghost
'Cause I, I feel like I'm doing the most
