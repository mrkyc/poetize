Girl you want the easy way out
Baby tell me what it's all about
And...

Explain just what you mean
Are you giving up on me
Easier to say, than do
Explain just what you mean
Are you giving up on me
Easier to say, than do

Settle, settle
Since you leave I hit a nerve
You're leaning over, over
On the edge just like a bird
Soaring, soaring
I'm not here to clip your wings
And you're pouring, pouring
Tears of joy down your face
See you turn down, down
You call it quits
You say the love is gone and you won't miss
My presence, and my attendance
But apparently you're wrong, you're wrong
I'ma ease up, won't go too strong but...

You wanna throw in the towel (throw in, throw in, throw in)
You're putting your foot down, no tiptoeing
The signs of an exit (the signs of an exit)
Have the expression, I read it
That was on your face
I can clean up but I can't pretend
That we mix well in bed
I was a helping hand
I lend and tell you the much you're good
Why you say you look tired then come back to me
Girl that sounds so foolish
You're confused I think you need to...

Our connection is broken
Girl I have to be open here
Your body language has spoken to me
It's talking to me
It's talking yeah
Explain just what you mean
Are you giving up on me
Easier to say, than do
Explain just what you mean
Are you giving up on me
