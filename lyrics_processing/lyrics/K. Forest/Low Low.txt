I call her my people, roll dice we play cee lo
Hit that like it's legal, but keep that on the low low
I know she a freak though, but only for me though
When I ride with heat though, keep that on the low low

When I say something, you tell them nothing
Babe you gotta keep it on the low low
Show them the cars that we bluffin'
Watch what you say in the public
I got some people they coming
They will put two in your stomach
Wake up smell the coffee
There's one of me, no copies
I left the bitter taste in your mouth now you (oh, oh) so salty
Don't hit my phone you phoney
Let me be on my lonely
Let me stay on my lonely
Girl I'm trying to stay lowkey

I call her my people, roll dice we play cee lo
Hit that like it's legal, but keep that on the low low
I know she a freak though, but only for me though
When I ride with heat though, keep that on the low low
You might also like
Keep that on the low low, keep that on the low low
Keep that on the low low, keep that on the low low (low, low)

You give your word you better keep it
Don't go back that's treason
There is no forgiveness if you give all of my business so I keep it on the low low
Tilt my head a certain way my face hidden in photos
You ain't seem to glow though
I don't be trusted enough
I don't say anything
When I was 21
I had those savage ways
Always 
Every-everyday
Climbing up the ladder
Tryna avoid the snakes (yeah, yeah)

I call her my people, roll dice we play cee lo
Hit that like it's legal, but keep that on the low low
I know she a freak though, but only for me though
When I ride with heat though, keep that on the low low
