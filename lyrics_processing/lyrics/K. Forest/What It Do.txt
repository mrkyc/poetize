Don't be afraid of the way you feel (No, no, don't be afraid, baby)
I'll make you surrender to my loving, baby (I'm gonna make you surrender)

When I beat it up, I ain't saying nothing
Baby, I'll be cool
Maybe we roll a blunt, like we did back in High School
You say you like my style, I like yours too
I like yours too
I like yours too
Tell me what it do
When we vibin', am I slidin' in?
When I'm vibin'
Tell me what it do, when I'm vibin'
Tell me what it do
Tell me what it do

What you know about K?
What you heard bout me?
Yeah, I can rock your boat
Rock your world, yeah, you'll see
Never lie when I stunt, yeah, I keep it G
I'll keep us so discrete, low-key, low-key
Yeah, you lust, baby
I know the feeling
That have you coming back for more
It's like round 3, I'm tryna up the score
Then we tie it up, like 4 to 4
If we makin' noise, should we close the door?
I'm tryna show you what I got in store
You got that wet-wet, that ocean shore
Girl, I'm on a vibe, girl, I'm on a wave
Love it how you talking dirty
I love it how you misbehaving
Girl, it's just truth I'm stating
Pretty brown eyes, I rate it
Girl, you ain't overrated, they just over-hating
You might also like
What it do, what it do? (Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
What it do, do, baby? (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

When I beat it up, I ain't saying nothing
Baby, I'll be cool
Maybe we roll a blunt, like we did back in High School
You say you like my style, I like yours too
I like yours too
I like yours too
Tell me what it do
When we vibin', am I slidin' in?
When I'm vibin'
Tell me what it do, when I'm vibin'
Tell me what it do
Tell me what it do

What it do? First class, yeah, I flew
To you, baby, to you, baby
To Paris over-seas, your curves are a tease
I sin, baby, I sin, baby
Tell the Lord I sin by kissing on your skin
From your head to your back to your shin
Tell the Lord I sin 'cause I gotta cheat to win you
Bottles of that gin,'cause I need to know what you into
'Cause I've been here, waiting in my car
Thinking 'bout those things that you said you are
She brown-skin from Berlin
Bring a friend for my friend
You on fleek, on 10
You work out to stay thin
What it do, what it do? (Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
