You should tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I keep secrets, I mean it
Let me be your weakness
You should touch me more, touch me more, trust me more
Let's make it easy
Real smooth, real easy

Are you afraid of trust, are you afraid of truth?
Don't be afraid of me
Girl, you have to open up, then air it out
Then let it breath
Girl, I wouldn't talk your name, then backtrack
Then wanna talk it out
Your secret's safe with me
I got the combination, throw away the key

Sometimes when the telephone gets broken
Stories emerge, they change your words
I took an oath, I won't reveal
For the record, my lips are sealed
Same position I play the field
You got a wall, I break the shield
You might also like
You should tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I keep secrets, I mean it
Let me be your weakness
You should touch me more, touch me more, trust me more
Let's make it easy
Real smooth, real easy

6 side girls keep it on the hush
Look around, look around, baby who you trust?
99 problems, all I see is dust
All I'm tryna say is that they ain't one of us
They want the intel, so they try to crack codes
You're an offense player with a defense mould
Inside edition, girl, they try to get close
Be careful who you tell, girl, don't get close

Sometimes when the telephone gets broken
Stories emerge, they change your words
So I took an oath, I won't reveal
For the record, my lips are sealed
Same position I play the field
You got a wall, I break your shield
You should tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I keep secrets, I mean it
Let me be your weakness
You should touch me more, touch me more, trust me more
Let's make it easy
Real smooth, real easy

Oh, oh
Real smooth real easy
Real smooth real easy
Oh
Yeah oh
Oh, oh
