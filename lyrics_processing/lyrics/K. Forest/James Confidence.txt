I can't just pull up on you like that
I gotta drink some first, you know

Yeah
I can't approach you just like that
Give me Jameson, oh yeah
Now I got confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not normally like that
But I need Jameson right now
It give me confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Jameson's my norm
To me it's normal
It goes straight down to my abs
I'm turnin' abnormal
You want to some of me
A brief summary
If I ain't addin' up
Would you accept the total?
Under any weather
All tucked up in storm
Pierce my liver first
With this liquid-thorn
Hell hath no fury
Like a woman's scorned
So I'm gon' tell the truth
And show you what I'm on
I'ma tell you straight
No hints and clues
This ain't no wild chase, it's your choice if we chase the goose
A battle for your mind, let's call a truce
Secret intentions but I'm still gon' want the best for you
Exercise the love, I let my arm stretch
Wanna give you the Earth but the world ain't in my palms yet
So I'm gon' up the reps, I'm gon' up the sets
Do like 3 sets of 10, that's what they recommend
You might also like
Yeah
I can't approach you just like that
Give me Jameson, oh yeah
Now I got confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not normally like that
But I need Jameson right now
It give me confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't approach you just like that
Give me Jameson, oh yeah
Now I got confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not normally like that
But I need Jameson right now
It give me confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not picture perfect but we'd be a perfect image
Crossing borders head on this is a line of scrimmage
We're small peas in a pot and I'm just glad I'm in it
Gave up the race with other girls with you I'm tryna finish
It takes a strong woman, of intellect
To break her barriers of trust and let me into set
And let me intertwine, two souls in search of a gold mine
In need of no co-sign just old ties
Ain't no strings attached, just tell me if you into that
I'm no good at guessing games but I'm good at listening
Give me your number and I'll match it with the Lotto Max
I want real biz see this is tax-free
Hire me to your company I'll do the job
I'll bring that everlasting blaze, I'm a molotov
Cashmere, everything about you is so soft
Got me celebrating, yeah
Yelling "Mazal Tov"
Yeah
I can't approach you just like that
Give me Jameson, oh yeah
Now I got confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not normally like that
But I need Jameson right now
It give me confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't approach you just like that
Give me Jameson, oh yeah
Now I got confidence oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not normally like that
But I need Jameson right now
