All that rain could've come in handy where a series of dangerous wildfires is raging on this morning
The flames are spreading now, and prompting increased evacuation

Have I been on your mind, girl?
Yeah, I need to know
I'm dreamin' 'bout you daily
Wanna keep you close
Have I been on your mind?
'Cause I've kept you by my side
I've held you in my mind
Don't care 'bout so and so
You've always been my vision
From the day, that we caked up
I just can't seem to find
Why you're always on my mind?

I remember those days
When we were cakin' up, talkin' 'bout life
I remember those days
When we were sneakin' out, 'cause your mom's home at 5
Yeah, we started, fighting
Lost what we had
'Cause we stopped, trying
Pissed me off, I ignored your calls, I became defiant
Didn't realize 'til we split
How much, we always relied on each other
And I don't, want another Billie Jean
They just want, fast whips and finer things
I ain't, trippin' off it
I had everything, you didn't take my offer
Are you off the roster?
New phone, who's this?
Now you gotta move ruthless
They all watching like I do
To have another chance to say I do
Are you listening to your friends?
But I ain't trippin' off them
You might also like
Have I been on your mind, girl?
Yeah, I need to know
I'm dreamin' 'bout you daily
Wanna keep you close
Have I been on your mind?
'Cause I've kept you by my side
I've held you in my mind
Don't care 'bout so and so
You've always been my vision
From the day, that we caked up
I just can't seem to find
Why you're always on my mind?

I ain't trippin' off what Mila say
They change your thoughts and make you feel a way
I was looking for the spark
Girl, you were my heart
Real talk, and I mean that
If I hit you up and you ain't hit me back
Only then I'll know if I should lean back
But I'm really trying to make the dream work
Like one on one, but no teamwork
On my mind, yeah, you know the time
Introversion, that Ocean Wave
Whether I'm in a whip
Or I'm on a plane
I'm around the world in like eighty days
I would've let it straight
But I don't chase nuttin'
The names Forest, not Forest Gump
I'ma add up all them factors
Link you up, and I'ma let you know the sum
Just one thing to you
I'ma take a chance with you
No more past talks, I need something new
I just can't stop, thinkin' 'bout you, babe
You're the only thing that's not a haze
So shawty, swing my way
I got a place where we could lay
For as long as we wanna kick it
Wasting time, just overthinking

Have I been on your mind, girl?
Yeah, I need to know
I'm dreamin' 'bout you daily
Wanna keep you close
Have I been on your mind?
'Cause I've kept you by my side
I've held you in my mind
Don't care 'bout so and so
You've always been my vision
From the day, that we caked up
I just can't seem to find
