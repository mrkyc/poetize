Leaving you alone but I had to go (go, go)
I had no intentions of (no)
Leaving you alone but I had to go (baby)

Girl I gotta go, go, go

Yeah
Girl I'm parked outside by the curb of the street (parked on the street)
And the car is turned off and I'm waiting to meet you downstairs
I've been trynna make time baby here's our chance (baby here's our chance)
In the seat babe, we ain't gotta go nowhere
We talk for hours, and get high
Talk till time flies by
Even though, we're eye to eye
Deep down I know we don't see eye to eye (eye to eye, eye to eye)
Deep down I know that it's not fine (not fine, not fine)
But I wanna go, go, go, go but have no, time
Phone's going off
And I know I can't stay
And you wanna know if
If I'ma leave to LA
Baby go to Miami
Baby go to New York
Maybe go to Chicago
And everywhere that you thought

I think silence is better (that's what I think)
I think I get you wetter
You can't go now with the weather
I give yo' body a fever (a fever)
I didn't mean to complicate it
And I'm making you floss one by one
Have you on the floor when I come
I don't wanna know what you got in store
If it's not for me baby
