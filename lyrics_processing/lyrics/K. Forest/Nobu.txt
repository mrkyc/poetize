Girl I want you to see what I see
So I'll take you to Nobu, off the coast to Malibu
Everywhere I go this where you'll be
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu

You're in the hills and I'm in Santa Monica
Meet me halfway then we'll head straight to Malibu
No reservations, we just walked through the restaurant
Link the owner then we're off to the private room
Follow the server wearin' black top to top, yeah
 'cause your heels make sounds on the hardwood
Nobu fancy but we ain't gotta be dressed up
Just enough to get me up to give you hardwood
Later, save that for later
Like we walked up in the building with containers
But first, look at the menu, aye
If I don't guess somethin' soon, aye, I'm gon' have to taste you
Loosen up, baby take shots of the Sake, aye, yeah
Girl come closer, let me feed you Edamame, aye
Too much Sake and we might not reach the party, aye
But that's okay 'cause I still rock with you the long way
You might also like
Girl I want you to see what I see
So I'll take you to Nobu, off the coast to Malibu
Everywhere I go this where you'll be
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu

When you're ready to decide what you want I'll tell the server
In the meantime let's go outside and watch the waves
Lean over the balcony where I can catch a sneak peak
Pull up a hundred girl don't finna grip the waist
But damn let's do this later, baby we ain't even order yet
Hot pepper hors d'oeuvres, DJ put me onto this
So in return I put you on, brace my fingers on your thighs
And during dinner turn you on, I'm gettin' my ish so
 gettin' darker and darker
Spread the soy all over the hot stones
Use my chopsticks to pick up the sushi
I'll feed you baby even though you still grown
I ain't gonna eat too much I'm saving room for
The real meal (yeah), the real deal (yeah)
I ain't gonna eat too much I need the space for
The main course, lowkey you're the main course
Girl I want you to see what I see
So I'll take you to Nobu, of the coast to Malibu
Everywhere I go this where you'll be
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu (take you to Nobu)
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu (take you to Nobu)
Yeah

Nobu, Nobu, Nobu
Take you to Nobu
Nobu, yeah
I meant it when I told you, that I'd take you to Nobu (Nobu, Nobu)
