Yeah I know it's been a hot minute (hot)
I'm at the Brinks, grippin' bags (grip, grip)
Yeah I know it's been a hot minute (hot)
My timin' perfect even when I jet lag
Next time you see me I'ma glean, I'ma glean, I'ma glean, I'ma glean
Next time you see me I'm clean, fresh and clean, fresh and clean, fresh and clean

You 'ready know
You ain't seen me in a minute I been low
Still above the bar but I limbo
Pop up when I'm runnin' you won't know
VVS go "bang-bang" when it glow
Pressure big but you will never see me leak
Mini eclipse and I ain't talkin' no sneak peak
You wasn't there when I was down, you was sleep
I looked above your head, I seen z-z's
Yes I'm doin' fine I have no side kicks
Just me and my shorty got the whole spot lick
Runnin' at my own speed, pacin'
Yeah it's been a minute 'cause I love the isolation
Takin' risk for that bag, yeah I'm on a tight roll
Gotta get right to the Brinks 'cause the bank got close
And it's like  for the bag, I'm like Rob De Niro
'Til I see green in that Goyard I'ma stay low

I'm with the lie
I'm never poppin' out if I don't see no guap
Can't be 'round you boys that like to flock
'Cause I got pookies on my wrist, they seen the blocks
On my ends I'm makin' love, I make it hot
They say "KK tell me why you never close?"
"You got the power but you still movin' ghost"
Ask that bread and I'm gettin' DeJ Loafs
'Cause I'm learnin' from the  turn close
See I'm offline, no tweets (yeah)
Until my bag is still complete (yeah)
See you won't know gavi (nah)
Until I'm way long gone, capishe (huh)
I'm at the Brinks I'm grippin' bags, I withdraw
Stuffin' on some tryna zip up the Goyard
Every dollar counts for something, yeah voila
Next time you see me best believe I'm droppin' jaws
Yeah I know it's been a hot minute (hot)
I'm at the Brinks, grippin' bags (grip, grip)
Yeah I know it's been a hot minute (hot)
My timin' perfect even when I jet lag
