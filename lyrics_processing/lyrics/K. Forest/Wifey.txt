Shawty too bad yeah, I'ma make her Wifey
Shawty too bad yeah, I'ma make her Wifey
Shawty too bad yeah, I'ma make her Wifey
Maker her, I'ma make her Wifey

I wanna have her but I gotta ask her father
The day is coming, saying vows by the altar
We'll be honest and the target is to really keep your promise
If it's way too hard don't bother

You're my Wifey
Wifey
(Say the word we gonna get it on)
Wifey
(Caliente mamacita)
My Wifey
(I'ma find a place to put a ring on, ugh)

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Is our relationship healthy?
It ain't about who's cakin'
It's about having conversations
When we fight and we argue
When you move like you're not you
Girl, we gotta have some patience
We need to work together, for the better girl
Don't tell me you got this
Then go breaking your promise
Girl, I don't judge who you were
We all have vices
You could tell me, like that's nice to know
But I've already been there before
Yeah I know, how the story go
Yeah I know, yeah I know
How the story go

Diamonds dancing on your finger
She didn't really want a singer
But somehow now I'm in the picture
Ain't it funny?
I say my vows
Keep 'em strong till I'm old
Sit back, watch our family grow, into something great
The window to the soul, made me realize that fate was real
You stayed at home, made sure I had my meal
Checked up on me, when I'm feeling ill
Call you over for some Netflix & Chill
You know we getting live, you know we getting real
I'll never forget what you do for me
When I snatched you, I know I hit the lottery
That's validation just to give you all of me
All of me
I wanna have her but I gotta ask her father
They day is coming, saying vows by the altar
We'll be honest and the target is to really keep your promise
If it's way too hard don't bother
