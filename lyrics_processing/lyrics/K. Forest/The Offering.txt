What do you bring
To the table
Better be something I can use
What do you bring
To the table
Better be something I can choose

You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (oh-oh)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)

What I see is what I like
But that don't tell me what you're like
People say that they don't hide
But honestly, that's been a lie
Going through the motions
Discover all the causes
That tend to make us question
There's a chance so destined
Pretty faces always make me interested
But a pretty face won't make me commit
Show me what is there, what is mine
Pay your dues, open your ties
There ain't no turn me off
I catch the curveball
Appearance ain't all
Appearance ain't all, no, no
You might also like
What do you bring
To the table
Better be something I can use
What do you bring
To the table
Better be something I can choose

You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (oh-oh)
You bring it (mhm)
Best have it (mhm)

Your tattoo stories are a pleasure
But that's nothing new
Under the sun
I've gone through all types of weather
From spring to the winter
I will remember what it was like in December
That's when I met her
Same time I ended it
Can't be with no pessimist
Can't have limitations
I got expectations
Babe, I ain't  yeah you not gon' have me waiting
Babe come bring your offering
I want to get that
Whatever you put in, girl, that's what you get back
Babe come bring your offering
I want to get that
