I'ma pull up to your spot, girl
10 pm you off your job, girl
Put it down on me
I'll put it down on you
Yeah, I know you working hard, girl
But they don't notice all the things
That make me appreciate you

But I notice, I notice everything
I feel like you're killing yourself everyday
Just tryna get paid
Need a paradise to get away
My homies ask me if I'm cuffin' it
I say that I feel it, just don't know if she legit
Plus you got over-time, your boss ain't letting up
Call you at 2 am, I don't mean to wake you up
But I need to talk, get some stress of my chest
Just hearing your voice I'm at peace I confess
I never lie to you on purpose
I'm riding for you if you're worth it
I'll find your lane and then I'll merge in
I don't know why I'm so shy up in person
I should probably stop rehearsin'
And be myself, no more curtains
Cause not many know how bad I'm hurtin'
You're the blessing that healed all my curses

Yeah, I know you working hard, girl
But they don't notice all the things
That make me appreciate you

Maybe I'm the one to make you smile
Girl, I seen you when you're a mess
'Cause I was there when you were joyful
But now you're depressed
I need you to lift your spirit up
I need you to keep your head up
And push through, the storm
Too much hate
You were only 5 minutes late to work
Why they going off in the place?
Girl, I can relate
They don't know, they don't know
That you got a lot on your plate
How long has it been since you been to church?
Girl, I'ma pray for you, girl, I'ma pray for you
Before I lay witchu
I will stay witchu
My girl don't tell me no beautiful lies babe, beautiful lies babe
Don't tell me what I wanna hear, girl I need the truth
Ouu, ohh
