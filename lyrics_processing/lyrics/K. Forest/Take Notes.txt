You kept it real low, real low off the grid
Not even your momma knew
Even though, she gave you that thing that you shakin'
You handle business, no strings (yeah)
Only time, things, scared to say
It's when those hunnids in your g-string
Under the night, under the night you count the bash, baby

Dump it all over the floor and spread it
Separate the ones, the five's, the twenties, the fifties and the hunnids, the hunnids
