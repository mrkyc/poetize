Keep you by my side baby
Side, I gotta keep you by my side

I got you there on my two
I got you there on my two
Gotta stay right on my two
Gotta stay right on my two
And watch for bad blood
To keep you by my side
I got you there on my two
I got you there on my two
Gotta stay right on my two
Gotta stay right on my two
And watch for bad blood
To keep you by my side

Girl I'm not holy (no, no)
I see what I want and I'm focused (baby)
I try to stay holy
But its so hard when you wearing a sundress
Girl come ride this pony (yeah yeah)
I'm Ginuwine
I mean I'm genuine
What a gentleman
Think I have been
I let you situate, then settle in
Girl, I got the sauce
I'm chefing, I'm whipping, I cook up the classico
Girl I'm musing
So close all the windows and keep in the antidote
I only side with the real
I'm not dissin' but I need to keep my distance
'Cause I caught a feel
I don't need feelings but your bond is what I'm feeling
I'm very selective
Maybe over protective
Only you, you get my perspective
And I keep it closed
So my enemies are never effective
I got you there on my two...
Gotta stay right on my two...
Watch for bad blood
To keep you by my side (on my)

On my side baby they better respect us
Off the radar girl I know they can't detect us
We've been running for so long they can not catch us
Only thing that's hanging 'round is my necklace
On my two, you on my right, you on my glock yeah
Don't draw attention, keep it cool don't make it hot yeah
Je parle you say I'm cautious, who I'm with yeah
Like the Nicks yeah we tryna' win some chips yeah
And keep you by my side
Kinda like Will does Jada
I've always needed a jada
With a little bit of paper
With a little bit of flavour
I'm not afraid to be dangerous
I skrrt skrrt on that pavement
And run 'em down for that payment
Before they go putt 'em in savings
I'm not here for no runarounds, my energy I gotta save it
That's why I keep you close
So they won't get one up on me
I got you there on my two
I got you there on my two (on my two)
Gotta stay right on my two
Gotta stay right on my two (on my two)
And watch for bad blood
To keep you by my side (on my two)
I got you there on my two
I got you there on my two (on my two)
Gotta stay right on my two
Gotta stay right on my two (on my two)
And watch for bad blood
