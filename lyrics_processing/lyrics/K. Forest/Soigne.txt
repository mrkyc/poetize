Baby I'm still gwanin like it's 02'
H1 Hummer like its 02'
You feel me, feel me
And girl, I felt like it was 02'
Bonnie and Clyde
I felt like Shyne, you my go to
And you got my XL on, I got my headband on
My Sixers jersey made me feel like Iverson
I could cross your way, I could shoot so long
You getting prepped at the beauty shop, Gina's Salon
Ouu she got a body that you wanna see
Ouu she got the stares from the wanna be's
And ouu baby, yeah, they wasn't there for the process
When you turned into goddess
I knew what it was, so I started showing love
Then I hopped out the ride
To show you I'm no scrub on the passenger side

Take it from me when I say
I got taste and them thighs fit your dress so lovely
Girl, I've been far away, far away
And I can't seem to stray my hands off your body

When I pull up to the front of the lobby
Your kisses with black lipstick
I've been touched by an Angel
I'll be careful with my words
'Cause I'll get what I deserve
If you're wearing Lucy's Fur
But I feel like I need her
I'm walking through the fire, baby
All black attire baby, I'm with you
I feel your spirit levitating
We can trade demon's if you feel me baby
I'm cruel baby
What you give is not enough
I need your soul, baby
So I can feel you love
You might also like
Take it from me when I say
I got taste and them thighs fit your dress so lovely
Girl, I've been far away, far away
And I can't seem to stray my hands off your body

I'm checkin' in, I need a key
Condo off of Bay Street
She caramel, she wear Channel
I see that she taste sweet
I'm making moves, there's no time to be lazy
It goes down in your DM's, but none of that gonna phase me
I know that life is crazy
Things like that don't change me
You want respect, I want respect
I treat you like a lady
I may be a dog but
You could never train me
Vida Loca's how I live
You don't need to save me
Sometime's we be warring like we fightin over Gaza
I just wanna chill, she wanna shop up in the plaza
What baffled me was that, the Devil wears Prada
You buy all they product, you got lot's of Prada
You like all the Diamonds, she like being fancy
She wants a pink stone, shipped from Dia Vandy
She need's a stone
Off the coast of Sierra Leone
I got some gifts for when you coming home
Take it from me when I say
I got taste and them thighs fit your dress so lovely
Girl, I've been far away, far away
And I can't seem to stray my hands off your body
Take it from me when I say
I got taste and them thighs fit your dress so lovely
Girl, I've been far away, far away
