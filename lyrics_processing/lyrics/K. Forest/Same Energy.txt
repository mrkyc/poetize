Yeah, yeah ah, yeah-yeah, same energy
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah ah, same energy
Yeah, put in the same energy
Ah babe, yeah, same energy, yeah-yeah
Yeah ah

I remember how you talk and baby, I got memories
So when you come and check in, have that same energy
I remember what you said so, where's that energy
You said you gon' do some things, so where's that energy?
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy

Open up my notifications, like what is this?
Scroll my bar down, I know who this is
It's this shorty from the east end, still sending me clips
I could take a risk, but it's like hit or miss
'Cause the last time that I hit her up, our convo got intense
Told me that she bout it and that she could bring a friend
Confirm that they do things, so like I guess you call 'em fiends
But that was like a week ago, haven't heard from them since
You can't be talking crazy baby, then start acting shy
All this blushing and no action girl, what did you imply?
If you know that you ain't freaky, don't pretend, don't gotta lie
Any statement falsified gets no attention, no reply
You might also like
I don't do show and tell, but I want you to show now
Tell you how to make sure things are parallel
Words are matching actions, actions matching words
Follow through with what you say girl, I know what I heard

I remember how you talk and baby, I got memories
So when you come and check in, have that same energy
I remember what you said so, where's that energy
You said you gon' do some things, so where's that energy?
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy

I was zonin', then she hit me with a hello
Outta nowhere to distract me that's no bueno
Check the time, okay I look down on my bezzles
Might not be kosher, but I really want her Jell-O
I want that energy, so do you need a drink?
Mix me with some Red Bull baby, now you got some wings
Just 'cause you got some wings, that don't mean you be an angel
Bring your freaky side, make sure you leave your halo
Come through my place later, we must discuss
But you insane you sound like you in a rush
But I'm that type that has to see it, to believe
And lips aren't A.T.M's I know that talk is cheap
Before you come here, have that same energy
Before you come here, re-charge those batteries
'Cause I got good memory, good memory
Of what you said, said to me, said, said to me

I remember how you talk and baby, I got memories
So when you come and check in, have that same energy
I remember what you said so, where's that energy
You said you gon' do some things, so where's that energy?
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy (oh yeah)
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy (oh yeah)
Same, same, same, same, energy, energy (oh yeah)
