Don't hate the playa, you should hate the game
I didn't make the rules so hold your complaints
They not aware of our history
So when you search for my name clear the history
Before your man think something's up
I don't wanna have to muscle up
It's not new to me I've been in the scenario
Where I'm not just a friend, I'm not a Mario, oh
It's better when you downplay, the connection that we have
It's better if they speculate, when I pull on your app

I'm that somebody that they say don't worry about, yeah
Playa, playa

Ran into you and your man, I'm gone
I see them cashin' out on you with the Goyard
Girl I need a plan before I pull up (pull up)
I don't wanna have my cover gettin' blown up
Don't worry 'bout me though
It's not like I have my top down, Jeep though
Don't worry 'bout me, oh
I'm just a friend, one of her people
Save my number with the name of your best friend
So when I'm ringin' he gon' think I'm your best friend
Set up a date, you insist we should hang out
No hesitation for invitations you send out
Outside by the park (outside)
We was backseat lovin' (backseat)
And we made Hydraulics
But the car was bumpin'
