And girl you be the reason I'mma try
And you know that I could never lie about how I feel
My heart needs to feel love and affection
Girl you could kill (hold up)
So I want you to use
What I choose, what I use to get by
Girl it's you that I use to get by
'Cause these are the days of our lives
And I'm home for a clue?
Or we moving on too fast
Cause I'm really trying to make this last
These reasons why we clash girl

We should never do things out of spite (yeah, never)
People say we're different but we're alike
I dream of your loving (I stay dreaming, yeah)
We have more in common
So why you keep shoving me away
Take me, carry me away
From my thoughts girl cause I be rolling down memory lane (yeah, where you at)
And if you want this love again (girl I see you)
It comes with pain and no restraints
