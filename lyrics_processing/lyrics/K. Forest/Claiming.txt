I don't belong to nobody, no, no
I don't belong to you baby, no
Especially if you ain't claiming
If you want me you gotta make it known
Make it, make it, make it known
Make it, make it, make it known

Don't worry 'bout who I'm callin'
You want me but he be stallin'
Can you tell me what you waitin' for 'cause the clock is tick-tick-tick-tick, tickin'
Stop playin' you don't want a label
You still wanna be able
To do your thing on the weekend and feel no ways by the evening
And if you want me on the lockdown
You gon' have to claim me baby
Tell everybody, everyone that I'm yours
If you want me to yourself
You gon' have to rep me baby
But until then...

I don't belong to nobody, no, no
I don't belong to you baby, no
Especially if you ain't claiming
If you want me you gotta make it known
Make it, make it, make it known
Make it, make it, make it known

If you want me, want me, want me
If you want me, want me baby
If you need me, need me, need me
Make it known
If you want me, want me, want me
If you need me, need me, need me
If you want me, want me baby
Make it known, yeah
Ma-make it known
Make it
Make it known
Make it known

Started this out by searching for words to say
I know you hate it when I leave you just an okay
I searched for love in all these shallow places
Like a diamond in the rough really not the one to play with
You found me a little tainted and a little faded
But you took a timeout to figure all the words I wasn't sayin'
I know it's hard to possess something when it nearly needs possession
And I pushed you away and I don't know how to deliver a message
And outside everyone's opinions
And how my Instagram portrayed me, to me as a women
You know the real me
And as God laid upon every part of this body
I once gave a man before you every good part of me
And he took away his hand and then threw it back at me
So how am I supposed to give you the best of me
When all I'm left with is the broken parts in me
Afraid to proclaim love because it sounds like profanity
Afraid to claim you because I don't wanna bring damagin'
I tell you that my screws and you just get them loose
I built up a wall and you just climbed above
I throw you a brick and you just start a foundation
You just waitin' for me to claim my greatest possession
And to claim this position
