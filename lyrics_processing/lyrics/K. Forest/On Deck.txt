Shorty, shorty
Keep me out the mix
I ain't missing it

You brought your friends, just badies on deck
They stopped and stared, I don't break my neck
Already had that up already, I done had that up already yeah
Already had that up already, I done had that up already yeah

Walked thru the door, seen a couple dimes
I know what's in the store, but I'm never in the line
My neck's never breaking, I'm just tryna make a statement shorty
I'm gonna say this, keep me off the mix
I've had your type, I ain't missing it
Unless your giving becky
Girl I've seen so much, so much already
Boricua Morena, she a big spender
I've got some questions, you give me answers
But I don't wanna get involved, until I get my problems solved
And I may love it if you call me daddy, but
Means nothing just cause you a badie
Never want a shorty that be flashy
Them type of shorty's never happy
You might also like
Just badies, they stop, I don't break
Already had that up already, I done had that up already yeah
Already had that up already, I done had that up already yeah
Baby, my temptation, all I see is these pretty faces
Girl I could really have you moaning
Stay the night I hit it in the morning
You're probably someone important
But you never gonna have me foaming
Yeah if you only knew, what I really gotta go thru
When she gives me looks and she gives me clues
But I'm holding back when I'm making moves
When I'm bored yeah I'm playing games
Same games that drive you insane, drive you insane baby

You brought your friends, just badies on deck
They stopped and stared, I don't break my neck
Already had that up already, I done had that up already yeah
