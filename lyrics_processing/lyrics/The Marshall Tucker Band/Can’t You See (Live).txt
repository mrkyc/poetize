Gonna take a freight train
Down at the station, Lord
I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain
Jump off, nobody gonna know

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, whoa, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, oh she been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
Gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady, now
Oh a mean ol' woman, Lord
Never told me goodbye

Can't you see, oh can't you see
What that woman, oh she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, whoa she been doin' to me
