Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Watch me! watch me!
The belle of the ball
My heart, my hand
And everything I own
And we are the boys (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
With new shiny shoes (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We've seen 'em all (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And we've chosen you (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Now no one will find your limit
Girls from Roedean (Ooh-ooh)
Girls from Shipley
Girls from Hounslow (Ooh-ooh)
Girls from Whitby
You're a candied queen (Ooh-ooh)
And let me show my darling what that means
Watch me! watch me!
Ooh-ooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hatch me! hatch me!
A girl before
Bouncing round
Behind the bedroom doors
And we are the boys (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Who'll drape you in jewels (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cut off your hair (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And throw out your shoes (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Cause baby
You won't need them where you'll be
Girls astride me
Girls beneath me
Girls before me
Girls between me
You're birthing machines
And let me show my darling what that means
Hatch me! Hatch me!
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And baby
Turns out I'm evil
In all my dreams, girls who'll clothe me
Girls who'll feed me
Girls who want me
Girls who need me
All you pretty things waiting for somebody
