Now I'm all fucked up and I can't stand up
So I better suck it up like a tough guy would

All of this vice we revel in is for love
Sometimes virtue won't get you where you need to get to
Got the spine to carry it
You know the route well so you follow the old path
To a new hell

Nothing will ever fill that hole
No one will bring you what you want
Wasn't born until you came along
What made you?
A virgin killer, No regret
Knew it from the very first time we met
Now I know why you keep me around
Lost souls are never to be found

All of this vice you revel in is for love
Who are you to judge?
Even though we're tough there are holes in us
We try to fill them up
But we're just not big enough
You might also like
Nothing will ever fill that hole
No one will bring you what you want
Wasn't born until you came along
What made you?
A virgin killer, No regret
Knew it from the very first time we met
Now I know why you keep me around
Lost souls are never to be found

Now I'm all fucked up and I can't stand up
So I better suck it up like a tough guy would
Now I'm all fucked up and I can't stand up
So I better suck it up like a tough guy would
Now I'm all fucked up and I can't stand up
So I better suck it up like a tough guy would
Now I'm all fucked up and I can't stand up
So I better suck it up, urgh

Nothing will ever fill that hole
No one will bring you what you want
Wasn't born until you came along
What made you?
A virgin killer, No regret
Knew it from the very first time we met
Now I know why you keep me around
