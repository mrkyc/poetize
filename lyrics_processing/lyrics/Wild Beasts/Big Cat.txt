A big cat, bet you get a lot of that
Went there with no way back
You can look but don't touch
On heat, big cat got a mean streak
No match for this athlete
You can look but don't touch
You can look but don't touch

Big cat on top
Better show me what you've got

Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain
(You can look) Big cat on top
(But don't touch) Better show me what you've got
Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain

Get back, big cat having none of that
Safeword you can't retract
You can look but don't touch
Gratified, big cat got a birthright
Sole survivor of his kind
You can look but don't touch
You might also like
Big cat on top
Better show me what you've got

Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain
(You can look) Big cat on top
(But don't touch) Better show me what you've got
Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain

Take the collar off, baby
Won't be a house cat
Are you okay with that?
It takes a lot of love, baby
To love a big cat
Are you okay with that?
It takes all of me, baby
Being the big cat
But I'm okay with that
I know I ask a lot
Big cat gotta be on top

Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain
(You can look) Big cat on top
(But don't touch) Better show me what you've got
Big cat, top of the food chain
Big cat, top of the food chain
(You can look) You can look
(But don't touch) But don't touch
(You can look) Better show me what you've got
