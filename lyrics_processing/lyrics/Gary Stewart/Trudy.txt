Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas they won't let me out of this jail
If she asks you how I'm fairin' tell her I'm about to lose my mind
Worried about old John Lee Walker and the girl I left behind
John Lee Walker was a car mechanic and hand for cover and mouth for cash
Luckiest man in Dallas County had a gold watch chain and a black moustache
He loved his whiskey and he loved his women drove a big long Cadillac limousine
Kept a big fine fancy townhouse in Dallas and a hotel suite in New Orleans
Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket a .44 hog leg up under his coat
Cut you down in a New York minute if he catch you cheatin' that was all she wrote
So call up Trudy on the telephone send a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas they won't let me out of this jail
If she asks you how I'm fairin' tell her I'm about to lose my mind
Worried about old John Lee Walker and the girl I left behind
I just got to town last Friday evening sure as hell didn't mean to stay
I was on my way back to Louisiana had a powerful thirst and six months pay
I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on D-ville I was flyin' high and feelin' mean
Poured down a bottle and a half of red eye dropped thirty-five dollars in the slot machine
And the boys in the back was dealing seven cards I set down and won me a hundred-ten
I was rakin' in chips like Grant took Richmond till big John Lee come strollin' in
You might also likeHe ripped off the bar like a 707 pretty soon he done won all of my bread
I accused him of cheating he reached for a pistol grabbed a chair and went upside of his head
Then I took off a running like a motorcycle heard the bullets whinin' and sirens wail
But it took half the cops in Dallas County just to put one coon ass boy in jail
So call up Trudy on the telephone send a letter in the mail
