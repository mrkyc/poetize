Tonight I hit the neon bar light
Found the street where we had our very first fight
How can I let this go away
Your lipstick, red like the district
In the back of the car, is what 
I wonder what will become of me

Why is all my life
Caught up in the way she moves
Thinking about the way she moves
Way she moves
Way she
Way she
Way she moves

It's not your fault
That's the way I feel about you
I want to 
See, I can't believe it's over
You call me late
Tell me what you've changed your feeling
You're typical
You're, you're, you're just a pretty little liar, liar, liar
Pretty little liar, liar, liar (x3)
Pretty little liar, liar, liar, liar
Pretty little liar
You might also like
Last call, talking about your alibi
You're down south, undercover with your new lie
I've heard all of this before
Don't speak no more

Why is all my life
Caught up in the way she moves
Thinking about the way she moves
Way she moves
Way she
Way she
Way she moves

It's not your fault
That's the way I feel about you
I want to 
See, I can't believe it's over
You call me late
Tell me what you've changed your feeling
You're typical
You're, you're, you're just a pretty little liar, liar, liar
Pretty little liar, liar, liar (x3)
Pretty little liar, liar, liar, liar
Pretty little liar
I can't believe her but can't leave her when she holds me close
I can't trust her but I love her, I can't let her go
Puts on her makeup, just to cover up the lies she told
Both made mistakes and she's so fake but my heart she stole
I can't believe her but can't leave her when she holds me close
(I can't believe her but can't leave her, oh no)
I can't trust her but I love her, I can't let her go
(I can't trust her)
Puts on her makeup, just to cover up the lies she told
(Yeah)
Both made mistakes and she's so fake but my heart she stole
(Oh, oh)

It's not your fault
That's the way I feel about you
I want to 
See, I can't believe it's over
You call me late
Tell me what you've changed your feeling
You're typical
You're, you're, you're just a pretty little liar, liar, liar
Pretty little liar, liar, liar (x3)
Pretty little liar, liar, liar, liar
