We were driving across the west coast freeway
We packed our bags, we were livin' life our way
Don't know where we're goin', but we don't care
Ain't got any money, we're just livin' blowin' smoke in the air
She's my gypsy, she's so pretty, don't know the city, all I care is that she's with me
Pass me the vodka, you know I gotcha, no one can stop us
Lost in the night, with you by my side, we're feeling alive, like we can do anything
Oh I will survive, with you by my side, we're livin' our life like we can do anything
We can runaway, runaway, ru-ru-runaway
We can runaway, runaway, ru-ru-runaway, runaway
We keep on crusin', fast down the black top, a million girls pushin' riding with me nonstop
Searching for a feeling, one day we will find, don't got any vision cuz your love's got me so blind
She's my gypsy (she's my gypsy), she's so pretty (she's so pretty), don't know the city
All I care is that she's with me (that she's with me)
Pass me the vodka (pass me the vodka), you know I gotcha (you know I gotcha)
No one can stop us (no one can stop us)
Lost in the night, with you by my side, we're feeling alive, like we can do anything
Oh I will survive, with you by my side, we're livin' our life like we can do anything
We can runaway, runaway, ru-ru-runaway
We can runaway, runaway, ru-ru-runaway, runaway
