Y'know what?
I can do better
I can do better than you

You think you're better
B-b-better than me
No, you're not

Not at all
Yeah, you think you're better
B-b-better than me

When I first met you, thought you were a queen
But now that I know you, it all feels make believe
I'm moving on, and not looking back
Did not I believed you when you said our love would last
Like a fake diamond, girl, your always lying
Like a drama queen, girl, your always crying

Not at all the pain you put me through
Another drink, I'm over you
You think you're better
(Yeah)

You think you're better than me
Not at all
Drunk in the night with someone new
Thought I was the only one
But now we're through
I'm starting over and I'm not turning back
Out on the town
Popping bottles, blowing cash

You're crazy all the time
(Yeah, right)
You make me lose my mind

You think you're better

And you get what you give
And you never gave a damn about us
So I have to let you go
You're crazy all the time
You make me lose my mind
And you get what you give
And you never gave a damn about us
So I have to let you go
