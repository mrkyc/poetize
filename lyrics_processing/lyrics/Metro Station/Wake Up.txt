I don't wanna wake up without you now
Even when the sky comes falling down
Let's live forever
Always together
I don't wanna wake up without you now

I remember good times, bad times
Stay up watch the sunrise
Black lights, bad nights
Then dancing through the moonlight

Girl, I'm just saying
This time i'm not playing
It's love that I'm chasing
And it's yours that I want

 we live fast
No cash, live  then you come back
Black out, cash out
You said that we'd never last

Girl, I'm just saying
This time i'm not playing
It's love that I'm chasing
And it's yours that I want
You might also like
I don't wanna wake up without you now
Even when the sky comes falling down
Let's live forever
Always together
I don't wanna wake up without you now
I don't wanna wake up without you now
When your heart's broken and on the ground
I'll pick up the pieces
Always will keep it
I don't wanna wake up without you now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(I don't wanna wake up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Without you now)

So fine, all mine
Perfect with no makeup on
Heartbeats, bed sheets
Make love then we fall asleep

I'm saying I'm changing
The games I'm not playing
This love I'm not faking
And you don't ever
(You're what I want)
Sit , fall down
Kiss me and don't make a sound
Break up, make up
Till your dress falls to the ground

I'm saying I'm changing
The games I'm not playing
This love I'm not faking
And you don't ever

I don't wanna wake up without you now
Even when the sky comes falling down
Let's live forever
Always together
I don't wanna wake up without you now
I don't wanna wake up without you now
When your heart's broken and on the ground
I'll pick up the pieces
Always will keep it
I don't wanna wake up without you now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(I don't wanna wake up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Without you now)
I think of what you said, can't sleep in this bed
Feeling like I'm dead, dreams of you inside my head
I think of what you said, can't sleep in this bed
Feeling like I'm dead, dreams of you inside my head
I think of what you said, can't sleep in this bed
Feeling like I'm dead, dreams of you inside my head
I think of what you said, can't sleep in this bed
Feeling like I'm dead, dreams of you inside my head

I don't wanna wake up without you now
Even when the sky comes falling down
(The sky comes falling down)
Let's live forever
Always together
I don't wanna wake up without you now
(I don't wanna wake up)
I don't wanna wake up without you now
When your heart's broken and on the ground
I'll pick up the pieces
Always will keep it
I don't wanna wake up without you now
(I don't wanna wake up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Don't wanna wake up, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
