You lead me on, step back, I'm feeling lonely lately
We shared a kiss, locked lips, it's so confusing baby
Sips wine, I'm on her mind, she said she loves me maybe
If all's fair in love and war, then what are we fighting for?
If all's fair in love and war, then what are we fighting for?
(We're just friends, just friends) then what are we fighting for?
(We're just friends, just friends) a fight between love and war
In the club, slow dance, take her home I'm wishing
We make love all night, morning comes she's missing
She sobers up, had enough, darkness comes we're kissing
Sick of games, all the same, such a lie we're living
If all's fair in love and war, then what are we fighting for?
If all's fair in love and war, then what are we fighting for?
(We're just friends, just friends) then what are we fighting for?
(We're just friends, just friends) a fight between love and war
(We're just friends, just friends)
If all's fair in love and war, then what are we fighting for?
(We're just friends, just friends)
If all's fair in love and war, a fight between love and war
I thought I was the only one, her love's like a loaded gun
She's deadly, it's crazy, I'm missing her lately, oh
I thought I was the only one, her love's like a loaded gun
She's deadly, it's crazy, I'm missing her lately, oh
I thought I was the only one, her love's like a loaded gun
She's deadly, it's crazy, I'm
