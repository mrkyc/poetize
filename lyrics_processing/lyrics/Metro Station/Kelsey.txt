So take one word, you said
You put it in your bed
You rest your tiny head on your pillow
You wonder where you're going next
You've got your hair pushed to my chest
And now you're hoping that someone will let you in
Well I swear I'll let you in
You know I'll let you in, oh Kelsey, you

So don't let anyone scare you
You know that I'll protect you always
Now, through the thick and thin, until the end
You better watch it, you know you don't cross it
Because, I'm always here for you and I'll be here for you

(I know, I know, I know)
I know how it feels
Believe me, I've been there, and
(I know, I know, I know)
I know what it feels like, tell me, Kelsey

And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey
And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey - oh you, darling

Now it's gonna get harder and it's gonna burn brighter
And it's gonna feel tougher each and every day
So let me say that I love you, you're all I've ever wanted
All I've ever dreamed of to come
And, yes, you did come
I want you so bad, can you feel it too?
You know I'm so, I'm so in love with you
I want you so much, I need you so much
I need your, I need your, your touch

And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey
And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey
And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey
And I'll swim the ocean for you, the ocean for you
Whoa, Kelsey

And you never, ever let me in
And you never, ever let me in
And you never, ever let me in
