To forget they were together
All this time
He was taking her for granted
She wants to see
If there's more
Than he gave
What she's looking for
He calls her up
Trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want
Her out there and alone now
He knows she's movin' it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it
She don't care
Everybody
Put up your hands
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
Feel the beat now
If you've got nothing left
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
Back it up now
You've got a reason to live
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
You might also likeHe was always givin' her attention
Working hard
To find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated
By most suckers hated
That girl was fine
But she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up
She's trippin' on the phone now
Had to get up
He ain't coming home now
He's tryin' to forget her
And that's how she came with him
When he first met her
When they first got together
Everybody
Put up your hands
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
Feel the beat now
If you've got nothing left
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"
Back it up now

I don't wanna be in love"
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say: "I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love"

You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
We break up
It's something that we do now
Everybody's
Got to do it sometime
It's okay
Let it go
Get out there
And find someone
It's too much to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire
Know everything is good here
Stop what you're doin'
You don't wanna ruin
The chance you got to
Find a new one
Everybody
