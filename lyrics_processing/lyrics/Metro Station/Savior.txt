When I met you, said I'd take it slow
Young and wild with nowhere to go
I'm always thinking 'bout you
Are you thinking 'bout me
Where we stop we'll never know

I was, I was smooth-talking at the bar
You were looking like a star
Girl, we could go far
That was the, that was the night you met me
We got drunk off cheap vodka
In the night, no one can stop us

I could tell you were upset
When they turn the music down
When they turn the lights off
When they close the club down
We can dance in the sunrise
She loves the nightlife
Let's just dance the night away
I feel I can save you
And I feel like your savior
And I feel like your savior
And I feel
You might also like
The morning after, I was all alone
Now she's gone and won't pick up the phone
I feel I'm searching in the dark
Let's go back to the start
We live fast but dance so slow

I was, I was smooth-talking at the bar
You were looking like a star
Girl, we could go far
That was the, that was the night you met me
We got drunk off cheap vodka
In the night, no one can stop us

I could tell you were upset
When they turn the music down
When they turn the lights off
When they close the club down
We can dance in the sunrise
She loves the nightlife
Let's just dance the night away
I feel I can save you
And I feel like your savior
And I feel like your savior
And I feel
(Woah)
Let your body just take control
You know music's gonna save your soul
(Save your soul)
I'll forgive you for whatever you do
(Whatever)
You turn the love from me and you
Let's go

I could tell you were upset
When they turn the music down
(Music down)
When they turn the lights off
When they close the club down
We can dance in the sunrise
She loves the nightlife
(We'll go dancing)
Let's just dance the night away
I feel I can save you
And I feel like your savior
And I feel like your savior
