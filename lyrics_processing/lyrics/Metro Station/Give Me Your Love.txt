Girl, won't you take my hand
Songs on the radio
I could pick you up, we could get drunk
We could drive down the coast
You'll always be my Hollywood girl
But I wanna show you the world
We could get high, we could dance slow
Girl, you got a heart of gold

She said, "I need you inside of me
Need you more than the air I breathe"
Girl, just give me one more night

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)

Come on, let me be your man
Just shoot the dice, let's roll
I could step back and you could move forward
My heart's the first thing you stole
You're the type of girl from a dream
Made up from a movie scene
We should hook up then we should lay low
So we can be alone
You might also like
She said, "I need you inside of me
Need you more than the air I breathe"
Girl, just give me one more night

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
We could fly away, suck on champagne
I want your love and not the 
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
I could take away all the pain
I ain't playing no more games
This is all I need forever
I will set you free when we kiss in the rain
This is all I need forever
I will set you free when we kiss in the rain

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
(With the songs on the radio)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
(Ooh)
We could fly away, suck on champagne
I want your love and not the 
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your lo-o-o-o-ove
I could take away all the pain
