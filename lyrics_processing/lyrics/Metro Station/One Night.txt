With you right by my side
Not looking for love in the club
When we start we can get enough
I still remember the time on the clock
At the door was a knock
It was you coming back to me
You told me that we should get lost in the night
We would fight til the sun starts shining
One last time
Just a one night stand
We'll have one more dance
Just for one night, one night
One night, just give me your hand
Let's have our last dance
Just for one night
One last time tonight
With you right by my side
Not looking for love in the club
When we start we can get enough
(We only got one night
We only got
We onyl got one night one night
One got one night) x2
You might also likeI can't remember half of the night
In the darkness we touched
In the club we felt alive
We started kissing so we made out
Her body's my drug but we're not falling in love
It's just a one night stand
We'll have one more dance
Just for one night, one night
One last time, just give me your hand
Let's have our last dance
Just for one night
One last time tonight
With you right by my side
Not looking for love in the club
When we start we can get enough
(We only got one night
We only got
We onyl got one night one night
One got one night) x2
We only got one night
And we won't stop fighting
We only got one night
We'll shine bright like lightning
(I would kill for love
Just just a one night stand
Just just a one night stand) x2
One last time tonight
With you right by my side
Not looking for love in the club
When we start we can get enough
(We only got one night
We only got
We onyl got one night one night
