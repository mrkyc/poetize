It's twenty minutes past four
Cronic we just scored
Now you're on top of me
She gets hot when she gets higher
She ignites the fire
I'm begging, "Don't leave"

As the smoke clears we drift away
Everything's gonna be okay
Because you're right here
I need you right here
As the smoke clears we drift away
Everything's gonna be okay
She won't stop 'till she's faded (Yeah)

Why don't we just spark one up?
Can you feel the high, my lover?
I wish that I could be the smoke in your lungs
Why don't we just roll one up?
I want this forever darling
I want to burn with you
I want to burn with you

I got a ziplock full of Trainwreck
She's my stoner princess
We black out when we sleep
On the road, I'm smoking Swishers
I can't help but miss her
She's my California dream

As the smoke clears we drift away
Everything's gonna be okay
Because you're right here
I need you right here
As the smoke clears we drift away
Everything's gonna be okay
She won't stop 'till she's faded (Yeah)

Why don't we just spark one up?
Can you feel the high, my lover?
I wish that I could be the smoke in your lungs
Why don't we just roll one up?
I want this forever darling
I want to burn with you
I want to burn with you
Spending all our money like it's part of the trip
Smoke it all the way and then we do it again
Once it lifts you up you just can't get enough of it
I want to burn with you
I want to burn with you

She breaks it down, I roll it up
I'm feeling stoned, I think it's love (yeah)
I'm chilling with Mary Jane
I love it when she kills the pain
The high never lasts so spend it fast
So we live like it's our last night (like it's our last night)

Why don't we just spark one up?
Can you feel the high, my lover?
I wish that I could be the smoke in your lungs
Why don't we just roll one up?
I want this forever darling
I want to burn with you
I want to burn with you

Spending all our money like it's part of the trip
Smoke it all the way and then we do it again
Once it lifts you up you just can't get enough of it
I want to burn with you
