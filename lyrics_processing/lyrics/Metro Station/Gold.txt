Ninety miles an hour, rush to your bedroom
Gold, searching for gold
Straight up girl, what happened to the feeling?
Laying on your bed, flying higher than the ceiling
Gold, feeling like gold
It's like I'm always soul searching
Looking for the right person
Chasing fame and money
Feeling sad while it's still sunny
Like what the fuck is wrong with me
I pour myself another drink
The bottom of the bottle
I just pray I'll see tomorrow
Reaching for the stars
Nothing there to hold
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
Turn my back on love
Turn my heart to stone
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
Made of gold
Walked up to your house, feeling like an addict
Dreary for love but killing the bad habits
Gold, searching for gold
My heart got lost in the Hollywood hills
Searching for love, pills and thrills
Gold, feeling like gold
It's like I'm always falling down
Get back up off of the ground
Chasing weed and women
Feeling guilty while I'm sinning
Like what the fuck is wrong with me
I pour myself another drink
The bottom of the bottle
I just pray I'll see tomorrow
Reaching for the stars
Nothing there to hold
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
Turn my back on love
Turn my heart to stone
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
Made of gold
My heart is beating out my chest, you're better than the rest
I think I've lost control, your heart was dripping gold
My heart is beating out my chest, you're better than the rest
I think I've lost control, your heart was dripping gold
Reaching for the stars
Nothing there to hold
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
Dreams are made of gold
Reaching for the stars
Nothing there to hold
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
Turn my back on love
Turn my heart to stone
Don't wake me up now
My dreams are made of gold
My dreams are made of gold
