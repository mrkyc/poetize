She's so, so ready
We've been going steady
She wants to take it to the next step
Red lips, champagne, white dress
We live with no regrets

Spending money, flashing lights
Exchanged rings, bottles pop
She's on my mind non-stop, non-stop

I want a shotgun wedding on a Friday night
Slow dancing with a girl dressed up in white
Say yes, say yes
Baby, wear that dress
Say yes, say yes
Let's get married in Vegas
Blowing all our money like we own the world
Partners in crime, yeah, she's my girl
Say yes, say yes
Baby, wear that dress
Say yes, say yes
Let's get married in Vegas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  (x3)
Let's get married in Vegas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  (x3)
Let's get married in Vegas
You might also like
The party is done
But our night's just begun
She wants to take her clothes off
Real love, hot sex, in bed
Tonight I won't forget

Spending money, flashing lights
Exchanged rings, bottles pop
She's on my mind non-stop, non-stop

I want a shotgun wedding on a Friday night
Slow dancing with a girl dressed up in white
Say yes, say yes, baby, wear that dress
Say yes, say yes, let's get married in Vegas
Blowing all our money like we own the world
Partners in crime, yeah, she's my girl
Say yes, say yes
Baby, wear that dress
Say yes, say yes
Let's get married in Vegas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  (x3)
Let's get married in Vegas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  (x3)
Let's get married in Vegas
I'm so young
But this could last forever, baby
Friends think we're crazy
But we'll be together, baby
I'm so young
But this could last forever baby
(I want a shotgun wedding

I want a shotgun wedding on a Friday night
(Yeah, oh)
Slow dancing with a girl dressed up in white
Say yes, say yes
Baby, wear that dress
