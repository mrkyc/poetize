I can't resist you, want to quit you
But can't get enough
Time is wasting, dreams are fading
And I'm giving up
It's not a secret now the whiskey river's getting deep
Fake friends and vodka, then I lost ya
Now I'm losing sleep
I see the shadow of a girl, but she fading like my smoke
And now she isn't here, and I want to hold her close
She was the sweetest thing I tasted, she said "C'mon lets get wasted"
Said she loved me but she faked it
I can't let her go
Now I'm in too deep, shes on my mind
The clock is running out of time
When it all comes crashing
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
We're going steady, wasn't ready
But I'm hooked on her
That first deal was such a thrill, but now it's all a blur
The whole city knows I'll throw back a fifth a jack
Whiskey and wine is on my mind
And there's no coming back
You might also likeI see the shadow of a girl, but she fading like my smoke
And now she isn't here, and I want to hold her close
She was shining like a diamond, but now this girl's just lying
When she's gone I feel like crying
I can't let her go
Now I'm in too deep, shes on my mind
The clock is running out of time
When it all comes crashing
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
I was thinking back to our very first date
Drinking in the city, staying out really late
I could feel Molly she was running through my veins
On another level were going insane
I was thinking back to our very first date
Drinking in the city, staying out really late
I could feel Molly she was running through my veins
On another level we were going insane
Now I'm in too deep, shes on my mind
The clock is running out of time
When it all comes crashing
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
Devil in disguise, tellin' me your lies
Drowning in this bottle, floatin' in the sky
She's a devil in disguise
She's a devil in disguise
She's a devil in disguise
