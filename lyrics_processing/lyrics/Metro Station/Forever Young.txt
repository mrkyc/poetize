Been a long time since I drank that much
Last night was kind of rough
Visions still blurred, still feeling drunk
Woke up with a strange girl next to me
Still tangled up, touching in her bedsheets
Like that I know her name
Love isn't real cause it's all a game
All I remember was it started with a couple shots
A crowded cover silhouette, remember? I forgot
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Light my cigarette and drink until we see the sun
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Pouring whiskey til you kiss me, you could be the one
I want to be forever young
Bottles that you can get enough
Been six months since I've sobered up
Living fast is all we know
Now I'm seeing double and I'm moving slow
Pull up cause my pockets always full of green
Before I pass out she's all I want to see
Black out, I drift away, wake on the floor do it all the same

A crowded cover silhouette, remember? I forgot
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Light my cigarette and drink until we see the sun
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Pouring whiskey til you kiss me, you could be the one
I want to be forever young
I want to be, I want to be forever young
I want to be forever young
It's funny, it was all on me
But we never really see how far it is
Star driven, start tripping
Fall in too deep and it's all a dream
No regrets, it ain't over yet
Get what you give, take what you get
Oh, we only ever get one chance
Yeah, we only ever get one chance
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Ever young, ever young, I want to be forever young
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Light my cigarette and drink until we see the sun
I want to be, I want to be forever young
Pouring whiskey til you kiss me, you could be the one
I want to be forever young
I want to be, I want to be forever young
