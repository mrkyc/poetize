I was  shy at the beginning of the night
So tired, just searching for some light
She caught my eye, she had my tongue tied
Give me 80 proof then I'll let loose and tell the truth

So I hit it with Jack in the back of the club last night
Now chilling with brandy, Swiss candy
Then you walked by

Give me some liquid courage
I want to feel it pumping through my veins
Give me some liquid courage
Taking shots until we go insane

I was holding her hand as the bar closed down
Was scared and nervous, now we run this town
Just make believe she leaves the club with me
We had twenty drinks, felt like a king, don't wanna sleep

So I hit it with Jack in the back of the club last night
Now chilling with brandy, Swiss candy
Then you walked by

Give me some liquid courage
I want to feel it pumping through my veins
Give me some liquid courage
Taking shots until we go insane
(Yeah, yeah)
Liquid courage
(Yeah)
That liquid courage
Give me some liquid courage
Taking shots until we go insane

I'll take it on the rocks
Give me a shot
She's on my mind
We're sipping on champagne and vodka
All the time
I'll take it on the rocks
Give me a shot
She's on my mind
We're sipping on champagne and vodka
All the time
(Oh, oh)

Give me some liquid courage
I want to feel it pumping through my veins
(All the time, yeah)
Give me some liquid courage
Taking shots until we go insane
(Just one more shot, oh)
Liquid courage
(Yeah)
That liquid courage
Give me some liquid courage
(Oh, just one more shot)
Taking shots until we go insane
