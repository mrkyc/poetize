Whiskey bent and broken
The words that were spoken
They tore me apart
Cause you told the truth
And it got hard to listen
Everyday we're not together
Is a memory we're missing
And we can't live forever
So while we're on this planet...
Can we be together?
Can we be together?
Said you couldn't see yourself
With anybody else
Postcard from Tennessee
Then you sent back a letter
Ever since I left Los Angeles
Things haven't been the same
You're on the West Coast, Hollywood life
I'm booking a red eye ticket tonight
When I get to the door, pull me into your bed
I've been dreaming about this moment forever
Perfume on her letter, always remember
We're never gonna be this young again
We're never gonna be this young again

Your sex was the greatest
Then we got so wasted
And you don't really smoke
You french inhale when I roll it up
Another shotgun to the head
Then we black out in your bed
Wake up then we make love again
And we can't live forever
So while we're on this planet...
Can we be together?
Can we be together?
Said you couldn't see yourself
With anybody else
Postcard from Tennessee
Then you sent back a letter
Ever since I left Los Angeles
Things haven't been the same
You're on the West Coast, Hollywood life
I'm booking a red eye ticket tonight
When I get to the door, pull me into your bed
I've been dreaming about this moment forever
Perfume on her letter, always remember
We're never gonna be this young again
We're never gonna be this young again
I always wanted love to be a mystery
Know she misses kissing me
When my heart's in Tennessee
But she's a city girl
And I'm a rolling stone
I like country bars and bourbon
She's rockin' Chanel and drippin' Gold
Ever since I left LA
I've missed you everyday
You're on the West Coast, Hollywood life
I'm booking a red eye ticket tonight
When I get to the door, pull me into your bed
I've been dreaming about this moment forever
Perfume on her letter, always remember
We're never gonna be this young again
Always remember
We're never gonna be this young again
You're on the West Coast, Hollywood life
I'm booking a red eye ticket tonight
When I get to the door, pull me into your bed
I've been dreaming about this moment forever
Perfume on her letter, always remember
We're never gonna be this young again
