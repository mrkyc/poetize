And all that I know is I've been alone
Girl, I've been waiting for you
It's been two months since you picked up the phone
And girl, I don't know what to do

I had a dream that you came back
But all my dreams just fade to black
Girl, what's your fantasy?
These nightmares, they haunt my sleep
I wasn't there when you needed me
And now it's just killing me
I saw you out in the city
I gotta get you back

I'll give you everything I got
Drive you anywhere you want
We can jump state lines until the cops catch us
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'll keep you by my side
Be my outlaw girl, I need a ride or die
I need a ride or die chick
Don't let this end so tragic
Girl, I'm changing like the weather
I can make it better
I need you here with me
You might also like
Can you give me a chance?
Forgive the lies that I've told?
Since I broke your heart I'm falling apart
If you come back I'll never let you go
Girl, you're the only one for me

I had a dream that you came back
But all my dreams just fade to black
Girl, what's your fantasy?
These nightmares, they haunt my sleep
I wasn't there when you needed me
And now it's just killing me
I saw you out in the city
I gotta get you back

I'll give you everything I got
Drive you anywhere you want
We can jump state lines until the cops catch us
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'll keep you by my side
Be my outlaw girl, I need a ride or die
I need a ride or die chick
Don't let this end so tragic
Girl, I'm changing like the weather
I can make it better
I need you here with me
I don't know where we're going
Our cups overflowing
The smoke I'm still blowing
I gotta get you back
But you're moving too fast
We gotta make this last
So let's look at the past (Oh!)

I'll give you everything I got
Drive you anywhere you want
We can jump state lines until the cops catch us
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'll keep you by my side
Be my outlaw girl, I need a ride or die
I need a ride or die chick
Don't let this end so tragic
Girl, I'm changing like the weather
I can make it better
