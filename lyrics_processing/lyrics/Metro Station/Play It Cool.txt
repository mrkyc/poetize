We're dancing through the disco floor, we drinking till the last call
She said her name was Molly, fell in love soon as you saw me
We killed the bottle, now we're too fucked up
But we won't slow down til the sun comes up
"I think I love you" is what she whispered
"I think I love you" and then I kissed her
It's love at first sight when you walked my way
Girl say you're mine
Give me one night, I want to take it off
You're all that's on my mind (just play it cool)
It's love at first sight, love at first
It's love at first sight, love at first
She wears the latest fashion, we're kissing with a passion
You say your voice is rising so she says that I'm the only one
I'm falling hard from Molly and the way she moves her body
Short black dress and red lipstick
I never thought I'd fall in love so quick
"I think I love you" is what she whispered
"I think I love you" and then I kissed her
It's love at first sight when you walked my way
Girl say you're mine
Give me one night, I want to take it off
You're all that's on my mind (just play it cool)
It's love at first sight, love at first
It's love at first sight, love at first
She's a model from the LA streets
This girl just stole my heart from me
The disco ball we're right beneath
She's a model from the LA streets
This girl just stole my heart from me
The disco ball we're right beneath
It's love at first sight when you walked my way
Girl say you're mine
Give me one night, I want to take it off
You're all that's on my mind
It's love at first sight when you walked my way
Girl say you're mine
Give me one night, I want to take it off
You're all that's on my mind (just play it cool)
It's love at first sight, love at first
