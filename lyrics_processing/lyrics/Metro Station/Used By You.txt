She's talking dirty and she's only 19
Wasn't looking for love till she came up to me
Built like a model, pass the bottle, dance in the street
Wasn't searching for much but her love I want to keep

Turn, turn it up now
She said, "Come in my bed now"
We're in Downtown L.A
I know a place, baby, we need to stay
Turn, turn it up now

I wanna get used by you
Take it off 'cause we're not stopping
Used by you
Turns up for the pills we're popping
All night, I know we can't stop
Damn, she makes my heart drop
I wanna get used by you
I wanna get used

She's on my mind until I fall asleep
When I wake up, she's the one I wanna see
She takes control
Let's rock and roll
She's hard to keep
Wasn't searching for drugs
Found her love
I'm in too deep

Turn, turn it up now
(Oh)
She said, "Come in my bed now"
(Yeah, yeah)
We're in Downtown L.A
I know a place, baby, we need to stay
Turn, turn it up now

I wanna get used by you
(Used by you)
Take it off 'cause we're not stopping
Used by you
(I wanna get used)
Turns up for the pills we're popping
(Yeah)
All night, I know we can't stop
Damn, she makes my heart drop
I wanna get used by you
(I wanna get used)
I wanna get used
(Yeah, oh
I wanna get used)
All night, I know we can't stop
Damn, she makes my heart drop
I wanna get used by you
(I wanna get used)
In the city of angels
She lights the candles
She sets the mood right
Under the moonlight
In the city of angels
(Whoa)
She lights the candles
She sets the mood right
Under the moonlight

I wanna get used by you
(Used by you)
Take it off 'cause we're not stopping
Used by you
Turns up for the pills we're popping
All night, I know we can't stop
Damn, she makes my heart drop
I wanna get used by you
(I wanna get used)
I wanna get used
(Yeah, I wanna)
I wanna get used
(I wanna get used by you)
All night, I know we can't stop
Damn, she makes my heart drop
I wanna get used by you
