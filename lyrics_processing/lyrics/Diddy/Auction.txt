God is all I fear, money machine is all I hear
Where are you? Tearing up the mall, I buy the mall out there
It's the bomb, no fall out gear
No shelter, Helter Skelter, bubble like Alka-Seltzer
Look at me, king, I'll melt ya
Bars and cars give them the scrunchy face
Violate then find out how your lung taste
Got money to bungee, you don't want this hate
Yo, I can throw it down and watch it come back up
You food, but you don't really want this plate
Nah, slow down, Diddy, you're killing them
Pictures on billboards, know them bitches is feeling him
You still blowing up like you helium
Cars like spaceships, niggas thought it was aliens
This is Harlem, niggas that push foreigns
Little homie shoot with the left like James Harden
Excuse me, money, never to beg pardon
Jacuzzi in a Sprinter, models take part in
Tell me where the money is at and I'm departing

Welcome to the auction
We selling flows, riches glow, solid gold
Big chains froze, flashy rings, all you need
What you want nigga, what you see
Nigga, welcome to the auction, we got it all
Soul ball, fortune, fame, riches, cars
Vintage frames, drinks to pour, minks to the floor
Nigga, you already know
You might also like
I'm chosen, something like Beethoven
Comes out golden anytime I compose it
Watch gruesome, chain ferocious
Supercalifragilis-expialidocious
The tub filled with roses
Coming to America money, we Earl Jones it
King Joffery, James Brown, now watch me
Keep going knowing they can't stop me
Wearing 40 belows, the coat's Rocky
Lambo truck same color as broccoli
Acting like Tyson when he was twenty something
Bitch seen the money and came, I call that money cumming
Ask what's a couple of mills, I say twenty something
I'ma keep on moving, I hear the drummer coming
Bright like them Times Square lights the way I bubble something
Nights and ice for the Ruckers, I know the summer's coming
Dyckman, double parked, all the niggas just love the frontin'
I'm like, "Fuck it, nigga, then show 'em something"
Cause I'm shining like I can glow or something
Throwing money in the air, but I don't owe 'em nothing

Welcome to the auction
We selling flows, riches glow, solid gold

Nigga, welcome to the auction, we got it all

Nigga, you already know
Hold up, let me show you how to post up
Let me show you how to do it when you leaning on the 'rossa
Let me show you how you talking
Switch up the way that you walking
You can get it at the auction

All that facade rapping and jaw yapping
Nigga, shut the fuck up and watch God happen
Come rain, sleet, or hail, no sales stop
Crib on the island, gotta sail to the mail box
Still send mails to my homie in the jail spot
Roll a big L, bump Big, and let a shell pop
Bodyguards tail wifey to the nail shop
So you can get popped and she won't drop the Chanel box
Get on my city, nigga, Westside ride, Eastside bang
Sheesh, I came so far, GS Lex to G5 planes
At least I've trained
You say it's crazy good, we not sane
That's the beast I've tamed
These shots came b-y frame for no reason
Somebody gotta be filming this
When you got this much God, somebody gotta be villainous
Somebody gotta be feeling like it's prophecy filling in
We gotta be boss, somebody gotta be middle men
When you do it this big, somebody gotta belittle it
Literally it's like the lottery picked us
And you ain't who you depicted in a lot of these pictures
Welcome to the auction
We selling flows, riches glow, solid gold
Big chains froze, flashy rings, all you need
What you want nigga, what you see
Nigga, welcome to the auction, we got it all
Soul ball, fortune, fame, riches, cars
Vintage frames, drinks to pour, minks to the floor
