Picture me ballin' in the drop top, open skies
In somethin' foreign, soarin', 145
The God is callin' for my body, let my spirit fly
I want it all, uh, no lie
Picture me pourin' poppin' somethin' imported
Pedal floorin', clutch poppin', boppin' to Lauryn
Now picture me fallin'

Never seen, never heard, never happened, never occurred
Now picture me flyin' 10,000 feet above the sea
Poppin' bubbly, you'd love to be me
Now picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage
Picture havin' ice and only wanna speak to God
Picture your dreams bein' shattered and your cream bein' lavished
At the same time, tell me what you think matters
Picture all the money that I've gotten off tours
Now picture me plottin' for more, picture this nigga

Do you like it? (Yeah!)
Wanna do the things that I do
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like in my shoes
Do you need it? (Yeah!)
Wanna see the things that I see
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like to be me
You might also like
Picture me wildin', fiendin', reachin' for tools
Straight flippin', losin' my cool
Now picture me gritty, P. Diddy 'bout to run in your house
The guns with me, put one in your mouth
Now picture me dressed in white linen while your life is endin'
Slightly grinnin', picture that priceless image
Picture me broke as fuck on your block about to open up
Like "Okay nigga, what's up?"

Picture me drivin' a course through your home, bustin' a "U"
Screamin' at the top of my lungs "YOU FUCKIN' WITH WHO?"
Picture me not bein' that hustler dude
Picture the Benz, a 5, and the drop not new
Picture the watch ain't platinum, the rocks not blue
Picture y'all niggas not knowin' how I do
Picture me, better yet picture you
Paintin' a better picture than the one that I drew

Do you like it? (Yeah!)
Wanna do the things that I do
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like in my shoes
Do you need it? (Yeah!)
Wanna see the things that I see
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like to be me
Where do you go from here when you felt you've done it all?
When what used to get you high don't get you high no more
When you got a lot of cars, don't even drive no more
When you're expected to win, they ain't surprised no more

Hold up, stop, wait, reverse the tape
How much money can one nigga make in one place?
How much dough could you hold in one safe?
How many hoes can a nigga really chase?

Where do you go after the applause
After all the Soul Train and Grammy awards, after the tours
After asking these whores what they after me for
Is it the money? The fame? The house, take it all

The sky's the limit, but I ain't done jumpin'
Money is fast, but I ain't done runnin'
Picture me drivin' some wack shit
Picture me foldin' under pressure, picture that shit

Do you like it? (Yeah!)
Wanna do the things that I do
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like in my shoes
Do you need it? (Yeah!)
Wanna see the things that I see
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like to be me
Do you like it? (Yeah!)
Wanna do the things that I do
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
Wanna know what it's like in my shoes
Do you need it? (Yeah!)
Wanna see the things that I see
Tell me, do you want it? (Yeah!)
