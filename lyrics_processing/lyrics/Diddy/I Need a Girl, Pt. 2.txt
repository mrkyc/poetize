Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's gon' make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force, fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life
You might also like
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on, ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime, you'd be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leakin' in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred-foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl, I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you, I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face, baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
