Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Hey, hey, hey
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing (Yeah, yeah)
You don't really wanna stop
Check it out
(Eh-eh) Yeah, come on

Whether you like it hard over live guitars
Anything dropped, if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin', everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop, what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the sixth, seventh and eighth wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Nah (Eh-eh)
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing (Yeah, yeah)
You don't really wanna stop
Eh-eh, eh-eh

When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggas won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil' sis walk away with the dough, y'all niggas still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggas shit on E, what a pity
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why? It's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit' my dimples
Drive a Tahoe wit' plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit' my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggas and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin' you
So who stressin' who? And even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin' it on
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Nah, baby (Eh-eh)
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing (Yeah, yeah)
You don't really wanna stop
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Now you can bump this in your jeep, on and off road
Bump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this 'til you're bein' old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin' on chrome
Yo we don't stall, we ball while you playin 'the wall
We in the middle of the dance flo' gettin' off (Come on)
Got a bunch of hot chicks gettin' live with us
At the end of the night they gon' slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's obvious
To the top now, ride with us, come on
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Nah, baby (Eh-eh)
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing (Yeah, yeah)
You don't really wanna stop
Eh-eh, eh-eh (Come on)

Everything we make is hot
Thought I told you that we never stop
Keep risin' to the top, yeah, yeah
Keep risin' to the top, yeah
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
