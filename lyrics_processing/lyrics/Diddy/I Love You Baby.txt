I'll always be there for you
Yeah
I'll never betray you
Mm, mm, mm
I love you, baby
I love you, baby

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then
Talkin' that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin' joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't nothin' shook (Uh-huh)
About them, I doubt them cats waitin' for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, "Yeah, they from over on Mayfair"
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull the piece out (Yeah)
This bitch over there with them pointin' the chief out (There he go)
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'ma show 'em how Black play (What you want?)
Roll the dice, fuckin' with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true, that be the motto (That's right)
Ran out of ammo and started throwin' bottles (Damn)
Runnin', and I ain't lookin' back for shit
Crooked-ass bitch, Tenai, I get you back for this (I'll get you back)
You might also like
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Uh)
I love you, baby (Come on)
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)

Yo, since the last altercation I been on the street (I'll never betray thee, Uh)
See honey at the club every week and not speak (I love you, baby, What's up bae?)
I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How one of them brothers was locked with babe bro
Used to call my crib with C-Seventy-Four (Yeah)
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours (What's up?), he had the jack
Babe bro told him, "You wanna get money, see Black (See Black)
When you get home," we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money (Aha)
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl (Uh)
You's about to get fucked with no gel (Come on)
I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin' (Yeah)
And plan your extermination, word
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Uh)
I love you, baby (Come on)
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Uh)
I love you, baby (Come on)

It took a while to peep your style, Miss IBM-workin'
Low profile single, house in Staten Island
And Manhattan while them same cats
You sent to get me, boo, is on they way to get you
Fuckin' with you, that small time crack dealin' nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gon' set me up
And get away scot-free without some type of injury?
Nah, kill it, I'ma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, I'ma do it to you
Who knew she was the female Rambo?
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans and
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin'
Not for long, the buck, the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin' I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic
Gotta pause and think about honey, no doubt
And admire how that chick went out, yeah (I love you, baby)
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Uh)
I love you, baby (Come on)
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Uh)
I love you, baby (Come on)
I love you, baby (I love you, baby)
You drive me crazy (I love you, baby)
I'll never betray thee (I love you, baby)
I love you, baby (I love you, baby, come on)
I love you, baby (No, you don't)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
I'll never betray thee (Let's go)

I love you, baby (No, you don't)
