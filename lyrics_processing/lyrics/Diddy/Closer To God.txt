Ooh, ah, woah-ah, I, I, I

I get closer to God when I'm with you
I swear to God, oh-oh, oh-oh, I'm
Closer to God when I'm with you
I, I, I swear
I get closer to God when I'm with you
I swear to God, oh-oh, oh-oh, I
I feel closer to God when I'm with you
I swear, ayy

There's something really special livin' inside of you
Woah, you make it easy in the mind, yo
I can never see my life outside of you
Even though I'm broken, got me feelin' strong
Everything that's spoken doesn't need a song
I only wanna be the one to get along, I
I admire you, naturally I do adore you
With the measure of a woman, I mean to restore you
I love you like a mother loves her only son
I, I, I

Oh, I, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, I
I feel closer to God when I'm with you
I swear

Every time I hear you speak, I feel enough
Even in my dreams, I see our kids and stuff
Even on my hard days, I wanna kiss your scars
I got the same ones on my heart
I'll be ya future baby mama, teacher, lover, friend
While I'm all of the above, you know I can't pretend
I'll be your lioness, I'll post up in your den
I, sing it, bae

Oh, oh, I
Oh-oh, oh, I
I get closer to God when I'm with you
