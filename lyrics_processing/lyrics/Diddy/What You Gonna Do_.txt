It's a Hell up in Harlem, fuck it, another day, another dollar
Wake up, to the barking from the Rottweilers, pull the collars
Make 'em sit for the Godfather, then I holler
To Justin my son, "Run the water"
For the shower, trust fund scholarship sure to give him power
Baby momma call, she pick him up, in about an hour
Now I'm free to go, free to blow, with the calicos
And the navajos, it's just the way this player knows
Anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam
Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?
He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish
What is this? Three niggas dressed in black
Rollies on they wrist, feathers in they hat
One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack
Put my finger on the trigger
Then I asked him, "What you want nigga?"

What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?

I pray to God that I'm dreamin'
I know my family wouldn't take it when the doctor said, "He ain't make it"
Mom Dukes cryin', baby moms full of grief
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street
All because I used to creep with her girlfriend Sharese
She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation
On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uh
That's why niggas wanna twist my shit, flip my wig
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gibbs
Before they draw, niggas threw me to the floor
Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket
They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin' heathens
Love to see a nigga stop breathin'
I heard a voice sing out, "Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?"
Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads
Night Bone

What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision
Watching my life go down, like Christion
Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac milli's
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game
And deuce deuces can't stand the pain
Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard
They just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka
Blowin' bullet holes sizes of door knockers
Three headed for my chest straight, the other two
Came a little late, and just barely missed my face
I'm tryna find a steady place between two cars
One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars
Shit, I'm just tryna live, so I can raise my kid
And own the world, bone all the girlie girls
That's when I finally figured out
That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father
And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions
No more confessions, only suggestions
I think Sam set me up 'cause them bullets squeezed up from the rear
And Sam was the only nigga there
Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum
Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin' 'em
Niggas didn't even get to peep
Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat with the heat
Clips, they feelin' em, to the top, shit ain't sweet
Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead
They fled, and they waved, hot lead
If I aimed up, I'd be on my death bed
Sucker move, for that they don't get no props
Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots
We in the block, no Land posters, just old posters
Of gangsta niggas I see ghosts of gangsta figures
I'm tryna hold my own when they snatched me out the car
Took me in the saloon and said, "Puffy, there you are"
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots
Washin' dishes, I guess we're goin' out like bitches
I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth
Happiness, 'cause me and all my peeps got hurt
That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin
That's when I heard the bustin', yeah, uh-huh
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when it's your turn to go?
What you gon' do when you can't take no mo'?
You gon' cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
