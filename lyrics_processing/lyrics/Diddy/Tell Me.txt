Can you feel me?
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it (Yeah, can you feel me?)
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
I am the dance floor king
Get on the dance floor
Can you feel me?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's play a game
Let's pretend for a second you don't know who I am
And what I do, lets just put it do the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, try to see into your mind
See into your soul, see no limits, to the levels me and you can go
When it's me that is in control
But it's something 'bout you that make me wanna change
I like the way you dance and the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going got me goin' out of my brain
See us going at it, goin in and out of them lanes
I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment, and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
Want you to come up lookin like it's somethin' you wanna
You might also like
Tell me
What you thinkin' about when you got me waiting patiently?
Usually I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's somethin' about you that really got me feelin' weak
And I'm tryna find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the mornin'
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hopin' that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you gonna like it, I like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it, I want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight, come on (You know)
Cause baby you're invited, don't stop (Baby)
I know you gonna like it, I like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it, I want it (Tell me)
But you don't have to fight it (You know)
'Cause baby, you're invited (Yeah)
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Yo', let me talk to you one more time, baby girl
