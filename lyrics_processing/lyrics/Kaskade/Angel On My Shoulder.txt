It's time you see
The love you give
Is killing me
And I want to live
This isn't right
Search your soul for light

So I'm turning left
I told myself
I could be as bad as someone else
But I find it hard
When an angel's on my right

But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand
But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand

Why won't you go
No means no
Your dirty life
Is like a one man show
You're a night attack
You turn the light to black

I told myself
I could be as bad as someone else
But I find it hard
When an angel's on my right

But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand
But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand

Talk to me
Walk with me
Come with me
Beautiful lady
Beautiful lady
Will you come and save me
Come to me (Come back here)
Walk with me (Come back here)

But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand (Come back here)
But you held my hand
And took me right back down to hell
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my hand
Come back here
