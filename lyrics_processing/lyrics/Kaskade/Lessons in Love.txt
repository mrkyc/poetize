When you walk my way
I feel the rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time

I never was too good at following rules nah, nah
I'm better just pretending I was a fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

I feel the push inside of me
That won't let me leave
But what could I say
To make you feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time

I want the same rush over and over and over
Over and over and over

All day, all night

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes

All day, all night

And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
