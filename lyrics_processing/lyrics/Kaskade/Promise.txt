Walked around this empty town
3 am no one around
All the shops are closed and I'm close to passing out
Got a place I oughta be
And someone who's missing me
But my mind, no, my mind can't get out

I know I'm not supposed to say it
I know I'm not supposed to think
But I got it bad, bad, bad
I know I'm not supposed to say it
I know we can't ever be
But I want it bad, bad, bad

Promise when you're with her that you're picturing me
That it's all you can do
That I'm all you can see
Promise when I'm with him that I'm picturing you
And when you're loving her
Promise that you're loving me, too

Promise, oh, promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise, oh, promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise, oh

On the night that we both met
Painted eyes and silhouettes
I said "Hi," you said "Let's go inside instead"
How could something feel so right?
When it met, we had to lie
All I got now is this pounding in my chest

I know I'm not supposed to say it
I know I'm not supposed to think
But I got it bad, bad, bad
I know I'm not supposed to say it
I know we can't ever be
But I want it bad, bad, bad

Promise when you're with her that you're picturing me
That it's all you can do
That I'm all you can see
Promise when I'm with him that I'm picturing you
And when you're loving her
Promise that you're loving me, too

Promise, oh, promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise, oh, promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
Promise that you're loving me, too
