I see it in your eyes
You're seconds from destroying me
I've said my last goodbye
Now someone get me outta here
Can't take another lie
Stop telling me who I should be

'Cause I don't wanna go where you're going
You're telling me I can't change my mind

So I'm cold as stone
The only way I know
To keep my soul
And never let it show
That I don't really know what I'm doing
All I know is I'm crashing down

So let me, let me out
I can't love you anymore
Let me, let me out
I don't love you like before

Let me, let me
I don't love you
Let me, let me
Don't love you like before

Never felt so lonely
There you're standing, next to me
I always feel so empty
When you promise you won't leave
Every time you hold me
I run away so I can breathe

You can't even hear me when I'm screaming
Trying to say you're way out of line

So I'm cold as stone
The only way I know
To keep my soul
And never let it show
I'm cold as stone (cold)

So let me, let me out
I can't love you anymore
Let me, let me out
I don't love you like before
Let me, let me
I don't love you
Let me, let me
Don't love you like before

I was wearing my heart on my sleeve
Before when I used to be down on my knees
It's funny, how clearly I see
I was trying, oh so desperately

So let me, let me out
I can't love you anymore
Let me, let me out
I don't love you like before
So let me, let me out
I can't love you anymore
Let me, let me out
I don't love you like before

Let me, let me
I don't love you
Let me, let me
I don't love you like before
Let me, let me
I don't love you
Let me, let me
