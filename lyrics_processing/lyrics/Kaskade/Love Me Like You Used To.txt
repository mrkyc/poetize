Cut me deep
Talking in my sleep, tossing in these sheets
I can't breathe
Every time you leave, you steal a part of me

I'd never admit to myself I've been thinking about you (About you)
Truth is I don't wanna wake up alone here without you
There were some things that we said that we never can undo
Oh, I tried to (Oh, I tried to), still I try to (Still I try to)

You know I can tell
You don't love me like you used to
You don't love me like you used to
And I can't forget how it felt
When you loved me like you used to
You don't love me like you used to
You don't

You don't, oh, you don't, oh
You don't love me like you used to
You don't
You don't, oh, you don't, oh
You don't love me like you used to
You don't

Broken glass (Broken glass)
Try to fill the cracks from pieces of the past
Can't look back (Look back)
We weren't built to last
We were always meant to crash

I'd never admit to myself I've been thinking about you (About you)
Truth is I don't wanna wake up alone here without you
There were some things that we said that we never can undo
Oh, I tried to (Oh, I tried to), still I try to (Still I try to)

You know I can tell
You don't love me like you used to
You don't love me like you used to
And I can't forget how it felt
When you loved me like you used to
You don't love me like you used to
You don't

You don't, oh, you don't, oh
You don't love me like you used to
You don't
You don't, oh, you don't, oh
You don't love me like you used to
You don't
You don't love me like you used to
