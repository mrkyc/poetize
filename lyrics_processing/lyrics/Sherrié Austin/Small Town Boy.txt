And in a tender voice he said he'd wait for me
Yeah you're dreams are bigger than some red dirt farm
But the grass on the other side ain't always green
Then, I, said good bye, and on those silver wings he let me fly
Well I gave him a kiss but I would not give my heart
To a small town boy
Heaven forbid that I'd ever miss the arms
Of a small town boy
Now the south bound wheels on this gray hound bus
Can't carry me home fast enough
Well I got off track now I gotta win back the love
Of a small town boy
Has he found a warmer touch or a pretty face
Does he lay with her down where the lilacs grow
Oh, those city boys could never take his place
Will I find the humble words to tell him so
Can, I, turn back time
Does a fool deserve the right to change her mind
Well I gave him a kiss but I would not give my heart
To a small town boy
Heaven forbid that I'd ever miss the arms
Of a small town boy

Can't carry me home fast enough
Well I got off track now I gotta win back the love
Of a small town boy
I miss the little things
Like the summer heat, the fire flies
Dancing slow on a starry night
When I was the apple of his eye
Let me still be the apple of his eye
Well I got off track now I gotta win back the love
Well I got off track won't you help me win back the love
Of a small town boy
Small town boy
Small town boy
