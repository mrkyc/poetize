Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug 'o' war
The sleeping child between us, may not make it through the night
I'm fightin' back the tears, as she fights for her life
Well it must be kinda crowded, on the streets of heaven
So tell me, what do you need her for
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever
But right now, I need her so much more
She's much too young, to be on her own, barely just turned seven
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of heaven
Tell me God, do you remember, the wishes that she made
As she blew out the candles, on her last birthday cake
She wants to ride a pony, when she's big enough
She wants to marry her daddy, when she's all grown up
Well it must be kinda crowded, on the streets of heaven
So tell me, what do you need her for
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever
But right now, I need her so much more
She's much too young, to be on her own, barely just turned seven
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of heaven
Lord don't you know, she's my angel, you've got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her, but she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin', but prayin's all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too

So tell me, what do you need her for
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever
But right now, I need her so much more
Lord I know, once you've made up your mind, there's no use in beggin'
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of heaven
