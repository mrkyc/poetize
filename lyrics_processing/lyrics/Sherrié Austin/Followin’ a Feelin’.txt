Burnin' in my chest
I need long cool wet kisses
Who'd want to settle for less
I don't know where it's gonna come from
But there's gotta be more than this
I don't know what path I'll find it on
The only thing I'm sure of is
I'm gonna keep followin' a feelin'
I wanna take that crazy fall
I'm going down each road that calls me
Join the dance, take the chance, risk it all
I've had what I've had
Been there, done that, now I want more
I'm gonna keep followin' a feelin'
'Til I find what I'm looking for
Yeah
Sometimes you gotta lose yourself
Before you find the truth
Sometimes you gotta let go of your dreams
Before they come back to you
There's a healin' in forgiveness
Real power in a touch
Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom
Before you know which way is up
You might also likeI'm gonna keep followin' a feelin'
I wanna take that crazy fall
I'm going down each road that calls me
Join the dance, take the chance, risk it all
I've had what I've had
Been there done that now I want more
I'm gonna keep followin' a feelin'
'Til I find what I'm looking for
Yesterday's behind me
And when tomorrow finds me
I'm gonna be followin' a feelin'
I'm gonna take that crazy fall
I'm going down each road that calls me
Join the dance take the chance risk it all
I've had what I've had
Been there done that now I want more

Till I find what I'm looking for
Followin' a feelin'
Gonna take that crazy fall
Yeah
Followin' a feelin'
'Til I find
What I'm looking for
