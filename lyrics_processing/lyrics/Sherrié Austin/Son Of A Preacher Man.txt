An' when his daddy'd visit, he'd come along
When they gathered around and started talkin'
Oh, that's when Billy'd take me walkin';
Out through the back yard, we'd go walkin'
An' then he'd look into my eyes, Lord knows, to my surprise
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes, he was, he was; oh, yes he was
Ooh
Oh, bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come 'n tell me: "Everything is all right."
He'd kiss and tell me: "Everything is all right."
Can I get away again tonight?
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes, he was, oh, yes he was
You might also likeHow well I remember, the look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time;
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown
And the only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes, he was, he was; oh, yes he was
He was, he was
(The only one who could ever reach me.)
That sweet-talkin' son of a preacherman
(The only boy who could ever teach me.)
He was the son of a preacherman
Oh, (The only one who could ever move me.)
Yes, he was
(The only boy who could ever groove me.)
That sweet-talkin' son of a preacherman
(The only one who could ever reach me.)
Oh, yeah
(The only boy who could ever teach me.)
Mmm, mmm
Yes, he was, he was; oh, he was
