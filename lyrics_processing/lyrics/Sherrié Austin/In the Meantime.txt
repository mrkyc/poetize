Yeah, yeah
Jeannie had big plans
A ballerina Broadway bound
And that '87 Honda was gonna get het out of this town
Caviar for breakfast
A limo waiting every night
White chiffon and black tie
Her name up in the marquee lights
Oh, how her star was gonna shine
Oh, but in the meantime
Make the coffee, read the paper
Late for work, dreams will wait 'till later
Get the bills paid, buy the groceries
No time to stop and smell the roses
Ain't it funny, ain't it fine
How life goes on in the meantime
Bobby had a fast ball
Everyboy talked about
He made it to the minors
Struck a hundred batters out
But something in his elbow
Gave out in the final game
He had an operation
But never threw quite the same
Yeah, he'll be back when his arm is fine
Yeah, but in the meantime

Late for work, dreams will wait 'till later
Get the bills paid, buy the groceries
No time to stop and smell the roses
Ain't it funny, ain't it fine
How life goes on in the meantime
Now Jeannie takes the girls to dance class Wednesday afternoons
And Bobby coaches little league
Junior will be pitching soon
Sometimes at night they laugh about old meant to bes and might have beens
But 6 o'clock comes early and it's time to start the day again
Make the coffee, read the paper
Late for work, freams will wait 'till later
Get the bills paid, buy the groceries
Take time to stop and smell the roses
Ain't it funny, ain't it fine
How life goes on
Ain't it funny, ain't it fine
How life goes on in the meantime
In the meantime
Ooh, in the meantime
Life goes on in the meantime
Ain't it funny
In the meantime
