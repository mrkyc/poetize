Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies

There are bombs standing on the corners of the cities
Waiting to explode at the slightest touch
Baggy shadow street boys stand cocked ready to fire
Their eyes are grenades and the pin is about to be pulled
Boom! The brother went off
Pressure pulled the trigger and the brother became a nigga
And no one could figure out how it happened

Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies

What went wrong? He had a chance
Somebody even loved him
Even told him that he was better than most
But he went off
Chains rattled inside his brain and his sky was filled with clouds
That didn't even bring rain
But just the illusion that something was coming
So he became a gun
That he could hide in a jacket
And make believe he had an erection all the time
He could penetrate anything
His tongue was a curse, his attitude was a bullet
And he'd shoot you down without a second thought
You might also like
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies

So he became G.I. Joe, killing his family, not the enemy
A human gun made and manufactured
In the United Snakes of America
There are bombs standing on the corners of the cities
Waiting to explode at the slightest touch
Baggy shadow street boys
Stand cocked ready to fire
Their eyes are grenades
And the pin is about to be pulled

Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies

They are warriors looking for a rites of passage
They are young lions enchanted by the sound of their roar
They are diamonds treated like worthless stones
They are rivers with nowhere to run
They are dreams unfulfilled
Desires buried in the remains of an abandoned soul
They are the beauty of spring
Blinded by the snowstorms of winter
Soon they will see their beauty, their strength, their love
And like the rivers flow into sea
They will unite as one
Then our voice will be more powerful than a gun
And as we speak, we'll get things done
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies
Grenades in their eyes and death is their prize
Peace will arise and destroy the lies
