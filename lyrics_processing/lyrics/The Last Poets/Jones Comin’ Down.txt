Got the shakes
Nose running
Joint dripping
Mind slipping
Body aches
Jones coming down
Got an attitude
Fighting mad
Feeling bad
Funeral sad
Another 24 hour drag
Damn, I needs me some scag
Pawn my brother's doo-rag
To cop me a transparent thin bag
You see, you see, 'cause I'm strung out, strung out on a white witch
My timeless bitch
Riding a white horse into my main vein
Damn baby, got to kill this pain
But I'm gon' get slick
And get my woman to pull a trick
She don't care
She's on welfare
Going to steal her check
And cop me a deck
And deal me some stuff
When the going gets rough
Where's my wine?
I've got to ease my mind
Is that the kid I hear crying?
Shut up, kid
You want the super to call the man
And have me pull another bid?
So what if you're hungry?
Shit, my jones is down on me
I ain't your old man
I don't know where the dude is
If he knows what I knows he's out getting his
Damn, this pain is getting worse
Let me see how much dough this ho got in her purse
Well now, six dollars will cop me two small trays
And that's enough to take my gorilla jones away
Now let me see what's happening on the corner today
Aye, there's my man
Brother sweet stuff Sam
Aye Sam, can I get a play
On a double tray
So I can take off and lay
Okay woman, get up out of bed
You heard what I said
I'ma tie the rope around my arm and heat the cooker
And I want you to get your ass out on the corner and play hooker
Wow, I can feel it now
This stuff is boss
I see that ho on that horse
Hey baby, wait for me
Cause I'm gon' be free!
Free! Free! Free! Free!
