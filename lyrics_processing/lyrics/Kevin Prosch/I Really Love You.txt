Lead me not to temptation
Oh, but deliver me from evil
I shall not want
I shall not want
You who lead me beside the still waters
And there You restore my broken, broken, broken soul
God
My broken soul
And the path to You was never easy, God
Seems the struggles have been there all my life
But I finally found the One worth living for
I wanna tell You tonight

That I really love You
I really want, I want You, God
And I really love You
And I really want, I want You
Just You
You
So true

It's a cry I've had all my life
To be loved by someone
And for once, maybe just once
To do something right
Sometimes it seems it's all I can do
To just keep my head above the surface
The shame weighs me down
It's so, so deep sometimes
And my weakness
Always seems to bring me down
But look at You
Here You are again
Talking to me
Walking with me
You never let me down
But God
This place, this place that we have together
Is almost like a, a fairytale
But it's so real now
You're becoming so real, I can
Feel You in my bones, God
You might also like
Yeah, I really, I really love You, God
I, I want You more
I want the world
I want the world to see what You've done for me
I really love, how I love You, God
I, oh, I want You now
Come to me, God
Come to me, God, yeah

Would You walk into the room now?
Hey, would You walk into the room, God?
Would You walk into my life?
Change everything, change everything, change everything
 nobody can make me feel the way that You do
Lover of my soul, lover of my soul
Look at me now, God
Nobody can make me feel the way that You do
O Lover, Lover, Lover of my soul
Would You walk into the room tonight?
Would You walk into the room tonight, God?
Would You walk into the, walk into the, walk into the room, Lord, yeah?

I really love, really, really, really love You, God
You're the one
You're the one
I really want You
I want You, God
Come to me
Come to me
Arrest my soul
