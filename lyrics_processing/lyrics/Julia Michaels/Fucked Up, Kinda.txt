I want that fucked up kinda love
Where I can't go out with the opposite sex
'Cause I always get those angry texts, like damn (Hmm)
I want that fucked up kinda love
Where you get mad at me for something you did
You know you're wrong, but you never admit it, like damn
Ayy, I want that fucked up kinda love
Get drunk, bring the past back up
Then I chase you down the block trying to apologize
For what?

I know I shouldn't want it, but I do
All of my friends say I probably shouldn't be with you
You know, you know I want you more
The more you put me through
I guess I fucked up, kinda

'Cause I want that fucked up kinda love
Where I'm scared you're gonna ask for space
And space is gonna lead to a break, like damn (Ah)
Mmm, you're pickin' fights in front of my momma
'Cause you like drama, 'cause I like it, too
'Cause I chase you down the block trying to apologize
For what?

Oh, I fucked up, kinda
Yeah, I want that fucked up kinda love and so do you

Baby, I learned from watching you and your problems
Learned it so good
Now you chase me down the block, trying to apologize
For what?

I know I shouldn't want it, but I do
All of my friends say I probably shouldn't be with you
You know, you know I want you more
The more you put me through
I guess I fucked up, kinda
'Cause I want that fucked up kinda love
Oh, I fucked up, kinda
