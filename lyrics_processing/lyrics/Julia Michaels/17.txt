I had a dream we were riding in a drop top down the block
Taking our time doing whatever we want
You put your hand on top of my hand
And just like Grease, we were summer loving
Had our first kiss and we hit the ground running, ah
You put your hand on top of my hand

No dark side for us
No fights just because
No silence that kills, ah
No, no sleepless nights
Oh, just you and I
I love how love feels

So can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Making love and getting high, you and me
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?

Where we keep goin' nonstop down the block
Sneaking our way into every single club
And I have one too many I think
And this thing we have, we didn't know what was it
We didn't know we could get messed up from it
And all we really wanted was
You might also like
Ah-ha, babe
No sleepless nights
Oh, just you and I
I miss how that feels

So can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Making love and getting high, you and me
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?

Pin you down, kiss me now
We can go in for another round
Pin you down, come kiss me now
Pin you down, kiss me now
We can go in for another round
Pin you down, come kiss me now

I had a dream that we danced at a crosswalk, down the block
Didn't even care that we made the traffic stop
You put your hand on top of my hand

So can we stay in this dream like we are 17? (Can we stay?)
Making love and getting high, you and me (Can we, baby?)
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
(Where we never get, oh)
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Pin you down, kiss me now
We can go in for another round (We can go in, babe)
Pin you down, come kiss me now (Pin you down right now)
Pin you down, kiss me now
We can go in for another round
