You set the highest bar, the holy mecca
You were smart, you were strong
You were sweet, the whole trifecta
You went and lead me on, and I let ya
'Til I realized it was time to forget ya, yeah

I was all about you
Now you're all about somebody else
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Up all night without you
But I'm not up by myself

Oh, look at me now
Watch me wrap 'round
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now
Bet you're pissed how you're seeing me out
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now

Bet she can't tie a cherry stem with her tongue
Bet that after just one shot, she gets drunk
All your boys talk shit, say she's no fun (She's no fun)
Are you second-guessing yet?
Have I won all these bets? Oh
You might also like
I was all about you
Now you're all about somebody else
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Up all night without you
But I'm not up by myself

Oh, look at me now (Now)
Watch me wrap 'round
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now
Bet you're pissed how you're seeing me out
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now

Leave it to me to put you in your place
A dose of your own medicine, how's that taste?
Oh, look at me now
Watch me wrap 'round (Watch me)
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now

I was all about you
Now you're all about somebody else
Yeah, yeah
Up all night without you
But I'm not up by myself
Oh, look at me now
Watch me wrap 'round (Watch me)
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now (Watch me wrap 'round)
Bet you're pissed how you're seeing me out
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now (Somebody else)

Leave it to me to put you in your place (Leave it to me, yeah)
A dose of your own medicine, how's that taste? (How's that taste?)
Oh, look at me now
Watch me wrap 'round (Watch me)
Watch me wrap 'round somebody else now
