Don't care what's on the TV
Kiss on kiss, kiss me, baby
Feels so good, love this feeling
Then you turn away and say I'm being
Insecure and way too needy
Guess you think that you're easy
Well, fuck you, I'm leaving

I flip out on the small things
And you flip out 'cause I'm flipping out
And you're so scared you'll say the wrong things
So you lay low and you shut your mouth
And I, I get angry and I hate it when you hate me
I get angry and I hate it

I know I always break your heart
Every time we end up in a mess, I just take it too far
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
In the moment, I meant it, mmm, but I shouldn't have said it
See that you're guilty, too
But you handle things so fuckin' passive aggressively
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
In the moment, I meant it, yeah, but I shouldn't have said it
You might also like
Wait, how am I apologizing
For something that you started?
Know I overreacted, and I'll apologize for that

But I flip out on the small things
And you flip out 'cause I'm flipping out
And you're so scared you'll say the wrong things
So you lay low and you shut your mouth
It's a product of how I was raised
And I'm so scared that I'll never change
Yeah, I'm so scared that I'll never change

I know I always break your heart
Every time we end up in a mess, I just take it too far
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
In the moment, I meant it, mmm, but I shouldn't have said it
See that you're guilty, too
But you handle things so fuckin' passive aggressively
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
In the moment, I meant it, yeah, but I shouldn't have said it

Hey, but I shouldn't have said it, yeah
But I shouldn't have said it
But I shouldn't have said it and now I regret it
I know I always break your heart
Every time we end up in a mess, I just take it too far
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
In the moment, I meant it, mmm, but I shouldn't have said it
See that you're guilty, too
But you handle things so fuckin' passive aggressively
I know, I know, I know, I know I should say sorry
