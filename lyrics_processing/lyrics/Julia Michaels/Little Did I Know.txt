The summer before you
I thought love was Shakespearean
More or less a painful experience
Only ever real if you're delirious
The summer before you
I let it take up very little oxygen
Not where I'd rest my head, more like a ottoman
Never had someone like you to treat me like Solomon

But little did I know
You would be the one I'd confide in
Learn how to try with
Little did I know
It was you before I ever decided

Oh-oh-oh, little did I know
Oh-oh-oh, little did I know

The summer before you
You can't spell "drama" without consonance
And I admit, I usually was the cause of it
Now here we are, you've got me changing all of it
Slow me down, I want you to
It's different when it comes to you
Hey, yeah
You might also like
But little did I know
You would be the one I'd confide in
Learn how to try with
Little did I know
It was you before I ever decided
Yeah, little did I know
You would be the one that would save me
Learn how to change me
Little did I know
Oh-oh-oh, just look at you, can you blame me?

Oh-oh-oh, little did I know
Oh-oh-oh, little did I know

The summer before you
I thought love was Shakespearean
More or less a painful experience
Only ever real if you're delirious

But little did I know
You would be the one I'd confide in
Learn how to try with
Little did I know
It was you before I ever decided
Yeah, little did I know
You would be the one that would save me
Learn how to change me
Little did I know
Oh-oh-oh, just look at you, can you blame me?
Oh-oh-oh, little (Yeah) did I know (Did I know)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh), little did I know (Did I know)
Oh-oh-oh, little did I know that it could feel like this (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, little, every time I got you on my lips (Hey)
