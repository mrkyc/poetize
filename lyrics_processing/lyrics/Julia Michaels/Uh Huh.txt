It's electric how my lipstick
Makes its own way right into your kiss, and
It's pathetic how we both get
Kinda fucked up, hanging on each other
We're ahead now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

Uh-huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'
We're in deep now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

Uh-huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill

It's rare when the panic in my mind
Feels so damn good
Woo

Uh-huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill
