Bring out the worst in me 'cause it's all you see
But you always make my heart go, make my heart go
You found what I buried deep and you set it free
But you always make my heart go, make my heart go

I felt your skin on mine and my lungs filled like an ocean
'Cause you still take my breath away

You always know what to say to turn it around
And if you wanted to, you could be the one to turn me down
And you figured out ways to hear it pound
I'm so effected by you, yeah, and I know that now

You always make my heart go, make my heart go
You always make my heart go, heart go

Know how to bring me to my knees 'cause you make me weak
But you always make my heart go, make my heart go
You made yourself my everything, can you let me be?
So that I can let my heart slow, make my heart slow
You might also like
I felt your skin on mine and my lungs filled like an ocean
'Cause you still take my breath away

You always know what to say to turn it around
And if you wanted to, you could be the one to turn me down
And you figured out ways to hear it pound
I'm so effected by you, yeah, and I know that now

You always make my heart go, make my heart go
You always make my heart go, heart go
You always make my heart go, make my heart go
You always make my heart go, heart go

Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
But trust me you're the only one
Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
But trust me you're the only one
Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
You're the only one

You always know what to say to turn it around
And if you wanted to, you could be the one to turn me down
And you figured out ways to hear it pound
I'm so effected by you, yeah, and I know that now
You always make my heart go, make my heart go
You always make my heart go, heart go
You always make my heart go, make my heart go
