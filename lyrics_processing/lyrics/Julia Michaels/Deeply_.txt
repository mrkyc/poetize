What's wrong?
You haven't been you in a while
I know that you know I'm knowin' too (?)
I miss the things we used to do
Come on, get up and dance like we did
Before the Hell that got hold of you (?)
I miss the things we used to do

Like, cuddle on a Sunday
Make love til Monday
Fight on a Tuesday
Hold on for two days
Scream in the worst way on Thursday
Fall back in love on a Friday
Now it gets hard to see you this vulnerable
So now more than ever, you need to know

I would do anything for you
Don't even have to ask me
I would walk to the end for you
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply, oh
And if you needed me right there
Scream my name from a distance
No, I'm not going nowhere
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply
You might also like
Baby, I'm here, come tell me if you're fine
A touch on the skin if you really want
A laugh that can make life less exciting
You said "I feel down"
And you're perfect, I don't say it enough
But I love the unknown
And if I say it enough, can we

Cuddle up a Sunday
Make love til Monday
Fight on a Tuesday
Hold on for two days
Scream in the worst way on Thursday
Fall back in love on a Friday
Now it gets hard to see you this vulnerable
So now more than ever, you need to know

I would do anything for you
Don't even have to ask me
I would walk to the end for you
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply, oh
And if you needed me right there
Scream my name from a distance
No, I'm not goin' nowhere
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply
Yeah, I would do anything for you
Don't even have to ask me
I would walk to the end for you
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply
And if you needed me right there
Scream my name from a distance
No, I'm not going nowhere
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
