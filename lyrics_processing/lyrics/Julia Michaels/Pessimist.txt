Plantin' lemon trees since I was twenty-three
Watchin', waitin' for it to grow but still, it tasted bittersweet
No matter what I did
No matter what I did
I was hot-headed to the ninth degree
Punch and pushed by anything I thought would make a mess of me
That's just what I did
That's just what I did

Made me die, made me melt
You've changed the way I felt
With your touch, with your help
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else

You're all I see in my mind
I think I see a lifetime
Done holding on to myself
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else
Painlessly caught in your eyes
I think I see a lifetime
Done holding on to myself
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else
You might also like
You made me believe that she ain't no make-believe
I'll stop checking horoscopes to cope with all my misery
That's just what you did
That's just what you did, yeah

Made me die, made me melt
You've changed the way I felt
With your touch, with your help
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else

You're all I see in my mind (In my mind)
I think I see a lifetime (A lifetime)
Done holding on to myself (To myself)
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else
Painlessly caught in your eyes (In your eyes)
I think I see a lifetime (A lifetime)
Done holding on to myself (To myself)
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else

Made me die, made me melt
You've changed the way I felt
With your touch, with your help
You showed me what it means to fall in deep like no one else
You're all I see in my mind (In my mind)
I think I see a lifetime (A lifetime)
Done holding on to myself (To myself)
You took a pessimist and turned me into something else
Painlessly caught in your eyes (In your eyes)
I think I see a lifetime (A lifetime)
Done holding on to myself (To myself)
