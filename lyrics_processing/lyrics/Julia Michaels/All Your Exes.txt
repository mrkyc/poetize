Hmm

I know where you've been, what you've done
Who you loved is a part of who you are
But that maturity ship sails when I hold you in my arms
There's a spot on your chest just for me
That's personally addressed
And anyone there before me
Should be a criminal offense

When your friends tell stories about 2017
I know there's parts that they leave out to be considerate of me
Wish I could be blissfully unaware
Of where you used to put your mouth
And who you write your fucking songs about

I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
I wanna kill all the memories that you save in your head
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for
The only girl that's ever been in your bed
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
You might also like
Please don't tell me if I accidentally stumble
Into something that reminds you of her
No, I don't need your previous logistics
Where you spent your last Christmas
Spare your past-life specifics, oh

And when your friends tell stories about 2023
I hope they hardly can recall there was a you without a me
Wish I could be blissfully unaware
Of the history in your couch
And who your songs all used to be about

I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
I wanna kill all the memories that you save in your head
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for
The only girl that's ever been in your bed
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead (Mmm)

Don't tell me to make nice, that I should try to empathize
I'm confident I've got them accurately demonized
You tell me not to worry, I'm the only thing you see
Well, yeah, I fucking better be
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead (All your exes)
I wanna kill all the memories that you saved in your head (Oh)
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for
The only girl that's ever been in your bed
