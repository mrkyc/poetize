Yeah, ah, oh, mmm

It's a sad day when your papa sees you cry
Over yet another guy, add another tally line
That's about five that he can beat down
If he sees 'em in the street now (Eh)
And it's a sad day when you start to realize
That you got a certain type, ain't avoiding what you like
I could sniff mine out in a line-up
And take 'em home with me, I might just

I want, I want, I wanna love me right
Don't want you on my mind
Hoping for change (I do, yeah)
I want, I want, I wanna love me right
Not getting sleep at night
Hoping for change (Ah)

'Cause I like (Uh)
Guys with big lips that treat me like shit
That only want my hips when it's convenient for them
People I can fix that leave when they're good again
I keep falling for boys and mistaking 'em for men
Mistaking 'em (I like them)
Mistaking 'em (I like them)
I keep mistaking 'em for men

The ones with the girlfriend
Obsessively texting, saying "I love you"
Heard from Vanessa, they're getting married (Mmm)
Shit out here is getting scary (Woo)
Afraid of commitment, super unstable
They're lovely now, just wait 'til later
Dyeing their hair blue (Mmm)
Shit out here is getting scary (Woo)

But I want, I want, I wanna love me right (I wanna)
Don't want you on my mind (I don't)
Hoping for change (Ah)
I want, I want, I wanna love me right (Yeah)
Not getting sleep at night (No, I'm not, no, I'm not)
Hoping for change

'Cause I like (Eh)
Guys with big lips that treat me like shit
That only want my hips when it's convenient for them (I like 'em)
People I can fix that leave when they're good again
I keep falling for boys and mistaking 'em for men
Mistaking 'em (I like them)
Mistaking 'em (I like them)
I keep mistaking 'em for men (Ah)
It's a sad day when your papa sees you cry
