Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
I guess that I should probably write one 'cause
I'm feelin' pretty lonely
He's the only thing that holds me right now
Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
I guess if I'm not wrapped here in your arms then
I can't talk about love
And who wants to talk about love?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't want us
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Well, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad
And I'd show up at your house
All screamin' at your door
Sayin', "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love
No, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now
You might also like
Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
Fuck it, here it comes, a
Heartbreak is annoying
And I'll feel it in the morning
Swallow it down like a bitter pill
At least it'll taste better than this feeling will
And I don't like myself when I'm just standing still

No, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad
And I'd show up at your house
All screamin' at your door
Sayin', "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love

I know that when I wake up there's gonna be seven texts and three calls to you
And I'm not gonna know what to do
And I'll make up some excuse about how that was meant for someone else
