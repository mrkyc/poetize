No, you're not really that small
I just said it so I'd hurt you
I know I said that I'd call
But I never said when, mmm
Always holding over your head
Everything we've been through
I wish I could be that tender, stable girl
That you want, but I'm not, oh, oh

So can I cut you some slack?
Get all that weight off your back? Oh, oh
Lift the tension in the air
That I put there, that I put there

So, let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
However, whenever, whatever you want me to

No, I don't have to go home
I just love to make you anxious, huh
I always ruin good things
Like that time with your friends
And I'm probably ruining something now
And I can't believe you're staying
I wish I could be that tender, stable girl
That you want, but I'm not
(Yeah)
You might also like
So can I help you relax?
Get all that weight off your back? Oh, oh
Eliminate the unfair
That I put there, that I put there

Oh, let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
And if it ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough for you
The hurt is so deep it's making you think things that aren't true
Well, let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
However, whenever, whatever you want me to

I could apologize but that's not my style
I could just write it out, but that takes some time
So let me communicate the only way that I know how
I wish I could be that tender, stable girl
That you want, but I'm not
But I'm not, so

Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
And if it ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough for you
The hurt is so deep it's making you think things that aren't true
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you
