Hear Paris in the fall is beautiful
I haven't seen it, though
Hear all of my friends are getting old
I haven't seen 'em, though
I wanna riot in the street
So confined, I could scream
I hear my boyfriend's beautiful
I haven't seen him, though

I wanna ma-ma-ma-make time
Make time for a good time
Ma-ma-ma-make time
For a good time

'Cause I, I work too much
I just wanna hang around with all of my friends
Break down, fall in love
Maybe we can wait around until it all ends
Eh, I work too much
I just wanna hang around with all of my friends
Yeah, do whatever I want
Break down, fall in love
(Break down, fall in love)

Hear his lips taste good on a Tuesday (Yeah)
Well, okay
I wanna get fucked up in a new way (Yeah)
Yeah, okay
Make love in a park, even when it's light out
Forget consequence
Get high like the stars, even when it's light out
Don't wanna forget

To ma-ma-ma-make time
Make time for a good time
Ma-ma-ma-make time
For a good time
