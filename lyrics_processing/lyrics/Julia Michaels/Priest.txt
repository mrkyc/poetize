Mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, there are liars, but then there is you
In retrospect, that's what brought me to you, mmm
Guess I thought I could change you to the truth, mmm
I don't know, I don't know what I was thinking, uh huh

Sometimes, I miss you and then I remember
That I deserve much better
Cover my tattoo about you with another
And now I'm feeling much better

Oh, you broke my heart, and now, you want some redemption
Oh, it's obvious that you ain't learned your lesson
Oh, you're owning up so you can get to Heaven
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession

In my weak moments, I think about you, mmm
But not in the way that you think that I do, mmm
I've actually made up a game with my friends
To see how long until this one ends and the next one begins
I've got a hundred dollars riding on it, mmm

Oh, it's obvious that you ain't learned your lesson
Oh, you're owning up so you can get to Heaven
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession

Oh, oh, woo
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession
Oh, oh, woo
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession

Sometimes, I miss you and then I remember
That I deserve much better
Cover my tattoo about you with another
And now I'm feeling much better

Oh, you broke my heart, and now, you want some redemption
Oh, it's obvious that you ain't learned your lesson
Oh, you're owning up so you can get to Heaven
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession
(So fuck your confession)

Oh, oh, woo
Oh, but I'm not a priest, so fuck your confession
Oh, oh, woo
