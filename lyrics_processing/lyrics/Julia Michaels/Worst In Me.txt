Yeah
Remember when I used to be happy for you?
You could go out with your female friends and I'd be totally fine
Remember when you used to be happy for me?
You'd celebrate all my success without crossing a line

Now, it's like we're scared of getting good
'Cause we know the truth is that we could
Yeah, we know that we might actually work
And the truth is that we could

But maybe it's the worst in me
That's bringing out the worst in you
I know we can fix these kinks
But the worst in me doesn't want to work on things
But the best of me wants to love you
But the worst in me doesn't want to
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah

It's almost like I've gotten so used to resentment
That every annoying little thing you say has lost its effect
It's almost like it's made you a little bit bitter
When I don't always react the way you expect
You might also like
It's like we're scared of getting good
'Cause we know the truth is that we could
Yeah, we know that we might actually work
And the truth is that we could

But maybe it's the worst in me
That's bringing out the worst in you
I know we can fix these kinks
But the worst in me doesn't want to work on things
But the best of me wants to love you
But the worst in me doesn't want to

I won't hurt you again
If you won't, if you won't
But, baby, I won't lose you again
If you won't, if you won't
Remember when I used to be happy for you?

But maybe it's the worst in me (worst in me)
That's bringing out the worst in you
I know we can fix these kinks
But the worst in me doesn't want to work on things
But the best of me wants to love you, I really want to
But the worst in me doesn't want to
Ah ah ah ah ah (Really doesn't want to)
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah (The worst in me doesn't want to)
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah (Oh)
