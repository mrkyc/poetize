I was reaching for heaven, it became my obsession
But I guess it was more like a curse and less like a blessin'
And It was perfect on paper, but there weren't any layers
And how can a kiss of an angel feel more like a stranger?

I try to take it all away
Take it all away
But it all went up in flames
And I fell hard like

Icarus
I got to close to your heart and now I've turned to dust
I didn't know that your love could be so dangerous
And all your golden promises, they just turn to rust
And I got burned like Icarus
I got burned by your love

Stop what you're sayin', I'm done with the stayin'
You're not gonna pull me in, I'm finally awake, and
I finally see you for who you are
And not the person I thought you were
And maybe you just drop things to watch how they're breakin'
You might also like
I try to take it all away
Take it all away
But it all went up in flames
And I fell hard like

Icarus
I got to close to your heart and now I've turned to dust
I didn't know that your love could be so dangerous
And all your golden promises they just turn to rust
And I got burned like Icarus

Gotta let go, gotta let go
Gonna wash the poison off of me, oh oh
I'ma let go, I'ma let go
Watch me as I'm flyin' away from your love
Mmm, flyin' away from your love

Like Icarus...
I got to close to your heart and now I've turned to dust...
I didn't know that your love could be so dangerous
And all your golden promises they just turn to rust
And I got burned like Icarus
I got burned by your love
Burned like Icarus
I got burned by your love
