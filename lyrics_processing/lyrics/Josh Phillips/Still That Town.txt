Looks like just a map dot
Couple  rock roads running through it
Pit stop at the Quik Stop, last chance for gas
One bar and a Baptist church
Any way you turn there ain't nothing to it
Kinda place you leave and you think you won't look back
Man ain't it funny how it works like that?

It's still that town that makes me wanna roll my
Windows down and catch a southern breeze
Blowing through them Evergreens
When I think about where I wanna be right now
It's still that town

It's a seat laid back and a console kiss (It's still that town)
It's a summertime jump off a cold creek bridge (It's still that town)
It's a bonfire white shine whiskey buzz
It's a red in the dirt that made us us
Everything red down here in our blood
Yeah it's

It's still that town that makes me wanna roll my
Windows down and catch a southern breeze
Blowing through them Evergreens
When I think about where I wanna be right now
It's still that town
Yeah it's still that town

Yeah we grew up and we got our first buzz
And we learned how to rough in that town (It's still that town)
Yeah we were raised by no other place like our roots run deep in this town (It's still that town)
Yeah it's still that town
Yeah, it's still that town

Yeah it's still that town that makes me wanna roll my
Windows down and catch a southern breeze
Blowing through them Evergreens
When I think about where I wanna be right now
It's still that town
