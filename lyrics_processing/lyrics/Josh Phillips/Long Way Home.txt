From the white wooden cross on the side of the road on that old oak tree
To the red to the glass and the tall swayin grass,it's easy to see
This two lane knows my pain
Yeah, here I go again
Back and forth, up and down, tryna make it all make sense

Everyday I wind up here, windin through gears
Windin down that same old back road with the windows down
Chasin down some old memory
It's like I make this drive, just to cry
But I guess that's what I need sometimes
When I can't face that you're really gone
So everyday, I take the long way home

Well, this outta my way two mile stretch is all that's left of back in the day
That road sign's still missin
Can't believe they ain't fixed it, but it's better that way
I can still sees us jumpin out
Two fishin poles and a six pack
Crossin lines havin the time of our lives
Not catchin a thing

So everyday I wind up here, windin through gears
Windin down that same old back road with the windows down
Chasin down some old memory
It's like I make this drive just to cry
But I guess that's what I need sometimes
When I can't face that you're really gone
So everyday, I take the long way home
You might also like
Man, I'm gettin through
But damn, I'm missin you
So at times like this

I wind up here, windin through gears
Windin down this same old back road with the windows down
Chasin down some old memory
It's like I make this drive just to cry
But I guess that's what I need sometimes
When I can't face that you're really gone
Yeah, when I can't face that you're really gone
I take the long way home
