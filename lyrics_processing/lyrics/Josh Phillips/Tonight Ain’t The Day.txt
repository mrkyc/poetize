Someday I probably oughta slow down
Livin' in this cold beer haze
Watch who I hang around, what comes out my mouth
Yeah I damn sure oughta do that someday

Need a little less Jack in my Coke
Little less habit in my smoke
Just a little more work in my play
Put a little less Skol in my back pocket
A little less rollin' in my rockin'
A little less blowing all my cash when I get paid

But tonight ain't the day
Tonight's gettin' rowdy
Tonight's one of them 'Dixie cup, mix 'em up strong' kinda parties
Talking runoff the rails
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell
Someday I oughta change my ways
But tonight ain't the day
Oh tonight ain't the day

Someday I'll find me a good girl
Sweet talk me sideways into walking straight
I'll stop all-nightin' in this town
Pick up my throwdown, take it out back, and throw it away

But tonight ain't the day
Tonight's gettin' rowdy
Tonight's one of them 'Dixie cup, mix 'em up strong' kinda parties
Talking run off the rails
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell
Someday I oughta change my ways
But tonight ain't the day
Oh tonight ain't the day
Oh naw, tonight ain't the day

Need a little less Jack in my Coke
Little less habit in my smoke
Just a little more work in my play
Need a little less Skol in my back pocket
A little less rollin' in my rockin'
A little less blowing all my cash when I get paid

But tonight ain't the day
Tonight's gettin' rowdy
Tonight's one of them 'Dixie cup, mix 'em up strong' kinda parties
Talking run off the rails
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell
Someday I oughta change my ways
But tonight ain't the day
Oh naw
