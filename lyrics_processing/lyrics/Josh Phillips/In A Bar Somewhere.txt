If you're ever in Port Saint Joe, on that emerald coast
I hope I'm the last thing on your mind
If you're ever on the interstate
Same shade of gray truck goes flyin' by
Don't think it's mine
Well I hope your sun is shinin'
And you never look behind you

But if you're ever in a bar somewhere
At a back booth table, peelin' those labels off High Life beers
That miss me song comes on like neon, loud and clear
And you think you've had too much
Just let that good buzz call me up and I'll be there
If you're ever in a bar somewhere

I hope that pasture gate's got a Master lock
So you don't have to tell him that was our old spot
Where we used to pull off
And I hope that water tank's got brand new paint over both our names
Just one less thing to make you think about us

But if you're ever in a bar somewhere
At a back booth table, peelin' those labels off High Life beers
That miss me song comes on like neon, loud and clear
And you think you've had too much
Just let that good buzz call me up and I'll be there
If you're ever in a bar somewhere
If you're ever in a bar somewhere
You might also like
I hope I never cross your mind
Never cross your sky
But baby it's alright

If you're ever in a bar somewhere
At a back booth table, peelin' those labels off High Life beers
That miss me song comes on like neon, loud and clear
And you think you've had too much
Just let that good buzz call me up and I'll be there
If you're ever in a bar somewhere
Yeah if you're ever in a bar somewhere, oh
