Pleaser, girl, you love to be a pleaser
Mmm, but take a bow, take it now
'Cause your heart's so good, you can turn a sinner into
A believer and I want the world to see ya
Mmm, 'cause you're the show everywhere we go
I'll be your front-row fan in the bleachers
In every single room, it's all eyes on you
But baby, I don't mind

You can steal my thunder any time
I love the way you glow
In the camera lights
On a red carpet roll
So go ahead and make a scene
Like it's going outta style
'Cause if it's up to me
You can steal my thunder anytime

Woo, hoo, anytime
Woo, hoo, anytime
Woo, hoo, anytime
You can steal my thunder

Better, no it don't get any better
Mmm, than watching you shine like the moon
Most any other guy might try to dim your light
But baby, when I'm with ya
I'll be the frame around your picture
Ooh, one step behind, no, I don't mind

You can steal my thunder any time
I love the way you glow
In the camera lights
On a red carpet roll
So go ahead and make a scene
Like it's going outta style
'Cause if it's up to me
You can steal my thunder anytime

You can steal my thunder

In every single room, it's all eyes on you
But baby, I don't mind

You can steal my thunder any time
I love the way you glow
In the camera lights
On a red carpet roll
So go ahead and make a scene
