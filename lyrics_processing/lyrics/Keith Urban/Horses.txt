Sometimes you get a little bit frightened
Afraid of the wind and the lightning
Sometimes you get a little bit insecure
Sometimes you wonder if you're even good enough
Hiding from the morning when it's too much
But there's so much waiting behind the door

And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive

So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run

I saw you on the street just the other day
You looked so pretty when you smiled that way
So open up the door, let your heart escape
