Moonlight, it's gotta be close to
Midnight, where did it go?
All the time, all the friends left waiting
Never made it 'cause we kept making out
In the driveway, who would've thought
In the driveway, that we would get lost
In that dashboard radio static
Makin' our own kind of magic

Oh-oh
I said, thirty more minutes, thirty minutes ago, and
Oh-oh
But we're still right here and you already know that

I should leave
Put the car in drive, babe
But your kiss keeps tellin' me to stay
Yeah, your lips keep gettin' in the way
You know we should've
Called it a night, babe
But goodbye's something I can't say
Yeah, your lips keep gettin' in the way

Windows, we already fogged up
The windows, we're writing our name
On the glass as the clock keeps ticking
Sun'll be up any minute

Oh-oh
