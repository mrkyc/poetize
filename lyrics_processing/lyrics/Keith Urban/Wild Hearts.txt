Saw the man in black, spotlight in the air
Heard a thousand screams, I saw my daddy stare
Feel like I've been runnin' since the day that I was born
Eagle on my back, phoenix on my arm

This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rockstars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me?
All of you lost ones who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wildcards and all of the wild hearts
Just like mine

Now listen
Has anyone ever told you, you'll never amount to anything?
You're just wastin' your time chasin' the tail of a dragon kind of dream
But I'm here to tell you anything can happen in this life
If you got that heart and the passion and a God lit fire inside

This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rockstars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me?
All of you lost ones who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wildcards and all of the wild hearts
Just like mine (Oh, ha)
Just like mine (Oh, oh)
