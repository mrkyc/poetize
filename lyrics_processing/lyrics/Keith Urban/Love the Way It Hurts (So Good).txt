We were dancing on the beach
You were holding onto me
And on my chest, I felt the beating of your heart
Another late night reverie
Seconds felt like years to me
You said, "Baby, let's just stay right where we are"

And I guess we should have known
It was too good to go on
But there's something about us that I just refuse to let go

I remember
I remember summer nights
You were like a midnight daydream
Neon lights
We were making waves in the backseat
Everytime I close my eyes
I sink into the pain of the memory
I'm holding on for what it's worth
I guess I love the way it hurts
So good
I love the way it hurts
So good

There's a pounding in my chest
A rush of blood goes to my head
Thought I saw your silhouette pass by the door
And even though it hurts like hell
I just cannot help myself
I crave the way it makes me feel, but it leaves me wanting more

I remember
And I remember summer nights
You were like a midnight daydream
Neon lights
We were making waves in the backseat
Everytime I close my eyes
I sink into the pain of the memory
I'm holding on for what it's worth
I guess I love the way it hurts
So good
I love the way it hurts
So good, hey

And I guess we should have known
It was too good to go on
But there's something about us that I just refuse to let go
And I remember summer nights
You were like a midnight daydream
Neon lights
We were making waves in the backseat
Every time I close my eyes
I sink into the pain of the memory
I'm holding on for what it's worth
I guess I love the way it hurts
So good
I love the way it hurts (love the way it hurts)
So good
I guess I love the way it hurts (I love the way it hurts)
So good
I love the way it hurts (love the way, I love the way, I love the way it hurts)
