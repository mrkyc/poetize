The words are getting hard to find
Like friends on Valentines
The puzzle pieces got lost in time and left behind
But fought a real good fight
But there's something about you, babe
Though I tried to open up
It's no use, I'm frozen in this state
Being great at pushing everyone I love
I love away

And it's just too little too late to change
I got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long
I can't stop singing in and out of key
I got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
For way too long

Despite the look that's in your eyes
I know how hard you tried to break my stubbornness
Do your best to pull me out
But I'm buried in this mess, I see you're disheartened and
I really want to give you more
Than just parts of what I can
I wish you could call the last ones
So you understand

That it's just a little too late to change
I got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long
I can't stop singing in and out of key
I got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long

And baby, I'm trying, baby, I'm trying
You know I've been trying for way too long
And baby, I'm trying, baby, I'm trying

But it's just a little too late to change
I got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long
I can't stop singing in and out of key
I got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, mmm, for way too long
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
