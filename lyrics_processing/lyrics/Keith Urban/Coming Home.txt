I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive

I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm, mmm

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm

Coming home

Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same

I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go (Yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
(Nothin' in the world that feels like I'm)
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home (Comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (Ooh-hoo)
So many places, but there's none like mine
