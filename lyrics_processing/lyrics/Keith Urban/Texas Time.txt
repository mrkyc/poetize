New York girls, they can be so pretty
But I get cold livin' in the city, oh
Then I've got to go
And I've been west out to California
Summer nights and girls are so much warmer there
They just don't have a care
But I know a place where the people are smilin'
Takin' it easy and it's been a while since I've gone
And now it's time to go home

Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

I-35, Dallas down to Austin
We can find a world we can get lost in there
Where we can breathe the air, oh, oh
We can howl at the moon like a wild coyote
Cactus in bloom and the pink peyote's so fine
So fine, we got nothin' but time, hee
