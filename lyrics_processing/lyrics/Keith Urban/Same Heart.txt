Traded in my old Toyota
And I moved out of that shoebox apartment
I've been wearing brand new clothes
Even changed the number on my phone, mmm
Different bars and different streets
Different drinks, different lips
Different parts of town
A different Friday crowd
There's different songs on the radio
Who am I kidding?
Everything's different now
Everything

But the same heart that loved you's still beating
In this chest hard, no matter how far I think I've moved on
There's always gonna be a scar
'Cause I still got the, I still got the
Same heart, ooh
Mmm, mmm
Ooh

I've been goin' different ways to get to work
'Cause if I go down 12th, it still hurts when I pass that corner light
When your laughter in the wanderlust comes flooding back and fills up my car
And I realize that a piece of me will always wonder where you are

The same heart that loved you's still beating
In this chest hard, no matter how far I think I've moved on
There's always gonna be a scar
'Cause I still got the, I still got the
Same heart (I still got the, I still got the)
Mm, mm (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the, I still got the)
(I still got the, I still got the)
(I still got the)
But I still got the same heart (I still got the, I still got the)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the, I still got the)
Same heart (I still got the, I still got the)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the, I still got the) Oh-oh, oh

I could say that I'm fine, but I'd be lyin'
It's so hard to move on, but I keep tryin'
Every breath that I take, you're there reminding me
I could say that I'm fine, but I'd be lyin'
It's so hard to move on, but I keep tryin'
It's so hard to move on, but I keep tryin'
I'm lying, I still got the

Same heart that loved you's still beating
In this chest hard, no matter how far I think I've moved on
There's always gonna be a scar
'Cause I still got the, I still got the
Same heart, ooh (I still got the, I still got the)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the, I still got the) Oh, oh
(I still got the, I still got the)
I still got the, I still got
The same heart (I still got the, I still got the)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the, I still got the) Same heart
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I still got the) Ooh
