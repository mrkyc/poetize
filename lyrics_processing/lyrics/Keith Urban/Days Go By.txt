Woo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm changin' lanes and talkin' on the phone
I'm drivin' way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of comin' in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone

And days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by, and, ooh, ooh

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
Mm-mm
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losin' ourselves

And days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Babe, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
And days go by, and, ooh, ooh
Yeah, the days go by, and, ooh, ooh

We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today

And the days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start livin'
You better start livin'
Better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by, oh, and, ooh, ooh
Yeah, these days go by, oh, and ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let 'em all fly by
Come on, come on now
Yeah, come on now, and, ooh, ooh, ooh
