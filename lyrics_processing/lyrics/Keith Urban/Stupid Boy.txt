Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different

Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind

She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh

So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Ooh, yeah

Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
Yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
I'm the same old, same old stupid boy

It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone

Ah, she's gone, she's long gone
Yes, she's gone
Yeah, oh
Nobody's ever going to love me like she loved me
And she loved me, she loved me
God, please, just let her know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Baby
Yeah, I'm down on my knees
