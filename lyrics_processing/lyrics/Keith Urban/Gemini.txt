She's not quite a contradiction
She rolls with it
Quick with a snap decision
I'm fine with it
Strong on her strong opinions
I'm weak for it
It's not just one thing, not just one thing
I want all of it, huh

Mmm
Emotionally, physically, diving right into me
Mmm
Emotionally, physically, getting a hold of me
Mmm
Emotionally, spiritually, movin' so close to me
Mmm
I wonder if she knows

She's a maniac in the bed
But a brainiac in her head
And I know what everybody knows
Mm mmm, baby, she's both
Wears the hell outta that dress
But she's pretty even when a mess
And I know what everybody knows
Mm mmm, baby, she's both

All of my complications
She see through it
I don't know if it's because of
Or in spite of it
But I don't doubt her intentions
When she's sayin' it
It's not just one thing, not just one thing
I want all of it

Mmm
Emotionally, spiritually, moving' so close to me
Mmm
I wonder if she knows

She's a maniac in the bed
But a brainiac in her head
And I know what everybody knows
Mm mmm, baby, she's both
Wears the hell outta that dress
But she's pretty even when a mess
And I know what everybody knows
Mm mmm, baby, she's both
She's in my soul, I'll never let go
She's in my heart now, in my heart now

She's a maniac in the bed
But a brainiac in her head
And I know what everybody knows (everybody knows)
Mm mmm, baby, she's both (everybody knows)
Wears the hell outta that dress (yes, she does)
But she's pretty even when a mess (ooh, give it to me)
And I know what everybody knows
Mm mmm, baby, she's both
Baby, she's both, ooh yeah
Mm, mmm, mmm

She's spinning around the room
When she's spinning around the room
She got the stars comin' out of her eyes
Got everybody staring, like they're caught in the headlights
A little bit left, a little bit right
She'll wake you to make love in the middle of the night
And every breath that I take is brand new
I'm a man brought back to life
Castor and Pollux sent you to save me
I've returned to my Gemini
Ooh
She's in my heart now, in my heart now
Spinning around the room
Hey, hey, hey
