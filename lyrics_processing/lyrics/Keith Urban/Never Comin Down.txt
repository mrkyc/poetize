I can feel it comin' on now
As the music plays
Takin' shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all gone
Light it up like a rocket
We're goin' all night long

Everybody sing (Ooh)
Mm, I love it when you (ooh)

When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
Wanna take you by the hand, dancin'
And we'll pass it around, 'round, 'round
Yeah, we're so high, we could paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceilin'
And I swear we're never ever comin' down
Never comin' down

(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah) Never ever, never comin' down

And the beer is ice cold
We're goin' down to the wire
Then we'll all go rolling home
And maybe we'll keep it goin'
'Til we see that sun comin' up
Right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud

(Ooh)

When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?

Tear the top right off the ceilin'
