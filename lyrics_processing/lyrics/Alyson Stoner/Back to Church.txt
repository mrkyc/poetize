Go ahead and pray for me
Cause I move just a bit unholy sometimes
It's inside of me
Like a bat out of hell trying to get out tonight (tonight)
Now lock the doors, I'll show you a rhythm that you never seen
I'll take the lead
Meet me on the floor and I'll tell you a secret baby, this is how it's gonna be
I threw away the key, now you can never leave

You'll get high, I'll get low
I'm not trying to save your soul
Oh, when your body hurts
I'm gonna take you back to church

Don't belong to me
Might as well because I'll be crossing the line
You're so wrong for me
You could see it at first but now you're just blind
Now lock the doors, I'll show you a rhythm that you never seen
I'll take the lead
Meet me on the floor and I'll tell you a secret baby, this is how it's gonna be
I threw away the key, now you can never leave
You might also like
You'll get high, I'll get low
I'm not trying to save your soul
Oh, when your body hurts
I'm gonna take you back to church
Back to church
I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna take you
Back to church
I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna take you
You'll get high, I'll get low
I'm not trying to save your soul
Oh, when your body hurts
I'm gonna take you back to church

I'm just trying to take you
I'm not trying to save you
I'm just trying to take you
I'm not trying to save you

You'll get high, I'll get low
I'm not trying to save your soul
Oh, when your body hurts
I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna take you
Back to church
I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna take you
Back to church
I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna take you
You'll get high, I'll get low
I'm not trying save your soul
Oh, when your body hurts
I'm gonna take you back to church
