I miss you
Yeah I'm just waking up
Feeling lonely as -
And I want you
On the floor
On the chair
I don't care
Anywhere that you want to
Just gimmie that
Gimmie that heartfelt
Making my heart melt
Feeling
I'm sorry
Every night I go out
Always giving you reasons to worry
But it's all in your head
I'm a good girl I swear won't you hurry
To gimmie that
Gimme that old school
Playing it all cool

Cuz I can't get enough
I don't wanna wait no

Right into your heart
Right to where you are

And that voice it drives me mad (mmm)
And you know that just one touch
And god I'm so (ooo)

An equation that won't ever change

No matter how far
Wherever we are
Waiting
