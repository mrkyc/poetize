Step inside the dragon's lair
If it's too hot, get out of here
Don't you act like you don't care
When you see me standing there
Always running hot and cold
Up and down and back and forth
You hear yes when I say no
Round and round, away we go
We agree to disagree
But were you ever meant for me?
I don't know
I don't know

I will not apologize
For packing up my life and leaving
And I can't waste any more time
Waiting for you to call me, baby

(That's what you wanted)
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted, that's what you're gonna get
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted, that's what you're gonna get
You might also like
You think you're a dragon slayer
But I don't think you can compare
After all the smoke is clear
Take a look into the mirror
Always running hot and cold
Up and down and back and forth
You hear yes when I say no
Round and round, away we go
We agree to disagree
But were you ever meant for me?
I don't know
I don't know

I will not apologize
For packing up my life and leaving
And I can't waste any more time
Waiting for you to call me, baby

(That's what you wanted)
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted, that's what you're gonna get
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted, that's what you're gonna get
There's no turning back this, baby
Cause you're the one who did this to me
Give me one good reason that
I shouldn't run from ya
There's no time to second guess
Oh, baby, you should hold your breath
This is when I save myself
I'm better off without you

I will not apologize (Whoooah)
For packing up my life and leaving (better off without you)
And I can't waste any more time (Whoooah)
Waiting for you to call me, baby (better off without you)
I will not apologize
For packing up my life and leaving
And I can't waste any more time (wooooah)
Waiting for you to call me baby (wooooah)

(That's what you wanted)
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted, that's what you're gonna get
That's what you wanted, that's what you wanted
