Try to come between us if you really want
My baby don't need your love
I swear he don't
Tell him it's divine destiny how you belong
My baby don't need to know
I swear he don't

And I'd be more concern, he was interested
If I felt I had any trouble pleasin' him, but I clearly do fine
Why would he look around when he got the best?
Honey, please, shut your mouth it's a waste of breath and time, why do you try?

That boy is mine now
And I'm my baby's one and only girl
The boy is mine
Every night, every day, every where
Every way we're in love so
Why do you try?
That boy is mine now
And I'm my baby's one and only girl
The boy is mine
Every night, every day, every where
Every way we're in love so
Why do you try?
You might also like
Try to say you're different if you really want
My baby won't listen no
I swear he won't
Tell him what he's missing
That you got it all
Sorry, but his hands are full
No, really though

And I'd be more concern, he was interested
If I felt I had any trouble pleasin' him, but I clearly do fine
Why would he look around when he got the best?
Honey, please, shut your mouth it's a waste of breath and time, why do you try?
