I saw you color the air around you
You heard the music a different way
You had no boundaries
They bent to your rules
A new kind of sacred
Whatever you say, I'll follow

Didn't expect falling like that
Doesn't make sense
Never done this
But I don't wanna end up strangers
Touching me right
Talking in just the way I like it
I can't help it
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Thank you for fucking up my life (baby)
Your body got me changing my mind (honey)
You're even better on the inside (baby)
No going back after the first bite
You know when it's right
(Baby)
You might also like
I knew the minute I pulled you closer
I had to question the plans I'd made
Gave up my cold world to keep you warmer
Now my life is naked
Is it worth the pain that it costs?

Didn't expect, falling like that
Doesn't make sense
Never done this
But I don't wanna end up strangers
Touching me right
Talking in just the way I like it
I can't help it
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Thank you for fucking up my life (baby)
Your body got me changing my mind (honey)
You're even better on the inside (baby)
No going back after the first bite
You know when it's right
(Baby)
Caught in the middle
Known to be normal
Caught in the middle
If we met for the first time now would I say goodbye?
Sorry for fucking up your life (baby)
I wonder if I'm still on your mind (honey)
And do you hide it on the inside (baby)
No going back after the first bite
Thank you for fucking up my life (baby)
Your body got me changing my mind (honey)
You're even better on the inside (baby)
No going back after the first bite
