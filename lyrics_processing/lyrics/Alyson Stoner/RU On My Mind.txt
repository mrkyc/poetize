I'm in my head
Want you to learn me
You feel it yet
My wheels are turnin'
It's obvious
I like where we're goin'
Don't be shy
This is your moment

And now I don't understand it
I got things on my mind
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Yeah we can do this right now
Close the tab and we out
Cause I'm in if you down
It's goin' down, down
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?

I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
I got things on my mind
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Yeah we can do this right now
Close the tab and we out
Cause I'm in if you down
It's goin' down, down
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone
Let's make shapes tonight (And I still don't understand it)
Take turns crossin' lines
I got things on my mind (You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth)
See you lick your lips (And my heart don't understand it)
So hard to resist
I've been waitin' all night
Understand it, understand it

Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
Are you? Are you?
Yeah we can do this right now
Close the tab and we out
Cause I'm in if you down
It's goin' down, down
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin'? (You think you know somebody)
