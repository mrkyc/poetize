They tore my high school to the ground
And put a new wing in the east lot
On my old parking spot
It stands reminding me of how
I wish that I could travel back in time
Change my state of mind
So if you're still in your teens, listen to me

It's hard to see beyond these walls
Of who you hope and who hope not to be
Socially
Maybe you're in or you're out
But in the end, when all your hats are in the air
Nobody's gonna care

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now (Look at them now)
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown
So be cool, be hot, be weird
It's just four years

Next time you're walking through your school
Take a look at who's surrounding you
Or hounding you
'Cause it's all just castles in the sand
When your tassel's on the left side of your head
You're never going back

So homecoming court, vote on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the king of the nerds and the queen of the prom get a job
Wouldn't you know?
He's a CEO and she answers his phone
So be cool, be hot, and be weird
It's just four years

And as for your grades, I know they're important
Everyone wants to be a whiz
I just don't know where mine is

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on
'Cause every homecoming court moves on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown
So be cool, be hot, be weird
Oh, be hot, be wild, you're here
Oh. be cool, be hot, be weird
