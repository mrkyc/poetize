And you can never go back

Well, Jackie, you can be anything you want
Well, that's what they said when you were young
But you've never been good at moving on
Are you still at the corner restaurant?
Meeting Jimmy McKay when you get off
Don't you know that it's all a sad mirage?

And you can never go back to Xanadu
Running with the young and the restless
Nothing better to do
Nothing yet to lose
And you can never go back to Avalon
Stolen with the bold and the beautiful
Those days are gone
Don't you know those days are gone?
And you can never go back

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, you can never go back
Whoa, whoa

Jackie, didn't you say you'd be a star?
Maybe it was the world that made it hard
Or maybe you've just forgotten who you are
Can't you see that you're living in the past?
Maybe this is the time for me to ask
Are you ready to move on? It's been too long

And you can never go back to Xanadu
Running with the young and the restless
Nothing better to do
Nothing yet to lose
And you can never go back to Avalon
Stolen with the bold and the beautiful
Those days are gone
Don't you know those days are gone?
And you can never go back

And you can never go, and you can never go
Back to Xanadu
Running with the young and the restless
Nothing better to do
And nothing yet to lose
And you can never go back to Avalon
Stolen with the bold and the beautiful
Those days are gone
Don't you know those days are gone?
And you can never go back
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Go back
And you can never go back
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You can never go back
And you can never go, no, you can never go
