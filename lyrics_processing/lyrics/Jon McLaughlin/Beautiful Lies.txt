If you'd give and not give up
We could lie on our backs underneath our white flags
Let emotions that rise up
Bleed into words for no one in particular

It's not a game if we both play it (we play it)
It's not a lie if we both... just say it

Come and sit a little closer
Put my arm around your shoulder
I don't want to be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?
We can close our eyes
Forget about the wrong and the right
You and I won't be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?

Inside there's a burning
Making the words that we use temporarily true
We could twist 'em and turn 'em
Into beautiful lies underneath the moonlight

It's not a chance if we both miss it (we miss it)
It's not a knife if we both... twist it

Come and sit a little closer
Put my arm around your shoulder
I don't want to be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?
We can close our eyes
Forget about the wrong and the right
You and I won't be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?

A blind eye will save us from our loneliness
We can't find what we're craving
So we fold to this
Let time overtake us
As we're faking true love's kiss
Just like this

Come and sit a little closer
Put your arm around my shoulder
I don't want to be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?
We can close our eyes
Forget about the wrong and the right
You and I won't be alone anymore
Isn't breaking what a heart's for?
(We won't be alone)
Whoa-oh
(We won't be alone)
Whoa-oh
