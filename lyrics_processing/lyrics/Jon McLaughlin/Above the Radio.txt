I got only one life to lead here
Tryna be myself and speak clear
Your eyes look at me, and it's harder than you think
I stood up with my legs, so heavy
When the world was right in front of me
And I wasn't recognized when, time was on my side and

High above the radio, I soar
And no one has to know
No no one has to know

There comes a day when it's down to the worst
Dancing around the fire
Get burned if it's what it takes, to learn from my mistakes
And

High above the radio, I soar
And no one has to know
No, no one has to know

I hear the wall around this city coming down
And I feel my heart beat as I'm running out of town
You say I'm giving up, but I'm just slowing down
To live my life for now

How many people know exactly what I'm saying?
Feel like you're losing a game that you don't even want to be playing
And smile was on my face, when I'm staring into space and

High above the radio, I soar
And no one has to know
No, no one has to know

And I hear the wall around this city coming down
And I feel my heart beat as I'm running out of town
You say I'm giving up, but I'm just slowing down
To live my life for now

Ooh, high above the radio, mmm
High above the radio, oh
High above the radio, I'll soar
And no ones got to know
No one has to know

I hear the wall around this city coming down
And I feel my heart beat as I'm running out of town, yeah
Yeah, you say I'm giving up, but I'm just slowing down
You can tell me I'm giving up, but I'm just slowing down
