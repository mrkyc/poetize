Things start to change outside
Temperature's dropping, I don't mind
Bustin' out our heavy coats
Shoppers fill up the rows
And everyone's singing while they drive
It's gonna be a white Christmas
But I believe the house and sparkle
And every door's got a wreath
The snow is finally coming down
The neighborhood kids are running around
The fire burns, the record spins
So let's forget about what a crazy year it's been
I don't need money or shining trees
As long as you sit right next to me
Let's sing it out like we were young
Merry, merry Christmas everyone, ooh
Young kids wait for Santa to come while
The older ones bite their tongues
They can feel the magic in the air
Family's flying into town
Look a year older now
It wouldn't be the same without them there

Well, I just know
Let's hang out underneath the mistletoe
The snow is finally coming down
The neighborhood kids are running around
The fire burns, the record spins
So let's forget about what a crazy year it's been
I don't need money or shining trees
As long as you sit right next to me
Let's sing it out like we were young
Merry, merry Christmas everyone, ooh
Oh amen, hallelujah, hear the angels sing
Put on your sunday best and reminisce
While the church bells ring
The snow is finally coming down
The neighborhood kids are running around
The fire burns, the record spins
So let's forget about what a crazy year it's been
I don't need money or shining trees
As long as you sit right next to me
Let's sing it out like we were young
Merry, merry Christmas everyone, ooh
