Well, Autumn never seemed this cold before
Here I am, sleeping on the floor
Mmm, we changed just like the leaves outside my house
And my phone lay silent by the couch

And I remember June, back when I met you
And your eyes were green, and we were, too

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss, goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

I can still see your silhouette in the white hot sand
And I still feel my ring on my hand
And the clock was always ticking, down behind that glass
Singing, "Love, be good while you last"

We both knew, what we were getting into
And the things we said
Sounded true

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing, a kiss goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

The distant innocence
We are leaving far behind
Your last words will be burning in my mind
In the Winter time

Summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
I knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing, a kiss
Goodbye, goodbye

Summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss, goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over
