But she won't unlock it
All dressed in white
And face in the blankets
The nights with the boys
The rings in their pockets
The drives to work that don't ever drive back
It's a four letter word
And who'd ever thought that
A four letter word
Would be so hard to spell out
And our hearts skippin' beats
On edges of seats
We'll take time when it's up
But give up when it's down
Freakin' out about love
'bout love
About love
'bout love, no
Not love
But love
About love
'bout love, no

And we wouldn't have fell
Our emotional policies
And lookin' glass selves
It's a realization that we all need to find
It's all in our heads when we're changing our minds
About love
Love
About love
'bout love
'cause it's not love
Love
About love
'bout love, no
Or if we're not gonna mind
What's lost in our chest
Then I'll spend all my time dodging yours I guess
'cause the life you're denying me is a hole in my heart
And advice and society pull us apart
And at the blink of an eye
We'll get the courts involved
And if you don't like her eyes you just get 'em annulled
'cause the justice of the peace
Losing its power
Honeymoon suites to hotels by the hour
We take time when it's up
But give up when it's down
And it's not love
Love
Not love
It's not love
Not love
Love
Not love
Not love
No no
Not love, oh
Love
Love
Not love
Cuz it's not love
Love
Not love
It's not love, no
It's not love
Love
It's not love
Not love, no
It's not love
Love
