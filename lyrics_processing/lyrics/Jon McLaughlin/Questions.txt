Katie stands at the top of the stairs
As she's leaving her father stares
What has she come to
Another boy she runs to tonight
Powerless he just shakes his head
Disapointed and off to bed
He won't be sleeping
Cause the hours she's keeping
Are not right

She's asking a question
How will I be
After this next on eventually leaves me
And how can a man
Be all that they say
When all that i know
Is men run away
I think I lose just a little bit of me
In every man that I see

Danny's been out for seven days
Funny how he thought the price had been paid
On a past he hates to talk about
It's everything wrong about him
He goes back home to a battle field
Starts to drink as some kind of a shield
For the anger instilled in him
Their looks are killing him now

He's asking a question
How will I be
When it comes down to the end
And memories still haunt me
How can he have forgiveness that flows
When no one forgives him
Yet it's Jesus they know
I think I lose just a little bit of me
In this family that won't see

A crowed of confusion gathers round
Watching the light as he slowly goes out
After all they've talked about
Everything's coming out now
The anger turns to dead and gone
Heart's start to feel what feels so wrong
And as the time starts passing by
Hours turn to days in their heads
And they can still hear him say

I came for your questions
Of what you don't know
But you can't see the answers
Unless I go
So give me your hatred
And give me your diseased
Give me your tired
And I'll take them with me
Cause I'm hanging here
Losing every part of me
Just to open your eyes
To what you will never see
And to answer you questions
