Hey world, I can do it too
D4L, I can do it too

I can do it wit no hands, I can stand on one toe
I can lean wit it, rock wit it, bitch I'm Fabo
You don't wanna see fo'-fo'
Don't test D4L, whole Bankhead we ready to go
When real killas at yo do', give up the blow, Mook-B
I was born in mackin', live it, at times shawty was low
In the 'hood, I was the mark, and I stunt cause I smoke 'dro
What can you do, I can do it too
Get loose, pop 1, pop 2
I'm still goin', you through
What's happenin', what's up, I need grey goose off in my cup
And the geek just kicked in, can you do it like a truck
I gotta see my doctor, cause it's hard on the battlefield
That's why I keep my black shield, cause God say don't kill
But know that we real when we come through
Got to scope in my demon to hunt you
Got a plot and a scheme to confront you
Swung on the big money, gotta 1, 2
All my niggas on the block gon' roll
All my niggas on the block gon' smoke
Strap-up, Stuntman, let's go
We're deep, we're deep, oh, oh, oh

What-eva you do, I can do, bet y'all niggas can't stunt like me
Hollywood Courts, nigga dat's so true, ain't no tellin' what the stunt might do
Whole car built wit big ole rims, now I got 'em lookin' like
Neva seen a Dodge Magnum wit emory in the head lights
Damn right, I buy real good
Trap that good in my neighborhood
Cross my heart and hope to die
Oh my Lord, stay mack, so fly
Why ask why, D4L, we'll neva die, fa real though
Still got a house on the hill, ho
