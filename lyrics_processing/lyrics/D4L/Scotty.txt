I'm starting to see spaceships on Bankhead (I'm geeked up)
Oh, it just keeps going with me, man
D4L, Slick B
Scotty's calling me

(I'm in the zone) I've gotta see my doctor
(Scotty's calling me) Scotty, beam me up
(I'm in the zone) I wanna fly
(Scotty's calling me) Morning, noon, and night

I'm geeked up, geeked up
Geeked up, geeked up
I'm geeked up, geeked up
Geeked up, geeked up

I'm geeked up, and I can't see, and all the walls keep lookin' at me
I tell myself there's nothin' wrong, but I can't stop grittin' my teeth
I can't sleep, I can't eat, I just geek, I just geek
And I know I can't take one, so why not three? Shit get deep
I can't help the way I feel, when I geek, I keep it real
In the hood, I keep my steel, try to blow my high, you will get killed
'Cause it's real Bankhead, real Fabo, broad daylight, don't keep shit low
Roll my blunt right in front of po' po', fuck them hoes, they can blame it on the 'dro

I'm geeked up, geeked up
Geeked up, geeked up

Star Trek Star Trek, Scotty don't wanna give a star back
I'm in the zone, and I bought me a star gack
And I'm really geeked up, that's a star fact
I'm starting to see space ships on Bankhead
I roll with gangsters, pill poppers, and dank heads
I got partners like Worm, Lil Boom, Buddy and Famous
I got sisters like Jasmine, chocolate porches they dangerous
I fly like blaze when I'm burning purp'
Real body heads we burning hurt
Geek music I'm earning turf
While your footballs soft like nerf

(Scotty's calling me) Morning, noon, and night
I'm geeked up, geeked up
Geeked up, geeked up
