You fuckin' thieves

And we back, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch (Ugh, ugh)

(Fabo!) Prince O in the house
And we represent the south and I got to let 'em know
D4L came to ride and we can roll
Ain't nothin' but the pimpin' inside and she can go
When I'm geeked up, they can watch me roll
Anybody buck, better lock and load
Ain't goin' to the truck, better watch that ho
If she knuck, if she buck, she can hit 'em with a fo'
Oh, I betcha can't stand on one toe
With your arms in the air, imitate Fabo
Stop, drop, oh, pop one time
Lean back, Sprewell, then pop one more
Oh,, I betcha can't get like me
Roll a blunt and take a hit like me
Step in the club and pull a bitch like me
He could spit like hell, he ain't shit like me (Front side)
You might also like
I betcha can't do it like me (Ugh)
I'm tipsy off Coke and Hennessy (Ugh)
When I walk up, you niggas envy me (Ugh)
'Cause I'm D4L, you know who we be
Made you "Front Street" in 2003
2004, it's all about me
I'm gonna explain so y'all folks can see (Oh)
Watch me do it, so easy
First, you get real low (Ugh)
Bounce on your toes (Ugh)
Snap your finger, make your arm roll (Ugh)
Hit the floor (Ugh), do the Fabo (Ugh)
Get real crazy and scream out, "Oh!"
I'm tired of givin' you suckers game for free
Next time, when I put out my CD
Thirty-two tracks, cost thirty-two G's
I bet you can't do my dance like me, oh

Yo, we on some other shit (Whoa, whoa)

Stayin' down with them ghetto hits (Whoa, whoa)
A team of soldiers spittin' lyrics (Whoa)
Talkin' slick, he gon' peep some shit (Yeah)
Chopper wet, it's gon' hit you quick (Whoa, yeah)
Sprakka-sprakka, duck, bitch (Yeah)
Betcha can't work the street like this (Yeah, come on)
Flip a P into keys so quick (Whoa, whoa)
Broke down in dimes and nicks
Hit the club, so fresh with my clique
On the floor, doin' my dance like this (Go)

Nope, Stuntman walked through the door
With a box of the blunts and an ounce of the 'dro
With a bag of them pills, and you know I'm spinnin' like whoa
I'll knock a nigga ass to the floor, ask Carlos, ask Fabo
Ask Lamar, ask Mook B, ask Bruski, they already know
Nope, I ain't really playin' with a ho
When the K start sprayin', I ain't layin' in the hole
I catch 'em in the hood and hit 'em with the four
Do my dance on that ho
Nope (Oh), I betcha can't do it like a G
Grab a tee and wipe they feet like me
They ain't got to do it right, but they still wanna see
And they all wanna, but they can't do it like me
Nope, but I can do it like me
Shake the leg and get to it like me
