I make a hard earned living and it's enough for getting by
To the world of social network I'm nobody at all
Just 1 in 7 billion one more face on the wall
The odds are stacked against me I know it's true
But come to find there's something only I can do
I may be a nobody
But I'm gonna love you like nobody will
Someone you wanna run to
Who can move you when the world stands still
You say you need somebody
Who can understand the way you feel
Your heart and soul, your whole body
I'm gonna love like nobody will
I stayed home again this weekend, caught up on thinks to do
The car, the yard, the driveway and saying I love you
Rent was due on Tuesday but I spend my last dime
On these half a dozen roses and this bottle of white wine
They say no one's perfect but I disagree
Come to find out there's no doubt you're perfect for me
And I may be a nobody
But I'm gonna love you like nobody will
Someone you wanna run to
Who can move you when the world stands still
You say you need somebody
Who can understand the way you feel
Your heart and soul, your whole body
I'm gonna love like nobody will
You might also likeLike nobody can to the world I may be just an ordinary man
But give me time and I'll be your whole world, there's no need to be lonely any longer
No I may be a nobody
But I'm gonna love you like nobody will
Someone you wanna run to
Who can move you when the world stands still
Oh you say you need somebody
Who can understand the way you feel
Your heart and soul, your whole body
I'm gonna love like nobody will
Your heart and soul, your whole body
