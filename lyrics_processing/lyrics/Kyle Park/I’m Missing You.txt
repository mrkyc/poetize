That lights up my midnight sky
Every time I think about you
I laugh right after I cry
You're everywhere I turn
And your every girl I see walkin' by
And everyone says I'll get over you
It just takes time
I've done everything
To try and let go
I've done all that I can do

I'm missing you
I miss your every move
Without you around
I feel my world coming down
I'm missing you
I'm thinking all I can do
Is keep movin' on
And maybe you'll see you're wrong
For leavin' me
And did you know that every night
When I fall asleep
Every one of my dreams
Involve kissin' you
And everyday I'm awake
I'm missing you
You might also likeI talk on the street
And I can barely speak my name
Just one thought about you
And I forget what I have to say
I reach for the phone
But I know i'm only an old flame
It would be a tough call
But after all I'm the one who's to blame
Nothing I've tried
Can get you out of my mind
Theres nothing that I can do

I'm missing you
I miss your every move
Without you around
I feel my world coming down
I'm missing you
I'm thinking all I can do
Is keep movin' on
And maybe you'll see you're wrong
For leavin' me
And did you know that every night
When I fall asleep
Every one of my dreams
Involve kissin' you
And everyday I'm awake
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I miss your every move
I'm not strong enough
To let go of your love
But girl it's true
That somehow I keep holding on
Even though you're long gone

I'm missing you
I miss your every move
Without you around
I feel my world coming down
I'm missing you
I'm thinking all I can do
Is keep movin' on
And maybe you'll see you're wrong
For leavin' me
And did you know that every night
When I fall asleep
Every one of my dreams
Involve kissin' you
And everyday I'm awake
