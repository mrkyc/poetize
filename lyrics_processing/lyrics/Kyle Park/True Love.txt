How could I with all my running around
I would have had no luck trying
Why keep looking to find what can't be found
Is love really a game, something I can play or is it my imagination
Forever means the same as giving up the game all because of your infatuation
Let's quit while we're ahead, leave us behind
There's nothing you can say that can change my mind
I'm sorry if I've broken your heart, but I don't want to lead you on anymore
You can wait around for a dream that won't come
And you can say whatever you want but I'm done
We're going down girl, let's give it up
We had a good run, but it was never true love
I didn't know the end was coming, but heaven knows that I wasn't running away
We might have had a few things going, but lately home's the only place I won't stay
Is true love even real, something I can feel or is it just an expectation?
And who are we to say that we should feel this way all because of our desperation?
Let's quit while we're ahead, leave us behind
There's nothing you can say that can change my mind
I'm sorry if I've broken your heart, but I don't want to lead you on anymore
You can wait around for a dream that won't come
And you can say whatever you want but I'm done
We're going down girls, just give it up
We had a good run but it was never true love
You might also likeI could fake it, but we'd never make it, loves too complicated of a lie
Such resistance of true love's existence is reason enough not to try
Let's quit while we're ahead, leave us behind
There's nothing you can say that can change my mind
I'm sorry if I've broken your heart, but I don't want to lead you on anymore
You can wait around for a dream that won't come
And you can say whatever you want but I'm done
We're going down girl, just give it up
We had a good run but it was never true love
Oh, it was never true love
