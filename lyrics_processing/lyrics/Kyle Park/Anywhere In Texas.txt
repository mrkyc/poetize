Traveling across the ocean
Nothing seems to be in motion
Eight hours of airplane flyin'
Take it down. I feel like dyin'
Thousands of miles away
And no one knows a word that I say
I wish right now that I could be in Texas
Somebody please give me directions

France and Germany
They both looked the same to me
Everywhere eyes stare my direction
Criminal intent or music inspection
A few songs for every Jack and Coke
Once again drunk before I'd hoped
We tune up and right away we're playing
But all I want to see is someone singing

I don't need to go home
But anywhere in Texas will be fine
Some place I can go
Where I can understand the payphone line
I thought I wanted to roam
But I just found out what I thought I would find
I sure don't need to go home
But anywhere in Texas will be fine

Four cities in seven days
Two bad shows and one didn't pay
Third delay from isolated showers
Stuck in an airport for five long hours
Twelve dollars for a Jack and Coke
Once again broke before I'd hoped
San Marcos or Amarillo
I want to go back to the 'Armadillo'

I don't need to go home
But anywhere in Texas will be fine
Some place I can go
Where I can understand the payphone line
I thought I wanted to roam
But I just found out what I thought I would find
I sure don't need to go home
But anywhere in Texas will be fine

A cheap romance in France is gonna have to wait
The girls I love are in the lone star state

I don't need to go home
But anywhere in Texas will be fine
Some place I can go
Where I can understand the payphone line
I thought I wanted to roam
But I just found out what I thought I would find
I sure don't need to go home
