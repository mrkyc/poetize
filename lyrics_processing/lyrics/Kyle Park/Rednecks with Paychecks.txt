We got bass boats, fit wheels and our vehicles
We drink RC, cold Bud Light, and George Dickel
If it has four wheels, a worn in label, a throttle, or an outboard motor
We're gonna gas it up, throw it on it's , gonna find a little dirt in the water

We're just rednecks with paychecks
We're American made, bonafide blue collar
Workin' for a dollar, just to hoot and a holler
For the weekend, with some good friends
We're gonna blow a little dough, do a little livin'
'Cause you can't take it with you up to redneck heaven

We got Sweet Home playin' on the jam box cooler
Chicken fried ribs and a pig on the barbecuer
Yeah and you can bring your hillbilly hotrod and we'll try like hell to break it
Because everyone here's a southern engineer, so by God we can duct tape it

We some rednecks with paychecks
We're American made, bonafide blue collar
Workin' for a dollar, just to hoot and a holler
For the weekend, with some good friends
We're gonna blow a little dough, do a little livin'
'Cause you can't take it with you up to redneck heaven
