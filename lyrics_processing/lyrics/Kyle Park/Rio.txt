I bought him down in Houston from a cowboy friend of mine
He said he'd named him Rio, got him on the border line
He's bred just like the river, and he runs as free and wild
A good horse don't get no better, he can weather any mile
He said, "Why don't you take him out past the lake and let him run?
And you'll come to know that red turns to gold in a setting sun"

Every valley and mountain, I ride up and down them
I go wherever Rio goes
From the top to the bottom, I don't try to stop him
I just go wherever Rio goes

And when we came up on the river, I could tell the horse had changed
There was somethin' 'bout that water, like it was runnin' through his veins
And ill never understand it, how he knew just what to do
In the shadows of the darkness, hell you couldn't see the moon
And I don't believe that Rio could see each step he'd take
But sure as the rain, he finds his way to the river bank

Every valley and mountain, I ride up and down them
I go wherever Rio goes
From the top to the bottom, I don't try to stop him
I just go wherever Rio goes
You might also like
Oh he said, "Why don't you take him out past the lake and let him run?
And I came to find my own peace of mind with the risin' sun

And every valley and mountain, I ride up and down them
I go wherever Rio goes
From the top to the bottom, I don't try to stop him
I just go wherever Rio goes
Every trail, every turn, every lesson I learned
I followed his heart and his soul, so I go, I just go
Wherever Rio goes
