And I'll do whatever it takes
To prove that I'm the only one
That will ever feel this way
I'll go above and beyond
Where no other man has gone
I've always been by your side
To help you when something was wrong
But I never knew you would try...
To leave without tryin' at all
I can tell that you're walking away
But I won't let your heart stray
I'll do whatever it takes
I'm only a man, but I live for you
In this whole world you won't find..
Someone who can love you the way I do
And with every move that you make
You take away all of my strength it's true
So help me find a way, Help me make you stay
Oh I'll do whatever it takes
You've packed up all of your things
Without any reason to show
Is it something that I did to you girl?
Or is there somewhere else that you go
Late at night where I'm far away...?
I guess you never heard me say
That I'll do whatever it takes
I'm only a man, but I live for you
In this whole world you won't find..
Someone who can love you the way I do
And with every move that you make
You take away all of my strength it's true
So help me find a way, Help me make you stay
Oh I'll do whatever it takes
You say that it's hard to believe
That I could ever be all that you need
Darlin' you don't have to leave
As long as I'm awake girl I'll do whatever it takes
And with every move that you make
You take away all of my strength it's true
So help me find a way, Help me make you stay
Oh I'll do whatever it takes
