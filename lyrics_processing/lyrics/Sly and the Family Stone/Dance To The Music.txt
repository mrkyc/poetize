Say, get up and dance to the music!
Get on up and dance to the music!


Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music (Hey, Greg) What?

All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat, yeah
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet

I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
I said ride, Sally, ride, now

Cynthia (What?) Jerry (What?)
If I could hear the horns blow
Cynthia on the throne, yeah
Listen to me, Cynthia and Jerry
Got a message they're sayin'
All the squares, go home (Yeah)
Yeah, ooh
Listen to the voices
