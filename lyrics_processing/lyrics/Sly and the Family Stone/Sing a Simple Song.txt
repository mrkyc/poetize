Sing a simple song!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' in my sleep
I'm walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin' in the street
Time is passin', I grow older, things are happening fast
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at last, lemme hear you say

Ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Ya, ya-ya, ya-ya

Sing a simple song
Try a little do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do
Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do
Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm livin', livin', livin' life with all its ups and downs
I'm givin', givin', givin' love and smiling at the frowns
You're in trouble when you find it's hard for you to smile
A simple song might make it better for a little while, let me hear you say

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm livin', livin', livin' love

Everybody sing together
