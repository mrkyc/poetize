{Verse: Chris Morris]
I'm Just A Kid With A Dream/
She Said Boy You Can't Fit In These Jeans/
I'm Ginuwine If You Know What I Mean/
Been Birth With A Gift I Know It Hurts I Exist/
Been Blessed With A Soul That's Covered Painted With Gold/
Just A Pawn In The Game/
But I'm Focused On The King Of The Hill/
From Seeing Roaches And Rats To Crack Needles And Pills We Praying/
On Church Sunday/
While Aunt Jerry Catch The Holy Ghost On A Monday/
From Sounds Of That Gun Play/
Uh/
My Heart Bleed The Rap/
Rhymer Of The Year And Don't Concern With Stats/
We Burn These Blacks To Find Where The Fern Be At/
The Weed Entails The Tales That We Seem To Tell/
From Word To Mouth They Expose Us/
Chris Fucking Keisha Now He Flirting With Felisha/
Awww Shit Go Call Tameka/
That's Why Yall Sitting On The Bleachers/
Cause We Don't Like Them Girls Who Run They Mouth Like Some Sneakers/
But On A Different Day Another Dollar/
Hopping On The Bus Couple Quarters Crispy Collar/
To Get Up On The Scene/
Tryna Make A Pile Of Green Like A Lawn Cut/
Neva In The Bin And I'm Never Getting Washed Up/
Mind On The Prize/
Some Pray To Allah/
Some Pray To God/
Word To The Wisdom Of The Lawd/
While I'm Focused On My Future/
Girls Bust It Open Karma-sutra/
All These Hoes Evil Like Medusa/
Words From My Mama/
Birth In The East Like A Lama/
I Love To Kill Rap Fitted Armour/
One Time/City Engage/
We Keep It Real For The Minimum Wage/
Yea We Ready Foreal Nigga/
