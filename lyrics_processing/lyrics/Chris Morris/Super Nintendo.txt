Verse 1: On This Super Nintendo I Go So Hard/
My Light Bill Large And I Ain't Paying the rent bro/
And If They Cut It Shit That's What My Friends For/
I'm All Up In They Crib Tryna Play My Nintendo/
And If They kick Me Out Shit Back To My Moms Crib/
Lasted Bout A Mouth Started Nagging Bout Job Shit/
Now I'm On The Corner Selling Cookies And Corn Chips/
Life's All A Fight And I Ain't Ready To Forfeit/
I'm Off At 8 And I'm Ready To play/
With A License To Kill Any Cat In The Way/
Street Fighters My Game Mortal Kombat The Same/
Ryu And Liu Kang With Send Your Ass To The Japan/
You might also likeBet 5 And Its On/
A Fireball To Chest/
Finish Off With A Combo And Put Em To Rest/
Moms Yelling For Chores And My Girl Say's She's Bored/
So I Turn Off The Game And I'll Be Back In The Morn/
Yeah I'll Be Back In The Morn/

Verse 2: The Party Over Here's Kinda Live Drink Chill In My Hand/
I'm Whipping On These Cats Girls Yelling I'm The Man/
Street Fighter Champ 6 Times In a Row/
And I Even Got A Belt Here To Show/
I'm Loving How I Live And I Neva Wanna Change/
Neva With The Chains Or Whips I'm No Slave/
Illiterate Cats And Non Sayers Are To Blame/
I Rather Play These Games Than Wear The Same Thing As These Lames
So I Sit Back Relax Sip On This Cognac And Black
On Any Cat who Force Hands /
Ain't Showing Remorse Man/
The ILLest When It Comes To These Floor Plans/
Knocking Cats Over Like Door Stands/
I'm Loving The Crew/
While We Sip on This Brew/
While We Check out These Star's Till The Sky Turn's Blue/
Making Time For These Broads But I'm Focused On You/
And Any One Could See How My Love Is So True/
And Its All For/
