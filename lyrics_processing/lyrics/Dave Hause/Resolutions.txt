Get the hell out of this city, take a drive out to the lake
Maybe a class or charity work, something healthy for a change
I don't know, I don't know
Resolutions, resolutions, a little too much sin
I want to play my Al Green records and spend more time with Tim
I want to get out in the sunshine and take some of it in
Take it slow, just take it slow
I want to shed my skin
I rode around today
The things we've known feel like they're dying a little everyday
Revolution, revolution, oh give me a break
The signs all read foreclosure the more we work the less we make
Did you hear they locked up Jimmy and his kids are with the state?
Work got slow, I guess work got slow
Resolutions, resolutions meet me for a drink
I can't call out sick again, I've used up all my days
It takes a lot of medicine to keep up with the pace
Come on let's go, come on let's go
I want to shed my skin
I rode around today
The things we've known feel like they're dying a little everyday
I want to shed my skin
We can't go on this way
The things we've known feel like they're dying a little everyday
Everyday
