Our heroes didn't work like our daddies did
They dazzled us with TV through sleepy lids
We followed hulking maniacs to prozac nation
"You can be anything, just get your education"
We were good Christian kids
Went to church on Sunday mornings like mama did
Teenage love made us feel guilty and so we hid
Under those overpasses on summer nights
We'd tear each other's clothes off
And get into fights
Then we roared right through our twenties
Never bargained for a crash
Watched our hollow dreams get buried
Under heaps of plastic trash
Broken promises to children leave indelible impressions
Welcome to the great depression
We were our father's sons
Playing war on weekend days with our plastic guns
Catching up with who we were through the reruns
"Eat your vitamins and say your prayers
You'll become doctors, lawyers and millionaires"
We were misguided girls
Tried to fuck our way through such a distorted world
Confusing love with sex and plastic with pearls
"Get what you can for yourself, leave the rest behind"
It's freedom forever 'til your card gets declined

Never bargained for a crash
Watching hollow dreams get buried
Under heaps of plastic trash
Broken promises to children leave indelible impressions
Welcome to the great depression
Did he die for your sins?
Did he leave us for dead?
If you wanted us safe why would you fuck with our heads?
The factory's gone, the loans are foreclosed
But there's some places left that remind me of home
Just give me one place left that reminds me of home
The lifeboat is looking pretty full
If you find some room reach out and give me a pull
The way we learned to live is fading fast
