The orange sky don't seem to mind but I'm on the edge of my seat
There's ten thousand auto lights dead stopped in dirty Tucson heat
We crane our necks to get a glimpse, and ride on by while I nurse defeat
Nurse defeat
It's that same old sinking feeling, that blows on in from time to time
The only consolation comes tying despair to a rhyme
And knowing some are at home working, raising kids and saying prayers
Unaware of modern science, they may be wrong but I don't care
They pray for Tucson, they pray for me
They pray these roads lead home and won't take us too far
Take us too far
Well we get these years to play with and I've been game to roll the dice
But lately staring in the mirror has been showing me the price
Of all the reckless toxic gambling; having my fate hang from a string
The lonesome nights with pills and powders, the fuel I pretend helps me sing
So pray for Tucson, pray for me
Pray these roads lead home and won't take us too far
Pray for Tucson, pray for me
I hope your faith is what will carry me
If there's something past those stars
See Dave Hause LiveGet tickets as low as $27You might also likeCause the spell breaks every time I see those funeral cars
Or when they throw the floodlights on and I'm left stranded at the bar
I spend so many nights tempting fate with this guitar but I'm coming home
So pray for Tucson, pray for me
Pray these roads lead home and won't take us too far
Pray for Tucson, pray for me
Pray these roads lead home and won't take us too far
Pray for Tucson, pray for me
Pray for Tucson, I hope your faith is what will carry me
