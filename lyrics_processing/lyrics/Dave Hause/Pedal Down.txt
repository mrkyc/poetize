Has it kicked in yet?
The guy who sold it said you'll start to sweat
Your stomach churns, like you've got to confess
Grab the last of it, the sun just set
Keep the windshield clear
All the shaking makes it hard to steer
Getting jumpy like an auctioneer
Am I the headlights or am I the deer?
You told our half-truths to the neighbors
Tried not to look them in the eye
We headed out when the sun went down
Driving north on 95

We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down
We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down
Keep the pedal down

Has it sunk in yet?
When you see it, you can't forget
There's a window while the concrete's wet
It's kinda looking like the footprints set
See Dave Hause LiveGet tickets as low as $27You might also like
We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down
We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down

That say "you make such good parents
It sounds like old-fashioned fun"
We fall in love by the iPhone light
One each, a daughter and a son
We lead our lambs to slaughter
It's profit, bootstraps and guns
Every God needs a sacrifice
Honey, what have we done?
What the fuck have we done?

Is anyone out there? Is this thing on?
The temple is sacked and the healers are gone
You'll turn into a pillar of salt if you dare turn around
Is anyone out there? Is this thing on?
The temple is sacked and the healers are gone
You'll turn into a pillar of salt if you dare turn around
Don't you dare turn around
We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down

We can grieve it later
Keep the pedal down
Keep the pedal down
