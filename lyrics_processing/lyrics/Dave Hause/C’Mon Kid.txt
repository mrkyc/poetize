Even though things are falling apart
I know it's brutal working minimum wage
It's like you're finished before you start
Things got ugly for a while back there
I know I thought that you wouldn't pull through
Late at night when the phone would ring
There's no telling what you would do
Sometimes we'd yell and act mad as hell
Sometimes we'd act like we didn't care
Some of our love was just suffocating
It left you turning blue and gasping for air
C'mon kid, c'mon, it's one foot and then the other
Everybody needs a hand sometimes, everybody needs a brother
Well c'mon kid, c'mon, I'm reaching out to you
Get out of bed kid, face the world, and show us what you can do
I'm sorry I was always casting stones
Like my glass house couldn't be smashed
I spent as many nights as wild as a lion
I was lucky that I never crashed
Look, I've never really been no angel
I see a lot of myself in you
This little town can feel a lot like prison and angry young men
Angry young men always have something to prove
Always have something to prove

Well c'mon kid, c'mon, I'm reaching out to you
Get out of bed kid, face the world, and show us what you can do
I know you ended up with bills to pay
I know she promised you that she would stay
I know they told you he died for your sins and he's the only way
I know it caught you by surprise
I got a call that you almost died
Second chances are a crime to waste
So don't let time decide
