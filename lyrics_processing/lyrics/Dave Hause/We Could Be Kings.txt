So this is rejection
And it's bringin' you down
He told you that he'd find work soon
Then he stopped comin' around
That was the summer of sweet nights
He used to take you for rides
But it all changed in the backseat
He came inside

Well, he's seen enough to know
He's old enough to know what's right from wrong
But I know how hard it is to see things through

Oh no, did it rip you apart?
To be told we could be kings
When we were damned from the start
Oh no, did it rip you apart?
They told us we could be kings
When we were damned, damned from the start

You told him you loved him
But push had come to shove
There were no easy answers
Mixin' money and blood
He was too young to know better
And we were all unemployed
The sergeant promised a cake walk
But then he got deployed

I've seen enough, enough to know
It's not about which side you're on
I know how hard it is to keep it in

Oh no, did it rip you apart?
To be told we could be kings
When we were damned from the start
I know that it ripped you apart
They told us we could be kings
When we were damned, damned from the start

We've been living to the left of the dial
Hopin' drinks and denial will keep us here
I'm not promising you some bright side
Or tryin' to break your stride
But you asked me, you asked me
He was gone in an instant
They said nobody was spared
Not gonna tell you he loved you
Not gonna tell you he cared
(You asked me, you asked me)

Well, I've seen enough, enough to know
Sometimes with the truth you gotta let it go
I know how hard it is to keep it in
(You asked me, you asked me)
(You asked me)
I won't go and rip you apart
And tell you you could be king
I don't want to break your heart
I won't go and rip you apart
So open wide and just sing
'Cause we're all damned
Open wide and just sing
'Cause we're all damned, damned from the start
