But I'm older now, I don't believe in it
Cause I've seen what it does, what it does
And I don't see how it's worth it all
Because...
It's not the same when you're gone
You left me all alone...
The hardest part is knowing I've done nothing wrong
Why don't you stay for a little while?
I'll make you say you love me
I know I can do that
Why don't you trust me one more time?
And let me help make up your mind
I could have sworn we were just fine...
How can you not know that you're mine?
This is not what I expected from you...
As I'm sitting here, and not knowing what to do...
To make you see, to make you realize
That God is faithful, he provides
He's held our hands through the fire
He's givin' us our desire, so I
I won't fight, I won't bite
Cause He's the one who shows me love
Though I can't see past the pain
My God is still the same
Oh, I'm desperate to feel your breath
Dear God, give me rest...
Oh no... Give me rest
Give me rest...
Why don't you stay for a little while?
I'll make you say you love me
I know I can do that...
Why don't you trust me one more time?
And let me help make up your mind
I could have sworn we were just fine...
I must be going out of my mind!
How can you not know that you're mine?
Why can't you see that...
You should stay for a little while
I'll make you say you love me
I know I can do that
Why don't you trust me one more time?
And let me help make up your mind?
I could've sworn we were just fine
