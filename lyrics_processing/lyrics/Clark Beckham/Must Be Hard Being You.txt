You're in a movie
I'm watching the scene
Bet there don't seem to be screen
Girl, it's confusing
How can it be that you shwed up in reality?
I bet you never paid for drinks
Or waited in line for anything

But if you were with me
I wouldn't need to dream
If you were with me

All of the birds singing under your feet
Must be hard being you
Wherever you go people give up their seat
Must be hard being you

Baby, give me a break
You got me stunned
It's like I'm staring straight into the sun
Oh, I know you never pay for drinks
Baby, wait, stop
You don't pay for anything
You might also like
But if you were with me
I wouldn't need to dream
If you were with me

All of the birds singing under your feet
Must be hard being you (It's must be hard)
Wherever you go people give up their seat
Must be hard being you
(Break it down)

But if you were with me (If you were with me)
I wouldn't need to dream
If you were with me

All of the birds singing under your feet
Must be hard being you (Must be hard being you)
Wherever you go people give up their seat
Must be hard being you (Must be hard)
All of the birds singing under your feet
Must be hard being you (It's must be hard)
Wherever you go people give up their seat
Must be hard being you (Must be hard)
Yeah, take it down
Must be hard being you
Oh, take it back up
Come on now
Must be hard being you
Hard being you
Must be hard being you
Must be hard being you
Oh, I think it must be hard being you
Hard being you
