Yeah, I got bitches on my dick and I ain't even got a dick
Yeah, I know I get 'em sick, I saw your nigga on my hip
This money in a Gucci clip, you know that I don't ever trip
Just got back from another trip, no acrobat, I make it flip
Bitch, I got a family, everybody gotta eat
So keep that shit in mind when you thinkin' about tryin' me
I know what I'm doin', you ain't gotta keep an eye on me
I be countin' money like how they be countin' calories
I got her mad at me, 21, make twenty thousand a show
That's your salary, smokin' green like celery
You can't get the best of me, these white people invest in me
You know I got the recipe
Worst nightmare and your biggest fuckin' enemy

If you feelin' like a boss bitch, go'n
Go to the club, leave that nigga at home
If you got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl
Niggas be hatin' on bitches
You know these niggas be hatin' on bitches
You know these niggas be hatin' on bitches
You got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl
Niggas be hatin' on bitches

I'm the one with the sauce and that's so easy to see
I got 'em in the house wonderin' how it's easy for me
I went from one bedroom apartments in the trenches
To wakin' up and it's Versace all on my pillows, I just don't get it
Just got a quarter-million dollar check, I work like I get it
I just got my first crib, it's stainless steel in the kitchen
I be playing with them bags even though that it ain't Christmas
I'm just speakin' straight facts and I hope that you listen
I'm like a star in the sky, they wishin' on me to finish
I knew the money would come to me 'cause my palms kept on itchin'
I knew that bitches would run from me when I pulled up on bitches
But it's okay 'cause I know the game and I played my position

If you feelin' like a boss bitch, go'n
Go to the club, leave that nigga at home
If you got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl
Niggas be hatin' on bitches
You know these niggas be hatin' on bitches
You know these niggas be hatin' on bitches
You got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl
