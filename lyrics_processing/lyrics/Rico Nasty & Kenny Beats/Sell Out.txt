Woah, Kenny

I'm the best at being me, a lot of y'all can't relate
The only thing I care about is if it's food on my plate
Every time I hit the stage it be a sold-out date
Remember back when I used to sit in line and wait
Now it's mine I take, every time they hate
Man, these people don't know shit about the time it take
Try to box me in, I don't need no oxygen
You could leave me to die, I was born to win
You just gotta love yourself
Don't worry about what everyone is doing or did
You think you're down but you could get left
Don't worry about where everyone is going or been
I done did some fucked up shit in the past but I know that the Lord forgive
I remember dark nights, I would pray to God and he granted my every wish

Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
You might also like
The expression of anger is a form of rejuvenation
I'm screaming inside of my head in hopes that I'm easing the pain
Memories in my brain, thinkin' I'm going insane
Everyone knowing my name but somehow I'm feeling the same
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
'Cause they just want to tell me about how I helped them out
I won't let them down
You guys are so strong and you don't even know it
People hate you 'cause you're different and focused
People hated me so I flipped it
And turned my emotions to something y'all could sing to
'Cause some of y'all have been through the same shit I've been through
So listen when I tell you
Don't ever buy the dreams that these niggas try to sell you
Don't ever try to bite the same hand that fed you
Everything I did is for the moment that it led to

Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, yeah, woah
(Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out)
Yeah, yeah, woah
(Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out)
Haha
Do you feel better now?
Good
You're welcome
