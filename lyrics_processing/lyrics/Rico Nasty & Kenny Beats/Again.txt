Woah, Kenny

I don't have a choice, I gotta run it up
I got me a little change but it's just not enough
Thought I fell in love but I found out that it was lust
I felt like something was missing, it must have been trust
Don't like to talk about growing up, because I had it rough
But you know good and well I'm not the one to put your pity on
Everywhere I go, I put my motherfuckin' city on (City on)
I be high, I be gone, I be right, I be wrong

But I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again
I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again

Sometimes I get distracted by madness
Why do tragedies happen? What if I'm not adapting?
Friends posting pictures, I'm like where was I when this happened?
People looking at me funny, it's like money's the magnet
It's like I'm doing magic, the way I flip it and bag it
Shit might go wrong, I don't panic
I know I got some bad habits, but who doesn't?
No discussion, I ain't bluffing, I do this shit like it's nothing
Put my all into something, yeah, I came up from nothing

But I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again
I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again

Well now, if there's anything you should need, just let me know
I'd be very pleased to do it for you
