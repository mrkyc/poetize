Like, this is some professional, like
And this, this **** is in different areas
What the ****?
This ain't no homemade ****
Umm, huh, Rico

What the ****?

People keep tryna test my gangster
Pull up on your block with a mask like Jason
I don't really got no patience
I can never wait on a nigga to come save me, yeah
This pussy gon' drive you crazy (Uh)
Ridin' in a new all-black Mercedes (What?)
Eyes real low so my vision too hazy
Put a button on your soul like it's Driving Miss Daisy
Rico, are you crazy?
I don't know, maybe (Woah)
Take the air out you, Tom Brady
I do this shit on the daily, I don't ask for shit, I demand it
Windows rolled up, hotboxin' in traffic
Sauce keep leakin' on me, yeah, I need a bandage
Feds get behind me, then my niggas gon' handle
Sit down if you can't stand it

Damage how I'm crimpin'
Treat you like gum, spit you out if I ain't feeling you
I just wanna know why all these bitches so predictable (Woah)
I can never be typical
Don't come out the house unless I'm wearin' something whimsical
From where I made it out, they lookin' at me like a miracle (Yeah)
Don't say shit you don't mean 'cause I'm literal
If you put your money up to mine, your money miniature
Game over, wasted, finish it, rub it in your face if you ain't listenin'
Diamonds on me wet, I'm like a fisherman
I do the shit you can't do with no middleman
People keep sayin' that I'm rude, I don't give a shit
Stop comparin' me to bitches that I'm better than
Rico goin' hard again, go ahead and tell a friend
I be the tension all in the room like an elephant
Walk up in the club and make it rain like the weatherman
Money layin' everywhere, I ain't ever playin' fair
You don't wanna take it there, she told me to go to hell
I told her, "I'll see you there," life was a nightmare
Turned into a fairy tale, five-star hotel
No more motel, eatin' on oxtail
Bitches on my coattail, singin' to the money like I was Adele
I like it all to myself, I don't share
Say she ain't like me, bitch
I don't give a fuck
