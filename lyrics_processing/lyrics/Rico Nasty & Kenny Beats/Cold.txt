Hey, you there?
Aren't you tired of the same old thing?
At every day, every minute, every second
Everybody, everything?
Kenny

It be the same thing, just on a different day
This ain't no bud, this shit ain't gon' fade away
No, it won't fade away, shots like a fade-away
Smile in a hater's face, watch what the fuck you say
I got some crazy ways, do it like Simon says
Look at my diamonds dance, born in a lion's den
If you ain't got it, then why you be lyin' then?
Don't do no arguin', we do the opposite
Niggas go crazy, got hands like an octopus
Niggas ain't stoppin' us, bitches be watchin' and clockin' us
She wanna be me, it's obvious, we pulling up in them Tonka trucks
You be steady driving Impalas, bumblebees all on my collar
Is my name Lonzo? I'm ballin', ballin'
Let me know, give me a holla, put on a show, no Apollo
Clap it up on me like brothel, I'm busy, please don't bother
Make more money than your father, can't get to me, why bother?
I just left from the Bahamas, my money keep getting longer
Walk in, I smell like marijuana

She can try but she don't compete ('Pete, 'pete)
When I pull up, you know it's me (Me, me)
Ain't none of these bitches cold as me (Me, me)
Cross you just like a rosary ('Ry, 'ry)
Sauced up, I got a bowl on me (Me, me)
These VVS's, these ain't see-through (What?)
You talkin' tough then you get beat (What? What?)
Fuck a cop, you copped a plea (Let's go)

None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
I swear none of these bitches cold as me, me, me (Go)
None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
I swear ain't none of these bitches cold as me, me

Riding in a Maserati, like Scotty I'm with two hotties
I ain't just walk in the party, I brought the drugs to the party
Weed smell like somebody farted, I finish that shit and start it
A push to start, it be my car, because my car is always foreign
If I got the ball, I'm scorin', new car and the engine roarin'
Make it rain, it started pourin', I feel so fly, I started soarin'
Don't cost us whenever I'm tourin', these bitches basic and borin'
Tryna keep up but you can't afford it, my ego big, I'm so important
She can try but she don't compete ('Pete, 'pete)
When I pull up, you know it's me (Me, me)
Ain't none of these bitches cold as me (Me, me)
Cross you just like a rosary ('Ry, 'ry)
Sauced up, I got a bowl on me (Me, me)
These VVS's, these ain't see-through (What?)
You talkin' tough then you get beat (What? What?)
Fuck a cop, you copped a plea (Let's go)

None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
I swear none of these bitches cold as me, me, me (Go)
None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
