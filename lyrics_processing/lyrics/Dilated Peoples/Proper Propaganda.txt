We're coming to you live from the Scottish Rite Temple
Near the intersection of Crenshaw and Wiltshire
Where, as you can see in the background
Military personnel are mobilized and waiting orders
Despite the quiet and the deceptive calm, tension is still
Thick in the air after last night's concert and rebellion
The incident was allegedly sparked by police officers trying
To shut down a reportedly peaceful concert by hip-hop artists Dilated Peoples
We'll keep you updated with any new developments
For Triclops Media Watch, this is Harry Allen
Hip-hop activist and media assassin
And now, Proper Propaganda

We handle it, these brothers are fabulous
Dilated's showing you what rhyme travel is
Words spitoon from sunlight to moon
Busting on stage like gunfights in saloons
Click-clack, pull my mic back, you like that
Journalists, we're journalists too, we could strike back
Hardcore reporters with orders from headquarters
Behind enemy lines, sidestepping the borders
Repressed caps, we bring it to you as it happens
The streets love my crew from music to rapping
Street commander slash beat expander
Here to fight the slander with the proper propaganda
What's happening, you got a question then ask it
The news is just a TV show, get past it
And this from a quiet wartime journalist
Headlines, wake up, refuse and resist
Resist, like this, like this
Like thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-this, y'all

We kick finance action, and scores of sports
Politics, new fashion and war reports
Entertainment, when we come to perform
Watch, the illest weatherman in the biz with the storm watch
Triclops Media, record, tape and TV, Net radio, CD or DVD
Iriscience, write rhymes on picket signs
This is why Babu is scratching and keeping time

The pen is mightier than the sword
Cause the pen gives the word sending swords to war
They twisted it when he pulled Mao Tse-Tung
And said political power comes from the barrel of a gun
The officer meets his fate, .44 by .38
It was a dirty deed, but that don't mean a dirty case
Witnesses against the state are shushed
Facts overlooked so the judge can throw the book
Perhaps for politicians with something to prove
In the city where they blew the roof off of M.O.V.E
Questions when answered leads to more questions
Why it take months to deliver a confession
The principles are the same even without the name
But I still say M-U-M-I-A
I have to fight, it could easily be me
But just being the thinker than speaking it freely
Although I use my brain before using a fist
Don't push it, wake up, refuse and resist
