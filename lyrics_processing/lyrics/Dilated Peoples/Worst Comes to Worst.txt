Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
Worst come to worst
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
Worst come to worst
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first

Yo, some people got good friends
At night, I live my life right
Intense, on the edge, on the wire
I'm from the group where friction leads to fire
Stack your bricks, the time is take your pick
Do or don't, the track? Alchemist
Yo, my life is good, I got my peeps in the mix, so
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first

I got worldwide family all over the Earth
And I worry bout 'em all, for whatever it's worth
From the birth to the hearse, through streets the guns burst
Words I disperse are here to free minds
And if mine are needy, I need to feed mine
When worst come to worst
You might also like
Set up shop and write a verse
Actually, that's best come to best
My lyrics take care of me, they therapy; get shit off my chest
X the stress, three-four over the score
Different patterns of rhymin' prepare me for war
So next time you see us, we'll be deadly on tour
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first

Word up, if worst comes to worst, I make whole crews disperse
You know it's family first
Gifted Unlimited with Dilated Peoples
Babu, Evidence, Iriscience
And a shout-out to my man Alchemist on the trizzack

I'm a glutton for the truth, even though truth hurts
I've studied with my peoples on streets and in Church
We make it hard when we go on first
Long road, honor of the samurai code
These California streets ain't paved with gold
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
I got the back, at the end of the day
We could go our separate ways, but the songs remains
It won't change; got my target locked at range
I might switch gears, but first I switch lanes
Without my people, I got nothin' to gain, that's why..
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first

Special victims unit, catalyst for movement
Create to devastate, since '84 show 'n provin'
Definitely Dilated Peoples comes first
Cross-trainin' spar, we raise the bar
And we put it in your ear no matter who you are

Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
Worst come to worst
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
Worst come to worst
Worst come to worst, my peoples come first
My peoples come first
My peoples come first
Oh, when you need me...
D-I to L to A
Dilated, Dilated Peoples, Dilated y'all
Dilated Peoples, I roll with the fo' show logo the open eye
Dilated, Peoples, that's the record
We got you Dilated, Dilated, Dilated, Dilated peoples
