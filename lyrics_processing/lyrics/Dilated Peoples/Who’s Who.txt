It's 12 o'clock...
AM
What up?
Sound the alarm!

Check it, yo!
She loves me not, she loves me, loves me not
But I don't let it bug me the clubs be hot
Hugs at the list you should become a surgeon
We step up to the spot, it's like they open up the curtains
We toasted the second round coming right up
We be VIP we got new ways to light up
I don't pay the mack or pay the MAC for access
Charge it to the gate save receipts for taxes

Yo, evidence, back on the case, I'm hyped up
100,000 watts, my set list typed up
Dilated, wherever we go we might just
Blow the show and turn the party into a nightclub
Ladies, my thirteenth star of the game
I rap caffeine, next LP spit cocaine
After that we might clear the lane
Blackout come back and do this shit again

Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
Party people what you tryin' to do
We see y'all, what you tryin' to do, huh?
You on the floor, what you tryin' to do?
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
You with the girl, what you tryin' to do?
We see y'all, Dilated, what you tryin' to do, huh?
Who's who, what you tryin' to do?

Platform dropped in May 2G
(2001) Next year came Expansion Team
(2 and 3) we toured and we hit the scene
It's '04 we're back, all drink for free

Cheers! My team got the bombest green
Smell-proof bag so we don't cause a scene
Readin' TV, magazines and diplo schemes
Big smoke out the sunroof of limousines

See them come see them go it's our turn next to blow
It's our turn to burn think fast and talk slow
She got ass I might speak my flow
Stay on top of our game and I'm gon' squash the pros
The whole place is packed of course the bar's flooded
Rappers and actors and models, it's star-studded
Beat junkies mixin' and rippin' it apart, cuttin'
Shorty's doin' hard on the floor, they all love it

Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
Party people what you tryin' to do
We see y'all, what you tryin' to do, huh?
You on the floor, what you tryin' to do?
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
You with the girl, what you tryin' to do?
We see y'all, Dilated, what you tryin' to do, huh?
Who's who, what you tryin' to do?

Oh oh oh yeah!
Keep it movin'

Zulu, Gestopo metropolitan tropical
International local the family's unstoppable
Y'all ready to move? Rock's ready too?
B-boys and B-girls, this is rock steady crew
It's called cool earth flip breaks out the crates
They took it out from the top rockin' the real estate
It's the LA breakers and I have to stay
Peace to Grand Wizard Theodore and Jazzy Jay
Once again, we hit the nail on the head
It's dedicated to the ladies and my so-called friends
Smile in my face, then behind me call trash
Mad as what, tryin' to get where I'm at
Stay at this, batting in, target practice
Blast off, we kill till tracks tap the mattress
Who's who? That's your friends? That's my crew
We all dilated he's back and he's Babu

Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
Party people what you tryin' to do
We see y'all, what you tryin' to do, huh?
You on the floor, what you tryin' to do?
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or them?
You with the girl, what you tryin' to do?
We see y'all, Dilated, what you tryin' to do, huh?
