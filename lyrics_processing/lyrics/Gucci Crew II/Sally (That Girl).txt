And I woke up early this morning and I went to the 5 and dime
I saw this pretty young lady that was real, real fine
I tapped her on the shoulder and said, "Mmm, mmm, excuse me, ma'am"
She pulled down her pants and said, "Splack these hams"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally "That Girl"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
So we walked her to her house, as she opened up the door
It was a heart-shaped bed in the middle of the floor
She pushed me on the bed and this you can bet
In between her legs was real, real wet
So I grabbed her by her thighs and I moved up truly
She jumped off the bed and said, "Don't touch my booty"
"Don't touch my booty 'cause I won't touch you"
"Don't touch my booty 'cause it's not the thing to do"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
So we bailed out her house just to get something to eat
We saw her friend named Patty walkin' down the street
Patty turned around as we yelled out her name
She dropped to her knee and began to sing

Sally, whew, "That Girl"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
Sally is a girl that likes to play
And if you want some lovin' Sally is okay
She has a different fellow every day of the week
Two or maybe three just to make it sweet
Sally wants a man she can call her own
And sixty-seven hundred she can call on the phone
Sally's never tired and she's never alone
All Sally wants is a fellow with a room
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, "That Girl"
