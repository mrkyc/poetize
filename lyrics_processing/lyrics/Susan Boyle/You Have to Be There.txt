That i am not seeing?
What in my ignorant prayers
Am i failing to say?
Never before have i questioned the truth of your being
Never once have i dared
Never until today
All of a tremble
I stand on the edge of confusion
Who is to save me
If into the darkness i fall?
Now that i need more than ever my god to be near me
Do you hear when i call?
Are you there after all?
You have to be there, you have to
My life i have placed in thy keep
And without you i am drifting on a dark and stormy sea
You have to be there, you have to
Without you i'd drown in the deep
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
I reach for your hand
And when i die will throw open his arms to receive me?
Who will forgive me and take me and show me his face?
When i go to my rest, who will watch me and wake me?
When my time comes at last, will you grant me your grace?
I am so small on this earth, i am nothing without you
Daring to doubt you at all is a knife to my heart
Little by little i'm losing my way in the shadows
I am losing my hope and the world falls apart
You might also likeYou do have to be there, you have to
My life i have placed in thy keep
And without you i am drifting on a dark and stormy sea
You have to be there, you have to
Without you i'd drown in the deep
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
I reach for your hand
You have to be there, you have to
Without you i'd drown in the deep
Too far, too far from land
The waters drag me down
