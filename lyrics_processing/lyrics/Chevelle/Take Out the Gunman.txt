When the light
Hit me right in the temple
Felt something cold
Touch my toes as it passed
Might not be
The face you'd expect
But he's clearly insane
Got me pegged in the back
Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman
Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Huge
So little left if something
Cracks and clues
He's crazy as a straw
Why... Denied... Does no one care or nothing
How, they ask, I ever last so long
Cause I, I went blind
A blinding riot
He's regretting every word
Those empty lies
One more tonight
My blinding riot
As I summon every nerve
Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman
Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out
Gonna take out
Gonna take out
Gonna take out
Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman
Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
I'm so amazed at the way
We televise
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
