'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

It goes like this, uh
See, when I was young I met a chick
She said "Hello", I went red a bit
I just moved school, I was all alone
So her "Hello" made me more at home
We talked a bit on the phone
But she had up a wall of stone
She told me that her parents sucked
I was like, "Well, fair enough"
I just regret I never asked
Why the hell you so scared of trust?
And what the hell's inside your soul?
'Cause I don't believe your smile at all
Guess it slipped my silly mind
I couldn't tell this at the time
She was depressed and then she left
Haven't seen her since that recess
I guess she's

A year ago my friend mentioned her
"Remember her?" I'm like, "Yes, sir"
Haven't thought about her in forever
I hope she's doing a lot better
He's like, "Ah, nah, she's lost control
I saw that chick, she's on the pole"
I'm like, "What pole? The voting poll?
The North Pole? The totem pole?"
He's like, "Nah, dog, she's stripping now"
I'm like, "Nah, I'm sure you're tripping out
You're smoking crack and sniffing powder"
That couldn't be, she wouldn't think about it
She's too proud, she's too smart
She's too nice, she's too young
But now I know something new, huh?
How far she'll go to shoot up
How far she'll go to shoot up
How far she'll go to shoot up
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Angels to fly
