Friday every night, baby
In our tormented minds, baby
We gettin' older, gettin' wise, baby
But we're still young like a second wife, baby
She drop it low to stay warm, she got nothing on
North Melbourne at a party on something strong
In the studio, tryna make a summer song
But winter's dark and long and all the colour's gone
Do you dream in Kodachrome? (Drinking)
We deal with shit that no-one knows (No-one knows)
Blow it 'til we overblown, yeah, dose 'til we overdose
Wearin' all black, rest in peace, Jonah Lomu
Yeah, I might say I won't but you know I'm going to
Better get them fingers rolling
On a tram with the junkies sitting on it

If I'm tripping, yeah, say I'm tripping
North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
A very strange young lady, ooh
These North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
Been trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on you

Cheap wine for the lost souls
Don't wait, drank it straight from the bottle
Okay, Swede 'em all like Stockholm
This is our city, not yours
Medication for your trepidation, yeah
Love was murdered by our generation
We're so isolated and the night is young
We could die waiting for our time to come
So lose yourself, but not too much
If there are lies, it's not true love
Everybody suing us for doing us
Everybody doing us for doing us
So fuck are y'all saying? Fuck are y'all taking?
They'll go to your parties, drink your liquor, steal your pharmies

If I'm tripping, then say I'm tripping
North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
A very strange young lady, ooh
These North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
They're trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on you

We go together like chips and seagulls
In the sand with rubbish and needles
We were in her vehicle driving across the night
That was right before I lost my mind
She told me, "Don't stress so much"
Where there's smoke there's stoners
Homie, if I'm dying, I better be overdosing

If I'm tripping, then say I'm tripping
North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
A very strange young lady, ooh
These North Melbourne girls go crazy, oh
