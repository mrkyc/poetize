I ain't been to Tokyo, never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking god like I just won a grammy
Like I won a grammy
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing

Lookin' at you now and it have me going wild
Did two pills back at the show tonight
Got me spending money like a dad with no time
Got me spending time like a dad when he retire
I was dreaming of this rap shit back in '09
They were laughing at the battles and it made me so defiant
With a backpack, rapping on tracks that no one liked
Ain't the same one that I carry on my flights
That was 300 bucks from an online store
That use to be a weeks pay oh my god
Now I'm halfway there at least quasi toward
What I said I'd do I gave my whole life for it
Never went to school: Ferris Bueller
When I was starving, now my belly fuller
Got me thinking of the girls who took it
Back when I had not any moolah
Just singing
You might also like
I ain't been to Tokyo, never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking god like I just won a grammy
Like I won a grammy
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing

I got some thoughts, so let me think
I've been sober for a month I need a fucking drink
I'm going crazy like two bottles to the facey
Pop two Xannys, smoke a blunt and write a song with Marc E Bassy
Mom thinks I'm a drunk, the label says I'm lazy
High with my therapist, been high since I dropped Phases
Different faces, different friends, different ages, lot of changes
Spent 20k up in May, but it was nothing, I was bluffing

I ain't been to Tokyo, never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking god like I just won a grammy
Like I won a grammy
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing
Never win a grammy for this bullshit
I'll probably never get married to a woman
I'll probably be back in my mum's garage choofin
And if your weed refracts light then it's good shit
But I need awards like a need a new chick
Not at all they both make me too sick
Say I'm a square like cubic, the truth is
I prefer being indoors making music
I thought I was getting married to a girl
Already did so much damage to myself
Said that I won't start travelling the world
Till they pay me then my rapping start to sell
I'm going on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
You know the time is wrong for guarantees
Like a watch without no batteries
I'm not real honest but I'm not quite a liar
New girl on the pole like a damn fire fighter
Her genes so good that I bust right inside her
Never meet your idols never fuck your idols either

I ain't been to Tokyo, never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking god like I just won a grammy
Like I won a grammy
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
Ooh girl got me singing, ooh girl got me singing
Ooh girl let me see it, ooh girl I'ma eat it
