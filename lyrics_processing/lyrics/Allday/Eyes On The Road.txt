Eyes on the road, yeah

Now I got the prettiest looker
Slap her on the butt like, "Gimme some sugar"
I don't know love but the feeling is right
We fuck until we think we know the meaning of life
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
I can see my future and I think it is bright
But my parents keep saying a degree would be nice
But I tell 'em I don't need their advice
I'm driving 'round town, high beamin' my lights
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
It's not that easy to decide your pathway
Had to quit believing that this life's a party
If you want a wife, she wants a guy with money
Do you want me and my life with nothing?

Seven lonely dollars in my bank account
Next month's rent in major doubt
Driving 'round town, playing Take Care loud
With the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down

Yeah, uh, my parents keep giving me a telling off
"You're twenty-one already, all that's in your head is rocks",
They say, maybe I should cut my hair short
But no, no, no, I don't care for it
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
Fuck you, fuck that, I just wanna get across
Everything is perfect right now, hope it never stops
'Til I'm on the radio and I'm on the telly
And I'm living out these happy days like I'm Fonzarelli
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
Yes, I don't have a boss or a desk chair
Just a room full of fans saying, "Hell yeah"
And a closet full of clothes that are threadbare
All the windows are down, I'm breathing fresh air

Seven lonely dollars in my bank account
Next month's rent in major doubt
Driving 'round town, playing Take Care loud
With the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down
Fucking bottle of whatever mixed with O.J
Homemade bong, feel like a cake lord, I'm so baked
On the home straight, tryna drive home straight
Take a corner like I'm German made, I don't brake
But I'm Aussie made, golden-grade Irish flesh
Cast iron heart that I possess tucked inside my chest
Tired as heck, dreaming of my fiery death
If I don't explode my own skull, I'll probably die of stress
Beside myself like Siamese, all kinds of E's
Inside my palm to find some ease or try at least
I'd like to like the man I am, just so I can breathe
But the man inside of me, well, he's trying to leave
It's funny 'cause they'll call this my lyrical flow
The complexity of words near shits me though
I know they're serious, I'm growing weary though
