Back when life was suckin', uh, fuck that, we fuckin', uh
No hope, nothing, uh, fuck that, we fuckin', uh
Fuck that, we fuckin', uh, fuck that, we fuckin', uh
Fuck that, we fuckin', uh, fuck that, we fuckin'
Let me say

I was on a loan, once a night, taking money
At the motherfucking pizza parlour counter
Doing dishes super quick 'cause I'm tryna run and fight it
Now it's all I had it, what you know about it?
I was dripping in the shower, first train to the city
I would hop on all sodded from the rain when it hit me
I could make it but I hate it missing the Saturday, it's shitty
I'm addicted to these bitches
It's the greatest feeling when I'm in 'em like

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around

My mind in the summer heat, isn't it high?
Summers ago, I was sitting inside
Work and tell girls these ridiculous lies
Summer's ahead and I'm spittin', I'm spittin'
Just look at the pressure that sits in my mind
Seem like a difficult climb, now's like a different time
Nothing forgiven, no, nothing was given
Not giving, not giving, ah, thinking 'bout loss
Thinking 'bout spending out, thinking 'bout cost
Thinking 'bout rejection, not about rocks
Left it for a minute, now I'm digging out moss
Talking 'bout K, and I'm talking 'bout scum
Talking 'bout me, I can never outrun
And I'll never bow down, and wherever I come
I'm a winner right now and I'll tell you how come
We fuckin'

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around
My mind in the summer heat, places I'll be
Girls that are trouble keep making a scene
Crumbs on the floor and there's plates in the sink
In my room, lights off, it's midday, it's midday
She's shaking her tushy half-naked, I'm looking
No dream to speak of, I'm chasing some pussy
Why taking my serious, baking me cookies
Boy, are they tasty but really, but really
I don't care about shit
Got a little food and the friends that I'm with
Bet that I'll fuckin' chill where I sit
So why go and make it more complex than it is?
That's it, that's it, pessimistic 'til I turned it around
Made everything switch
Looking like in this life and repetitiveness
Don't tell me what it is, I'm sexting this bitch like "uh"

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We fuckin' like, we fuckin' now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Man, everything will come around
Life was suckin', fuck that, we fuckin'
No hope, nothing, fuck that, we fuckin'
Fuck that, we fuckin', uh, fuck that, we fuckin', uh
Fuck that, we fuckin', uh, fuck that, we fuckin'
