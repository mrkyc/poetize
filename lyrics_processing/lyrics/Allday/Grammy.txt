You are listening to another Allday Chubby Boy mixtape
Hosted by none other than me, Allday Chubby Boy

I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won, I won a

Looking at you now and it have me going wild
Did two pills back at the show tonight
Got me spending money like a dad with no time
Got me spending time like a dad when he retire
I was dreaming of this rap shit back in '09
Laughing at the battles and it had me so defiant
With a backpack, rapping on tracks that no one liked
Ain't the same one that I carry on my flights
That was 300 bucks from the online store
That used to be a week's pay, oh my God
Now I'm halfway there, at least quasi-toward
What I said I'd do, I gave my whole life for it
Never went to school, Ferris Bueller
When I was starving, now my belly fuller
Got me thinking of the girls who took it
Back when I had not any moolah
Now I'm singing

I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won, I won a

Wonder if I like the way I became
(Oh, fuck, I seriously don't know though)
I can't change anyway
Came a long way from the 8 o'clock train
Razor blade in my hand, tryna make it off safe
With my phone cut off, always pay it off late
Now a text in my phone and it's saying your name
Damn, girl, I could marry that booty in a chapel
Maybe even you as well
'Cause, baby, we're all living in a mad world
Told my brother, never trade for a bad girl
'Cause bad girls, there is always ample
And if she don't make you wear a Ansell
That means that you'd better wear a Ansell
Now I'm singing
I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy

Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won, I won a

Never win a Grammy for this bullshit
I'll probably never get married to a woman
I'll probably be back in my mum's garage, choofin'
And if your weed refracts light then it's good shit
But I need awards like I need a new chick
Not at all, they both make me too sick
Say I'm a square like cubic
The truth is, I prefer being indoors, making music
I thought I was getting married to a girl
Already did so much damage to myself
I said that I wouldn't start travelling the world
'Til they paid me then my rapping started to sell
I'm going on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
You know the time is wrong for guarantees
Like a watch without no batteries
I'm not real honest but I'm not quite a liar
New girl on my pole like a damn firefighter
Her genes so good that I bust right inside her
Never meet your idols, never fuck your idols either
I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
