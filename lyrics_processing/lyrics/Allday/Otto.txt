Uh, girl, tell me, why you act all sad for?
You're bored, you wanna go out more
But you have to understand that I am poor
All I can afford is a ride in my dad's Ford
So hop in, we'll turn the car to a dance floor
That CD stack left Fleetwood Mac raw
I'll take the keys and sneak out your back door
Steal my parents car for the girl that I adore
On route to a lookout where no other humans are
I'll be deep like the universe is super large
And you can make a wish upon a shooting star
I made a wish for me to get into your bra
You know it's just you, me and the crickets
Girl, tell me, can you operate a stick shift?
I know you're feeling, down I can fix this
Drive around town 'til your frown doesn't exist

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
You might also like
Girls like a gentleman with his own car
It let's them know you are driven, you will go far
So I guess she knows I'm going nowhere
'Cause my dough couldn't buy me a tow bar
You could have been with your friends at a club
Getting free drinks from a sensitive stud
But you're here with me, so I guess it is love
We'll park near the highway, throw eggs at the trucks
I know it's not like you to eat drive-through
But screw your diet, you can have a fry or two
Maybe a large Sprite with some ice cubes
Hope you brought your wallet, 'cause you're buying mine too
And no, you can't smoke in here
Even with windows down, that's a no-no, dear
And I'm so sincere, I wanna make you feel special
As long as you can pay for the petrol

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
I wanted to watch a movie, but you wanted to drive, drive
And you are such a cutie, so let's ride, ride
Out all night, night, 'til the sun shines, shines
Speeds very high, all to make you smile
Do something that you like
Uh, wait, wait, I hear the sirens behind me
"Son, can you pull over to the side, please?
Did you know you were driving at light speed?"
I take out my keys, hand him some I.D
I said, "Please don't fine me
I'm finally seeing my girl smiling, took all night trying
My speed was excessive but please don't arrest us"
He looked at my girl, took a breath, and said this

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown

I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom
Uh, uh, yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
