Streaming out, we're streaming out
Scattering in all directions and we're going home
We're just like baby spiders
Sicker now, I'm sicker now
And you're not making it better, you're no antidote
But you make my sunrises violet

Tired eyes, fluorescent light
Well, it seems as though my friends were right
You're quite unkind

You're always fucking 'round with your hairdo
Always fucking 'round with my head, too
Just be sorry, at least pretend to
I'll send someone around to get you
While you're shining like a heirloom
Everywhere except my bedroom
All the vapid squad you keep close
Feed your ego, not me, though

God, please give me strength, I need stronger faith
This is more than me, in my heart you'll see
I don't have a plan, hope I have a chance
I'll leave this with you, you are everything
You might also like
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

Don't need you now, don't need you now
It only took me a little while to know
The truth is sometimes violent
Speeding down, we're speeding down
To the city with our teeth out exposed
It's the only time we still get excited

Burning fluorescent light
Well, it seems as though my friends were right
You're quite unkind

And the boys form an orderly line
And you call it your fate each time
And your house is big and beachside
And your photos get plenty likes
On that gin and I'm catatonic
Full of pills and I am euphoric
I know your friends won't let you text me
They're trying to end me, those bitches messy
God, please give me strength, I need stronger faith
This is more than me, in my heart you'll see
I don't have a plan, hope I have a chance
I'll leave this with you, you are everything
God, please give me strength (God, please give me strength)
This is more than me (You are everything)
I don't have a plan (I don't have a plan)
I'll leave this with you, you are everything

You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you
