I just can't love like it's back then
We've been through too many bad things
I got some models coming through with me now
I think my life is as stupid as it sounds
And she chop-chop scissor it, roll and twist the end

Head shaved, no-one fucked with me
You know they get hotter when you break their heart
If they don't, you break it way too hard
Move on quick like a racing car, stay popping champagne for ya
Podium first place for ya, I'm sorry for the way we are
Roaring that engine, ignoring my texts and

When you're racing through my mind
