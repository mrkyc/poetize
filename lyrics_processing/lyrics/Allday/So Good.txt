All the shit that you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, "Me too"
'Cause I've been where you are right now

I was a bright child, wide eyed, my mind was open
Highly motivated to succeed, quite devoted
But eventually I noticed every time I tried to focus
That my mind was kind of bogus, so we sought a diagnosis
I had hypersensitivity; ADD, I'm fidgety
Basically they want to medicate me 'til it fixes me
Man, I don't really think this is the thing for me
I know I'm kind of shitty, but I'm just trying to live in peace
You wanna make me to a zombie 'cause you're lazy
And it's easier on you to say, "Sorry, you're crazy, man"
And if you don't take this here, you're gonna fail exams
Wait a year, your fate is that of a vagrant tramp
But this ain't making sense, I gotta take a stand
They say I couldn't live without it, well, I say I can
'Cause I never took those poison pills
And I failed school bad, but my choice was still

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono

We making bread like Helga's while the rest die helpless
So excuse me for pursuing dreams, guess I'm selfish
Rocking hand-me-down clothes but I'm the eldest
So how the hell does that work out, Mum, can you tell us?
And I know I roll around with some red-eyed fellas
We all wanna be king like the dead guy in Memphis,
Could be living stable but I'd rather live it fast
'Cause I grew up looking shitty, all the other kids would laugh
Now I heard somebody say that I look upper-middle class
Well that's my fucking aim, I'll tell the gutter, kiss my arse
And I don't want to spit these bars but I don't have shit else
So when I'm rapping you can tell that it's my actual self
And so I brag about a girl, whatever tactic helps
To make me feel a little better 'bout the hand I'm dealt
And damn, I'm so ashamed, but at the same time
I know it's all good, I'm having a great time
It's all good

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono
All the shit that you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, "Me too"
'Cause I've been where you are right now
Doesn't matter what you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, "Me too"
'Cause I've been where you are right now

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
