And I spent my last money on molly
I'm tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I'm not getting no better
I'm not getting no better

I'm on a victory lap of my city
The pretty girls king me, believe it or not like Ripley
Demons, I got within me, threesomes, they got me busy
It's more from indecisiveness these days, really, I'm not that kinky
They wanna get to me, bouncers miss me with the frisks
Real Gs move in silence like a hippie in a Prius
I got more enemies than I can think about or list
But I'm not Buzzfeed, motherfucker, and I really never slip
And sleep rarely, boy, I smoke too much weed, clearly
'Cause my ex-girl keep nicely suggestin' I need therapy
I think all my enemies must have a weak memory
'Cause when they next to me, they neutral as the Swede embassy

The Swede... I think I meant the Swiss Embassy
But that whole area of the world seems so neutral

Driving in your dad's Jeep Cherokee on an illegal substance
I be swerving like Kyrie Irving in Cleveland's offence
I drink spirits and Spirulina in even portions
I never said I'm living right, I'm just being honest
Keep your daughters indoors for a Alldeez performance
But I been creepy before this shit, I don't need an audience
I can spit alright, but that's the only thing I've conquered
Sometimes I hate being alive, but fuck the easy option
I'm in a holding pattern like jets when a freezing storm hits
Thinking morbid thoughts of coffins I could be more warm in
I be re-recording 'til early in the morning
'Til "I've heard it too much" is the only critique for it
I grew up with no money and a fat CD wallet
Now I'm fucking rich girls, making these deposits
I'm demonic, I came up through a well out of hell's core
I don't like myself, but I sure hate everyone else more
I'm on a world tour like Al Gore, high on planes like Belfort
Fuck my main girl with a condom
So I can fuck these other girls raw
I know I'm self-involved, I'm self-destructive, and I'm self-taught
I grew these old balls real heavy like a cell door

Everyone says that I'm doing things they never thought
But when I was fifteen, I saw this story getting told
You know I had the same best friends since I was twelve years old
So if you fuckbois really want it, they gone help me brawl
And if I've got to hide a fuckin' body, they gon' help me dig
Most of these girls tee-ball, they gone let me hit
Most of these rappers be on some real fuckin' jealous shit
But when they see me they in the club, they ain't gone mention it
Drinking Evians, I need my third eye open wider
My eyes are like tinted windows, I'm the chauffeur driver
On the lonely nights, I need my own Winona Ryder
Circa 1990, fuck her good and probably blow inside her
I'm that No-Doz-eating dopey creep with no hope
Reading Nietzsche just to fuck the scenester girls
And that's the only reason
I skated to my home loan meeting, "Boy, how much you saved?"
I said, "I spent my last money just the other day"
And I spent my last money on molly
I'm tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I'm not getting no better
I'm not getting no better
And I spent my last money on molly
I'm tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I'm not getting no better
