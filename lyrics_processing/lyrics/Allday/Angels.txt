I got a guardian angel, she's with me right now
Watching over me, everything I do
I cross the road with my eyes closed

Yeah, well, this is for the angels
I used to skip school, go hang out at my Grandma's
Come back for art to hit on Jade, I never cracked her
Used to ride on empty, South Road up to Flagstaff
In my shitty Mazda, rusty brown and smashed up
A year later, I met Jess, goon drunk with a fat ass
She'd come 'round in her Dad's car
She drove that shit like NASCAR
Before I was a rapper, I just was a guy that freestyled
At parties for status, I never had none
I used to spend every day with my friends in the garage
Or talking shit with my cousins on the carpet at Nanna's
I think they stop believing that I'm coming like Santa
But my circumstances changed, I'm just doing what I have to
I have dreams of fucking angels and coming down
The white sheets in rooms with views above the clouds
Take your time until the right moment
Then move quick, you don't get a twice over

'Cause time moves like a good butt jiggles
Satisfaction is a long, hard riddle
And I wish you good luck with it all
And I wish you good luck with it all
If there's angels watching over me
I hope they focus on someone more deserving
If there's angels watching over me
Well, this is for the angels

Sometimes I feel as lonely as Pluto
That's when I let the drink throw me like judo
I love my friends, but my homies aren't you though
Growing past conversations like go and fuck two hoes
I'm actually sick of messing with these hoes
I guess I'm growing up, I took my time to, but here we are
The world is spinning fast, dancing 'til the jig is up
Getting all the hate is fine, it's the love that's trickier
My old area don't feel the same
People I used to idolise are seeming lame
And I know it's me that changed, after all that we attained
I don't need much but art and some love to keep me sane
I say that shit but yo, I'm in the club and it's closing
Fucking with hoes that only wanna fuck 'cause they know me
Suffice to say it's dope, but I'm lonely and isolated at times
In this ivory tower that I created

'Cause time moves like a good butt jiggles
Satisfaction is a long, hard riddle
And I wish you good luck with it all
And I wish you good luck with it all
If there's angels watching over me
I hope they focus on someone more deserving
If there's angels watching over me
Well, this is for the angels
She said, "I'm tripping on you, baby, I'm tripping on you"
Could it be the drugs in our bellies? I'm feeling it too
And you can come up in this world, I'm living the proof
You got the flower power, baby, you really in bloom
Thinking of stupid shit I did, I should regret a lot
I guess it's not all bad though, looking at where I got
Already as if I'm done, I don't think I'll ever stop
I'm gaining on the leaders, my old rivals' already lost

And I'm feeling some way tonight
And I'm feeling this way tonight
And I'm feeling some way tonight
With the light on your face
