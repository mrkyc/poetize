Back in Blackwood, I drove them pizzas
Shout out to Sam, if you're there, go to Caesar's
Hacked my girlfriend's Facebook, that hoe ass cheated
Still, I cried down the phone, like, "You know I need ya"
I'll save two thousand bucks and change my address
Do some drugs, become a famous rapper
Blow up and solve your problems that's misconception
I just miss the honesty, don't miss rejection, no

Yeah, she moved to Melbourne to fuck lil gremlin
Who am I to not fuck that girl then?
Lyrics for ourselves, no one else then
Freestyles in the car, me and Nelson, like
Quoting Big L on the way to Reynella to battle anybody
Never pursuing the loot, look up to guru
A moment of truth, like one day I'll do music too
Now I'm responsible for my happiness
But I'm irresponsible at times
You don't know how to drive
'Til you hit obstacles skid off and survive
Mum used to say we're like the Brady Bunch
But there's way too much pill-popping and wine
These memories just won't cross at the lights
They stay jaywalking on my mind, when you say
You might also like
You say it's your time
Codeine seventeen, eighteen won't die
Nineteen came and went and it was all worthwhile
If we only feel this way for one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
If we only feel this way for one more night

Rep the same ones that's tatted on me
The classic nights we had with tragic money
Said we'll die exploring before we settle
Some drift away, you know it's continental
We feared it changing now we feel it changing
And I hate that resignation like this shit is fated
I know time is money and we spend it wasted
Then it's over in a blink, blink, indication
Usually, I'm tongue sucking high
Or stuck inside, too depressed to phone
Things I ingest to cope
With folks at openings of envelopes
Just to pull out my package
Maybe she could love a cheater like Sheryl Crow
And my girl's vain like varicose
But her pussy wetter than Gyarados
Used to hang out the window
Coming up Shepherd's Hill Road in the dark
In our first cars with our first loves
Before they left us with broken hearts
But I don't long for those days past
Don't fuck with this here
Might be cruel,, might be cool
But we're always sincere
You say it's your time
Codeine seventeen, eighteen won't die
Nineteen came and went and it was all worthwhile
If we only feel this way for one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
