Do it for the
This a shout out to the guy you know

I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold

This a shout out to the guy you know
Do it for the boys like Idaho
I know I said it wrong, but I'm vibing though
Face numb and it's all lace like tie a bow, double knot
All the trouble got the cops' car siren go *whoop*
And he picked me up, like, by the throat
Throw me in the back and then drive me home
And you're the kind of girl that they try to clone
Three-way calls on the landline, working in the retail
Stories at a bad time, I just wanna vent
Aye, seeing you a campfire, can we keep it burning?
I'm coming, I'ma stand by, come put up a tent
And you're not asleep, pick up my call
Now you're Marion Jones to me, you run it all
We're sitting in the dark, hoping that it kicks in
Do it all the same way, hope it turns out different this time
You might also like
I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold

This a shout out to your attitude
Pulling strings like a parachute
Coming down like a bandicoot, crash, PS1 days
And it's you that I have to lose, staring at the moon
Can we simmer down? You're my twinkle in my eye
And I'm thinking how everything is kind of crazy
Like a funny farm, always trying interrupt
And I'm getting nothing done, you know me
Like false flag terror in my territory
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I need medicine, you the dispensary
Yeah, you always come through right when I need
And I always come back like a boomerang
Bittersweet Pootie Tang still going through my brain
Yeah, you had me by the balls like I'm Super Saiyan
But I prefer who you were, not who you became

I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I should've been strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I need you, baby
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I shouldn't be strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on, oh
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I should've been strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I need you, baby
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I should've been strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
