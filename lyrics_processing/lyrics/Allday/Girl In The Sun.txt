I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun

You're probably the best invention
Sliced bread will have to settle for second
Never felt anything as absurd
We watch whole movies and don't catch a word
Kissing, caressing, you know the way it goes
I'll stop there 'cause your mum has a radio
Gorgeous in your Chuck Taylors and a short dress
Honest eyes, hope you don't lie like all the rest
We sit around and play UNO on your bed
Wait 'til your parents go out then oh, yes
I'm in love, I'm obsessed
I ask, "Do you love me?" and you say, "Not yet"
Then we sit in the car
With the lights off
And don't go inside or do anything
'Cause I never thought I'd find a love like yours

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun
You might also like
Girl, you're so spoilt, be honest
Whatever drink you like a poor guy has bought it for you
But I'd have it running in the faucet
To make sure you've got it right when you want it
And I don't have anything that shines to give you
My wallet's slim just like your limbs are
You're limber, you're just the kind I'm into
My girl in the sun, my respite from winter
We'll have children, boy and girl ones
And live in a bad area where they sell guns
I'll work hard 'til we can leave
Move to a big house in a leafy street
And chill on the floor
With our legs crossed
And don't mow the lawn or do anything
'Cause I never thought I'd find a love just like yours

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun
I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
