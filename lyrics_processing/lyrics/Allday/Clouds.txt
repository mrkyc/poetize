Pour it out, holy water, I'm the altar
Would you alter or just fall from grace?
The choice is yours to make
In a world full of wolves and snakes
Poison apples and spoiled grapes
Take caution and walk with haste
And you may make it one more day

Don't make it so complex, I need to spend forever on this
Wishing upon these bright comets and I always get what I wish
And I been here doing just what I wanted
Roof leak like go off and on
No costume, no Comic-Con shirt
Off all the time like Jim Morrison, hotel room, drinking heavy
I'm more than fine, don't be forgetting
Most of your girls probably obsessing
Always on road, call me Pirelli, screech
Who drive the fastest? So hard, this my catharsis
Straight out in minus glasses, don't bother asking if I'm injustice

Don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I said don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
Unless I fall from the clouds
Unless I fall from the clouds, from the clouds
You might also like
I need to step this out, oh Lord, oh Lord
Just tell me if you're down, oh Lord, oh Lord

Don't make it so complex, I need to spend forever on this
Green lines talking about concepts
Small minds get jealous and bitch
I let my phone out, another favour
Who the fuck it look like, Mother Teresa?
My wall's so thick, call up the neighbour
Same old me, man, nothing changes
I'm at the mall thinking up rhymes
Talking to yours, thinking she mine
Say one word, she literally mime
Might fuck her in the store, she giving me eyes
Do everything for energy besides sleep
Don't see no one here besides me
And I'm here to find, not to sightsee
Until they silence me, man

Don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I said don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
Unless I fall from the clouds
Unless I fall from the clouds, from the clouds
Aye, yeah
Unless I fall from the clouds, oh, unless I fall
