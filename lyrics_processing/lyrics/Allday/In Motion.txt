Haunting the city, crash with your homies
Chain smoking rollies, and they're all in love with you
Take me out somewhere, the twirling undead
You need to believe in yourself like I do
Hold your nerve, hold your nerve
Steady and sure, soon will come your turn
Then you're here, out of the smoke
And I don't believe what I've heard
And I'm healed from your will, yeah
And your powers are real, yeah
And my blood, congealed, yeah
And my stitches, unsealed, yeah
You pop out in my jacket
And I'll wait 'til you're back here
'Cause I'm so fanatic

And I keep on thinking
She seems so, she seems so
Unstoppable in motion, oh-oh
She hangs her arms around my neck
And I'm thinking
She seems so, she seems so
Unstoppable in motion, oh-oh
And I know it's out of control
You might also like
Were you late to blossom? How is it waiting?
Your indignation, I saw you from the start
Ate one too many, spewed in the lilies
You think you're clever, no, baby, you're just smart
But I won't drown to drag you out
Whatever, I could be the one
Caught in the generation, doing what we saw
Something weird that we saw on the TV screen
Me watching your pupils expand like a chia seed
Are you needing saving, baby? I can't be your deity
I worked too hard to make things flow evenly
It's me and my animals like Ace Ventura
Your Coca-Cola areola tastes like sugar
You pop out to meet a strange guy on the corner
I'm gone

And I keep on thinking
She seems so, she seems so
Unstoppable in motion, oh-oh
She hangs her arms around my neck
And I'm thinking
She seems so, she seems so
Unstoppable in motion, oh-oh
