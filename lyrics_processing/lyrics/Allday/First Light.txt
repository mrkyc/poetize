Feel colder than ever
(Remember when we used to sleep with beanies on and shit?)
Beanies on in the winter
(Oh man, I can't do that shit anymore, man, that was fucked up)
Patience keep getting thinner
(I think we're all growing up now)
I'm still the same boy somewhere in there
From back in the days in the hills
Where my best friend was my dealer, ay yeah

Now I'm back in black, yeah, always black
Like AC/DC, pray for some of what they had
Pray my nanna's there when I step out of a cab
You know I gotta rap, my calling ain't calling back
Yeah, all these rappers stay talkin'
That's Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen
Tryna gun me like JFK when I'm rollin' but I stay dodging
I'm the second shooter like Klay Thompson

Waitin' on the first light (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pray you make it to the morning
Tell me, baby, when you're up high (Up high, up high)
Does it feel like you're falling?
Does it feel like you're falling?
You might also like
Always real, never changing, yeah (First light)
Very me, no variations (First light)
I gave it all, I never gave in, oh (Oh)
Plus I'm always fuckin', never dating, yeah
Keep it underground like cellars and basements
And there ain't no celebrations yet
My first album went wood like a timber floor
Instead of doing them, I'm just doing me a little more (Ooh)
Tell 'em, broke ain't broken 'til you give it up (Ooh)
Money ain't shit if your spirit poor
Let my spirit soar, and the spirits pour
I love these clothes, but it's all just material
So much fun it feels like love, but it's really not
Nights like this, and it's all too familiar

Waitin' on the first light (Oh)
Pray you make it to the morning (What? What?)
Tell me, baby, when you're up high
Does it feel like you're falling?
Does it feel like you're falling?

(Waitin' on)
First light, first light
First light, first light
Ooh, ooh, ooh
"Everything in time," they told me
Waiting for the right time, baby
So what are you waiting for now?
Just waiting for a flood in dry country
Where it never rains, not really
When the red sand turns to mud
