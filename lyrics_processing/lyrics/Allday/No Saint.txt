Oh, they twist my words and quotations (They do)
Like I need any more motivation (Melbourne)
I had no class, no money, no lady
Ex-pizza boy, now I'm throwin' dough crazy
Crazy, no words can explain the lack of fucks I give
These rappers need to suck my dick as dry as the Sahara is
I got bars like Xanax dealers, all my friends are pharmacists
Caterpillars in my hypothalamus, they burrowing

You talk but don't listen, I'm going through some weird shit
You move to the rhythm of the city that we live in

Woah, I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
You wouldn't hear me, no

You must be out your coconut, going through my phone and stuff
Young, drunk Australian, I'm going Russell Crowe on ya
You say I'm a chauvinist, I say, "Well, whose show is this?"
You know where the door is at, or do I need to show you it?
I became a monster somewhere, I'm retracing my steps
Studio, bad hoe bedroom, studio, well, I'm just changing, I guess
Cops used to stop me and say, "I need your name and address"
I would say "Usain Bolt", then I gave it the legs
You might also like
I don't get no happiness from their failures
I really wish them the best in this game here
I got all my own stress and these payslips
I don't get any rest, I'm awake all the time
In my room pacing like Indiana
I need Rihanna or somebody really similar
I've been off the drugs a while, I'm thinking clearer
I think I'm worse when I'm sober, baby, text my dealer

I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
You wouldn't hear me, no
And now I'm getting the blame
I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
You wouldn't hear me, no

The city gets us all down sometimes
But if you're having fun, yeah
If you're having fun

If you're having fun, you're not wasting time
If you're not crazy, get crazy, it's a crazy life
You're like my lady, but you're not ladylike
Smoking hazy until we get McGrady eye
Yeah, we overtaking, Talladega Nights
Swerving through lanes on the way to mine
I don't give a fuck what you talking about
Angel of death in a boarded-up town
You talk but don't listen, I'm going through some weird shit
You move to the rhythm of the city that we live in

I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
You wouldn't hear me, no
And now I'm getting the blame
I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
