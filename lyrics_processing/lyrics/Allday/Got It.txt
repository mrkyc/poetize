I'm writing this whole thing tonight
I'm worried about like a whole lot of shit
Man, no holding inside
Maybe it's hard to maintain these things
While being as honest as I
While my friends call me up and put their worries on me
No problem, it's fine, baby, you know that I got it
Tell me your dreams, I'm following mine
Walk around town in a two-buck hood
And shit keep falling in line, haha
Yo, it's funny how things change
I'll be laughing all of my life, word to Gandhi
Back when I was starving, but I kept the positive vibes
And bitches love me, bitches love me, dog
I swear that they won't leave me alone
I spend my whole life chasing pussy
Man, it's everything that I know
So this here is what you're made of
Think that I'm gonna need me a clone
To do the foul shit that I came here for
But now I'm thinking I won't

Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it
You might also like
Coming to terms with the fact that
Now these bitches want it, now I need honour
Coming to terms with the fact that
If I don't do this proper, I'll be a goner
This is not legacy, this is life or death for me
Like asbestos in the lungs
And I'm not proud of the shit I've done
But I'm proud of the distance I've come
Booze on, then when im hungover lukewarm Arizona
Like Tucson, baby I'm drinking up
Do wrong, I'm sorry for the way I never said sorry
On the days that things were hard
Nostalgia, well, that's so powerful
And it can make bad things turn 'round in full
And I hope it does for you
I sit on the hallway floor, big spiders on the hallway door
Young, feeling way suicidal, that's what I made Allday for
Bring the drinks, 'cause there's always more
And I beg you, por favor
Don't say you love me 'cause I don't need it
Cut that hombre talk

Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it, baby
(Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it, baby
When I think of all the ones that were ahead of me
How quickly I overtook 'em
And I can't help thinking this is my destiny
Like Bey, Kelly and the other woman
I could literally rap forever
No, like, I can literally rap forever
Hey, fucking my old girls like it's gonna make you me
But it's more than that
You can copy every move that I make to a tee
But it's more than that
Yeah, it's more than that

So this shit's all from the heart, ay
Said this shit's all from the heart, ay
