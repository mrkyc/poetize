This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight

This is a scumbag story, my whole heart
Lives in Blackwood, where the apex a Coles park
My humble start, blunts that we rolled up
View of the city, first pulser in a Pulsar
Was it a Pintara dreaming of a Impala?
Taming of the shrew, these formal suits are a thin armour
And a suit Ferrari, feeling all super starry
The days are warm the girls love me and my crew is an army
Ha, I've been there, tell I've felt the future tugging
I've seen the dukes of nothing in the cars zooming past me
Even a few that's nasty, I've copped a few cherries
I've popped a few of my own, some say it's too many
I say it's just enough, I had my first kiss
First tag, first fight, first spit shirtless
First fuck, first drink, first rap verses
All in my hometown where the birds sing

This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight

See, it's a bit colder where I came from
Especially in the foggy mornings trying to stay warm
Especially walking home with a crayon
'Til everything here got my name on
"What do you write, bro?"
Screaming Koo-Wee across the valley then drop the bally
Some minor crimes and hit a party up, it's for the tally
Hoes have all be ordering Hungry's and quarter-baggies in my hand
Yeah, I roll with fatties and we're rolling fatties
Blow it skywards, fuck the climate and fuck assignments
Without a sense of time or motion and there's nothing like it
Mother asks you your career, you say, "Undecided"
She's like, "I never get to see you since you started driving"
And all you wanna do is fucking die young
And stay pretty forever, R.I.P to friends we lost, my eyes run
Thinking back to the day I got the call
And my focus is the moment, won't forget you
Not at all, it's for you

This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight
Instant classic shit
If I knew the difference, I'd have gone make all my lyrics
I would've had a fit. From bathroom cabinets
To fast lane weaving through the traffic
It was always my belief and I'm no Catholic
So fuck it, I'm a Maverick
In the City of Churches, crystal heads, not sucking amethyst
When other guys are tweaking, my demons try appearing
But I'm not tryna feed 'em, so I decide I'm leaving
But I couldn't find a reason so I focus on my hobbies
Started blowing up like pressure mines
Hoping I'll tread softly but I'll never
'Cause they're home and they hope I know they're watching
But it's so exhausting, the recording shows and touring
All the pressure, all the cities, sometimes I wanna quit
Other times I wanna kill it 'til these rappers on my dick
Telling me I am the best, young hope in all these years
But I know I am the shit because I work for all I get
For my city, baby

This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
