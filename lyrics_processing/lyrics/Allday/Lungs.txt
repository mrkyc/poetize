I was Nemo, I was in the fucking deep blue
You see through the facade, the facade is see through
I didn't watch the film but I saw the preview
I got the gist, I was texting, I was tryna reach you
You don't want no problems with the ghouls and goblins
Don't sign the documents, you know there's other options (Other options, yeah)
I'll be poeticating when they're long forgotten (Yeah)
Had to buy some Gosha when I got the dosh in
Diamante earrings, that's the ear infection drip
Most wanted at the mall, you know I'd steal to get that tick
Spinning lies to women, I can make you dizzy from that shit
I'll do anything once just to experience that shit

(Oh-woah, oh-woah) These rappers fuckin' with your brain
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) Talking things they hardly take
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) And I have no one to blame
But you're dressed pretty nice to be muddying my name

And my brother's still smoking
His lungs are gonna be black
And the world is exploding
But I don't worry about that
(When I'm flying over mountains) When I'm flying over mountains
(When I'm flying over trees) Flying over trees
When I'm flying over Brunswick
Checking on my G's (G's, yeah)

I was Nemo, brain was cloudy like a miso
You were pearly, shining like a Palomino (Shining, shining, shining)
We didn't have rich parents, didn't have a cheat code
We know how to scheme though, it was me and Peezo
Road to El Dorado, now with mi hermanos
Chinks in my armour, but they never come close (Never, never)
The jack of hearts is gung-ho and the queen is cutthroat
Just come to the art show, you won't see the brushstrokes (Ayy)
Fuck her in the shower with her face against the glass
Takes me back like a DeLorean, escaping to the past (Past, yeah)
Takes me back to Adelaide, where the haze don't block the stars (Stars, yeah)
Where the teachers said, "Watch him 'cause he's angry, but he's smart"

(Oh-woah, oh-woah) Yeah, I beg the orange sky
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) Would you send another rhyme
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) For the young and traumatised?
Southern Comfort, bikie weed, for the trouble on your mind

And my brother's still smoking
His lungs are gonna be black
And the world is exploding
But I don't worry about that
(When I'm flying over mountains) When I'm flying over mountains
(When I'm flying over trees) Flying over trees
When I'm flying over Adelaide
Checking on my G's
Is heaven a place on Earth?
Heaven is definitely a place on Earth, look at us all
