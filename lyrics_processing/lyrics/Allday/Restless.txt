Lean your shoulder into me
It's gettin' colder
Windows down, you've got to breathe
Your hair is blowin', you say
"All your friends are driftin' (Driftin')
You're the one I'm thinkin' 'bout"
Losin' again in the city (City)
Goin' mad in an empty house
Dead streets, yeah
I fell in love with you too deep, yeah
I know you gotta extend yourself, yeah
Don't wanna see you with nobody else

So, where did this come from, darling
Out of the blue?
Did you only love me when you had nothin'
Else to do?

And I would
Change my stripes
These days you're restless
And you need some time
I know
You'll be mine
These days you're restless
And you need some time
Some time, some time
You might also like
Now you sit down in the shower
Spittin' water
And you'll stay there for an hour
It's gettin' darker
There's a party we're late for
Way up on a windy road
With people we can't relate to
Once we're there, we'll wanna go
And what a mess, yeah ()
Fixin' me is a process, yeah
I never said it would be low risk, yeah
And now I drink until I'm so sick, yeah

So, where did this come from, darling
Out of the blue?
Did you only love me when you had nothin'
Else to do?

And I would
Change my stripes
These days you're restless
And you need some time
I know
You'll be mine
These days you're restless
And you need some time
Some time, some time
You say
"Why you always stayin' home? You're not Prince", I know I'm odd
But I'm original, I'm not prints, I figured out
I can't do this high, I'm not Wiz, I figured out
The devil's in the detail, formless
Am I boring? I'm sorry, I just gotta make it
We always had a different level of communication
Remember when I got my first cheque, said, "What you doin' later?"
We went straight to the store, bought a smoothie maker
Feelin' like a million bucks, yeah
Only smoothies for a couple months, yeah
Those are fake friends, they don't really love ya
Liquid breakfast, same thing for lunch, you're actin' different

So, where did this come from, darling
Out of the blue?
Did you only love me when you had nothin'
Else to do?

And I would
Change my stripes
These days you're restless
And you need some time (You need some time)
I know
You'll be mine (You'll be mine)
These days you're restless
And you need some time
