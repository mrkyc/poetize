We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

Holding your head down, they holding your head down
Talking 'bout living for the summer
But you're working all year round
I'm always hanging at the club
Until the bouncers say, "Get out"
Wait for something good to happen
But it's happening here and now
I swear that all my friends are no good for me
I swear that all your friends see no good in me
You know, just call me when I cross your mind
We talk, you blow it like it's GoldenEye on 64
One of a kind, you tell me that there's more to life
I always said I come and go
Life is tryna take you dancing all night long
And fuck you slow and never call back
Or maybe that's me, I just don't know
I'm taking yours, you're taking mine
You might also like
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

Crosses on my neck, crosses on my neck
'Bout to crucify that ass
You're being so bad, that's what you get
Mean I never see you 'round here and I'm in here all the time
Guess you're sick of all the talking
You've been hearing all the lines
But you're so nice, yeah, manners like the rich areas
Drinking heavy, yeah, every week
My homies gone, you're ripped early, uh
I hear that talking and I don't think to mention it, uh
This year, I'm ticking off all the things I never did, nah
I still don't fight, I'm way too high
I know you don't want to leave him
I don't want to make you mine
In the corner of the room, if you ain't trippin', take a dive
We all need someone to bitch about
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

You should do your thing, you should do your thing
Whatever that shit means
I ain't no Hugh on the movie screen
I'm such a reader from rain so fuck this Mother Nature
Can't trust a bitch, just fuck a bitch
Friends all say she'll just betray you
Like another trader and it's just verbatim
I ain't even saying I believe the words
When I was young and in love with being in love
Got hurt from the things that hurt, I ain't throwing shade
For sequoia trees in the morning, guess what, boys
The beat-boys avoid the priest and the loyal thieves
Bitches don't need nobody else

We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh
We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh
(We're only wasting time) We're only wasting time
(We're only wasting time) We're only wasting time
(We're only wasting time) We're only wasting time
