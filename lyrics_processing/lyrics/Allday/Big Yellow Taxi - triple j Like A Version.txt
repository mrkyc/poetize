They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel
A boutique and a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
Ohh-bop-bop-bop

They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see 'em

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
Ohh-bop-bop-bop

Well, I went down the coast, but there's no coral reef
'Cause Adani stole the coal, so all the coral's bleached
So I went to the city, but I don't wanna breath
'Cause the smog in the air just makes me cough and wheeze
Goin' stir crazy like Milo, high as trees until it drops me
Thought I had depression but I just needed a coffee
And the Amazon's dyin' but we got Amazon Prime
Too busy to be angry so they carry on lyin'
Well, there's a plastic island in our ocean that I heard about
We gotta turn around this shit before it burns us out
We focus on our differences, but we should kill the billionaires
Invest in local businesses, grow potatoes, spinachs
Might need my head checked, might need McAfee
I grew up on some poison, they called it McHappy
I guess you don't know what you got till it's packin'
And it speeds down the road in a big yellow taxi
You might also like
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ohh-bop-bop-bop
