*Church bells ringing*

Going under deeper
Trying hard to reach you
I don't talk too much, don't need to
It's my face they wanna see there (These days)
Got her hotel in my notes, honey
Said I wouldn't recognise her wearing clothes, honey
But she wouldn't fuck me as a nobody (Yeah, I know that's true)
And that thought is kind of sobering (Not enough though)
And if I had my time over, I'd do the same things again twice over
Mixed my potion and I'm floating, and I will fly
Through the wall like an apparition so you might notice
I'll sit there waiting for the moon to rise
At the park watching good people and human life
I don't wish for it, I know it will soon arrive
I'm not sure what this hole is I grew inside

I'm reaching through the night to you
But this dimension isn't mine
I'm reaching through the night to you
But this dimension isn't mine
You might also like
Am I see-through to you?
'Cause I feel like a ghost (Ghost)
Some things you don't want to know
Could you sell me some hope?

"I never changed", he said regretfully
We weren't supposed to ever leave
70% of me is Cheetos and Monster Energy
That's some white trash chemistry
Nurse ratchet, sick mentally
Over the cuckoo's nest in a F18
On the pew I was praying for better things
All those Gucci denim dreams
I think that girl is cute, but she's properly basic
Can't pinpoint why she wants to be famous
Come out from there, don't crawl in these spaces
Smoke more weed when the weed got me anxious
I'll sit at the park feeling miserable
'Til the good people go home to be in the warm
And I thought you saw me but I'm invisible
Spiritual, ethereal, nothing that you'd feel at all

I'm reaching through the night to you
This dimension isn't mine
I'm reaching through the night to you
This dimension isn't mine
Am I see-through to you? (Yeah)
'Cause I feel like a ghost
Some things you don't want to know (Want to know)
Could you sell me some hope? (Yeah)
Am I see-through to you? (Yeah)
'Cause I feel like a ghost
Some things you do I want to know
Could you sell me some hope? (Yeah)

I know I'll be rewarded for my sacrifice
