Yeah, yeah

Just to be here and not leave ya
It takes so much upkeep, yeah
A rolling stone don't start me up
Since things all went Jumanji, yeah
I traded everything to find a real cure
Those magic beans never became a beanstalk
I found religion couple times already before
Gambled everything on love 'til I was dirt poor
Passing town to town for answers
Like I rolled my ankle, out with all my crutches
Forgive 'em while you have 'em, 'fore you're both in caskets
Strapped into a starship, as cold as ice road truckers, ah, yeah

With every blossom comes
A bee and you've been stung
Much more than all the rest
Your timing's not the best

My dear, this could be your year, we got so close
Waiting on a wonder drug (Something to slow the mind)
Waiting on a wonder drug (On your most lonely night)
Between all the days we've seen, making the most
Waiting on a wonder drug (I say our glory days)
Waiting on a wonder drug (Are not so far away)
You might also like
And I've seen good plans go pear-shaped
And I got way past the concerned stage
Reverse Pinocchio, I saw you turn fake
All that namedropping, it just turns me off like Earth Day
How many licks to the centre of a Tootsie Pop?
How many likes until you feel like you are good enough?
How long could you look at your phone before you call it off?
Plastic is forever and it's always washing up
I should probably say something when I go through stuff
Got some real good friends I haven't spoke to much
I've been busy blowing up, I can't let this moment pass
And when I sell a million, maybe that will fill the hole in us

With every blossom comes
A bee and you've been stung
So much more than your share
This time we'll be prepared

My dear, this could be your year, we got so close
Waiting on a wonder drug
Waiting on a wonder drug
Between all the days we've seen, making the most
Waiting on a wonder drug (Wonder drug)
Waiting on a wonder drug (Wonder drug)
My dear, this could be your year, we got so close
Waiting on a wonder drug (Something to slow the mind)
Waiting on a wonder drug (On your most lonely night)
Between all the days we've seen, making the most
Waiting on a wonder drug (I say our glory days)
