High
Yeah
Miles high
Hey

I just wanna see your two nipples
Talk your language like Doctor Dolittle
Boys in clubs always saying, "You're beautiful"
You be like, "Come on, dude, chill"
We can roll up a blunt to burn like The Crucible
Do a line off somebody in a cubicle, I'll
Do almost anything, I don't say 'no' a lot (I don't say no)
And I don't need a yacht, baby, to go overboard (Oh yeah)
We get drunk just to make the hangover stop
It's hard to stay sober if the place is going off
And it's always going off when I step in there
Girls in sportswear, sweat me like Phys Ed.
I just think with my dick, I'm a dickhead
Yeah, how'd I fit inside the door with my big head?
I'm in my room just staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout ya

'Cause I don't believe in magic
I just believe in you
Baby, there's no right answers
We're just getting through
'Cause I don't believe in
Magic
'Cause I don't believe in
Magic (Gimme to me now)
You might also like
And I'm sure your boyfriend's the sweetest
But he does lack a certain me-ness
And all my ex-girls say I'm the meanest
But fuck those hoes, that don't mean shit
'Cause, see, I got my own demons to beat like Peter Parker
Smoking Mary-Jane reefer, fucking singers (Yeah)
That's why my life feels like a musical
They better play *. ***** at my funeral (Yeah)
So I don't wanna rate you with a numeral
But ten would be the number that is suitable
That's why I heard a handsome guy saying
"Why's she with that dude? He must be, like, famous"
And I don't mind, baby, with how fast my life changing
I probably can't be there as much as it might pain me
And my mums car's broom-broom and your sex drive crazy
Like Mercedes, and I'm with you till the hell fire flames me
No red lights, baby, and your body's gyrating
Still a teenage dirtbag, let's listen to Iron Maiden
Yeah, you're my favourite, yeah, you're my favourite
Don't regret my statement, high as Empire State is
No ifs, kinda, maybes, born right after 1980s
Wanna take you to bed, girl, no hibernating
Wanna message all the time just like we're dating
And we might one day, if you don't mind waiting it out
It's kind of crazy
I never thought that it would go
This far
Go this far, yeah, I know
It's kind of crazy
I never thought that it would go
This far
Go this far

'Cause I don't believe in magic
I just believe in you
Baby, there's no right answers
We're just getting through
'Cause I don't believe in
Magic (Gimme to me now)
'Cause I don't believe in
Magic (Gimme to me now)
