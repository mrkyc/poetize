When I was sayin' goodbye
That girl, she ain't gonna be alright
Cuz I could tell
She'd be goin' thru a livin' hell
And I
I wouldn't be there by her side
Lord I felt so bad
As I sat and watched her cry
Thinkin' I was movin' on
And she was barely gettin' by
Look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
I gave back her heart
The broken parts
She got the raw end of the deal
And look at whats it's done to me
Gotta know it tears me up
I gave it everything I had
And Lord it wasn't enough
Hurtin' her like this seems so wrong
Look at what I've done to her
Now she's alone
I saw her out last night
She was havin' a good time
That girl
It looks like she doin' fine
But then I saw a man
Walk up and take her by the hand
And I, oh God I almost died
And then it hit me
She didn't really need me
I just sat there for a while
Until I finally smiled
You might also likeYea look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
Shes found somebody new
And look who took the time to heal
And look at what it's done to me
Ya gotta know it tears me up
To walk away from the love me made
And just leave it in a cloud of dust
And now it's got me thinkin'
Maybe I was wrong
After all the things I've done to her...
Now she's strong
I walked up and said, "Hello."
She said, "It's good to see ya,"
"But hey I gotta go."
Yea look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
She's standin' tall
She's got it all
Got the world at her heels
And look at what it's done to me
Yea look at how it makes me hurt
If I could go back now I swear somehow
I'd find a way to make it work
Ain't life funny
Now I'm the one alone
Yea look at what I've done to me...
