Bring it back to Mama Bear, give me some honey yeah
Cashed my check, got a pocket of dollar
Loosenin' the buttons on my blue-collar yeah
Oh, this is what I do
This is where I stand
This is who I am
Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone
Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on
Rollin' it home five o'clock on a Friday
Gonna spend the next couple of days doin' it my way yeah, oh, yeah
Call up a few friends, build a fire in the backyard
Gonna do some chillin', chicken grillin', and guitars yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, this is all I know
This is where I'm from
This is what I love

Down the road from the church where the Good Lord saved me yeah
