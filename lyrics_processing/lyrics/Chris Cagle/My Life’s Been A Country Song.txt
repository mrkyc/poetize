Now I know how Merle Haggard felt
When he sang the words mama tried
And I've lived those teenage Friday Nights
The pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
And that Summer Becky broke my heart
Alabama sang old flame burnin'
I've danced to George Strait
Dank to George Jones
My life's been a country song

It's all about fallin' down and gettin' back up
You're good times and hard luck
True love and Amazing Grace
Workin' all week for a backache
Raisin' cain, Friday nights
Sunday church to set it right
They can write it on my stone
My life's been a country song

Now I know how Paycheck felt when
He told his boss to take this job and shove it
And I've had the girl that made me say
I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
And I'll always remember just where I was
When the world stopped turning
Through the good and bad
The right and the wrong
My life's been a country song
You might also like
It's all about fallin' down and gettin' back up
You're good times and hard luck
True love and Amazing Grace
Workin' all week for a backache
Raisin' cain, Friday nights
Sunday church to set it right
They can write it on my stone
My life's been a country song

It's been the words when I couldn't find 'em
A friend when I've been alone
It's been a toast to the things remembered
The strength for movin' on

It's all about fallin' down and gettin' back up
You're good times and hard luck
True love and Amazing Grace
Workin' all week for a backache
Raisin' cain, Friday nights
Sunday church to set it right
They can write it on my stone
My life's been a country song
