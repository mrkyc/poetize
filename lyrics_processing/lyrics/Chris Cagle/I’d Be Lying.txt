And wanted you to come back home
I'd be lying
And if I said that we could work it out
And you shouldn't have any doubt
I'd be lying
And if I got down on my knees
In front of God above and swore before the angels
I'd give you my love
I'd be lying next to you at night
Holding on to my whole life
Right back where I belong
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
Yeah, hunny I was wrong
And swallowed my pride
And put myself in your shoes
And tell you that I understand
Why you feel the way you do
Baby, I'd be lying, I'd be lying next to you
And if I told you that I loved you
And I'd put no one else above you
I'd be lying
And if I said that you're the one for me
And I'd never set you free
I'd be lying
And if I somehow found the strength
To knock on your front door
And tell you face to face
I won't hurt you anymore
You might also likeI'd be lying next to you at night
Holding on to my whole life
Right back where I belong
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
Yeah, hunny I was wrong
And swallowed my pride
And put myself in your shoes
And tell you that I understand
Why you feel the way you do
Baby I'd be lying, right here lying next to you
If I could swallow my pride
Put myself in your shoes
And tell you I could understand why you feel the way you do
Baby I'd be lying, I'd be lying next to you
Next to you
If I told you I was wrong
If I said that we could work it out
If i got down on my knees
