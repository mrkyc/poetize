Summertime
Drivin' fast down an old back road
Feelin' fine
Got Skynyrd on the radio
The moon is bright
Me and my baby gonna break new ground
On a blanket in a field of green
Yeah the crickets sing a song to me, it goes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Fireflies
They burn better than candlelight
Ol' Bob White down in the holler sings a lullaby
You and me
Well that's just enough company
So baby listen to the nighttime breeze
You can hear it singin' though the trees
You might also like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Baby, listen to the nighttime breeze
You can hear it singin' through the trees, it goes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I said a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
A night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town, woo
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Those city lights bring me down
