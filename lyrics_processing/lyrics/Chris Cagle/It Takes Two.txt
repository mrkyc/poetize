I wanna turn and go
When you drive me wild
It makes me wanna stay
Yeah sometimes it feels like I'm walking down a rocky road
Just to fall in your arms at the end of the day
You ain't perfect but you're perfect for a man like me
But I know that I'm not the man that I'm supposed to be
But it's going to take faith
It's going to take trust
It's going to take everything we've got
Even though we know it won't be enough
It's going to take hope
We even need a little love
And if anybody tells us we can make it on our own
It ain't true
Oh 'cause baby it takes two
Yeah sometimes my work and world get the best of me
Then I come home and try and give you what's left of me
And sometimes you wonder if I'm even listening
And I hate how it hurts you when I forget the little things
I'm not perfect but for you I'll do the best I can
'Cause without you I won't ever be more than just a lonely man
You might also likeBut it's going to take faith
It's going to take trust
It's going to take everything we've got
Even though we know it won't be enough
It's going to take hope
We even need a little love
And if anybody tells us we can make it on our own
It ain't true
Oh 'cause baby it takes two
I don't wanna walk alone now baby
I know I can't make it on my own baby
Even though sometimes you make me so crazy
But I know together we can make it with faith
It's gonna take a little trust
It's going to take everything we got
Even when we know it won't be enough
It's going to take a little hope
We even need a little love
And if anybody tells us we can make it on our own
It ain't true
Oh 'cause baby it takes two
It's going to take faith
We're going to need a little trust
It's going to take me, you, and both of us
