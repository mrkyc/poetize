Baby turn your love light on
And let it burn me all night long
I want to feel the fire of every single touch
Till I scream I've had enough
Then try to kill me with your kiss
Then resurrect me with your lips
Don't be afraid my love
To drop me where I stand

'Cause I can take it like a man
Baby I can take the good
Take the good with all the bad'
'Cause on your worst day
Woman you're the best I've ever had
So give me all you got
And when you think I've taken all
That I can stand oh oh
Don't be afraid to love me
'Cause I can take it like a man
Oh-oh, oh-oh

And when you're feeling down and low
I wanna be the place you want to go
And when you're standing
Out on the edge of it all
I'll be the soft place you can fall
You might also like
Oh yeah, 'cause baby I can take the good
Take the good with all the bad
'Cause on your worst day
Woman you're the best
I've ever had
So give me all you got
And when you think
I've taken all
That I can stand oh oh
Don't be afraid to love me
'Cause I can take it
Like a man oh oh

Take anything you need from me when you need it
And lean on into my love darling
Like you mean it oh

'Cause I can take the good
Take the good with all the bad
'Cause on your worst day
Woman you're the best I've ever had
So give me all you got
And when you think I've taken all
That I can stand oh oh
Don't be afraid to love me
No don't be afraid to love me
'Cause I can take it
