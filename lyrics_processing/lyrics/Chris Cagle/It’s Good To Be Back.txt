Stompin' around in my old stompin' ground
Too much time away, I'm back to stay
But I ain't settlin' down
Tonight we'll burn it down
Let's tear the roof off of this place
Tell everyone you know
They'll see a lot more of my face
It's good to be here
Long time no see dear
But I had to give it a go
Took the show on the road
Doin' it everybody's way but my own
Good to be home
Been gone away to long
Stickin' to my guns, makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all, it's good to be back
Welcome everyone
I've just begun the second half of the show
The nitty-gritty of the city wasn't pretty
But it taught me some things I didn't know
I swear that i'm not through
To much to do before the end
And the best place to get started
Is right he with all of my freinds

Long time no see dear
But I had to give it a go
Took the show on the road
Doin' it everybody's way but my own
Good to be home
Been gone away to long
Stickin' to my guns, makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all, it's good to be back
I'm stone-cold on a roll
No one gonna tell me no
Anybody wanna go
Just grab a hold and say yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's good to be here
Long time no see dear
But I had to give it a go
Took the show on the road
Doin' it everybody's way but my own
Good to be home
Been gone away to long
Stickin' to my guns, makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all, it's good to be back
Stickin' to my guns, makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all, it's good to be back
Oh y'all it's good to be back
