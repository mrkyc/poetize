Have you ever wondered what life would be like
If you'd only went left instead of taking that right
If you had waited just ten more minutes
To leave the house, would it all be different?

Every decision, everything we choose
Has a consequence whether we win or lose
Nobody knows that any better than me
I left her standing at the station
With a ticket and a dream

She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart, I didn't risk the ride
Yeah, she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide
Here on the safe side, oh

I still remember the night she left
She said she didn't want to lose me
But she had to find herself
I could've stopped her or got on board with her
But now it's too late to reconsider
You might also like
She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart, I didn't risk the ride
Yeah, she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide
Here on the safe side

Sometimes the greatest risk of all
Is never taking one at all

She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart, I didn't risk that ride
And she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide
Here on the safe side, oh

Oh, I don't want to be alone
Here on the safe side
