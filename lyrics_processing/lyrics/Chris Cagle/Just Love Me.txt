Or a saint that's bound for glory, no
And I'll never know what it's like to swim in money
Or how it feels not to have to go to work on Monday
I'm a simple man, and that's okay
But even a simple man wants to feel this way
Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack
Like a man that if you left him, you'd just have to have him back
Like a rock that you would lean on when your world gets too rough
Like a man that you would stand beside when he's not so tough
But even if that's not the man you see
Then just love me, just love me
I'll never write a song that lasts forever or a book for all the ages
But I'm not full of empty pages, no
'Cause I got a soul, and I use it for yearnin'
With a heart that skips a beat for you and a fire that keeps on burnin'
I'm a simple man, yeah, that's okay
But even a simple man wants to feel this way
Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack
Like a man that if you left him, you'd just have to have him back
Like a rock that you would lean on when your world gets too rough
Like a man that you would stand beside when he's not so tough
But even if that's not the man you see
Then just love me, just love me

But even a simple man wants to be swept away, and feel
Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack
Like a man that if you left him, you'd just have to have him back
Like a rock that you would lean on when your world gets too rough
Like a man that you would stand beside when he's not so tough
But even if that's not the man you see
