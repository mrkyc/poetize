Tearing up the ground we sow
With corn and beans and all
Yeah, man, it was hot
And I learned not to beg no more
When we drive by that country store
When Grandpa say what you need it for
Ain't got nothing we ain't got
Couldn't tell that old man nothin'
He was backwards to the bone
He said let me tell you somethin', boy
If there's something I want
I'll grow my own
Yeah, all I need is G-O-D to bless the seeds I've sown
And pray for a little rain
Yeah my daddy was the same
My daddy as a kid had a little but yet I lived
If you think you know what's good for me, you don't
I'll grow my own
As long as schools keeps washing brains
On how to ride that gravy train
And teaching kids that there just ain't
No God up in the sky
You might also likeAs long as they say guns are bad
And you don't need no mom and dad
Sex is just some fun you have
And love is all a lie
I pray for all those kids you raised
On my hard workin' dime
But unless you change your crazy ways
You ain't raising mine
I'll grow my own
Yeah, all I need is G-O-D to bless the seeds I've sown
And pray for a little rain
Yeah my daddy was the same
My daddy as a kid had a little but yet I lived
If you think you know what's good for me, you don't
Then I'll grow my own
Yes I will
Your lips are movin', yeah I can see 'em
And Mister Politician I just don't believe 'em
You want my money, you want my freedom
You want my rights but I'ma fight like hell to keep 'em
You want my sweat, you want my blood
You want my daughters and my son
But I'll grow my own
Yeah, all I need is G-O-D to bless the seeds I've sown
And pray for a little rain
Yeah, my daddy was the same
He showed me as a kid, had a little and yet I lived
If you think you know what's good for them, you don't
Yeah, the best thing you can do is leave us alone
And I'll grow my own
