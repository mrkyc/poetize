I never thought that I was good enough to have the love
Of a woman like you
But you showed me I was man enough with just a touch
In a way that only you could do
That's when my whole world started over you loved the fool right outta me
And honey, would you believe
You still do that to me
'Cause I still hold you in my arms when I dream at night and girl
I don't wake in the morning 'til ya' let me go
And in case I never told ya' you were my whole world
Honey, I wrote this song jut so you would know
Do you remember Jacksonville, 'cause I always will
No matter how hard I try to forget
I said a lot of hateful things that I didn't mean
And have a lifetime left of regret
That's when my whole world came crashin' down
Like a fool I went and let you leave
And it knocked me to my knees
You still do that to me
'Cause I still hold you in my arms when I dream at night and girl
I don't wake in the morning 'til ya' let me go
And in case I never told ya' you were my whole world
Honey, I wrote this song jut so you would know
You might also likeSo you would know
'Cause I still hold you in my arms when I dream at night and girl
I don't wake in the morning 'til ya' let me go
And in case I never told ya' you were my whole world
Honey, I wrote this song jut so you would know
That every time my heart beats
You still do that to me
Yeah honey, every time I breathe
You still do that to me
Every night, in my dreams
You still do that to me
Every time I think about you baby
You still do that to me
I still hold you, I still need you
When I'm sleepin' baby, that's when I see you
I still want you, I still need you
I still love you, you still do that to me
