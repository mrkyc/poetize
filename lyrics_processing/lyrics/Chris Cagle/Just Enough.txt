From a batch my daddy made himself
A stolen joke for me and the neighbor's daughter
I wanted her more than I feared daddy's belt
And when the buzzin' took the place of the burning
That drunk kiss made me burn more than I ever burned before
And it was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
To want some more
And like a drop of water to a thirsty man
Like a postcard picture of the promise land
A piece of candy candy from an old dime store
And it was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
To want some more
And I was up for anything when I was younger
I raised more hell than the devil did himself
But the good lord must've knew I needed an angel
'Cause I was on my way to an early grave or jail
She was a breath of spring in a long grin cotton dress
And she looked my way when I didn't know what I was looking for
And it was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
To want me some more
Like a sip of whiskey to a drinking man
Like a sprinkle of rain on the desert sand
A little ray of daylight on a jailhouse floor
And it was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
To want me some more

I can't believe how fast the years they fly
And the one thing that I've learned in all my years of living
Is that you, you never lived enough when you die
Like a drop of water to a thirsty man
Like a postcard picture of the promise land
A piece of candy candy from an old dime store
And it was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
It was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
It was just enough, just enough, yeah just enough
