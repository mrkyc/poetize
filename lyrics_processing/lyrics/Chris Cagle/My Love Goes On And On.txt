My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

There's only so many stars in the night
That can make up a milky way
And there ain't more
Than twenty-four long hours in a day
But they say everything has a limit
That ain't exactly true
'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart
Or the way that I feel about you

Hell, even when the pyramids are gone
Yeah, my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

Well, I got two hundred thousand miles
On a rusty old beat up truck
And I hate to say but there's gonna come a day
When I'm gonna have to give her up
But darlin' since I met you
Well, here is how it is
I could live with losing everything
But I would die without your kiss
You might also like
So if you think this fire we lit inside
Will burn out, you're wrong
My love goes on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

Yeah, I know that we can't spend
Every waking hour together
But I can hold you for tonight
And I can love you forever

Every time I think of what we've got
All I do is smile
'Cause the beginning to the end of time
Compared to this is a little while
I've heard raindrops'll turn into oceans
And oceans'll turn to dust
But there ain't a single force in the world
That'll have an effect on us

But that may be that the rocky
Rocky mountains don't last long
But my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
