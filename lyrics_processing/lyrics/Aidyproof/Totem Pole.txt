Everybody want that top spot on Totem poles
Don't nobody want the Feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on The totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
Go and claw like animals
Everybody want that top spot on Totem poles
Don't nobody want the Feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on The totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
Go and claw like animals

Hooptie being hotboxed
While we dreaming of a drop-top flow
9 to 5 don't work
Cause don't nobody want some jerk
To put a foot up on they neck for checks
Much less than what their work will show
Cause if it's me, evidently
In the breeze
In Bentleys
Can't walk away from them goals
3 feet away from all that gold
You might also likeOr I'll hate myself for it later
I chase greatness not paper
That's what my bars'll go hard
That why I'm meant to go far
At least I hope so
Scratch that "know so"
I came into this shit equipped
To face the whole world "solo"
And the odds
Are a cool 50/50
Now adjust 'em, we gon' dust 'em
Cause I got my circle with me

Everybody want that top spot on totem poles
Don't nobody want the feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on the totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
Go and claw like animals
Everybody want that top spot on totem poles
Don't nobody want the feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on the totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
Go and claw like animals
Stop the worryin' bout next man
That's what's hurrying
Feelings of inadequacy with urgency
Bury them
Them lines between reality and yo world
Go head blurry 'em
Cause their ways were designed to trick your mind
To think you'll never win
When ain't no race we all gon' waste
If we all keep this venom in
Just focus on yourself do your best
Grow your dough like Venison
Till heaven let us in
I pray we keep inspiring
More important that your poles or stats
Money, broads and all of that
Honor thee with your honesty
Now show me where your heart Is at!

Everybody want that top spot on totem poles
Don't nobody want the feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on the totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
Go and claw like animals
Everybody want that top spot on totem poles
Don't nobody want the feeling
Of being low
Everybody want that top spot on the totem pole
Wanna get it, now you gotta
