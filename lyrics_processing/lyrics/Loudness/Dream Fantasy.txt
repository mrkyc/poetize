Darkness is king, no shadows fall over me
I come alive with the night, you can't tie me down
It's my fantasy, it's my daydream
Thousands of women standing on the streets
Each one is calling me "Come to me", oh yeah!
I search the city streets, one girl is all I need
She's my fantasy, she's my daydream
Wooh no, dream fantasy
Under the spell of a foxy girl
Wooh wooh, dream fantasy, steal away!
Dream on, dream on, steal away!
Dream on, steal away!
She sells dreams in the heat of the night
My heart is victim to the game she plays
She won't tease me
I know she'll never leave me
Dreams come true
She's the world to me...fantasy
