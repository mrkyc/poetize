Make moves!
Can't sit down and wait, No!
(Put your shoulders to the wind!)
(Show them that you're made of steal!)
Why sit and wonder?
(Tuhtuhtwad!)
Why sit and wait until tomorrow?
Do what you can today.
(aye-yeah)
Everyone is yearning for a brighter future.
You've got your part to play.
(aye-yeah)
Let's get started!
On the noising!
(wahoy!)
The greatest feat: stop me from scorn.
Be a living example!
Get the people united!
(wahoy!)
In the church, in the dance, in the temple, wherever you are.
Now is the time!
(time-time)
Here is the place!
(place-place)
For times were rough!
(were rough)
No time to waste!
Live all your dreams!
(live it up!)
Keep your head high, high, high!
Show some love and you just might get by.
(bye-ee-i, yeah, i-i, yeah-yeah)
(yeah-yeah-woy)
Many are burning with desire.
Yet they never talk, so they keep on drifting apart...
To pride! They I!
Bury your feelings.
They never move, cause some a that's the love they use.
Act now! Find someone!
To love and trust!
Give free for life!
Rastafari is a must!
You'll get by, You will get by.
(by-yi-yi-yi, i-i, yeah-yeah)
Make moves!
(Put your shoulders to the wind!)
Stanyahoy!
