I'm not the funny hookey that you came to see
Give a lick, hit the deck, break a dogs neck
Movin' on the floor people place your bets
Dancin' 'til your bones are tired
Make you sweat 'til your life expires
I'm the one tell you don't look around
'Cuz the bad guys finish with hands down
Bad guy, once was a bad guy
Bad guy, now I'm gonna destroy
Bad guy, born under a bad sign
Moon rising, shinin' on down on me the
Bad, bad guy
Bad guy spit in the devil's eye
Lickety split spankin' the kitty
Grab a guitar sing a little ditty
All in the life in a day of me
Take it to the cops try to get me stopped
Put it up for grabs start a new crop
Bad guy can be your friend if you want
He's the teacher's pet your freak pussy taunt
You might also likeBad guy, bad reputation
Bad guys tell ya get on your knees
Bad guy, bad reputation
Bad guy, (voodoo child) (get the girls that please)
Bad guy, once was a bad boy
Bad guy, now I'm gonna destroy
Bad guy, born under a bad sign
Bad guy, now just a voodoo child
Bad guy, once was a bad boy
Moon rising, shinin' down on me the
Bad, bad guy
Bang down love, never too soon
Bad guys eye on a silvery spoon
Lickin' your ear love on the moon
Bad guys were born to lose
Push-ups honey taste good to me
I'm not the funny hookey that you came to see
Give a lick, hit the deck, break a dogs neck
Movin' on the floor people place your bet
Dancin' 'till your bones are tired
Make you sweat 'til your life expires
I'm the one tell you don't look around
