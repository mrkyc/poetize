So I'm gonna tear out your heart
And try it on for size
You gotta have a soul to get to go to hell
That's where I wanna go to ring the demon bell
Demon bell, demon bell
I wanna hear you scream like hell
Demon bell, demon bell
I'm gonna throw you in the wishing well
Television was my mom and dad
The six o'clock news told me how to be bad
And when you're really bad the ratings go up
That's why this damn country's getting really corrupt, yeah!
Somebody get me a whisky
Cus blood makes me so thirsty
We are like star-crossed wires
That's why they call me the shocker
Demon bell, demon bell
I wanna hear you scream like hell
Demon bell, demon bell
I'm gonna throw you in the wishing well
Like a baby howlin' for his mother
If you don't get love you turn into a killer
No-one ever took me to the carnival
Now the funhouse is my twisted soul
I'm lookin' for you, well lookin' for you
You might also likeI was born without a soul inside
So I'm gonna tear out your heart
And try it on for size
You gotta have a soul to get to go to hell
That's where I wanna go to ring the demon bell
Somebody get me a whisky
Cus blood makes me so thirsty
We are like star-crossed wires
That's why they call me the shocker
Demon bell, demon bell
I wanna hear you scream like hell
Demon bell, demon bell
I'm gonna throw you in the wishing well
Like a baby howlin' for his mother
If you don't get love you turn into a killer
No-one ever took me to the carnival
Now the funhouse is my twisted soul
Demon bell, demon bell
I wanna hear you scream like hell
Demon bell, demon bell
