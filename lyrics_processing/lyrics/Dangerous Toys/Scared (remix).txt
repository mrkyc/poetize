Im getting nervous, becoming a mess
Is he the doctor's man to take me away, or the same damn demon from yesterday!
Waking up is virtually impossible
Something in this story won't let me go
You know I'm shaking and i'm feeling sick
Guess I'm going to need a vodka quick
Momma's lace and whiskey on the top shelf
Somehow they got caught up in my dream
Monsters on my right and cobwebs on my left
Scary man standin' right in front of me
Hey man i think i like being scared
And i wish you all were there
Tommorrow if i get my strength
I'll put my daddy's gun to use
I hate it, I hate it, feels like I'm drowning
The man's tied me up and i think he's frowning
Black widow is his favorite bite
Why does the creature cling so tight!
Makes her crawl on my face and neck
God, the man drives me a nervous wreck

You know he hasn't hurt me yet
But it's different now, just a whim
Maybe I'm becoming his pet
Hey man i think i like being scared an' I wish you all were there
Man i really, really think, really think that i think
I like being scared
Momma's lace and whiskey on the top shelf
Somehow they got caught up in my dream
Monsters on my right and cobwebs on my left
Scary man standin' right in front of me
Why am i starting to like this?
You know he hasn't hurt me yet
But its different now, just a whim
Maybe im becoming his pet
Hey man i think i like being scared and i wish you all were there
Man i really, really think, really think that i think
