I hits the Gin & Juice
Shadow pulls up in the Impala
He gives me the scoop about them wanna be ballers
How fools out there wanna play
I take another hit on the way
And then I blast away
(how far Blacky?)
Far enough to go off the edge
I'm pushin anotha busta off the ledge
So I stumbled as I heads towards the Lex'
I got my dick on hard
And all I'm thinkin about is sex
I'm a shot callin' baller is what they call me when I'm comin
Got the dollar sign on my chest so I'm hot and gunnin
Hi-powered out my way, crusin Riverside
To check upon my riches is hella drive, so drive on...
As I lean to the side with my Dom Perignon
Big ballin is what I do and fools in my crew
Don't take lightly to you bustas and so we say fuck you
Then buck you
Tuck you in for the night
While I'm out here makin chips you at your funeral sight
So when I'm hangin with the click & we countin em dollars
I feel good cuz everybody in my hood call me Mr. Super Baller

Now it was once said by a Lil' OG
Always tryna come up and make a G, uh
Cuz when I bust like a curse
Cuz see once in a lifetime, everyone does some dirt
I guess it's gots to mean the same
So at the age of Sixteen I entered the rap game
I had my raps locked down tight
In the day I went to school but I wrote all night
And when I went to class I always fell asleep
But I was up like a mothafucka if you had a beat
My teacher said Blacky can't it wait
I said no I gots to put some mo' icing on my cake
I think i made about 50 G's
I bought a Lex', a house and a Cutlass on D's
Moms is trippin but she really dont know
And all I'm thinkin is she ain't on the county no mo'
Before my moms fuck with the county again
I rather take the chance of doing five to ten
I'm not taking a chance
I'm straight making the chance
So now I deserve to take what I gonna get
I bought my mama a house and got straight
Cuz all you mothafuckas just player-hate
Yo, you really wanna know why I'm so paid
Cuz my money to me it means everything
And to you broke ass bitches making no dollars
And to my family, I'm a real Super Baller
Does anybody know
That Super Baller
Does anybody see
That Super Baller
