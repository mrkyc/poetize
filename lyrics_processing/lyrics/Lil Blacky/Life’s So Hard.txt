I'm a hustler, the streets got me going crazy
Out dipping and diving, got me hustling for my baby
Came a long way, 22 seven years deep
Owe everything to one man, Big G
Raised his 3 sons to be sick made hustlers
Because of his rep, homie no one could touch us
Taught us how to get money at a young age
Showed us different ways to play the game and stay paid
He got me in this game, he got me in this rapping
He got me loving to see my chips keep stacking
Even though you're gone, got you locked in a cell
On the streets you got so much love it's like you're out right now
You've been gone for six, and I was fifteen
Keep your head up and stay with a tight team
I could only imagine, how shit could be
If you was out right now, with me, Sick and Bundy

Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
Got me out here struggling, struggling
Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
Got me out here struggling, struggling

Let me talk about my life, being a drug dealer and a rapper
And a lot about my struggles, did and even after
It was fucked up, I pour out liquor for my dogs that are gone
Keep fucking it up, keep rocking it up
Cause bitch you know it's on
I fled town with this trick
Coming round back, hit it and leave
Got a call my dogs dead
Couple of minutes I start a fit
Feel my pain, I'm hating this
Gripping a nine, I'm letting it rip
To these foos that talk shit
It's all who be talking this
Split your wig muthafucka
Dump a whole clip and on you busters
I told you once before, you fucked with the wrong hustlers
This dedicated to my soldiers, that are dead and gone
Your life lives on, ain't nothing wrong
I wrote this song, on the come up
Taking hits from a bong, on the come up
Buy my own, cause shit you know it's on
Lil Sicko AKA Mr. Nasty it's on
Keep hustling, thugging and stay strapped til I'm gone

Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
Got me out here struggling, struggling
Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
Got me out here struggling, struggling
Fuck the world, let me get lost in my music
Puff on weed, as I smoke and abuse it
Sent her to lose it as I sit back and kick back
Drinking on pisto, as I spit on a sick track
The little stories and corruptions that I seen in my life
About the struggle and the man, is how the fuck we got by
The thugging lullaby that always ringing, banged in my ear
The tried situation shit that faced and we feared
It's so much bullshit that I seen in this world
They used to smile but the world makes me smile no more
A cold hearted look, of a crook and his lost souls
My mom gives me kisses and my last abrazos
I'll probably die a Junior then my single comes out
For all the truth in this shit, can't get out of my mouth
Life's so hard, cause they trying to fucking hate on Southland
8-1-8 riders it's a south side thang

Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
Got me out here struggling, struggling
Life's so hard
Got me out here hustling, hustling
Life's so hard
