Went away, went away
Went away, went away

Since you went away
I've been down and lonely
Since you been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
Where did you go to girl?
Ooh, I'm missing you
Tell me where you are boy
Tell me where you are boy

I'm sitting thinkin bout the first time that I seen ya
Far from the average, I knew I had to meet ya
Too good to pass up, I knew I had to ask ya
Your name, I spit game and then I had ya
Just leave me your number, I'd given you mine
Looked into each others eyes, said "I'll call you" at the same time
Since that day you've been on my mind
Thinkin bout nothin else but you and money while I'm on the grind
You took a chance on a playa, said you wanna ride
You wanna roll with super baller and give it a try
Together we was one, telling me about mistakes
Shouldn't of done what I done, I regret grinding late
I missed the days laying back blowing smoke
I missed the days laying down with you on top moving slow
You were the best, and I should've stayed true
Now I spend my day's lonely and missing you
You might also like
Since you went away
I've been down and lonely
Since you been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
Where did you go to girl?
Ooh, I'm missing you
Tell me where you are boy
Tell me where you are boy

What's up girl, I know I hit it and quit it and splitted
Get it on my own and now I'm back, are you with it?
Get it, stayed on the grind, been doing time
Been through a lot, with you on my mind
Heard you got a man, but it's all good
We can keep it on the low like we do it's all good
Pick you up late night, take a ride to the beach
Get a room after and make love between the sheets
I'm nasty, I'm a pimp girl, sick with it
Turn around, let Lil Sick hit it
You know I get ya what you want cause I got it like that
Finer things, diamond rings and some clothes on your back
Let's ride out, ride out, in my caddy truck
Back to my hood, you know just the two of us
That's how it is girl, til the end
I guarantee and promise you, we'll be closer than just friends
Since you went away
I've been down and lonely
Since you been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
Where did you go to girl?
Ooh, I'm missing you
Tell me where you are boy
Tell me where you are boy

Ooh, where are you baby
