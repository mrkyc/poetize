Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (Incoming!)

See it's the Ying Yang
And we a hazard
We're gonna get bumping up
And get ready for war
If we have to
It's a disaster
And we're them bastards
They don't know what slap a ho
Jack a ho
Crack a ho, forehead
Bucking we leave more dead
Destined for hell
We might as well
Be narrow bred
Fucking your health
We rearrange the game
Put that thing on your ho
Pussy popping, dropping and twurkulating
Ready to go
Now if you think we, think we won't buck, buck
Try your luck fuck, and I bet you get stuck
Much as y'all want to dog a broad
Little treat the ho
Never to be dull
And let her eat dough
And when you're me though
This how you greet the ho
This how you greet the ho
Hello
Naw I jumped off track
Let me get back to my subject
Y'all victims we suspects
Y'all talk shit we crack necks
We're bad, bad, bad
We're on fire
Fuck the man, man
Cause we all gotta die now
If you figure that you're bigger than God
I can't tell it
And if you shit a little bit in the school
You're gonna smell it
So all you niggas need to quit all that hate
It won't last
But a blast from gun
Player make you run fast
You might also like

Look up in the sky
It's a bird it's a plane
Naw, D-Roc and Kayne
Who? Ying Yang
Faster than the speeding bullets
And we leap over ghettos
Came to take the rap game
For you niggas that don't know
Here we come come come
Better run run run
Saying 'don't want none"
(Saying "don't want none")
You better move
Get out the way and let a mother fucker get through
If you get ran over then nigga that's on youI know you don't want to see us cut a fool
Cause niggas like us be thorough bred
Thugs cold-hearted
Don't make us get retardedDon't want trouble so you'd best not start it
Step off to the side when you see us come in
Two alley mother fuckers in your city again
We are on now guppy
Cause young ass niggas
Came to thingAnd we always win
But you throwing a win
And let's all have a party
Cause we don't want to hurt nobodyWe just came to have fun
Give me a bottle and a mother fucking cup
And if you feel what I'm saying get fucked up
