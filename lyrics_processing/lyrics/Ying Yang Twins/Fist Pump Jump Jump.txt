Red One, Ayyyup!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Here they come, let them in
Me and my brother back again
Yeah it's them wonder twins
Thundering and lightning in
Block thumping, club jumping
Cars in the street
Bumping red light, stop sign, drop top
Cops flying speed limit twenty five
People all outside in the middle of the block
Like it when the bass knock
Roll back, tik tok
Fish that, hit drop
Ying yang on the block
Cause we make the party rock
You might also like
Cause tonight we got a whole lot of spirit for life
Now throw your hands in the air saying
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, woahoah, woahoah

We gotta whole lotta ladies
And a whole lotta fellas
When you put em all together
They be ready for whatever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

And we bound to win
Everybody in the back
Everybody in the front
Fist pump pump jump jump
Wild out and get ignant
I wanna see you all getting it
So everybody to the dance floor
Whoop for real though
The whole club on flame
If you feel this song then jam
You already know who I am
So you know what time it is
We are gonna party like it's 1999
We are gonna jump till the club close
Seem like we on NoDoz
Off the wall like Michael
Cause tonight we got a whole lot of spirit for life
Now throw your hands in the air saying
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, woahoah, woahoah
