Half step pussy ass nigga
Why you lookin' at a nigga like you wanna run one wit' me?
I got my big gun wit' me
Don't feel like dukin', I feel like shootin', fool
And I don't like your atitude
You do shit that them hoes on a rag'll do
Ol' faggot, you better watch your mouth
'Fore I be in front your house when your ass come out
Ol' bitch ass, hold another nigga dick ass, snitch ass nigga
Keep lookin' at a nigga like you gonna tell somethin'
I'll fuck around and, kill ya (Fuck around and kill yo' ass)
So on your mark, get set, get ready, YO!
If this shit get silly I'm lettin' it go
On Front Street or in the front seat
You ever come my way, it's gon' be gunplay
And HEY... I ride wit' the AK
Get high and spit five out the AK
Okay, let a nigga play
And watch T-Double-D knock your ass off the free seat
All my Dade County Chevy boys
We drive candy toys and tote guns galore
And treat the Hummer like a Tonka toy
And got shit you niggas ain't seen before, huh

We, in this motherfucker, crunk in this motherfucker
Atlanta niggas wit' a Miami boy
And I still like to play wit' my Tonka toy
I'm a Toys R Us kid, yes I is
You can't be serious? Yes I is
You think I'm playin', then ask my brother
You still don't believe me, then ask my mother
Because I love my gun, I play wit' my gun
I fondle my gun, have sex wit' my gun
And I don't pull that motherfucker out for fun
'Cause I ain't finna' give yo' ass time to run
I'ma bust one time, bust two times
By the third time, your ass is mine
He'll be down for the count, he can't get up
Damn! He's fallen, he can't get up

Fuck yo' ass muh'fucka, that's the past muh'fucka
And I know the fact make ya mad muh'fucka
It is, what a fuck nigga think it ain't
For real, you lame and we off the chain
Ying and the T-Double-D, we BOLO
Fuck hoes, niggas, ride by my dolo
Get the keys to my car, and I jump in
Hit the liquor store, buy my cigars and gin
Get drunk and I'm off in the wind
Lookin' for a little itty bitty pretty that could hold a sin

We smokin', and ridin'
Don't tell nobody be quiet
Might cut it, lil' buddy
Can't let this shit get ugly
