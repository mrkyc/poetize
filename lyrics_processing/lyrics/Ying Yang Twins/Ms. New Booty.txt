I found you Ms New Booty
Get it together and bring it back to me
Hit the playas club for about month or two
Put his hand on it then see what he do

Girl I don't need you, but you need me
Take it off, let if flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let em tell theyself
And you ain't gotta sell sex, girl, it sells itself, Like nothing else
Yeah I'm a country boy, but that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Ain't life grand (life's grand) livin up daddy
Here go da whisper song, baby this is us ready?
Put it on me enthusiastically, what ever it is that you do, you do it admirably
And I ain't choose it, that thang chose me
Its bubba and ying yang, all the way in this thang
YO!
