Everybody in the club in the heat
Pussy get to poppin when we holdin the beat
Bitches throwin up they posin hands
Ass keep poppin out these female pants
Every motherfucker sippin on liquor
See the crunker they be gettin when they be drinkin a beer
And they be pullin on a mmoma like, "Bitch come here"
Pullin on a momma like, "Bitch come here scream
I'm Santa Claus, didn't you hear?
Tell Johnny Saint Dick what you want this year
And we might get it to yo' ass by the summer
Who, Peter Pancakin with a thumper
You, know we crank the club
Black magic in here, so drank it up
And you gon' be just as drunk as us
You gon' be just as drunk as us

Fin' to take it to the stage - "DRRROP!"
Put it all in the face - "DRRROP!"
Make it flow in the place - "DRRROP!"

Drop that motherfucker! DRRROP!(Drop that mother-fucker)
Drop that motherfucker! DRRROP!(Drop that mother-fucker)
Drop that motherfucker! DRRROP!(Drop that mother-fucker)
