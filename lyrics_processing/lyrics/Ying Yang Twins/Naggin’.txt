Women always talkin' about what men do
We don't never talk about what women do...at least 'til now
Come on

Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say "kiss my ass" (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

This for my niggas who be fuckin' 'round with them feelings
And you get your heart caught up in a mess
'Cause you lust just to fuck what's up her dress
And never paid attention
'Cause you didn't think the girl would start trippin'
Shawty flip the script
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips
I'ma tell you what I can't stand
When a woman play the role of a man
Talkin' to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat you like a spare, like you lack to understand
I know you know that I ain't gon' go for this jaw jackin' all the time
Talkin' to me out of line, broad, you done lost your mind
You gon' fuck round and get me some time
You might also like
Every now and then you get mad (HUH)
Sometime I make you sad (HUH)
Make you want to say "kiss my ass" (HUH)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)

But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

I need a lil more grip a lil less lip
Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip
At the point of no return and you made it that way
By the shit that you say every motherfuckin' day
Hope you payin' attention, 'cause I gots to mention
Dissin' me in front of your friends
Tryin' to get a lil laugh in, joke crackin'
Then I wanna whoop his ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't a man but you like how he pretend
I'm gonna keep sippin' my Henn and smokin' my herb
In my ear loud and clear with your naggin' words
The way you talk is absurd, gettin' on my nerves
All in my ear, got me 'bout to hit the curb
(SHUT UP!)
Every now and then you get mad (HUH)
Sometime I make you sad (HUH)
Make you want to say "kiss my ass" (HUH)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with

She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

One day I got shot by Cupid
In the midst of this, relationship went stupid
We went from talkin' on the phone too long
To nowadays your ass ain't home
You always call, tellin' me you out with your friends
But I find out later on you with your other men
Then, you ain't in it for the dividends
Say you suck and fuck and you ain't gettin' nothin'
That's a damn shame it ended like this
Now I ain't got love for ya, bitch
Shoo fly don't bother me
Will I get back with her? Probably
Then I thought about it, I won't
Do I really want you? I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'ma leave her alone, 'cause I can do bad on my own
That's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad (Huh)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh)
Make you want to say "kiss my ass" (Huh)
I'm tired of listenin' to you naggin'
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with
"Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah"
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (Should have known)
I should have left that bitch alone
But now I'm stuck with (NAGGIN)

Now, this is not a song disrespecting women
This is a song that Ying Yang made for every man that ever walked God's green earth
'I don't do's' don't amount up to 'I do do's'
But your attitude stink sometimes
So sit on that...HANH!
