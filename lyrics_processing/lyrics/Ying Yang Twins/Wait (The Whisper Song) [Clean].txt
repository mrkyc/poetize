Tell you sumthing that you might like to hear
You got a sexy lil' body and your booty look soft
Mind if I touch it? and see if its soft
Naw I'm jus playin' unless you say I can
And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So baby girl, don't be scared
You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed
And you can start gettin ahead
You like to cut, give it to me, dat freaky stuff
Do it up, don't be scared if it gets too rough
Make a decision, we need to get down to business
So you can see what you've been missin'
You might had some but you never had none like this
Just wait til I show you this (Ooh!)
Ay girl! wait til I show you this
Wait til I show you this
Ay girl! wait til I show you this

Ay girl! wait til I show you this

See I wanna , tell me whats up
Walk around the club with yo thumb in ya mouth (mouth, mouth)
Take your thumb out
There might be a lil kosher to deal with
Wet fat (fat), they don't spill it
I keep it--keep it hot when I'm puttin' in work
Wanna skeet skeet, you bout to get your feelin's hurt
Cuz I'll beat dat cat with a dog
And knock, knock, knock, knock til she scrawl
Like (OOOOOH!)
Yea something like that, but it depends on the swing of the baseball bat
Hit it up on da counter make the
Plates fall Back
On the floor she ain't screamin...so they crack
Crack...crack
