Yo, yo, let's go

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)
You want this money then you gotta be a badd bitch
Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch
You might also like
I'm in the club, lookin' for a badd bitch
In the parking lot, lookin' for a badd bitch
Everywhere I go I'm tryin' to find that badd bitch
You know me, I gotta keep me a badd bitch
A freak in the mornin', freak in the evenin'
I'm looking for a freak when I'm done, block bleedin'
Now take me to a house, tease me, then please me
And tell all her friends how the dick made her sleepy
Believe me, when I'm up in it I'm beatin' it
Givin' y'all that Mike Jones treatment
I could tell by the way she walk that she got it
Body so deadly, you can tell when she drop it
I'm either gonna hit her or I'ma be assed out
I've seen her walk by me, damn near passed out
Then crept up behind her, told her it was time to
Let a playa like me get in that vagina

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)
You want this money then you gotta be a badd bitch
Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch

She a ghetto ass bitch with some ghetto ass game
In the club where she work and she poppin' that thing
Said the bread keep her fed and the head at the bar
She could barely breathe on a nigga dick and make him cum
Come one (Come one) Come all (Come all)
Where them hoes like to get bucket ball?
If they can't take off they drawers
Ain't stayin' in there, nigga, naw

I love the way she dance, she look like she fuckin' herself
Shawty do a number just touchin' herself
Freaky ways, she can shake ass for days
Getting kinky in 69 different ways
Jump on stage, she get paid, singled off
You got enough money, she taking her clothes off
Look at that: I tawt I taw a puttycat
I did, I did, I did taw a puttycat

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)
You want this money then you gotta be a badd bitch
Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch

Bitch move, like you got somethin' to prove
Keep runnin' your dick-sucker, ho, you gon' lose
I don't wanna hear about your motherfuckin' blues
I'd rather see your ass clap-clap in them shoes
Like, bam, bam, bam, bam
Wham, wham (I tawt I taw a puttycat)

Shawty gettin' crunk, love gettin' low
Love it when she take it to the flo', make that booty roll
Take her clothes off for cheese, love smokin' weed
And she getting hella freaky on the Ecstasy
Do her dance for me, song after song
Shorty won't stop, she goes all night long
Now that's a girl who know what she want in life
She a schoolgirl by day and a stripper by night

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)
You want this money then you gotta be a badd bitch
Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
