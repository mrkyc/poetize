Half step pussy ass nigga
Why you lookin' at a nigga like you wanna run one wit' me?
I got my big gun wit' me, don't feel like doofin'
I feel like shootin' fool
And I don't like your attitude
You do shit that dem hoes on a rag'll do
Ol' faggot, you better watch your mouth
Fo' I be in front yo' house, when yo' ass come out
You might also likeOl' bitch ass, hold another nigga dick ass, bitch ass, nigga
Keep lookin' at a nigga like you gonna tell somethin'
I'll fuck around and, kill ya
So now that you set you ready, yo
If this shit get silly I'm lettin' it go
First scrito in the front seat
You ever come my way, it's gon' be gunplay
Hey, I ride wit' a AK, get high and spit five out the AK
Ok, let a nigga play and watch T double D
Knock ya ass of the free seat
All my Dade County Chevy boys
Who drive candy toys and tolt guns galore
And treat the Hummer like a Tonka toy
Got shit you niggas ain't seen before

We in this motherfucker crunk, in this motherfucker
And our niggas wit' a Miami boy
And I still like to play wit' my Tonka toy
I'm a Toys R Us kid, yes, I is
You can't be serious, yes, I is
You think I'm playin' than ask my brother
You still don't believe me than ask my mother
Because I love my gun, I play wit' my gun
Have fun wit' my gun, have sex wit' my gun
And I don't put a motherfucker out for fun
'Cuz I ain't funna' get ya ass tryin' to run
I'ma bust one time, bust two times
And the third time yo' ass is mine
Go down for the count, "He can't get up"
Damn, he fell and he can't get up
Boom, it's on, bitch nigga we'll rock yo' room
Boom, bitch what's happenin'?

If you mad 'cuz you like you never had mo'fucka
Fuck yo' ass mo'fucka, that's the past mo'fucka
And I know the fact make ya mad mo'fucka
It is what I thought nigga think it ain't
For real you lame and we off the chain
And the T double D, we bolo
Fuck hoes niggas ride by my Dolo
Get the keys to my car and I jump in
Hit the Liquor store, buy my Cigars and 'gen
Get drunk and I'm off in the wind
Lookin' for a itty bitty pretty that could hold a sin
We smokin', and ridin'
Don't tell nobody be quiet
Might cut it lil' butt it
Can't let this shit get done
Boom, it's on, bitch nigga we'll rock yo' room
