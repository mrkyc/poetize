Half step pussy ass nigga
Why you lookin' at a nigga like you wanna run one wit' me?
I got my big gun wit' me don't feel like dippin' I feel like shootin' FOOL!
And I don't like your attitude
You do sh*t that dem hoes on a rag'll do
Ol' faggot, you better watch your mouth
Fo' I be in front ya house, when ya ass come out
Ol' b**ch ass, hold another nigga dick ass, b**ch ASS, NIGGA!
Keep lookin' at a nigga like you gonna tell somethin'
I'll f**k around and, kill ya!
So now that you set you ready, YO!
If this sh*t get silly I'm lettin' it go
First scrito in the front seat
You ever come my way, it's gon' be gunplay
HEEEYYY.. I ride wit' a AK, get high and spit five out the AK
Ok, let a nigga play and watch T-Double-D knock ya ass of the free seat
All my Dade County Chevy boys, who drive candy toys and tolt guns galore
And treat the Hummer like a Tonka toy
Got sh*t you niggaz ain't seen before

And our niggaz wit' a Miami boy
And I still like to play wit' my Tonka toy
I'm a Toys R Us kid, yes I is
You can't be serious, yes I is
You think I'm playin' than ask my brother
You still don't believe me than ask my mother
Because I love my gun, I play wit' my gun
Have fun wit' my gun, have sex wit' my gun
And I don't pull that muthaf**ka out for fun
'Cause I ain't finna' give yo' ass time to run
I'ma bust one time, bust two times
And the third time yo' ass is mine
Go down for the count, "He can't get up!"
DAMN! he fallin', he can't get up!

F**k hoes niggaz ride by my Dolo
Get the keys to my car, and I jump in
Hit the Liquor store, buy my Cigars and gin
Get drunk and I'm off in the wind
Lookin' for a little itty bitty pretty that could hold a sin

We smokin', and ridin'
Don't tell nobody be quiet
Might cut it lil' butt it
Can't let this sh*t get ugly
