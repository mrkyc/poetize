Ying Yang, we done done it again
And put it on the map like hahn!
Put it on the map like hahn!

Think we ain't crunk
They think we playing
All around the world
Is what they saying
Think we ain't crunk
They think we playing
All around the world
Is what they saying
Hanh x8
Take a pen and a paper
And we spit on some game
And flip the script
And got the world start screaming our names
Ying Yang in this thing and its evident
(You don't really like us nigga?) You irrelevent
We brought hands to the game and we taking over
Mind control them like a hypnotic potion
Puff of smoke them
Nigga we don't bluff we rolls them
Curve your stomach you vomit from the roller-coaster
We've been around the globe
Done seen the world
Now we still make jingles for the boys and girls
And they like when a nigga say hahn (hahn!)
Play a nigga song like hahn (hahn!)
Cause we keep coming wit the shit ya like
I say you got that right?
You got that right
Niggas stay crunk like hahn (hahn!)
Nigga off the chain like hahn
Kane bring it back now (hahn!)
Niggas in the club like (hahn!)
Bitches in the club like (hahn!)
We roll on dubs like (hahn!)
We scream throw it up like (hahn!)

We gonna crank this bitch until it flow
Say Hanh! (hanh!)
If you feel it mother fuckers say hahn! (hanh!)
If you don't give a fuck say hanh! (hanh!)
Ain't no kool-aid in your cup say hanh! (hanh!)
Crank this mother fucker up like hanh! (hanh!)
We gonna have a ball
And party like its Mardi Gras
Even if you're on the wall
Just clap ya hands
Ying Yang in this thing like hanh!
We was on Soul Train screaming hanh! (hanh!)
On 106 and Park screaming hanh! (hanh!)
We was on Spring Bling screaming hanh! (hanh!)
We was on the Bassment screaming hanh! (hanh!)
When we in your city we gonna scream hanh! (hanh!)
When you ain't wit us we still gonna scream hanh! (hanh!)
All these years we gonna scream hanh! (hanh!)
Even next year we still gonna scream hanh! (hanh!)
When we take the description of the song
Just cause we make it a jingle
That don't mean its a get along
See we make it like this
So you can learn it quicker
And find out why we ain't concerned with niggas
The twins and we quicker than little nigga
We quicker to drill a nigga
We jump up on a stage and kill a nigga
They wishing that they crowds would feel them nigga
The way me and my mans and them nigga (x4)
Scream hanh! (hanh!)
Till you can't no more
After that start stomping the flo'
Kinda like you got the holy ghost
Get crunk, start doing your thing
Get up, start doing your thing (hanh!)
