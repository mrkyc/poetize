Deck da club with piles of money
Falalalala, lala, la, la
She make, you think that she yo' honey
Falalalala, lala, la, la
You drink, and drink, and then, you think
She gon' go as you throw all yo' bank
Deck da club with piles of money
Falalalala, lala, la, la

One potato, two potato, three potato, four
Christmas done came so you get a little more
You hit the liquor store, they closed, you mopin'
So you hit the bar 'cause you know it's wide open
Ho, ho, ho, Santa's in the building
Boy, he so crunk they say (Ah, he's in the ceiling)
Cartier put in play with the Tiffany
Call me Ghetto Santa, say it with me
Everybody clean, everybody's raw
Everybody at the bar sippin' egg nog
Tipsy, tipsy, what do you know?
The whole club filled up with mistletoe
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year
Ying Yang Twins still off in here
Like Ho, ho, ho, take off your clothes
Get your grip of keys from workin' the pole
So we gon' make it snow, we should do that that
A-di-uh-do that that, a-di-uh-do that that
She a reindeer, call her Rudolph the Red Nose
She do a dance on her tippy toes
So keep on keep on spendin' that dough
Just to see her do her thang
Making that booty roll, but just don't spill my drank
Bend over and touch your toes, then bring that booty up slow
Round and round it goes, then one more time, get low, low
