Fuck y'all dames, I got game

For real bitch, don't take the shit wrong
Thinkin' I'm nice, I'll break ya jawbone
Get the fuck on, leave me alone
Bitch, you betta go on
See, y'all hoes ain't optimistic
Cockblockin' bitches, you unproper bitches
What's tha problem, bitches
You say ya nigga, hurt ya feelins
Well, hoes done hurt mine, not once, not twice
But bitch all the time so I'm a dog to a broad
Have 'em all cryin' I done cried before that don't make me a hoe
That just show me where my feelins ain't supposed to go
See, I got da magic stick, ya dumb bitch
Other nigga you fuck wit, be on some punk shit
And I'm ma show y'all I don't need no help
Just as soon as I loosen my belt, bitch

Call y'all, out y'all muthafuckin' name
Fuck y'all dames, I got game
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I need a moment I can't stand bitches and hoes
'Cause a bitch is a bitch and a hoe gon' hoe
But a woman hold her own, she got her own home
She drive her own car, buyin' drinks at tha bar
Take a nigga out to eat, take a nigga to da mall
Treat a nigga good and wash a nigga draws
But bitches ain't shit, always talkin' shit
They wanna be tha shit, but is they shit? No
And hoes, they fuck off the goddamn chain
Everything and everythang and don't take names
So that's a nasty hoe and I can't do shit wit it
Please, get out my face, I don't need a case
Yeah, I love y'all respectful women , independent women
I takes 'em out all the time but y'all hit the baggage
Need to keep on trackin'
I ain't speakin', I ain't talkin' to nothin' 'cause
All these hoes is da muthafuckin' same
Play ya to da left like a muthafuckin' lame
Call y'all, out y'all muthafuckin' name
Fuck y'all dames, I got game
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
Just keep my name out ya mouth
Before ya find out, how a down south hoe wil' out
You a hata, she a hata, three a hata, fo'
Everywhere I go, I see some hatin' ass hoes
Seven bell, jazze bell, never my 
 be hot because my deeper esophagus
Still they wanna bone me, smile and phone me
Laugh 'cause soon as I turn my back, they stab it
Learn to play fair, stop tryin' to care
Two hoes to one nigga, bitch, learn to share
Baby, you dead ass broke for hatin' on the rich chicks
See how I flow? Bitch, put this on ya wish list
Two seater wit tha chill on
My baby daddy put tha grill on, fixin' to put tha heels on
Chrome spokes wit da low pros
And tha trunk funk blows up the cedar on the dashboard
All these hoes is da muthafuckin' same
Play ya to da left like a muthafuckin' lame
Call y'all, out y'all muthafuckin' name
Fuck y'all dames, I got game
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
I hate hoes, hoes hate me
This is the men's national anthem for this year
All y'all real women, y'all can sing this shit too
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe, you can sing this shit too
If you a bitch and you hate another bitch, you can sing this shit too
So everybody gon' sing this shit
I hate hoes, they hate me too
Yup, yup, yup, yup
Yup, yup, yup, yup
