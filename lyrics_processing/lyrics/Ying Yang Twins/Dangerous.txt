She's fire, she's fine
She's his,  she's mine
Black barbie

I ain't really trying to let you in
But you can spend your Benjamins
Make no mistake thinking she's your friend
This is all about dividends
Wait, she like to play games
And she don't care who she play wit'
She do what she do
And she gon' get what she gon' get
She hit the strip club
And she gon' make her money quick
Shake ass on the pole

She take the thug
Put them in the trance
She shake that ass
Like an avalanche
Look into her eyes
And you taking the chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in her eyes
Like the way she moves
She got the fire in her eyes
Fire on her waist
Fire in her thighs
