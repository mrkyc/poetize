Put your arms around me, honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh babe, won't you roll those eyes
Eyes that I just idolize?
When you look at me my heart begins to float
Then it starts to rockin' like a motorboat
Oh, oh, I never knew anyone like you

Nighttime is a-fallin', ev'rything is still
And the moon is shinin' up above
Lovebird is a-callin' for ev'ry Jack and Jill
It's a good time for young lovers to love
I know someone is waitin' all alone for me
Waitin' in that same place underneath that old tree
Tonight's the night so won't you hold me tight?
In your lovin' arms I long to be

Put your arms around me, honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh babe, won't you roll those eyes
Eyes that I just idolize?
When you look at me my heart begins to float
Then it starts to rockin' like a motorboat
Oh, oh, I never knew anyone like you
You might also like

The band keeps on playin' all our favorite songs
We'll be dancin' when the mornin' comes
I'd like to tell the world what I feel for you
Hopin' you might feel the same way, too
Tell me that you need me, make my dreams come true
Ev'ry moment that I'm livin' I'm thinkin' of you
Oh please, don't let me down
You're the one that makes my world go round

So put your arms around me, honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh babe, won't you roll those eyes
Eyes that I just idolize?
When you look at me my heart begins to float
Then it starts to rockin' like a motorboat
