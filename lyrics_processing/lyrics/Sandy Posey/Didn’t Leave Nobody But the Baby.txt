Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Your mama's gone away, and your daddy won't stay
Don't leave nobody but the baby

Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Ev'rybody's gone in the cotton and the corn
And leave nobody but the baby

You're a sweet little baby (You're a sweet little baby)
You're a sweet little baby (You're a sweet little baby)
There's honey in the rock and surely gonna stock
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

Don't you weep, pretty baby (Don't you weep, pretty baby)
Don't you weep, pretty baby (Don't you weep, pretty baby)
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin' baby

Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
You and me and the Lord makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby
You might also like
Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
Come lay your bones on the alabaster stone
And be my ever-lovin' baby

Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Your mama's gone away, and your daddy won't stay
Don't leave nobody but the baby

Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Go to sleep, you little baby (Go to sleep, you little baby)
Ev'rybody's gone in the cotton and the corn
And leave nobody but the baby

You're a sweet little baby (You're a sweet little baby)
You're a sweet little baby (You're a sweet little baby)
There's honey in the rock and surely gonna stock
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

Don't you weep, pretty baby (Don't you weep, pretty baby)
Don't you weep, pretty baby (Don't you weep, pretty baby)
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin' baby
Go to sleep, pretty baby (Go to sleep, pretty baby)
Go to sleep, pretty baby (Go to sleep, pretty baby)
You and me and the Lord makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby

Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
Go to sleep, little baby (Go to sleep, little baby)
Come lay your bones on the alabaster stone
