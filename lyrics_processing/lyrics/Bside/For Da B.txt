Bang for the B not Philly
Shit goes down in my city
Think first now don't be silly
Still back the blade and get chingy
Still stretch that boy, no biggie
 x2
Bang for the B not philly
Mash work, get busy
Shit goes down in my city
Won't lack, always got my thingy
Think first now don't be silly
Still back the blade and get chingy
Still stretch that boy, no biggie
Ride that bird I don't sing like Biggie

Posted up in the B, late night playing cops and robbers
Ay, come we go ride? Come we go catch some oppers?
Skid round opp block, I'm not tryna get bagged by choppers
When the sirens come man skeet man's dashing from coppers
Fly upsuh, might set up shop like Lidl
My right hands loose, he loves discharging missiles
On the block with the TSG van playing piggy in the middle
And the sound off mad so we might have to screw on that whistle
You don't know about being young boys on the bus with the dotty
(You don't know about that)
Long stick in the gym bag no we weren't playing no hockey
Conversating with bro like make sure you done that properly
Now the feeling's rage cos the mandem locked for a body
All it takes is 1 phone call bro bring that thingy
That's 25 years and were not going home like Drizzy
Remember kway back then when i used to roll with my flicky
Now we just cop skengs and I'm tryna go half on a mizzy
Bside K but they don't come round
How many times have we run them down
Skududu bang man love that sound
Skid up skr crash corn then bounce
Kway back then probably jerk mans ounce
How i just run straight in then out
Kick down the door to your house
Leave man curl up stretch out on couch
That ting jam just just cop a next pole
Invest in smoke I ain't buying no clothes
B gang's way to bunny on road
If buck fiddy done it i was probably involved
Man flag b gang till im dead
Catch me posted up in the ends
My BroBros ments he dont care about bread
He just want to fish the bones out your head

I'm not the one to start fighting
Long sword, magnificent knifing
When you talk 'bout scoring points
I don't now what you mean
Your gang's not decisive
Just panic it
Cah they don't want smoke, they vanish
Seen them scream, that faggot's
Got gold teeth man break those carrots
You feel me
If the scores was weights then it's mad unbalanced
I dont know about broke boys round here
Sell them grams tryna push my balance
Got bro in the can, all mad
Had rocks tryna break and wrap it
Feds on top with things said the cats was big
That's right tryna leave man open
30 ding dong we're smoking
Wet man like i dash some volvic
Anyone K, anyone can hold it
Don't have the right to start boasting
Claiming a guy got got
But mandem know who ran with their pokers
Don't think you're bad to come closer
Badman you're the one who got ??
What bread big loaves of that Hovis
Is known to whip up them potions
Talk blood but the pigs tryna hold them
Touch gang ill be out with the ??
Tryna dish out the coldest poking
Real talk fam it ain't no joke ting
Deep in your ends I'm posted
Drive up, put the gears in motion
