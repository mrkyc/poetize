Like where dey doe? (Where dey?)
Where dey all hiding? (Where dey at?)
Jump in the hoopty
Make DeeDee drive it (Drive dat)
I heard there was opps on the block so come let's go find dem
Like heard there was opps on the block
So come let's go find dem

It's like free bucky B I know he's holding shit down in ISIS (My fucking nigga)
Like this time last year Belmarsh I was baking off with the lifers
Right now I'm kinda pissed off
I ain't really tryna breach my license (Fuck it man)
And I been on the run for a year now
It's long, I keep dashing from the sirens
B Side's where the G's at
Dat's the home of the convicts
Like come take a trip 'round my block
Nigga if you think you're on shit
Like dey don't want smoke
Nah dey don't want conflict
Dem boy there some actors
And dem boy der ain't on piss
You might also like
Like where dey doe?
Where dey all hiding?
Jump in the hoopty
Make DeeDee drive it (Drive dat)
I heard there was opps on the block
So come let's go find dem
Like I heard there was opps on the block
So come let's go find dem

On shit from a yute man
Ask anyone I've been bad from a pickney
Like manna still ducking and diving
And the pigs are still tryna nick me (Fuck the feds)
Dis nigga say he's on me, what he's on me?
Den I told him come dip me (Dip-dip)
Dip-dip for a man's back let my rambo puncture man's kidney
The opps dem talk too much
They do a whole load of tweaking
Like catch a man lacking in the B's gonna hold a lot more than a beating
Like little D, KK and Arzi will stab man up for no reason (Dip-dip-dip)
That's bare skududu in the ding-dong
Wheel spin, the tyres all screeching
Couple man banned from the ends
And dem boy der can't come back (No way)
Dem boys they some pussies
Dem man there watched me get stabbed in my back
And it don't make sense
Cah now dem man wan' talk bad on tracks
But I licked a stain with dem man
Den I stain 'em for 10 bags cash
Upsuh the kitties know me
I'm the one they get their gear from
Talk about 25 shots in a Mac but you've never been near one
Pull up on your block with the dots
Live corn I ain't letting off air guns
The 12-gauge sound like thunder
The ting nearly burst up my ear drums
Like where dey doe?
Where dey all hiding?
Jump in the hoopty
Make DeeDee drive it (Drive dat)
I heard there was opps on the block
So come let's go find dem
Like I heard there was opps on the block
So come let's go find dem
