I got tools in my jacket, go-go gadget
And if I ain't got it, I go-go grab it
And then i'm back in the setting with the blade or ratchet
Then i'm back in the setting with the blade or ratchet
My young g's savage, so so savage
Never lacking, always packing
In that 4 door auto-matic
I told them calm down, cah they move too rapid
Beef no lacking, trap no slacking
Beef no lacking, trap no slacking
I blacked out plus my black blade be matching
I'm older I'm tryna fire sticks like 
Ride with the passion, bag with the mash in
First you see it flashing then you hear it crashing
Nowadays a firearms part of my fashion
Nowadays a firearms part of my fashion
I'm bagging up tired, workers getting hired
Any slack trapping lil niggas getting fired
I'm dicing up the onions, not the sort to have you crying
Gotta watch the clients now I heard the cats be wired

I need bands in bundles stacked to the ceiling
I told my cousin "lets get money and just low the beef ting"
But he just wanna kill the opps becah they keep on tweaking
And now that niggas on the run and I don't even see him
We just rise up the poles if the teams not eating
How many niggas have we robbed and just left them speechless?
My nigga caught a body I just hope he beats it
My other niggas caught a body and he still ain't been nicked
I love my mum the most I'm just tired of her preaching
She told me I should get a job and I'm above the street ting
It felt like just the other day my trainers dem was leaning
So mum, I'm out here on the roads because a niggas eating
My heart turned cold I swear my hearts freezing
They said 30's a dead man when I see him
Let me tell you why I don't believe dem
Because I woke up this morning and I'm still breathing
Way before this rap ting I had bitches preeing
Fuck, I'll pass her on to bro and he's doing his ting
Tryna take my life these bitches want my semen
But you can keep that dirty pussy I don't fucking need it
Me and K was living mad living like some demons
And I swear if we seen that boy we would've spleadged him
We used to always have the burner on us when we're sleeping
