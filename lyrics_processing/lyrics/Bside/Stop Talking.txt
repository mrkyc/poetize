Man wanna talk 'bout guns
Man wanna talk 'bout action (Just chatty)
Bare hashtags, no bodies
Why chat lies for a caption? (Why lie?)
In and out of da block for the cash
Anything that I see, must grab them (Man grab them)
Enemies that drop, just stab them (Just stab them)
'Bout you come to the B, stop chatting
Man wanna talk 'bout guns
Man wanna talk 'bout action (Just chatty)

Why chat lies for a caption? (Why lie?)

Two man deep on a bike
Man don't know about cautions (No)
Ring-ring, trap in ghetts with Tizz
Hit bando 'til 6 in the morning (Trappy)
Demons fuck with my conscience
Man bring a problem, man get it sorted (Sick)
Feds on KK, but I don't say names
Got me feeling like I've been haunted (No names)
CH don't come to the side
He loves his life, looks like he's been snorting (Jokeman)
If Taze pulls up in a ride
He's gonna think 'bout the last time we saw him (Remember that?)
Same time with Rugez in the ride
Guns in the ride, who are you fooling? (Ha)
Who was running on the lane?
I got the car keys last time I caught him (Jokeman)
I done what I did for LA
Get the load down, them man bored him (Dip-dip)
You can laugh at the dead
But same time no one got touched on that poor performance
If the white come shit like YB
I don't buy that 'cah that shit's appalling (Dead up)
Any opp come, man'll get bun
Man'll get dip with borers (Boom-bow)
My niggas don't run, you pulled out your gun
I see dem straps bussing like Walkers
They ain't onto the beef, I'm onto these neeks
Looks like they're running from stalkers (Ha)
Can't wonder the streets, might bump into B
See yourself cutting them corners (Skeeting)
Music might make you look cool
But the badness runs in the waters (Gang)

Kick off the door to your mums, like, where is the money and the grub? (Where's the money?)
Come to your block with da gang
I beg a man please don't run (Don't run)
Dem man talk too much
These times ain't squeezed on none (Stop talking)
I be sitting in the trap
Begging the police don't come
Turning food into funds (Bands)
More money, that means more guns
B9 coming in chrome
Dot-dot all coming in rust (Rusty)
That bitch deader than me
I don't think I'm gonna fuck (No)
I make her just break down dem stones
Then I go re-re the dust (Whip-whip)
Like, gimme a sim and a phone and I'mma get that line ringing
Got a two in a Q or both
And I ain't going home till it's finished (Man trappy)
Man do road with trappers
Man do road with drillers
The plug he be showing me love me
I get it for the low and flip it (Gang, gang)
