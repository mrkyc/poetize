(Who engineered this? JS)
If a man fuckin' bust shots at you
And I know about it, it's fuckin' mad!
-Bruv, you--
I'm ridin' out immediately!

I drive German whips like Tokyo Drift
And I handle the skid like my name was Stig
They need to free up my bros out the nick
Still locked down, never did work for the pigs
And I still do road with my stick
Or I'm diallin' Kweng make him blow out your wig
It was me who put smoke on the strip
If you see me on the bike with a pole on my hip
I told bro take off his hat in the car
Cah I don't like this Volvo
The obbo's real and the Met's still surveillin', takin' photos
Twenty racks in the new twenties
It looks like ten in the old notes
And I had one ancient dotty
Like say I just bought it from Antiques Roadshow
How many man have I robbed and kidnapped
How many packs have I stretched like gymnast
How many shots have I bussed to the kit kats
How many times on the wing with my kick back
(How many man have I robbed and kidnapped)
(How many packs have I stretched like gymnast)
(How many shots have I bussed to the kit kats)
(How many times on the wing with my kick back) (How many)
Kitchen caution, wrist game awesome
No we're not playin' with flour
Nine z's in the road ting need more bowl mix
Flake residue in my trousers
Just whipped up a force click
Kettle's still boiling, 2 and a Q on the counter
We just bought some more whips the grey dons chored it
And we copped tools off the Scousers
