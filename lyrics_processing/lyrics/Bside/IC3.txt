Smokes not cheap
Step with bro and I might just squeeze
Where those neeks?
On a lurk tryna fry me an IC3
We run the B
When I back that mash don't run from me
They lie on beats
How can these puppy's give man so much cheek?

BsideK but dem man don't ride
Mans got guns, still roll with knives
18 times slide that inside
Still skid round there 2 rusty 9's

Free K1 and my young boy Tempz
Run man down watch him jump that fence
Bside gang stuff slugs in skengs

Move like shhh push bike with the scrams
Dem boy lucky that the ting did jam

Stick jam just throw dat hammer
New ting that blow like Hannah
Man roll that pack up
Loud boy get smoked for chatter
15 still grip that dagger
Hit cells go get my grams up
Shit smells not glitz and glamour
Slapped corn for Dizz and Blacker
We taped off roads and pavements
I saw dem niggas statements
Man smoke on opps that's flavours
Gunshots wake up the neighbours
Hand tings, don't fuck with tazers
Live corn for any paigon
Stretch man go burn my trainers
Den go bake off in

Like run, run? Me run? Mhm-Mhm, not from you
Samurai swords, the biggest of ones
Dip-dip spill some juice
Make sure the blade go through
No Spartan ish we Kuku
Get cash, buy guns and food
Do road and distribute
Phone lines got the money there coming
I be kicking back corn with a Russian

With a bat man I had a nigga running
Now they wanna talk about bludclart
MadMax I'll bludclart done him
