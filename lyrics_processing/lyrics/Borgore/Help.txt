(Ah)
I got versace models rolling blunts on my versace table
5k on a jacket and I haven't checked the label
always there with haters but always stay so grateful
I'm really good at making really good girls unfaithful,
I'm running out of checks to check,all my check's lit,
I had to threat more strangers than a wife from Craigslist,
not sure if its real life or am I lucid dreaming
it's a nightmare to have everything
but say we die with meaning

I think I need help
help I think I need
weed, alcohol, women
women, alcohol, weed
I'm tryna fight my demons
I know that I'm the best
vacation when I die
thankful that I'm blessed


Gucci models rolling blunts in my Tom Ford Raw
this is one mismatch that you wish you could afford
we're not the same religion but she's screaming "oh Lord"
this is one mismatch that my mom doesn't support
I think I need help
help I think I need
weed, alcohol, women
women, alcohol, weed
I'm tryna fight my demons
I know that I'm the best
vacation when I die
thankful that I'm blessed


I think I need help
I got everything I need
more wifeys in my house
than insta models on my feed
I'm fulfilled and yet I feed
I don't do drugs life is a trip
No even going out no more
it's hard to choose a whip

I think I need help
help I think I need
weed alcohol women
women alcohol weed
I'm tryna find a purpose
Can't deal with society
Good head is the only
way to fix my anxiety
I think I need help
help I think I need
weed, alcohol, women
women alcohol weed
I tryna fight my demons
I know that I'm the best
vacation when I die
