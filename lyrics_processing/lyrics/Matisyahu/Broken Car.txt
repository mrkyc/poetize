It don't move fast but it goes so far
Though you might bang your head or scrape your toes
Fred Flintstone with my feet out through the holes
But don't you worry now
Don't you worry, cos it will get you there
Where you need to go
Where you need to go
Where you need to go
Over the hillsides and the valleys, far and wide
Where the sun goes, and the sky it shines
Oh-oh, fire gon rage tonight
Welcome to my broken home
It's not so fancy, made from sticks and stones
It's often empty
I hope you like to be alone
You can stare out the window
Until you find your zone
Take cover from the bombs and the bullets
Take time to heal your wounds
Forget what they told you now, just listen on to the tunes
Listening to the tune
You might also likeWelcome to my broken house
You don't have to tiptoe here
You can put your feet down
Feel the floor beneath you, feel the ground
Don't worry bout the future
You're here right now
Unpack your bags and relax for a while
Rest your weary eyes
I know you've been tired
Where do you need to go?
Where you got to be?
Where do you need to go?
I'm your taxi
Don't you worry
Don't you worry now
Don't you worry now
Fire gon rage tonight
Welcome to my broken heart
I know it's hard, sometimes you fall apart
Welcome to my broken song
Don't worry now baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Welcome to my broken heart
I know it's hard, sometimes you fall apart
Welcome to my broken song
Don't worry now baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Where you need to go?
Where you need to go?
Where you need to go?
