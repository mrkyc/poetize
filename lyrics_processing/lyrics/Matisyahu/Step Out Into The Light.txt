Watchin faces out my window
Vs. 1
To the people on they grind
To the country out its mind
Half grins
Half spun like a dreidel
No middle to my know how
Slow down for the show now
I'd rather be alone than explain how
Wake up and walk out
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
My demons waitin on every corner just
to pull me down
They follow me around
They're in my blood as the leaves hit the
ground and the wind from the willow
My only shield is the sound
My feelings release in these sounds
Get free in these sounds
Let it bleed in these sounds
In these verbs in these nouns
In these words build a boat
Take me though stormy seas till my
feet hit the ground
Hit the ground running
Hit the town humming
Ancient melodies come back to me now
come back to me now
Ancient melodies come back to me now
come back
Stop and ask the question
Like Nachman I loose the vision
enter to the fog
Driving down this mountain to the ocean
floor where you've never gone before
open up the door to a room you've
chosen to ignore
Swimming in a ocean of fear
You've been swimming in an ocean of fear
Through the unknown and the unclear
Through the unknown and the unclear
Fear of ya life
Fear of ya knife
Cut open this tightly stitched world that
you made examine inside
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
Shake it off gotta shake up the vibe
(Chorus)
You've been traveling the speed of light
You been searching
You been movin all of ya life
You been reaching
You been running out of sight
You been seeking
Disappearing into the light
Into the light you been taken to
Vs. 2
Now ya digging up the grave stone
Breaking up the glass house that
you craved for
Breaking up the paved road that you made
Entering the maze
fear of the strange
Fear of the waves as they crash down
Once sung
Of a longing once felt
Like a trophy that you won and kept it
on the mantle
Time to dismantle
Get a handle
Takin off you sandals
Lighting up the candles
Now ya livin in shambles
Ramble on with the bros
Ramble on the pros
Cons can't hack it
With my jacket
Causing a racket
Take a crack and crackle
Tackling competition with my mission
Livin with the vision
Or touch the moonlight
Wake up and walk out
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
Shake it off gotta shake up the vibe
(Chorus)
Traveling at the speed of light
You been searching
You been movin
all of ya life all of ya life all of ya life
You been traveling at the speed of light
You been searching
You been movin
All of ya life
All of ya life
All of ya life
reaching
You been running
You been seeking
Disappearing
out of sight
All of ya life
All of ya life
All of ya life
You been searching
You been moving all of your life
You've been reaching
You been running all of your life
You been seeking
Disappearing into the night
You been reaching
You been running into the night
You've been searching
You've been moving all of your life
You've been reaching
You been running all of your life
You been searching
You been movin
You been reaching
You been running
You been seeking
Disappearing
Trying to step out into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Trying to make your life feel right
