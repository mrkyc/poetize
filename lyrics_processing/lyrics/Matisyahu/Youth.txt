Some of them running
Some of them looking for fun
Some of them looking for a way out of confusion
Some of them don't know where to be
Some of them don't know where to go
Some of them trust their instincts
That something's missing from the show
Some don't fit society
Their insides are crying low
Some of them teachers squashed the flame
'Fore it had a chance to grow
Some of them embers still glow
Them charcoal hushed and low
Some of them come with a hunger suppressed
Not fed them feel the death blow, yo
Young man, control in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
Take a stand, fan the fire for the flame of the youth
Got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move

Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
You got to make the right move
"Youth is the engine of the world"
"Youth is the engine of the world"
Storm the halls of vanity
Focus your energy
Into a laser beam
Streaming shattered light
Unites to pierce between the seams and it seems
See the world open peering the children see
Rapid fire for your mind
Half the truth is just a lie
They rub me the wrong way
They say their way or fall behind
Seventeen disconnect left out
The concept as to why
There's a spiritual emptiness
So the youth them get vexed
Skip class and get wrecked
Feel with music and cigarettes
To fill the hole in their chest!
Young man, control in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
Take a stand, fan the fire for the flame of the youth
Got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move
Young man, the power's in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
