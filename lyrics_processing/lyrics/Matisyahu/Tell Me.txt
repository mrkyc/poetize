Searching for a song
Hoping for a way
Staring at the sky
When I walk by
you may lose your way
Grounded for a time
So make way
For the waves as they break
Unravel down the line
Like we traveling in time
So come we gonna lead the blind
Cause my heart still hears the cries
Of my crimes
Mixed with blood and tears
You been fighting all these years
(Chorus)
Tell me what the reason
Your heart is frozen
You're tired of loosing
Your path is chosen
Tell me where you holding
Where you going so fast
Been tied up in emotion
But I'm trying to make this last
Say goodbye to the high
Say hello to the low
Say hello to your friends and the people that you choose
And I can't intoxify
Say goodbye to the foe
Too much on the line
to spend your time
chasing after all of those
Try to find a way
to walk the middle road
For now it's me
In a house full of boys
37 years old
Demons stayin at bay
And the ghosts  they went away
Sittin back on my porch as the day grows short and I watch my children play
(Chorus)
Say goodbye to the highs
Say hello to the lows
So many different shades
So many different flows
Seen so much clearer
Been paid the toll
Hurricane
When the haze clears and you find yourself
Back in the day
And raindrops
Of a past glory
I'm reaching but I can't touch them stories
Of my life seem trite
After me
What she sees in me
And the wipers up and on the glass
Keep my sights intact
To the river
Thoughts hush
Of memories
Of a past glory
Of a past glory
I'm reaching
But I can't touch them stories
Of my life
Seem trite
But not
New day New light
New year same fight
New lows new highs
