No way, you're
An astronaut in your spaceship
Who's got walking to the moon
In your spacesuit with your laser
Touching darkness like Darth Vader
With the strength of your creator
Angels all around ya
Surround ya with good nature
You got light
Yeah, you got light so bright
It can slice through the equator
Ancient fathers before you
To continue their adventure
'Cuz the lower you get
Helps you understand your neighbour
'Till you shred through all these layers
And after that
When you've cut this world in half
And you move into your prayer
You're a knight in shining armour
With the kingdom at your back
You're no stranger
Your despair, ya
Gives you power
That's a fact
When you climb these lonely towers
And you found your way back
You might also likeWill you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Run for the rhythm
And the timing's right
When you're lost at sea
Can't find your light
When the night goes on
And your song won't sing
And the chest is tight
And the bells won't ring
Look up to the stars
And know you're one of them
Shining in the darkness
To all the children
Remind them of a day
When the clouds will go away
And the sun will shine our way
When one day will be today
And the king will find his crown
And the light will be put down
To his kingdom on the ground
You've been searching all around
Now you've found
Raise me up into your town
Dancing all around
Raise me up into your town
Dancing all around
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
