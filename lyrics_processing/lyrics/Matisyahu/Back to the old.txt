Back to the old
Back to the gold
Still and steady
Got these subs in my Chevy
Feeling heavy
These lead pipes they don't tread lightly
Sitting silently
Living with myself
Limited capacity
No more catastrophe
Catastrophic epiphany
Epic stories of my history
Disproportionate display to intoxicate my luminaries
But with all that..
Dysfunction got the best of me
Disseminate the wellsprings
With no apologies
I'm giving up
I'm giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
You might also likeI've been blessed but I've been tossed around this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
Restlessness it got the best of me
When the curtain dropped down
When the lights went on
When the music stopped
Ain't got no song
When the words ran out
And my voice is shot-
Hey there superstar
Not feeling so hot
Tryna be a superman
With superfans
Doing a handstand
While writing your name in the sand
Heard you got a master plan
Made of plaster from the masters hands
After Matthew and his cast of characters
Passed through your land
After the blast just passed
Disasters aftermath
And your craft is on
I'm giving up
I'm giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
I've been blessed but I've been tossed up round this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
Restlessness ain't got the best of me
I'm giving up
Im giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
I've been blessed but I've been tossed around this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
