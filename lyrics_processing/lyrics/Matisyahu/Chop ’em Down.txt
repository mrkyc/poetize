From the forest itself comes the handle for the axe
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down;
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky
Lifetimes even gone in the blink of an eye
March through the desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax
Drop the staff Moshe Rabbeinu split the ocean in half
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased
Still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face
Now a day's the Yidden like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always
Lost in the desert trying to find your way
Lost in the desert trying to find your way
You might also like
From the forest itself comes the handle for the axe
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down;
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Yosef descended sold as a slave
Thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
Stock piled food for seven years of rain
Then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Yosef rose to power and the Yidden stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharaoh is getting worried let's make them pay
Bound in chains, first born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him, "Here's a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering"
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains

Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it
Get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem
Snakes camouflaged just fit the scene
Put your faith in a mirage it's just a smoke screen
