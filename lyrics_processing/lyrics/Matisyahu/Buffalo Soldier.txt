Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning down the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning down the block

Don't judge a book by the cover
Every single being in this world is your brother
When I lost my fun, the page and uncover
Ancient words that teach me to love ya
So we burn to return to the mother
And we yearn to unlearn all they told ya about yourself
Who you are, what you should be
I'm gonna be free leave it up to me
Shouts through the sky, look out through the night, feel alright
Stars burn bright, highlight the moonlight, you'll be alright

Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta

This is the medicine, I'm out like the bedouin
This knife I'm burying and this life I'm treasuring

I went running away to the cave
Went in a slave and came out all flames
I went running away for the hills
Back to my roots and I'm running still
But now I'm running to face my dreams
Found my place and what it means
Find yourself and no one else
You have to leave it up to me, leave it up to me

Bra, I shot the sheriff, the DA, and the deputy
Sorry Al Sharpton I don't need you to lecture me
Maybe I'll stop talking about guns
When you talk about the funds that they cut for the youth
Let's cut to the truth, ain't enough for the youth
So tell me how you judge me til you're stuck in the shoes, man!
Where the Congressmen, where all the Senators?
They're thinking about their green, not the color of the President?
This is just a relevance, survival is the sentiment
Narcotics is the only way you know that I'm a measure it!
They say that we are in a post Obama era
Well exactly what that mean? you needn't make it clearer
Does it mean that the rich are gonna finally start to share up
Reproportion the wealth and make things fairer
Asking God "why do poor people suffer" but now I'm such a hypocrite, the
Rolls Royce mufflers
In the gulus nobody never loved us
I am just the result of pain and hunger!
