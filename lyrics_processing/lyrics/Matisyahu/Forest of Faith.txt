Lie down in a forest
A forest of emunah
Vs. 1
Shattered vessels
Poisoned arrow
Sparkle in your eyes
Shining gold like pharaoh
Write it on a sign
Sing it out
Or keep it deep down inside
Holy holy holy
Am I built for my life?
Start with the wound
Start with the knife
Make the incision
Cuttin up my world and step out into the light
Deliver what you listen to
"
(Chorus)
What a man gotta do
"
"
"
To get through to you
Vs. 2
Air is free
Witches wolves with grins lurking staring at me
Under foot damp leaves
In the forest of faith
"
In the forest of emunah
Colonial ghosts make sounds like woosh
Horseman's head
Ride through the night line
British are coming the sight line
Revolution ignite mine
Sleepy days
The sun rays
Filled with golden glaze
From across the way
Sinking bridges
not burnt couldn't take the test of time
Building new ones
Sailboat bells chime
The moonlight
Days go on and get long
It was time to say strong and move on
Leaves changin and these days countin
Pressure building
Now ya going back to the sea of your life
(Chorus)
Vs. 3
You're the dark and the light
Wind and the kite
The reason I stay
Up all the time
Oxygen for my flame
Swimming upstream
"
"
Sing, Sing, Singing all the way
Wake up right now from your nightmare
Arise from the dust
Daffodil trees and these breeze don't lie
So sit back and just ride
No one to blame
Tried all the keys
And so I believe
Nothing left in this
Snow builds through the winter
Tactics division exactly distracting tracks of blacklist
Backflips twisting whistling thoughts
Tranquility
Lay down in the grass with my head in your lap but
these feelings collapse it was fantasy
Yeah you wanna believe
Yeah you wanna believe
It was you and me for eternity
One with thee you are one with me
Elementary together we must be
Flee the time and the century
Where can I be
Find a jet line through the sky
High above the clouds
Craving for the day
When my highs will start to say
Leave them all behind
I need healing
Living for these times
Breaking through my soul this time
Shift shape flames rise
