Keep on moving to the first rays of dawn
Keeping it on 'til the day stays strong
Runnin 'til the night time blazes on
All along I keep singing my song
I said, this phase is always
Sometimes I get so fased
But just know that ill always stay
Cause your my light through the haze

Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again

Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
You might also like
In the sunset I let myself down
Found the ground beneath my feet gone
No more words were there to speak
On that day my song was born
Never meant to leave you all alone
Said I'd be your shelter from the storm
Now your clothes have all been torn
Kingdom sacked attacked and dethroned

Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
It's the way of the world
Your on your own
Time to grow and be a man
Want to fly high like peter pan
No more never never land
So lose your backpack filled with sand
Come along now take my hand
We'll walk together- walk forever

Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
Walk with me now, talk with me now, baby
Walk with me momma, talk with me
Walk with me now, talk with me now, baby
