Ill be back to stack then I run
For the hills gotta find some time
Keep your pills gotta lose my mind
Find my heart down where the sun shines
???
Don't leave me cause I'll be left behind
Just want someone to walk the line
Next to me cause all alone
You're a king without his throne
Don't ya know its time to come home
Found his people you're alone
I'm done tryin this, I'm done tryin that
It comes down to this, it came down to that
I look up look down the world's not black
It's time to get out of this track
Strike the match, light the flame
It could never be the same
Light two candles
We fight through the night
Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright
I'm here for you, are you here for me
We can just be
You might also likeLook for me, I'm all over the place
Lookin up into your clouds searchin for a face
They say I may be just a crazy fool
But my DNA, runs thick like blood
An I'll be stuck in the mud, trudging through the quicksand
A man with a plan so stand and deliver
With my eyes on the prize and my hands reaching up to the sky
They wanna know why with my life on the line
Like my mothers and fathers one thousand times
And its bound to repeat or you're gon go back to the earth
This a noun for the sound
One day, I'll leave it all behind
I am yours, you are mine
There's no reason, there's no rhyme
There's no logic in these lines
Its above this space in time
It's above all of their minds
When the time comes I'll close mine
Open up your eyes
Light two candles
We fight through the night
Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright
I'm here for you, are you here for me
We can just be
Be, we can just be and breathe easily
(Hebrew?)
Strike the match, light the flame
Light two candles
We fight through the night
Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright
I'm here for you, are you here for me
We can just be
Be, we can just be and breathe easily
