Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you

From mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Today is the day, tonight is the night
Sons of twilight had done come along, take flight
High and twinkling, and swindling and a shooting in the sky
I'm shining, and I'm feeling alright
Lite a candle for the one you love
Peace and light from below to above
Eight nights, celebrate till I flying in the sky like a dove
Let me unwind as I light up a flame in the name of the Lion of Judah
Drop like a hammer when I fall like the rain sun shower
Feel the power when I hit like a train
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you

From mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
Happy Hanukkah! I wanna give a gift to you
Light up the night, my love shine through
From mount Zion, this is what we do, bring love to you
To get into the cosmos flows in top
When I write to excite, now I'm fighting back
Intertwined with the divine, it's a battle to the spine
It's a battle from the ancient line
Son of King David, Maccabee till the end of time
You're my light in this hardest time
Yes you bring piece to my mind
Won't you please let me unwind
As I light up a flame in he name of the Lion of Judah
Drop like a hammer when I fall like the rain sun shower
Feel the power when I hit like a train
