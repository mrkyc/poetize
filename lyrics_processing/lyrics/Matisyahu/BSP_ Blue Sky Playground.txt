Sup brotha?
We was just kids then big love big dreams
And a vision of the future
Vs. 1 (Dan)
Hidden gems, Yankee hat flat brims
Shroom stems, Red Rocks, Stonehenge, adjust your lens
Can't trust it, bust it, good luck kid
Fist in your mouth like a muppet, no strings attached
Puppets play the role, but I stroll relaxed, in control
All facts, screw a fib, old ip ain't new to this
I diss a bitch ass with crass remarks, the get hitched
To show I'm married to these chips, doggy it's hilarious
Foggy out in Frisco, I'm a bay boy with dub roots
I speak truth and get gruesome on loops, tie up your boots
And pull your sleeves up, we putting in work, murk your favorite then smirk
Gip you pricks like Smurfs, I go berserk jerk
The quirky kiddo, lanky height, crop Brillo
I'm nice, stop your sleeping, get your dome up off the pillow
Think twice before you test the professor in charge, laying in the cut with my dog, Matisyahu, what up!
(Chorus)
Re-up and re-vision
We up yeah we livin
Sizzling fire gone blaze for the children
Places we live in
Circles we give in
Willing, making these songs yall feelin
Healing, that's the way come with wisdom
Vs. 2
Ip, keep rocking it
like the way we talking shit
Laid back walk
New York we keep working it
NYG from the NYC
6'3" long and lean
Sea breeze from Cali
Back east from Berkley
Walk halls all day
In the mid nineties
Like the first time we blazed
The beat I got coming bro
Got you all day
You know I'm straight up from the WP
Feeling saturated
Relate as I gaze
Re-instate
Old ways
Make plays
High ways
No more sideline days make waves
Stay blazed
The trance is so rave
Behave? I can't stay
(Chorus)
Now we running away
Running away to the sounds
Take a vacay from this town
Quick trip down memory lane for a while
Feelin the day and the way
Clouds are placed
I wish this day would last forever
In the playground skies is blue
Thinking of the very first time
Very first time I met you
Cipher set
And the blunt was lit
I'm hearing melody
And drums that kick
While ya spit
I got this
We was just kids then
Big love big dreams had a vision of the future you and me
As the music guided me
Close my eyes and feel your staring at me
Close my eyes and feel your staring at me
Follow the beat and the words that you say
Colors and all the landscapes
Swirl and change
Make take
With me
Cruising through town
I'll carry your weight
And always like fallen angels misplaced
Close my eyes and feel your staring at me
Staring at me
Into the light
Follow the, follow the, follow the wind
The eternal way that you sing
Going away
