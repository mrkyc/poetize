Remember how it used to be
In the light of day it's easy to see
Now it's night time, you had to leave
Separated from the King
Now the water's rushin'
So you keep tryna swim against the stream
And it seems like you're not moving
The many water's gushing, you gasp for air
Almost drowning, ears ringing
Once upon a time we were singing
One day the trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa
This place is just a shell, external
Egos swell, that one'll burn ya
We fell a long way down
That eternal frown'll get you
You look vexed, it's the dregs
The yetzer hara's lurking
Tryna make you forget, we got a job to do
You can't be moved
You're a prince and a priest
You can't be moved
You're a priest and a prince, no, no, no
You can't be moved, no, no, no, no, no
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
Reunited, reunited
Return the princess to the king
Reunited, reunited
She's been taken for so long
Reunite them, reunite
And then they'll be filled with joy
I reunite them, reunite
Like the days of her youth
Descended to the pit
What's this feelin'? Can't get rid of it
Soul, sick, can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping
Joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
Like an ancient memory
Remember how it used to be
Close your eyes and breath in
That's the scent of freedom
Ringin' across the sea
Land of milk and honey
One day will wake up from this sleep
And we'll stop dreaming
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Then we'll see clearly, no, no, no, no, no
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
You're a warrior
Fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above
And brought down to a world below
Will wake up from sleep
Will wake up from sleep
Remember how it used to be, freedom
You're a warrior
