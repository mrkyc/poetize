I can still see us walking down the boardwalk
Holding hands, making plans
But we were you and hadn't seen much
Though there was so much love between us
Had to go our separate ways to understand

We threw our love away
But it came back like a boomerang
Every wrong turn let you right back to me

I've seen the lights in the northern sky
But they can't compare to the light that's in your eyes
The New York chill in the winter time
Ain't nothing like the chill that you send up my spine
And every time you say my name
Put the sound of the gulf shore waves to shame
I went all around the world and I came
Back like a boomerang

You know they say if it's meant to be it will be
Just gotta let it go, you never know
Maybe we were right for all our fears or
We were wise beyond our years but baby I
I've just been looking for you ever since
You might also like
We threw our love away
But it came back like a boomerang
Every wrong turn let you right back to me

I've seen the lights in the northern sky
But they can't compare to the light that's in your eyes
The New York chill in the winter time
Ain't nothing like the chill that you send up my spine
And every time you say my name
Put the sound of the gulf shore waves to shame
I went all around the world and I came
Back like a boomerang

You said we were too young to know what's right
We just need a little more time
We're only kids, we're only kids
Gotta go out and live our lives
Follow our own star, find out who we are
And then we did, and then we did

I've seen the lights in the northern sky
But they can't compare to the light that's in your eyes
The New York chill in the winter time
Ain't nothing like the chill that you send up my spine
And every time you say my name
Put the sound of the gulf shore waves to shame
I went all around the world and I came
