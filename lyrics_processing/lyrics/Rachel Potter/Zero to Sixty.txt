Hey, yeah, oh

We're flying down the highway
With the sunshine on our face
Got those speakers riding high
Bass bumping on the interstate
Top down, singing at the top of our lungs
Hair's whipping in the wind
Got you riding in the shotgun
Stealing kisses in the breeze
Turn the radio down so I can hear you sing to me, yeah
Sha la la la, I'm your brown eyed girl

Zero to sixty, pedal all the way down
Rip off the rear-view, we ain't looking back now
We're in the fast lane to love, and baby it's an open road
Throw the map out the window, it can't help us this time
Don't know where we're going, baby, that's alright
Let's rev it up, we're riding high
Cross some more of them county lines
Pay no mind to any caution signs
Yeah, that's how I wanna, that's how I wanna drive
You might also like
Can't believe you popped the question
Can't believe that I said yes
Can't believe I barely know you
But I believe it's for the best
What's the point of waiting?
Cause' when you know, you know
Just Married on the window
Cans are hanging off the back
Drove past my mama in the front yard
Hate to break the news like that
New rings on our left hands as we wave goodbye

Zero to sixty, pedal all the way down
Rip off the rear-view, we ain't looking back now
We're in the fast lane to love, and baby it's an open road
Throw the map out the window, it can't help us this time
Don't know where we're going, baby, that's alright
Let's rev it up, we're riding high
Cross some more of them county lines
Pay no mind to any caution signs
Yeah, that's how I wanna drive

Drive me crazy, yeah, drive me wild
Falling faster with every mile
I'll be your Bonnie, baby, be my Clyde
Buckle up, hang on, let's go for a ride
We're going zero to sixty, pedal all the way down
Rip off the rear-view, we ain't looking back now
We're in the fast lane to love, and baby it's an open road
Throw the map out the window, it can't help us this time
Don't know where we're going, baby, that's alright
Yeah, let's rev it up, we're riding high
Cross some more of them county lines
Pay no mind to any caution signs
Yeah, that's how I wanna, that's how I wanna, that's how I wanna drive, yeah
