Preacher says we should love our neighbors
But I don't even know my neighbors' names
And every Sunday, it's the same
Trying to find the answers in the stained glass window
All the sins I carry on my shoulders
Well, it's a wonder that I made it through the door
Broke some golden rules the good book said I should stick to
Does that make me rotten to the core?

The whispers in the pews, well, they ain't praying for me and you
How can a place so sacred be filled with so much hatred?

But me and Jesus, we're as thick as thieves
If you don't believe us, maybe you just don't believe
They may say a girl like me is going straight to hell
Oh, but I think Jesus can love this Jezebel

I met my best friend Jack in Sunday school
Singing about the B-I-B-L-E
Learning about the love that purifies each one of us
And in his eyes, we are free
You might also likeBut Jack grew up and fell in love with Adam
Pretty soon the word sure got around
Those folks who agreed, that Adam should love Eve
Well they kicked Jack and Adam to the ground

Yeah, whispers in the pews, well, they ain't praying for me and you
If we're covered by his blood then who are they to judge?

Yeah, cause Jack and Jesus they're as thick as thieves
If you don't believe us, maybe you just don't believe
They may say straight or gay, we're going straight to hell
Oh, but I think Jesus can love this Jezebel

This little light is mine, so let me let it shine
This little light is mine, so let me let it shine
This little light is mine, so let me let it shine
This little light is mine, so let me let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine

Yeah, me and Jesus, we're as thick as thieves
If you don't believe us, maybe you just don't believe
They may say if I act this way, I'm going straight to hell
Oh, but I think Jesus can love this Jezebel
