Let's go see my dear old Mammy
She's fryin' eggs and boiling hammy
That's what I like about the South
Now there you can make no mistakey
Where those nerves are never shaky
Ought to taste her layer cakey
That's what I like about the South
She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Those sugar-cured Virginia hams
Basement full of those berry jams
An' that's what I like about the South
Hot corn bread, black eyed peas
You can eat as much as you please
'Cause it's never out of season
That's what I like about the South
Ah, don't take one, have two
There's dark brown and chocolate too
Suits me, they must suit you
'Cause that's what I like about the South
Well it's way, way down where the cane grows tall
Down where they say, "Y'all"
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
'Cause that's what I like about the South
You might also likeDown where they have those pretty queens
Keep a-dreamin' those dreamy dreams
Well let's sip that absinthe in New Orleans
That's what I like about the South
Here comes that man with all the news
Box back coat with button shoes
All paid up with his union dues
And that's what I like about the South
Now there's a place down south called Dowadiddy
It ain't no jive and it ain't no city
It's awful small, but it sure is pretty
That's Dowadiddy
Here come old Roy down the street
Ho, can't you hear those tappin' feet
He would rather sleep than eat
An' that's what I like about the South
Now every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
Why don't you shake that head and sigh
And I'll go truckin' right on by
Well, I didn't come here to criticize
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me those no-good lies
That a lyin' gal like you can devise

If you love me like I love you
Send me fifty P-D-Q
Roses are red and violets are pink
If I don't get all fifty, I don't show
She's got backbones and turnip greens
Ham hocks and butter beans
You, me and New Orleans
