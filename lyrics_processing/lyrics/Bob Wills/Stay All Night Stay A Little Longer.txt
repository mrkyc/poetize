You ought to see my blue eyed Sally
She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate is the number on the door
And the next house over is the grocery store

Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

You can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
The big creek's up and the little creek's level
I plow my corn with a double shovel

Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Sitting in the window, singing to my love
The slop bucket fell from the window up above
The mule and the grasshopper, eating ice cream
Mule got sick and they laid him on the beam
You might also like
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Grab your gal and a-pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
The gals on the big creek about half grown
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone

Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
