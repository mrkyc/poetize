Took my wheat down to get it ground
The 'mander of the mill said "The mill broke down"
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

That's my girl, she's the one did it
She began to like it then just couldn't quit it
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

I'll give it to her down, yeah

She's got skin that you love to touch
But I'll bet that she don't touch much (Oh boy)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?
Not just me

Old luck a-but 'bout ninety-six
Just got back from gettin' it fixed
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

Ah, that's it uncle Bud, play it now
Whittle it down, boy
Yeah

Two old maids in a folding bed
One turned over and the other one said
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

Makes no difference how you feel
You ought to play that chicken reel
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
