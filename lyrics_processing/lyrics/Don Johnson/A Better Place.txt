A river on the wall
Disappears into the China Blue
An everlasting kiss is burning on my lips
In my ritual of love for you
But, oh, it's so easy to fall
So easy to lose our way
And darkness will follow
Baby, I know there's something to guide us
I'm walking this high wire
Through the line of fire
Trying to wind my way to you
Feel the rhythm of my heart
Racing from the start
Pushing me higher and higher
And, oh, it's so easy to fall
So easy to lose our way - so easy
And darkness will follow
Baby, I know there's somethin' to guide us
If we reach beyond the moon
Deeper then the sea
And brighter than the sun
There's a better place to be
It's older than the stars
But newer than today
It will carry us away
We have found a better place

I surround the human race
With all the love I have for you
And, oh, these meadows of light
Unravel the shadows
Hiding inside us
Baby, I know
I know there's something to guide us
If we reach beyond the moon
Deeper then the sea
And brighter than the sun
There's a better place to be
It's older than the stars
But newer than today
It will carry us away
Carry us away
We have found a better place
If we reach beyond the moon
Deeper then the sea
And brighter than the sun
There's a better place to be
It's older than the stars
But newer than today
It will carry us away
We have found a better place
Baby can you feel it
Deeper than the sea
We have found a better place
We have found a better place
We have found it
Can you feel it
