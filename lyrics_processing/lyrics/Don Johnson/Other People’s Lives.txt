Where the grass don't grow
You see everything in colour till you see it close
Everybody else's street looks like it's painted gold
Don't it always go that way?
Suzy wanted money to spend
Wanted some rich older man
To take her from the world she was living
In to the world on the other side
Suzy was bored with her life
Wanted something more to do with her
Nights
She said: someday I'm just gonna pack it up
And leave this all behind!
She wanted a piece of paradise
She wanted a change of scene
She wanted to live the privileged life and nothing in-between
Other people's lives always look so easy
When you're standing on the other side
Other people's lives

Working for the pennies for pay
He said: Anybody's life in the world
Has gotta be better than the life I got
Johnny had big things in mind
Had big dreams just burning inside
He said: Someday I wanna climb my way out of this
Climb my way right to the top!
He wanted a piece of paradise
He wanted to break away
He wanted to live the easy life
You know what people say:
Other people's lives always look so easy
When you're standing on the other side
Other people's lives always look much better
When you're seeing them through different eyes
Other people's lives
Where the grass is always greener
Where the grass don't grow
You see everything in colour till you see it close
Everybody else's street looks like it's painted gold
Don't it always go that way?
Suzy
She's got the money to spend
Married some rich older man
He gives her everything in the world she needs
Everything but love
Johnny
He's got the job of his dreams
Now he wonders is this what it all means?
He says: Sometimes you can have it all and still it's not enough
He wanted a piece of paradise
She wanted a change of dreams
But sometimes you know that paradise ain't always what it seems
Other people's lives always look so easy
When you're standing on the other side
Other people's lives always look much better
When you're seeing them through different eyes
Other people's lives
Other people's lives always look much better
When you're seeing them through different eyes
Other people's lives
Other peoples's lives
Other people's lives always look much better
When you're seeing them through different eyes
