B-b-b-be still

What you see is not a test
The sky will light before you
You'll be lost and found again
This is only good for you
Don't try to understand, the colors in my hand
Just close your eyes and I will guide you

I'm an extra terrestrial
Came up out the fucking dirt like a vegetable
Find out what my cerebellum for
Went up in the booth and told Montana press record
Little Patrick didn't catch a little leprechaun
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, where my paracetomol?
I done took some pain and then I turned it in to pleasure
I picked rap instead of a batchelors now I'm the most eligible
Ha ha ha stupid motherfucker how you like that
How do I go back to this when I already tried that
Message from my inner child, said he wants his life back
I done turnt myself into a product with a price tag
All these fuckin people only round me cause I'm doing well
I been living life like I got no regard for human health
We done shed blood, sweat and tears and fought tooth and nail
Tryin' to accomplish something more than just a few have failed
And every other day, mummy call me just to ask me if I'm coping with the fame
But every other night I'm spilling vodka on some chicken heads
Doing shit I know would make her totally ashamed
I am overly engaged, some who know me think I changed
Due to certain sudden circumstances we are socially estranged
('stranged, 'stranged, 'stranged...)
Yeah
I'm in tip-top shape called me fitness instructor T
Superman genetics in my genes, dungarees
I can see these niggas through my gross and cutler piece
It's lonely at the top but you can't fuckin beat the luxury
Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy
Tinie is the name, Disturbing London is the company
This is the Disc-Overy, everything infront of me
I ain't even worried about anything that's under me
Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy
Tinie is the name, disturbing London is the company
This is the Disc-Overy, the point of no recovery
I don't give a fuck, I'm going in cover me!
