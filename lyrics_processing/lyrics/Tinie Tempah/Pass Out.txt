Ugh
What happened?
It's okay, I'm good
Let's go

Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So we let it rain
Let it pour away (Yeah)
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out (Pass out)

Yeah, ah, yeah, I'm in charge now
I'm a star and I bought my fuckin' cast out
I live a very, very, very, wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out (Oh my gosh)
I used to listen to "You don't wanna bring arms house"
I've got so many clothes, I keep some in my aunt's house
Disturbing London, baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles' child, yeah
Yeah, yeah, and there ain't nobody fresher
Semester to semester, raving with the freshers
Twenty light bulbs around my table and my dresser
CLC Kompressor, just in case that don't impress her
Say hello to Dexter, say hello to Uncle Fester
Got 'em gazin' at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-Shocks, I got a crazy dumb collection
Haters, I can't fuckin' hear your reception

Yeah
Shit was meant to last me twenty-four hours, right?
Okay, I'm good

Yeah, they say hello, they say hola and they say bonjour
I'm pissed I never got to fly on a Concorde
I've been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe
I'm fuckin' crazy with the kicks, call me Jean-Claude
I'm 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
'Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where's my fuckin' clap, where's my encore?
Uh, I walk alone, 'cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I'll never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I'll never ever walk her home
DL the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I'm fairly famous, I'm sorta known
And if your son doesn't, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio
Extraordinary, yo, hope you enjoy the show
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out

Woah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Woah)
Ah, look at me I've been a cheeky bastard, man
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And look at all the drama we started
(Woah)
Now I'm in here, layin' on my back
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sayin', "DJ won't you give me one more track?"

I'll apologise for tonight tomorrow mornin'
I'll apologise for tonight tomorrow mornin'
I'll apologise for tonight tomorrow mornin'
I'll apologise for tonight tomorrow mornin'
So we let it rain
Let it pour away
And we won't come down

Pass out
