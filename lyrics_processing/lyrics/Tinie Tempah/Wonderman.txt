The strong, the mighty
The forces of evil could never destroy
The power of the Wonderman
And though the most formidable journey lies ahead
Only one will prevail
Wonder, Wonder, Wonderman

Uh, yeah, these haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol
Uh, my uncle used to drink a can of Kestrel when life got stressful
Uh, what kinda person should you be when you wanna make people accept you?
Uh, what does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special?
Uh, yeah and I went from the kid in class
Texting radio DJs so they could big me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got 'em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when it's blowing up
Like, "Are you really big enough?"
I traded friends for fans, cement for sand
Raise your hand, the Wonderman

Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face?
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one, they're calling your name (Uh, yeah)
Are-are you-you, are-are you-you the Wonderman? (Let's go, uh)
You might also like
Bored of being nameless, bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and can't afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes, imagine satisfaction when you make it
It's more than being famous
More than the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in twenty foreign places
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises
Amen, hallelujah, Tinie look what's happened to ya
Yeah, they love that attitude, brand-new and improved
Yeah, and when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little braggin' too
Amen, hallelujah, Tinie look what's happened to ya
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran
Look, I traded friends for fans, cement from sand
Raise your hand, the Wonderman

Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face? (Yeah)
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one, they're calling your name (Oh)
Are-are you-you, are-are you-you the Wonderman? (Oh)

Come on, come on, the stars are where you belong (Wonderman)
Come on, follow, your heart is gonna take you home (Uh; Wonderman)
Come on, come on, the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here
Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face? (See the bright lights)
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one, they're calling your name (Uh, yeah)
Are-are you-you, are-are you-you the Wonderman?
