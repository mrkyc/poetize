Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

Uh, love suicide is killing me
You're getting into my head, you're like a guillotine
You've got my gasping for air in your vicinity
And now your saying some things that you don't really mean
That's really mean, how the hell I'm caught up in between?
Devil's advocate trying not to intervene
Putting up a front like it ain't a thing to me
I swear this gotta be the worst position to be in, be in
I guess you feel like you've been ignored
And your perfect picture turn into a jigsaw
'Cause when your round me you get a little withdrawn
And we just can't seem to find time to sit and talk
I know she isn't sure, uh

What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know
You might also like
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose (Uh)

Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh)

I feel like I'm about to break down
Why you acting like a kid up in a playground? (Huh?)
If you got something on your mind why don't you lay it out?
Feels like the end of us is coming any day now
Any day, I thought we'd never separate
I could be destroyed but not defeated: Ernest Hemingway
You know its probably for the best anyway
'Cause my suspicions now is worrying your jealous face
Let's go our separate ways, uh
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?

Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see
Yeah
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Within four walls and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

Tell me the reason why (Why)
You committed love suicide (Uh)
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose (No)
I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears)
Time to get outta here

You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
Made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide)
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
