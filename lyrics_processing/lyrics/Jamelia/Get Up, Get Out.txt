You tried so hard to get
Right back inside my head
And I say it was a real success
Coz now your lying here
In my bed
I checked your messages
Believe me everyone does this
Now I'm picking up my heart up off the floor
I ain't gonna do this no more
How could you do this to me?
You said you loved me
I'm so much better then this
So you gotta go
Get up, get out
Take your s**t get out of my house
A million apologizes later
You do it again
Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
You might also likeYou do it again
My God, what a fool I've been
How could I not have seen that you were a
Lying, cheating, love taker
Stupid, mother f**kin, heart breaker
The first time was bed enough
But I believed you when you said you were done
Now I'm picking up my heart off the floor
I ain't gonna do this no more
How could you do this to me?
You said you loved me
I'm so much better then this
So you gotta go
Get up, get out
Take your s**t get out of my house
A million apologizes later
You do it again
Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
And so the curtain closes on this fine romance
I can't believe I really gave you a chance
I will not let this become
The story of my life
I'll still have hopes and dreams
With put you by my side
Get up, get out
Take your s**t get out of my house
A million apologizes later
You do it again
Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
Get up, get out
Take your s**t get out of my house
A million apologizes later
You do it again
Get up, get out
Boy, I dare you to turn around
Uh, uh, uh-h, oh
