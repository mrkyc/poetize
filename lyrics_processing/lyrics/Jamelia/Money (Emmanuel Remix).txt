Mmm, whoa

Money don't say you love me
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby
And if you really cared, babe
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine

I ain't no primadonna
So I can't fall in love with material things, oh, no
Now you need to offer more than your chains and your diamond rings, yeah
I need to know that there's a place for me deep in your heart
And I don't give a damn, oh
No, I don't, about you and your credit card

Money don't say you love me
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby
And if you really cared, babe (If you really cared)
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine
Money don't say you love me (It can't make me stay)
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby
And if you really cared, babe (babe)
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine
You might also like
I must admit it, I was fine with it
With your talkin' and giftsin' to start, yeah
Now all that's wanted is to know that
Is to know that I got your heart, yeah
I have no idea about where this is gonna go
And I don't really care, for your amount of dough, oh no

Money don't say you love me (No, baby)
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby (Oh, I can leave you)
And if you really cared, babe (Really)
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine (Not your money on mine)
Money don't say you love me
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby
And if you really cared, babe (If you really cared)
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine

So you think I got a price tag on me?
Just to flash your cash and you're all I see
Well, let me tell you something
You couldn't be more wrong about me
All your fancy cars, they just don't turn me on
Got me wrong
Make all the money that you can, cause money don't make a good man
(It ain't about the money, no)
Money don't say you love me
And cash won't make me stay
I can leave, baby (I can leave)
And if you really cared, babe
You would spend your time (If you really cared, oh, cared)
And not your money on mine
Money don't say you love me (Money don't care)
And cash won't make me stay (Money can't stay)
I can leave, baby (Don't wanna pay)
And if you really cared, babe (If you really cared)
You would spend your time
And not your money on mine
Money don't say you love me (Money don't pay)
And cash won't make me stay (And money won't stay)
I can leave, baby (And money can't pay)
And if you really cared, babe (If you really cared)
You would spend your time (You'd spend your time)
