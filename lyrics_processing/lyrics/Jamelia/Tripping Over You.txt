Why am I alone?
What I have I done to deserve?
Being out here on my own
It's cold
Even in the sun
It's like every freak has got somebody
Or I am the only one
So where you at?
Show yourself
I need a sign
Don't take your time
If it's such a small world
Why can't I find you?
And if it's such a small world
Then I shall be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
And I ain't gonna stop, no
'Til I get what I'm wanting
Yeah, it's a small world
But damn, I'm gonna
Find you, find you, yeah
I've searched
Deep inside my soul
Realize when I'm alone
I'm fine but I still want someone to hold
So where you at
Show yourself
I need a sign
Don't take your time
If it's such a small world
Why can't I find you?
And if it's such a small world
Then I shall be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
And I ain't gonna stop, no
'Til I get what I'm wanting
Yeah, it's a small world
But damn, I'm gonna
Find you, find you, yeah
Come on
Where you at?
Come on
Show yourself
Come on
Where you at?
Come on
Show yourself
Come on
Where you at?
Come on
Show yourself
Come on
Where you at
Come on
Show yourself
Well, why can't I find you?
And if it's such a small world
Then I shall be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
If it's such a small world
Why can't I find you?
And if it's such a small world
Then I shall be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
And I ain't gonna stop, no
'Til I get what I'm wanting
Yeah, it's a small world
I shall be tripping over you
Tripping over you
I shall be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
I gotta be
Tripping over you, tripping over you
I shall be
