Never ever, in a million years
Was this what, I was thinking of
Crazy, some how it never crossed my mind
My first friend becoming my first love
Used to be the one who play with my toys an
Never would of thought of you as a boyfriend
If you'd asked who I was looking for
I would have said someone like the boy next door
Growing up if you had ever told me
You'd be the one I'd be wanting to hold me
I would have laughed and said you were crazy
Never be with the boy next door
So hold you, showed you, everthing in my life
When we go cruising in your ride
So why, was I taken by suprise
Found love growing in my own backyard
Playing hide an seek
In the summer heat
Didn't wanted to go inside
Wanna hang out until sunrise
Whenever I was down, never had a doubt
You wouldn't be in my life
Whenever anyone saw me, they saw you too
