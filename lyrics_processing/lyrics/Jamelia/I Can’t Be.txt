Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
So many times I told you that I wasn't happy
But only now I know this what it means to be sad
Together we can discover
There's so many things I never knew we had
I want to love you like you used to love me
And I want to hold you like you used to hold me
Get back to loving you, how I should be
Away from you I don't wanna be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
You might also likeI don't know how you feel about the situation
But let me tell you that it ain't feeling good to me
I don't know if I can let go
Don't think that I could get over losing you
You're like the air I breathe
You're everything I need
Get back to loving you, how I should be
Away from you I don't wanna be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you there's no me
Oh, without you, without you
Without you, without you
What can I do, what can I do?
It took some time to realise how much I need you in my life
Now that I know, don't wanna let go, no
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
I thought I wanted to be, now I know I don't
Be on my own without you, now I know I won't
I want to get back the love that we didn't see
'Cause without you I can't be
Can we get it back to where we were?
Don't you know that you're my man and I'm your girl?
It's just the little things that you say and do
'Cause without you I can't be
Can we get it back to where we were?
Don't you know that you're my man and I'm your girl?
It's just the little things that you say and do
