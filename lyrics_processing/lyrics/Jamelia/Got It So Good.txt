That you had to live
You've held on, kept strong
'Cos something had to give
The lesson's you've learned
The habits you've kept
Made you bolder, stronger
But you just don't see it yet
Gotta re-adjust your point of view
It's time to put some faith in you
Live how your life is surely gonna change, yeah
Hey now, don't you cry
There's no drama in your life (oh no)
You're gonna see you got it so good
Smile, start another chapter
Now, you ain't never going back there, no
From now on
You're gonna see you got it so good
Ever you face
If you're taken off track
You'll re-bound, come round
And find your own way back
It's turning a page
Appreciating the new
And taking each day in
Any which way that you choose
You might also likeGotta get yourself some piece of mind
It's something you done left behind
Live how your life is surely gonna change
Hey now, don't you cry
There's no drama in your life (oh no)
You're gonna see you got it so good
Smile, start another chapter
Now, you ain't never going back there, no
From now on
You're gonna see you got it so good
All the fires that were burning
All the lies that were hurting
It was worth every minute
Just to have the life you found
See past what brings you down
'Cos there's no way this can change
And no words that can say and can take this
Hey now, don't you cry
There's no drama in your life (oh no)
You're gonna see you got it so good
Smile, start another chapter
Now, you ain't never going back there, no
From now on
You're gonna see you got it so good
You got it so good
You got it so good
You got it so good
