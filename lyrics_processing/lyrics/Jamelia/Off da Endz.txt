Baby boy even made me forget my friends
When Mr. Off Da Endz puts his lips on me
My lady-like tendencies were history
I'm telling you this guy is Off Da Endz
His touch made me regain my confidence
I really don't care what rules I bend 'cos
Mr. Man is off da endz
Unforgettable eyes
Chocolate skin
Most beautiful lips
I'm wanting him
Cutest smile
Perfect teeth
Husky voice
So sweet
Warmest touch
Smell so nice
Hair real neat
Always dressed right
