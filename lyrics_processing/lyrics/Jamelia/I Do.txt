I've been around but never found
Someone that compares to you my friend
But how can I tell you
That everytime you cross my mind
I wish that I could be the one for you
Its time that you knew
(But if I showed you)
How I really feel inside
(wonder what you'd do)
Would you run away and hide?
(and if I told you)
What my heart is telling me
Would you tell me, you feel the same way that I
I do (I do)
If you were mine, I'd think you'd find
That nobody compares to me my friend
Then why can't you see yeah
I try to show you, but I don't wanna push you
Coz I don't wanna loose you
(But if I showed you)
How I really feel inside
(wonder what you'd do)
Would you run away and hide?
(and if I told you)
What my heart is telling me
Would you tell me, you feel the same way that I
I do (I do)
