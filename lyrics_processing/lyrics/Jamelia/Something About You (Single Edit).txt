You make me laugh one thousand ways
And I realize, you fill me up
Like hot water in my teacup
I'm enchanted by your smile
I must admit it took a while
For me to see that this was somethin'
More than he's my friend, its nothin'
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real
There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now
That you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right
You got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
Your style, your voice, your points of view
The good, the bad and ugly too
Boy, I'll take it, give it to me
I'll be careful, give it to me
Addiction don't come close to this
Official is what this sh** is
Still I can't say it
No, I can't say that I'm in love
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real
There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now
That you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right
You got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
I just wanna be your all and all
I just wanna be the one to make you fall
I wanna take you away, I want you to be for me
I want you here with me forever, be my holiday, yeah
Oh yeah, let me take you away
There's something about you
There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now
That you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right
You got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
You got me
