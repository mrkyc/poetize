Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things
And I can leave the same way
And if you really cared babe
You would spend your time
If you don't understand
You can't afford mine so
Ain't a pre-madonna
So I can't fall in love with material things
You need to offer more than chains and dimond rings
I need to know that theres a place for me deep in your heart
I don't give a damn, 'bout your credit card so
Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things
And I can leave the same way
And if you really cared babe
You would spend your time
If you don't understand
You can't afford mine no
You might also likeI must admit it I was fine with your talkin' an gifts to start
Now all thats wanted is to know I got your heart
I have no idea, 'bout where this is gonna go
I don't really care, for your ammount a' dough
Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things
And I can leave the same way
And if you really cared babe
You would spend your time
If you don't understand
You can't afford mine no
So you think I got a price tag on me?
Just a' flash your cash and your all I see (all I see)
Well let me tell you something you couldn't be more wrong about me
All your fancy cars they just don't turn me on, got me wrong
Make all the money that you can coz money don't make a man
They say that will be your one and only
Promise promise money never get you crazy
And now you flexin with some friends
And so me sing say
Money can't buy my love
A for me security love for me own insurity
Because money can't buy my love
And me sing again
Money can't buy my love
And em sing say
Money can't but my love
