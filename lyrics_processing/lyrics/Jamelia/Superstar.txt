Hey hey, yeah
Uh huh, superstar, ah ah

People always talk about
Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o
All the things they're on about
Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o
Write it on a piece of paper (Paper)
Got a feeling I'll see you later (Later)

There's something 'bout this
Let's keep it moving
And if it's good let's just get something cooking
'Cause I really wanna rock with you
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
You do, you do

I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I don't know who you are
But you must be some kind of superstar
'Cause you got all eyes on you
No matter where you are
You just make me wanna play
