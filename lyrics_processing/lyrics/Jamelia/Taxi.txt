Jets steaming from all sides
My heart is jumping, I can't control it (aah ooh)
Get me talking from my mind
Boo creeping up behind
Think I may want to split this crazy scene
I know a place, a cosy place, a killer bed
I know directions, will you let me take the lead and
I got the cash in my handbag, let me pay
Taxi, Taxi
We can party back at mine now baby
Taxi, taxi
Smoke kaboosh and drink some wine now baby
Taxi, taxi
Get your coat you've pulled tonight baby
Taxi, taxi
Follow me, follow me 'cos I, I, I know the way boy
It's too late to stat, I'm all restless
Don't you wanna see under my dress
I cooked the best breakfast - In bed
Ooh get me coming onto you now
Can't help it's what you do to me
Why can't we split this crazy scene

No point roaming around

Don't wanna stop for food
I can feed your appetite
I got everything you want
Everything you need
Cabbie on the accelerator, give it speed
Ooh yeah, like it like that
I like it like that
One way, my way, never going back
I know the back roads, it won't take long
Get your coat, we're going home
