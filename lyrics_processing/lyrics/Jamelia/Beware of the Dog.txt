Do you know how much you want him?
You're tryna be cool about it
You're tryna be big about it
You're constantly just denying
You're like a moth to a flame
Can hardly wane
But listen, 'cause I know what I'm saying
He's tryna catch you in it
And then he will back you in it
'Cause he's just another girl addict
And if you give it away (Give it away)
You've gotta be crazy, crazy

You better shake him off before he gets you
He's coming to get you, he's coming to get you
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget you
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog
