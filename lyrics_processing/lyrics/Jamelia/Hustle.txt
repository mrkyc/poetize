For all the gentlemen
Pick your game up, track your lady type
Sign your name up, hustle who you like
Last time we made a ten
So that's right where we begin
Follow me up, to the city lights
I'm gonna shake a little tonight
Oh, are you seein' how I love to dance
Are you working up a master plan
Here I am
And I'm waitin' on a fine romance, hmm
If you got your eyes on me
Keep it rollin' heavily, yeah
If you want me to stay...
You better spin that record one more time
(Ah, ah yeah, one time, oh)
Baby give me all them old school rhymes
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
Wanna feel vibrations up my spine
(Ah, ah yeah, my spine)
You better work that hustle how I like
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
You might also likeYeah, I got the feelin' back
I know just what to do with that
Shola (?) dropping, I throw you a glass
Check you know him with your head
And with the palm of your hands, baby
The floor's starting to react
Watch opposites attract
The spots heavin', expect beatin'
I'm gonna shake a little, woah
Oh, are you seein' how I love to dance
Are you working up a master plan
Here I am
And I'm waitin' on a fine romance, hmm
If you got your eyes on me
Keep it rollin' heavily, yeah
If you want me to stay....
You better spin that record one more time
(Ah, ah yeah, one time, oh)
Baby give me all them old school rhymes
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
Wanna feel vibrations up my spine
(Ah, ah yeah, my spine)
You better work that hustle how I like
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
It's Sway and Jamelia
You better get familiar
Gonna keep on hustlin'
Tryna make a million
When Sway steps in the place, there's no replacement
You can either move to the base, or move to the basement
DJ wanna wheel it out
Spin it back and speed it out
Turn it up in your car
But if you're on a bike then pop a wheeley
What's gwannin', darling
Maybe one day we can meet up
You can help me put my feet up
Then we can mess the sheets up
Listen, the lion's back and about to claim the lion's share
And anybody denying that will end up lying there
See I'm a pioneer
They didn't see me
I make the party jump
Even if it is the B.E.D
You better spin that record one more time
(Ah, ah yeah, one time, oh)
Baby give me all them old school rhymes
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
Wanna feel vibrations up my spine
(Ah, ah yeah, my spine)
You better work that hustle how I like
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
You better spin that record one more time
(Ah, ah yeah, one time, oh)
Baby give me all them old school rhymes
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
Wanna feel vibrations up my spine
(Ah, ah yeah, my spine)
You better work that hustle how I like
(Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
