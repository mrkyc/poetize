(Ooh, no-oh, yeah-yeah)

The fights, those nights
I tried to pretend it don't hurt
The way I prayed
Someday that you would love me
Really, completely
Just how I wanted it to be
But no, so wrong
Can't believe I stayed with you so long

You hit, you spit, you split, every bit of me, yeah
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah

For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you
You might also like
My head, near dead
Just the way you wanted it
My soul, stone cold
'Cause I was under you're control
So young, so dumb
Knew just how to make me succumb
But I understand
To make yourself feel like a man

You hit, you spit, you split, every bit of me, yeah (Every bit, yeah)
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah (Thank you)

For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears (Every time)
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you (Thank you)
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you (Oh, thank you, thank you, oh, thank you)
Thank you
You coulda had it all, babe
It coulda been so right (So right)
I woulda given you everything
Morning through night (Everything)
Yeah, you taught me some lessons (Lessons)
Those are my blessings (Blessings)
That won't happen again (Again)
Thank you

For every last bruise you gave me (Every last bruise)
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me (Oh-ooh)
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you (Oh)
Messed up my dreams, made me strong (Gotta thank you)
Thank you (Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you)
