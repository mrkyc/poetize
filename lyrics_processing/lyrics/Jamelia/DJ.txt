Come on, come on
Ha, uh-oh, we got that fire, oh, oh
Uh-oh, you're gonna rock to this, uh-huh
You're gonna drop to this, come on, come on

10 o'clock, weekend
Bout to head out to the Garden of Eden
Go my stilettos and my cap on
Before I hit the door I got to get my cellphone
'Bout to call my boys and see what's up
Are you rollin' with this chick or what?
Meet me at the spot
I'll be the one round the back in the crop top

DJ, gimme a beat I can rock to
I want a joint you can drop to
The ceiling is caving in
The speakers is rumbling
DJ, gimme a beat I can rock to
I want a joint you can drop to
The ceiling is caving in
The speakers is rumbling

Turn it up, bump the bass
'Cause we bout to tear the roof off this place
Shake ya ass, check ya glass
Put your hands up, let the track blast
Yo, this beat is so ridiculous
I think this dancefloor's about to bust
Everybody on the wall
Better press 'cause it's bout to be last call

We ain't trying to leave the club
Now let me show you how to get crunk
Hit the floor, lock the door
It's time I go

DJ, gimme a beat I can rock to
I want a joint you can drop to
The ceiling is caving in
The speakers is rumbling
DJ, gimme a beat I can rock to
I want a joint you can drop to

The speakers is rumbling
If you came to dance, clap your hands
Ladies grab your man and
Feel the bass, go uhh-uhh
All in your face go uhh-uhh
