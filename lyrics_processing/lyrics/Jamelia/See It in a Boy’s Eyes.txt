Tho my heart don't feel the same
Nothing change, nothing change
Comrade I don't feel the same
With my foot to the floor
Hear my key turn in the door
Holding back what's in store
When a girl wants a little bit more
What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I want to go where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
What's a girl supposed to try
When all you do is criticize
Pretty soon you'll realize
I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
Well it rains, when it rains
Tho my heart don't feel the same
There's a sun in my sky
You don't see it, you don't even try
But you'll die, before you cry
Solitude is where you fly
You don't say this ain't right
But I see it in your eyes
What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I want to go where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
You might also likeWhat's a girl supposed to try
When all you do is criticize
Pretty soon you'll realize
I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I want to know where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
What's a girl supposed to say
Just turn around and walk away
Pretty soon you'll realise I can see it
I can see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
See it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
