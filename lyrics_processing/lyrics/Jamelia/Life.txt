Baby, I found a letter today
Oh, it's so beautiful
Declaring your undying love so poetically
But it wasn't written to me
So I guess I wasn't s'pose to see
Although last night you were loving me
Wanting to spend your life with me
Why couldn't you just talk to me?
And say J you're not the one
Instead of f*ing with my head
And now I want you dead
No matter what the consequences
I'ma bout to do life for you
Got to Slip all that love for you
And I swear if I don't have you then nobody will
Nobody will
I'ma bout to do life for you
In my head something broke for you
And I swear if I can't have you then nobody can
Nobody can
Baby, what does she do that I don't?
Only one thing I can think of she's a ho a goer I want
Tell me why do I should spare you with this ring upon my finger
Is it nothing but you're just another confused...
How could you lead me on and make me tell my daddy you're the one?
She can't love you like I do
But you don't love me like I love you so
You might also likeI'ma bout to do life for you
Got to Slip all that love for you
And I swear if I don't have you then nobody will
Nobody will
I'ma bout to do life for you
In my head something broke for you
And I swear if I can't have you then nobody can
Nobody can
This cannot be the ending
On you I'm depending
This eternal loves in my heart
We just can't be apart
I'm gonna hold on forever
And let you leave me never
You ripped out my heart and I feel like I'm dying
I'm taking you with me and there's no denying
Said I'ma bout to do life for you
Got to Slip all that love for you
And I swear if I don't have you then nobody will
