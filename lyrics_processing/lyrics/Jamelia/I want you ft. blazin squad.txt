You need to make up your mind, if you love me or if you hate me
Can't take this pain much longer, you make me feel just like i
Can't live without you even though i can't live with you boy
Your just like chocolate and im addicted to you baby
*chorus*
I want you even though it ain't right
Always argue and fight nothin ever goes right but i want you
I want you even though it ain't right
Try to tell you goodbye, get you out of my life
But i want you
FLAVA
Is this just a thug affair im on it for real
Its the ill hits that breaks hearts and tears emotions to bits
I just want things the way they were back in the day
I heard you wouldn't say a word cuz you were to shy
Too speak and say how you feel
If you were quick with me i will take you deeper than you ever been
Its my life that were livin its my time were fillin
Broken images of our lives at the minute its just us
*chorus*
I dont know if you love me coz you never show me affection
You treat me like your play thing always take my love for granted
Wish i could leave you, you dont know how many times ive tried
Your no good for me but i can't get away from your love
SPIKE-E
Ill let you know somethin' for real
How do i feel when i see you across the street
It looks like we could win
Just cuz its broken its still unique slow down take a seat
And just listen cuz of all the tings that weve been missin'
The tings in your eyes the kissin' reminiscin' no longer dissin'
Cuz we could be together whatever the weather
The chance of me by your side and thats for life
*chorus*
KENZIE
I love you from day but manz gettin' in the way
Had to keep them at bay
Shes not right for you thats what they used to say
I used to take it all in think about when i lay in bed
At my home people would moan groan just leave me alone
Let me do my own thing let me step into the zone
Were it got to the point i had to switch of my phone
People ringin' me up askin me what is goin on but i won't
STRIDER
I want you girl you know it even ain't right
We used to argue and fight at the end of the sun
There was like your always shoutin screamin'
Windows smashin photos rippin' tell me why your trippin
Cuz its my mind that your flippin' listen
Im confused like you dont know what i should do
I wanna stay ain't gonna stop and start i just can't stop lovin you
Dont see you but feel you try to say goodbye but i can't
I need you understand i want you
*chorus*
Yeh yeh i want you yes i do
I want you can't tell you goodbye
Can't tell you goodbye i want you
