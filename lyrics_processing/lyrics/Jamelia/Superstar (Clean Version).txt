Hey hey, yeah (uh huh)
Uh huh, superstar (yeah), uh huh (come on)
No matter where you are (uh), ooh no (uh huh)
Oh oh (yeah)

People always talk about (Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o)
All the things they're all about (That's right) (Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o)
Write it on a piece of paper (Paper)
I got the point I'll see you later (Later)

There's something 'bout this
Let's keep it moving
And if it's good then the music is cooking
'Cause I really wanna rock with you
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
You do, you do

I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I don't know who you are
But you must be some kind of superstar
'Cause you got all eyes on you
No matter where you are
You just make me wanna dance
You might also like
Baby, take a look around (Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o)
Everybody's hanging 'round (Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o)
Deal with all the problems later (Later)
Bad boys on their best behavior

There's something 'bout you
Let's keep it moving
And if it's good then the music is cooking
'Cause I really wanna rock with you (With you)
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
You do, you do

I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
