Think it over 1 last time
Like you don't know yourself
All depend on you
There are consequences in what you do
But if you lose
I won't forgive myself
Showing that my self-control
Won't bring back you life
When your old
Do something for yourself
Coz oh-oh If you don't
You will never know
Go-o, Why would you stay when it does nothing for ya
Go-o, Watching your pain only makes me surer
Go-o, Holding you down theres no way I can keep you
I say go ahead and save your life
Do something for the first time
It's the least you could do, yeah
Who cares if they don't take the risk
Your biggest ones not doing this (doing this)
I can not live for you
Infinite responsibilities
How bout living duty free
Emancipate yourself
Coz oh-oh If you don't
You will never know, oh no
You might also likeGo-o, Why would you stay when it does nothing for ya
Go-o, Watching your pain only makes me surer
Go-o, Holding you down there's no way I can keep you
Heavens sake I can take disappointment
But I can't understand
Why you won't leave
You've been quite
Awful quite
No enjoyment
There comes a point
When you gotta take what you need
Don't forget I respect
What you gave up
But you lost such alot along the line
Get it back, get it back, rise up
Get it back, get it back, or you gotta go
Go-o, Why would you stay when it does nothing for ya
Go-o, Watching your pain only makes me surer
Go-o, Holding you down theres no way I can keep you
Go-o, why would you stay, why would you stay
Go-o, watching your pain only makes me surer
Go-o, holding you down theres no way
