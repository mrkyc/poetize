I was dressed to impress, you know how I gets down
Every guy that I passed looked at my ass like "woah!"
And this one in particular couldn't hold it down
He said...
Hi
Do you wanna go for a ride?
I got it all 
I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you
I said you're promising the world
Thinking better make me your girl
But if promises are comfort to a bull
And you don't know my name
Is it some guys are idiots?
And their dumb lines are getting me
Ladies if you with me, let em know
They gotta up their game
You better brush up your ediquette
A girl like me, you'll never get
Think you're gonna win it, but you won't
Don't even know my name
Now me and my girls are ringing at the hottest bar
And their ain't no doubt, it going on is what we got
Now this boy slides over here like he's a roller skates
Puts his lips to my ear, one hand around my waist
He says:
You might also likeGirl, I wanna make you my world
And all I have, I give it to you, I give it to you
And I say baby boy you failed
Tonight you made no sale
Cos my promises are comfort to a bull
And you don't know my name
Is it some guys are idiots?
And their dumb lines are getting me
Ladies if you with me, let em know
They gotta up their game
You better brush up your ediquette
A girl like me, you'll never get
Think you're gonna win it, but you won't
Don't even know my name
Don't wanna be too hard on you fellas, fellas, fellas
I just wanna teach you a lesson
Don't need to know what you're sittin' on baby
All you gotta do is get to know my name...
Is it some guys are idiots?
And their dumb lines are getting me
Ladies if you with me, let em know
They gotta up their game
You better brush up your ediquette
A girl like me, you'll never get
Think you're gonna win it, but you won't
Don't even know my name...
