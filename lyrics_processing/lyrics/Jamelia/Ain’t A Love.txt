When we got privacy
That's, how I know
This is serious
You play me down to friends
When on me you do depend
Don't say you don't
So boy if you wanna hide it, can't decide it
And ya not it's how you feel
Won't do you good at all
And if ya wanna disguise it from the guys and fantasise about what's real
So tell me what's real
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
Why is my a** in motion, all that you thinkin' of
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
Why you so overheaded off our love
Like you can't get enough
If this ain't a love
Why you always callin' me?
Knockin' so frequently
Can't leave me alone
This is serious
Asking where i'm gonna be
Acting so jealously
Man the table's turn
You might also likeI see that you wanna have it, all romantic
Feel the static, and it's strong
When they ain't lookin' on
Are you man enough to show it? let'em know it that we got it going on, am I runnin' wrong?
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
Why is my a** in motion, all that you thinkin' of
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
Why you so overheaded off our love
Like you can't get enough
If this ain't a love
Yeah, ooh, ah
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
So boy if you wanna hide it, can't decide it
And ya not it's how you feel
Won't do you good at all
And if ya wanna disguise it from the guys and fantasise about what's real
So tell me what's real cause
If this ain't a love
If this ain't a love
