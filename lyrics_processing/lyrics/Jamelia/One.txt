On top of dis ish
Showing you how its is
When you get your wish
Never knew that I could kick it
Demolishing the wicked
Didn't have to be paper for
Me to rip it
Displaying qualities that u never existed
Coming in from every corner
That'll get you twisted
Got u wide open
When I'm singing my song
5,4,3,2, nah there's only one
Only one girl can make a player not a play
And only one girl can make a bad boy stay
With only one girl the light you will see
But I bet you never knew that girl was me
I stepped into the room and I
Saw that look you can't deny it baby now
You've been took now honey it ain't all about
What I got cos I guarantee that sugar
