Forgive me, please
I need to moment to compose myself
Before I breathe and face up to this tragedy
It's terrible, to lose a loved one to something that you can't control
Did you ever think of me?

Though the end was inevitable
It's impossible to comprehend at all
With no voice on the phone, and nights alone
It's over, I know

It's time to put my black dress on
'Cause our love is dead and gone
You know I got to do what's best
I wanna put this thing to rest
My black dress on
And walk this night alone
Goodnight, all my broken dreams
Goodbye, heartache, rest in peace

I knew the day was drawing closer
As I watched you slowly slip away
Still, I was so unprepared
A miracle was so unlikely
But that was what I was praying for
'Cause losing you I couldn't bear
You might also like
Though the end was inevitable
It's impossible to comprehend at all
At the end of the line, I know I'll be fine
But now is the time

It's time to put my black dress on
'Cause our love is dead and gone
You know I got to do what's best
I wanna put this thing to rest
My black dress on
And walk this night alone
Goodnight, all my broken dreams
Goodbye, heartache, rest in peace

Black dress, lipstick
I'm done with this
Four inch heels, perfect nails
I won't cry no more
You ain't gon' mess my make up
No more tears and no more fears
All your lies, they sting my eyes
I realised you're not for me
It's time to put my black dress on
'Cause our love is dead and gone
You know I got to do what's best
I wanna put this thing to rest
My black dress on
And walk this night alone
Goodnight, all my broken dreams
Goodbye, heartache, rest in peace
It's time to put my black dress on
'Cause our love is dead and gone
You know I got to do what's best
I wanna put this thing to rest
My black dress on
And walk this night alone
Goodnight, all my broken dreams
