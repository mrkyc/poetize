Many mistakes made, mad sins committed
Any hot chick that was wit it I was out to hit it
I keep a Yankee fitted, my world stay spinnin
I seen them faggot niggas grinnin from the whole beginnin
Me and my team, man we live life and gettin green
Hot chicks up on the scene, kid we sittin mean
Jewelry's shinin, ghetto cash, mastermindin
Livin life inside the rough but shine like a diamond
I'm tryna make it happen livin life day to day
They say play to win, well that's the only way we play
Families seem like the real enemy
A true, true friends of me is trees and Hennessy
I love the ghetto life, FDR city lights
Burnin L's inside the truck, duckin blue and whites
I play two parts to this, negative and positive
But bottom line, understand man I gotta live

So work wit me understand how I come, ghetto jiggy
Niggas where you from? New York City
The spot where we keep the whips pretty
Cops and these chicks act shitty, ay yo
(Bitches and these cops act shitty)
Ay yo, I never asked for this, I just wanna rap
??? ??? ???,make some figgas, give my niggas that
See me shinin think ya shit is honky dory
Behind the scene it's a real different story
The mad junction, can't let it stress me
I'm at my best, son ya best won' test me?
Once again it's on, official burn out
Don't look, puzzled ???? faces how it turn out
Once in a while I take the train just to clear the brain
People ask me 'what's the deal kid, it's just the same'
You know the night-runners, nothin major
Don't let me and my bullshit invade ya
I know you probably, got problems of ya own
No need for you to zone
Understand, I love this game, it mean a great deal to me
It's my life, can you image how it feel to be?
(Hook)
I remember when there was no pots to piss in
It don't even to start me to reminiscin
About the past when we wasn't gettin no cash
Had the skills, but like a hot chick wit no ass
It meant nada, I gotta get my gid on
I need some chedda in my pocket, hot shit on
The lifestyle'll be butter like the wife's smile
Make a habit, don't break, it may take a while
I'm a hustla, I'mma hustle til the end, too
Starin at that, evil that us men do
Basically it's LB fam all night
And ain't nothin wrong doin it all night
Ghetto Jiggy
