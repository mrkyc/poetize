Ah man, I don't even know how to start this out
Shoutouts to every Radio Station that play our thing from State to State
Coast to Coast, do your thing baby
This is to you
Now the world has been waitin for, (Lost Boyz) Love, Peace & Nappiness...
LB fam baby, Selassie I
Brooklyn's alive New York C style
NYC, break it down
(Mr. Cheeks)
This one here I don't know where to begin
Dedicated to the ladies and ghetto men
I know we all got some peeps locked in the pen
Well in the game of life, it's very hard to win
We've been through a lot of shit, a lot we've been through
A through versatile style, I'll begin to
Fingers on my peeps cause I feel that's only right
We supposed to beat life, so we don't fight
Jealous motherfuckers always wanna take yours
Should be getting fixed but the cops breakin laws
Shystie bitch niggas hits just to score
I'm not down for that, see I'm down to break doors (one time)
It's for real, express how you feel
Niggas know thrills, you need to chill (one time)
And let us cast niggas skills represent
Niggas scheme on my team, cause we be bent
Yo, you can try to bring prime mills to the real
Lost Boyz, losing's not in the program
Sutures in my coat, sat down and wrote
Think for my critics and gats to quote like
Shortie, I'm right in front of you like
Shortie, what you want to do like
Going places where cats never went
Sex, Lex, market share excellent
Call me still...

See we cover all grounds, bounce in whips
Far from thugs, far from bloods and crips
Listen, it's the LB to the death
If you ain't down to rep, take a step to the left
My teams makes G's comes correct
Skills we possess, with numbs of Meth
Many faces we've seen, places we've gone
Still New York my home
Me and my peeps love to bring our swing
Me and my peeps love to do our thing
Like I said before, the team versatile
Yeah I said, may curse for a while
But we in to this Love, Peace & Napp shit
True entertainers, true to this rad shit (repeats 8 times)
Cuz it's still...
