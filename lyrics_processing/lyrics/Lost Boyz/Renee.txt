This here is dedicated to all my ghetto men and all my lady friends
To everybody that lost somebody that was very special to them
Check this out, this about my queen
Her name was Renee
And we call this one a ghetto fairytale
Check it

Funny how love dies when we just begun
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day, I wonder why my shorty had to die
Funny how love dies when we just begun
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Renee (Check it)

Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peepin' shorty as she's walkin' to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
"Excuse me miss, but can I get your name?"
She said, "My name is Renee"
I said, "I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to the subway?"
She said "If you want," so yo, we started talkin'
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walkin'
I had to see where her head was at 'cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm tellin' shorty I'm a writer
And as she's lookin' for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo, don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, "I never **** with Philly blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts"
I said "Nah, they burn slower
Right now, I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you"

Yo

So now we sittin' on the train
Besides her fingernails, shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A crazy magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CD's
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said, "Cheeks, do what you want"
She said, "I'm gonna feed the dog"
I said, "Alright, well, I'ma roll this ****"
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
Ayo, top, I got a tender-roni girl
We're sittin' on the couch chattin'
We're smokin' **** off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan
She started feelin' on my chest
I started feelin' on her breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
Ayo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a **** before we ate and a **** after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see
But first, dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
'Cause on the real, this is where it's at

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, "Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you"
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
Ayo, we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinkin' of
I'm hangin' out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee because Renee uses Code Two
But yet, I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says "Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's"
I jump on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ayo, this **** is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinkin' about the po-nine
I'm doin' a buck, who gives a ****, I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
And by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me "Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone"
I pour beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so yo, this is how I shed my tears
Funny how love dies when we just begun
