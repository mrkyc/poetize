Live in stereo so once again here we go
To all my real cats who love to hear the real raps
I still understand the reason that you feel that
Yo, I'm a crook like Donald One of
Chips add up like coins listen everyone joins in the session
Know when I'm about to teach a lesson
In love when micronesses starts finessin
Listen, raps off the hook as
L's burn, take it like a man kid it's our turn
Shout out to all my peeps getting green like they suppose to
Yo from the fam understand, kid we toast you
Love the way of goin down baby
No doubt these bitches weak ass see the style
Until the day I'm up an gone I'm gonna get it on
An' let me warn all your foes you gettin shitted on
From day one we had hot mix
Yo I thought you cats could chill shit I got this
In a smash, time to take respect burn some extra cash
Even come through an' get some extra ass
Plug me in
I see you wanna be down but you don't hit the list
You could either give that or you can get with this
Man I promise just to hit you with officialness
An' all I ask is you don't get me nor my pistol clips
So recognise the guns blast for the love of that
Are yo good for me pull my blast I'm a see that ass
Until then I'm a rhyme kid and still shine
But when I spot him I'm a get him got him bottom line
That future rap, yo I'm crap cause I play the streets
An the way yo niggas live that's what I say the beast
Keep the cheddar in my pockets ain't no bubbly
An when it trouble me, Henny make it a double, G
LB fam represent New York City
Hang on the strips, an we keep whips pretty
All my keys throw your L's up, you know it's on
I'm a keep this shit strong until the flow is gone
Plug me in
You might also likeLet me get a mic a checker, one, two now
I came through this show these niggas how we do now
Cadillacs be seated an we gettin weeded
As long as I've been in this game I haven't been defeated
You can't fuck around my shit is at a puntin radies
Top or not still hot ain't nuthin changed
All these are G subs in uniform
You violate the fam, see how you'll get torn
Out the frame yo you know why a nigga came
An' by the time I'm at the door you know a nigga name
Mr. Cheeks MC, did you get it yet
Place ya bets I got some gats up in my Nauty sweats
Love the Benadet, elves we throw Sue Wynette
We hate enough to get in they well, fill your stretch
Get, an' meanwhile while you be talkin that same shit
We'll fanagle this game kid
