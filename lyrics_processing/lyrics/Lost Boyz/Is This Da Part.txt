Is This, is this, is this, is this
Is this, is this
Is this da part
(Is this, is this, is this)

Where you goin? I told you soon that I was blowing
But you can't wait, you wanna run around ho'in witcho friends
Hey that nigga Cheeks ain't got no ends
But I can see clearly now, the darkside ends
I remember when we first met, everything was chill
A nigga from the southside, a shorty from the Springfield High
Shorty lookin fly right, Tah? (Woo)
I says hello, but I gets no reply (no reply)
I'm leanin' on the gate I say hello, she ain't talkin'
Oh, you a stink bitch, well, stink bitch, you keep walkin
"Hey I ain't no bitch", Oh now, shorty you reply
But couldn't you reply when a nigga said hi
And tell me...

Is this da part (Is this)
You take my heart (Is this)
To wipe your feet on (Is this)
Is this da part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
Is this da part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
Is this da part you take my heart to wipe your feet on

She said well listen, I don't know you from a can of paint
Well. if you ain't no bitch, then why reply when you ain't
The conversation went on, cos my bobo's mad strong
I never thought twice that my wife would do wrong
I see her all the time, she's always home when I call her
I feel like a million bucks, we takin flicks at the mall
I had it goin on, nigga, but only for a minute
Cuz it only took a minute for another to run in it
Had the, birds and the bees
Lemonade and iced tea
Man I went all out with ease
She was my main squeeze
Tell me....
Is this, is this
Is this da part

Now shorty rock, she had a nigga on lock
Used to bring her friends through to meet my mens on the block, yeah
Everything seemed love love, yo
Shorty was the one I thought of so
I never used to listen to the rumors I would hear
Until my man pulled me near, put a bug in my ear
Listen here, shorty over there wit the smile, it be foul
Just a little while, seen her on the Isle
Wit another kid, who just came home from a bid
He grabbing on that ass, all hugged up in front the crib.....
See what I'm sayin, bitches don't appreciate nuthin, man
2 dollar bitches wit 3 dollar haircuts you know...

Is this da part (Is this)
You take my heart (Is this)
To wipe your feet on (Is this)

You take my heart (Is this)

Have you ever met a girlie that you really did want
Tah got the Phillie
Light up the blunt
Time to get puffed, huffed out my head
I be dancing wit the niggas
Rest in peace to Cash
And niggas who pass
I get blast
Up on the block, it's 1 o'clock
Runnin wit the Tah, pretty Lou it's the crew
This is how it go
This is how we do
