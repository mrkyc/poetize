Yo, yo, yo a nigga like me is in this here rap game
Niggas actin like Mr. Cheeks ain't the same
But first of all I make cash moves outta state
And I can't help but if my shit is tryin to go platinum
Lately, you see my team is X-rated
Ah, the deal, peoples know how I feel
I still love my family and friends
Just because I'm bouncin in and out of state, and we collectin ends
They think shit has change, like up the words
Psst, this is some ex shit that sounds absurd
I be spendin cash on everybody I know (I KNOW)
So don't act like I know
You might also like(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
This is how we do

Yo, yo, yo my brothers Freaky Tah you be getting high

Everyday we smoke, we drink the brew
Bouncin with my people that love to have fun
We've been getting down since Day 1
(Mr. Cheeks)
Be the star of your show, show be your star
I rip niggas when I come to the bar
Order me a JD, niggas lookin shady
At me and my team and my main ladies
Stop that, you need to just chill
See I'm that nigga with the real rap skill
I'ma drop a bomb and I, stay calm and I
Even if I handle fire alarm
Cause I stay in situations
Niggas be fuckin with only food dilations
That's all around town, we get down
First of all, you best to make a call and I'll, I'll
Be, comin, aiyyo I got this mans spot
You should've filled up drummin
My man Bink make me wanna bounce
Puff on the lye and drink a forty-ounce
One more time now...
(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
Everybody know how we do
Everyday we smoke and drink the brew
Bounce with the people that love to have fun
We've been getting down since Day 1
Everybody just know how we do
Everyday we smoke and we drink the brew
Bounce with my people that love to have fun
We've been getting down since Day 1
