Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus I love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go

Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long
Shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said that will work


I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be too demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding, like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street gash your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinking to me short
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talking to chick
Your complaining's making me sick
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday be careful my friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word, she began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing bye bye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
Too many threats kid, gotta let her go
Always in your corner
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out
I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real
