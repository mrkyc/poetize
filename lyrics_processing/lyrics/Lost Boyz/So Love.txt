For always bein' truthful
It may sound lame but I truly adore you
And listen I will always go out for you
There's nothin' in the world a cat won't do
To show that his love is true for you
We'll take walks through the park at night
Spread love in the dark that's right
Once I had mad women on my list
On the real none ever made me feel like this
I wasn't frontin' when I said that I want you
Even though it took some time to confront you
We at home in the zone elaboratin'
I'm lovin' you, you lovin' me we be marinatin'
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation
Chorus: (Sam Jones: I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(Sam Jones: I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't
Put you through hard times but you still stay by my side
I provide anything that you want and need
But you don't mess with my liquor nor weed
Word to moms we could travel this world
See youse my wife no longer my girl
See people mad at the thing we got
Cause we come through the spot lookin' hot, why not
Is it a crime at times when I nag you
I know shiesty cats that wanna bag you
It's all good in my hood I did it too
What the hell this cat think he can do for you
That I don't, haven't already done
I used to deal with wicked chicks I found a steady one
As long as we keep it tight, build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation
You might also like(chorus)
I know you've had your flashbacks of what we been through
But it's a whole different story when I mean you
Make it down to respect and protect you
And if any men disrespect you
Been through downs and ups, ups and downs
I wrote this here from the gut, how that sound
I lay it down while my man Chuck sings to you impressions
I bring to you glamourous life only for the wife
So others never give it baby livin' trife
Cherishin' all the moments that's excitin'
It's probably all of that cause I live fightin'
If you feelin' bored get your thing on
If I really didn't know you why'd I ring on
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation
