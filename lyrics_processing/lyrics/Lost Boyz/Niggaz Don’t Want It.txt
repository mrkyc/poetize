Album: Rhyme & Reason Sountrack
Song: Niggas Don't Want It

Back up off of dat speed
Yo, back up off of dat speed
Queens most wanted
Yo, back the fuck up
Chorus x3: Niggas Don't Want It Over Here, Niggas gettin blunted over here

Spiggy Nice, field jackets and I keep my jeans saggin
You use the ???, see it's ??? sense the dragon
It's Lost Boyz crew in 96, sometimes Queens mothafuckas
Bring the ruckus, clear the floor
I try to maintain, but niggas they be fuckin wit my brain
Kid I've in this game ever since 13
It's your worst nightmare cause I'm far from a dream
Some niggas wanna scream, I keep it quiet when I scheme
They called us on the humble, me and Freaky Tah got stuck
Now it's time for me and Freaky Tah to blow the fuck up
For real I'd rather puff a L in my act
Or creep thru the streets with my seats layed back
Or now I'm the versatile tile
They keep it to my now, my made style is runnin wild
I run with crews of individuals that break backs
Cause know a-days niggas fake jacks
Fuck all your crews and your individuals
Who refuse to use mics as tools, kid ya lose that
To violate the Lost Boyz that's a warnin', keep it real in 96 shit is on it

You done made the wrong wrong move
That'll get in ya
Ima bust it in with this ill type of beat
Cause you know Freaky Tah got this ill technique
Style, I'm buckwild
I gotta flip some shit, I flip, the flip
The flippin the script
But let me bounce now, back in the game
Freaky Tah leakin no shame to my name
Niggas know my style, niggas lookin now
Niggas don't wanna hurt me that's word to my pow
They don't know what, what the fucks goin' on
What the fuck get outta here
Let me go and do this by myself
Got my 4-4 from my fuckin shelf
I stay with my gun, I roll with my gun
I never lose my gun, but yo I'm on the run now
Chorus x3
Interlude: 
We do this everyday, yo brin g the drama
Uknowwhatimsayin
The year is 84, its time for me to enter with the ill shit
Freaky Tah got my back, watch him kill shit
Lost Boyz representing South Side, Jamaica, Queens one time for your mind
I wear my jeans cause kid i got the horror, and if i die tonight bury me in
My jeans tomorrow
Nigga, you wanna battle me but first face reality
Cause when I'm done with you I'm doin' jacks fatality
On you and your bullshit crew, kid I thought ya knew how us LB's do
We comin thru, a 1000 ghetto men
We creap, so don't sleep
I'm stayin out of sight, only at night is when i creap
I ??? to wonda put em on him, I tried to warn him in my session
I put this to his brain, I'm crazy insane at this confession
It's me the Mr. Cheeks I bring it to your brain-a, I'm crazy insane-a
Chorus x4

And I got warrants, fuck all the cops
They get the middle finga, I don't be a singa
Hold on, whatcha say, hold on
Muthafuck y'all
Muthafuck y'all
Muthafuck y'all
Muthafuck y'all
Fuck y'all punanas goin after mine
Freaky Tah leakin its a nothin on my line
To the tick tock, I'm not gonna stop
Bustin yo shot, words on the block
Niggas iz lookin at me, knowin me
Represent the L-O-S-T-B-O-Y-Z
Ah, ah ah ah ah let bust a head inside my muathfuckin steel
Ima pull a head and I'm a shoot em niggas dead
Niggas don't know I bust up the hemp stead
Chorus x3

Eh, yo the buddah cess is in your area
Lost Boyz crew iz scarier
Fuck the police, they ain't area
