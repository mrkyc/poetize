Yeah, she don't stop
She working it on the block
She moves it around the clock
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can get it
Don't quit, the way that she moves it
She's making me lose my grip
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can g-g-get it

She knows just what she likes
No matter what the price
She got me hurtin' bad
Perfect tan, working' out
Looks like a million cash, well
Let me fill your glass
And there was money in the bed

Yeah, she don't stop
She working it on the block
She moves it around the clock
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can get it
Don't quit, the way that she moves it
She's making me lose my grip
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can g-g-get it
You might also like
She puts in overtime
And on those slow grinds
She gets a hustle of louboutins, buckle up
But I got that attitude
She got the right moves
Lets put the work in baby, up
And down the avenue

Yeah, she don't stop
She working it on the block
She moves it around the clock
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can get it
Don't quit, the way that she moves it
She's making me lose my grip
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can g-g-get it

T-t-turn around and cut u in a blink of an eye
Yeah you know she always get what she wants (Hell yeah)
And it's so amazing how
She's putting me down
Is this love, is this love, is this love? (Huh)

Yeah, she don't stop
She working it on the block
She moves it around the clock
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can get it
Don't quit, the way that she moves it
She's making me lose my grip
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can g-g-get it
Yeah, she don't stop
She working it on the block
She moves it around the clock
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can get it
Don't quit, the way that she moves it
She's making me lose my grip
And she can get it, sh-sh-she can g-g-get it
