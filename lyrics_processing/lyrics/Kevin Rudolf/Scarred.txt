She came from a small town
Hpnotized by the big city life
She came looking for a piece of action
All she got was the big city life
She tried to convince herself
This was leading somewhere
Just like on the last day of school
They were gone by the time she got there

She's like, "Whoa, I finally found my place"
And I'm like "Whoa, this girl can't keep them boys away"
And she says, "No, see, I used to have dreams"
But I cashed in something long ago that I can't redeem

What you are, just another cut away
Now you're scarred, and these scars won't fade
I still know, you don't get something for nothing
Without giving up your soul

She got the get it look
With the drink in her hand
And she feels like no one
She tries to put the past behind her
But she still owes him
If I ever get out of this place, things will be different
She still hides at the bottom of the bottle
And cries when she looks in the mirror
You might also like
She's like, "Whoa, am I looking at myself?"
And I'm like "Whoa, I don't see nobody else"
And she says, "No, that's the price I paid"
And it'll cost me my life just to get out of the game

What you are, just another cut away
Now you're scarred, and these scars won't fade
I still know, you don't get something for nothing
Without giving up your soul


What you are, just another cut away
Now you're scarred, and these scars won't fade
I still know, you don't get something for nothing
Without giving up your soul
What you are, just another cut away
Now you're scarred, and these scars won't fade
I still know, you don't get something for nothing
