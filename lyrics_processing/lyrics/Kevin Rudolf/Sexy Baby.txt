I said 'hey, yo, sexy baby!'
Seeing you alone just causes too much pain
So baby, let's go back to my place
And tomorrow morning we can learn each other's names

I don't admit to be anything but what I am
The truth is like a loaded shotgun in my hand
I might be saying "nice to meet 'cha"
One minute the next guy's got' cha right where I need' cha
You've got a face that makes it so hard just to think
I am a pushover, but push me to the brink
Matter of fact, I'll take a rain check on all the formalities
I know a good thing when I see it

I said 'hey, yo, sexy baby!'
Seeing you alone just causes too much pain
So baby let's go back to my place
And tomorrow morning we can learn each other's names

They handed me a one-track mind
Said I'm staring at the exit sign
I don't wanna play the game this time
I can take the steering wheel
From here, my dear, so let's be clear
I've been looking for the one thing that I see
How 'bout you share some of the loneliness with me
Got the direction with my election
I'm in it to win it before we begin it with my direction
You might also like
Hey, yo, sexy baby
Seeing you alone just causes too much a pain
So baby let's go back to my place
And tommorow morning we can learn each other's names

Oh, this ain't about I get to know you, nice to meet you, it's a quarter to midnight
This is about just having fun before the sun comes
Wonder what could go right

Hey, yo, sexy baby
Seeing you alone just causes too much pain
So baby let's go back to my place
And tomorrow morning we can learn each other, s names
Saying 'hey, yo, sexy baby'
Seeing you alone just causes too much pain
So baby let's go back to my place
And tomorrow morning we can learn each other's names
Oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Seeing you alone just causes too much pain
