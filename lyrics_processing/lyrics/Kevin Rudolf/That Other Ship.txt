Rolling through, I'm a hurricane
If they could save my soul I would get down and pray
Believe that, loose cannon, I got something to say
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
That other ship, that-that, that-that, that other ship

Take a ride to the other side
That's where I come alive, alive

So take a shot at me, I got nothing to prove
I'm a kamikaze dropping, got nothing to lose
You can put up a wall, I'mma break on through
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that bang bang

Surfing the edge, baby I ain't afraid
Only God can judge me, bet I'm pleading insane
I came up from the streets I was born and raised
On that, on that, on that, on that other ship

Take a ride to the other side
That's where I come alive, alive
You might also like
So take a shot at me, I got nothing to prove
I'm a kamikaze dropping, got nothing to lose
You can put up a wall, I'mma break on through
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that bang bang

I'm right, you're wrong, I'm back, you're gone
I take control, you take too long
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other

So take a shot at me, I got nothing to prove
I'm a kamikaze dropping, got nothing to lose
You can put up a wall, I'mma break on through
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that other ship
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that bang bang

I'm on that other ship (other ship)
I'm on that other ship
