Time doesn't wait, wait for no man
So get on with it, there's no escape
Try if you can, and, oh, this world is crazy
And, oh, it blows my mind
Oh, it seems like everybody's rushing
Just to get to the back of the line
Well I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I dance with the Devil, but I got no regrets
He told me next time you're in town, drop me a line

Oh, just gimme a sign
Let the world fall apart
Just gimme a sign
Don't leave me in the dark

I couldn't shake that little voice
Ringing in my head
Wanted to run away from myself
So I asked for a wise man to make me wise
He said, "Son, the answer's contained inside"
I choked on the fortune
But I feel fine
You might also like
Oh, just gimme a sign
Let the world fall apart
Just gimme a sign
Don't leave me in the dark

You know they're gonna aim at you
You know they'll try to take from you
Just gimme a sign, cause I need it this time

Stand up (stand up)
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up, Stand up
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up (stand up)

I got in some trouble way back in the day
Spent a few years tryin' to find my way
I broke a few rules, I ain't payin' the fine
Oh, just gimme a sign
Let the world fall apart
Just gimme a sign
Don't leave me in the dark
Oh, just gimme a sign
Let the world fall apart
Just gimme a sign

You know they're gonna aim at you
You know they'll try to take from you
