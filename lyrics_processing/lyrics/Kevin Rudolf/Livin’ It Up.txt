(Oh, crazy)

She'd bring me flowers on a Sunday with a bottle of wine, oh
But I got my fingers in the cookie jar, I ain't got the time, no
And you say that actions speak louder
So why you talking so much?
Well you want me to be more specific
Is it that you love me so much?

And I can't speak, not that I ever wanted to
I just dream cause, well, living is hard
Don't pity me, just keep moving along
I will be living it up, living it up, living it up

Yeah (Yeah)
Whoa (Oh)
Yeah

I remember when we met she said
She knew she'd be mine (What?), whoa
But now, she looking crazy in the face
She'd want to skin me alive, Uh uh, whoa
And you say that, you can recommend it
You were the queen of the pearl
But you act like you are so offended
But it's in it, I just don't give a fuck
You might also like
And I can't speak, not that I ever wanted to
I just dream cause, well, living is hard
Don't pity me, just keep moving along
I will be living it up, living it up, living it up

Yeah (Yeah)
Whoa (Oh)
Yeah

Then I realized I was alone, so I got my fix
But the next time that she calls home
I am gonna call it quits

And I can't speak, not that I ever wanted to
I just dream cause, well, living is hard
Don't pity me, just keep moving along
I will be living it up, living it up, living it up
And I can't speak, not that I ever wanted to
I just dream cause, well, living is hard
Don't pity me, just keep moving along
I will be living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Living it up, living it up, living it up
