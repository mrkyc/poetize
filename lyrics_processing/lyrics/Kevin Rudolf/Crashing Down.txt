Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You'll never know the life that I've been through
Your tears fall, I see you miss me too
But just know, it's not the same
So don't say you feel my pain

'Cause you don't know the first thing about it
And you don't know what it took to get this far
I had to go on without you and I don't need anyone

Remember when you had to leave me
You tell me you're in love with me now
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be there
When the world comes crashing down

When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
(World comes crashing down)
You might also like
It's too late, there's nothing left to do
You moved on, forgot about you too
You should've known and turned around
That you'd be back one day

'Cause you don't know the first thing about it
And you don't know what it took to get this far
I had to go on without you and I don't need anyone

Remember when you had to leave me
You tell me you're in love with me now
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be there
When the world comes crashing down

When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down

Now there's no more you and me
It's not what it's supposed to be
You never should have let me go
Now, let me go
Remember when you had to leave me
You tell me you're in love with me now
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be there
When the world comes crashing down
Remember when you had to leave me
You tell me you're in love with me now
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be there
When the world comes crashing down

When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
When the world comes crashing down
(World comes crashing down)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
