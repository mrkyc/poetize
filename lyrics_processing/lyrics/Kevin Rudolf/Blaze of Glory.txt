Walk through the valley of the shadow
On the run ready for a battle
Looking through the eyes of the tiger
No fear, cool like a sniper
Iron fist, that's how I run this
From the streets climbed up to the summit
I've been the hunter, I've been the hunted
Don't look now you got another thing coming

How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
(You gotta bleed for it) How, how bad do you want it?
(Feel the need for it) How, how bad do you want it?
(Win the prize for it) How, how bad do you want it?
(Never see doubt for it) How, how bad do you want it?

I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
Flying high, gonna strike with no warning
I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
Light the sky, let the flames tell the story
You might also like
Roll up, roaring like thunder
Up the king street into the jungle
Pressurized and tried by the fire
New king, ghetto empire
One ruler, heir to the power
Clock strikes, it's the final hour
Under a full moon, red like a bloodstain
Chemicals running through your bloodstream

How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?

I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
Flying high, gonna strike with no warning
I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
Light the sky, let the flames tell the story

How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
How, how bad do you want it?
I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
Flying high, gonna strike with no warning
I'm going up in the BLAZE OF GLORY
