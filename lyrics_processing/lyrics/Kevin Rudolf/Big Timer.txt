I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer
To be a big timer

A little boy with bigger dreams
In a world with nothin' is ever what it seems
Had to find a way so I played guitar
But I never knew if I would make it far
Now I rocking shows and dropping beats
Goin' places that I was told were out of reach
Like a rocket ship to outer space
To anybody who doubted me
I'm on my way

I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer
I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer
You might also like
Now I know what I'm supposed to do
Turn around and give it all to you
Just take the ride, say goodbye
Now's the time to leave it all behind
But I'll never change, I'm betting everything
Yeah, that's how I'm living my life
Cause I just gotta get it, just gotta get it
If I make it through the night

I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer
I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer

Will I ever find my way? (Ever find my way)
Make it to a better place

I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer
I thought I told ya'll I was living like that
So high I could never go back
What if I didn't put it all on the line
To be a big timer, to be a big timer
Take a ride, say goodbye
