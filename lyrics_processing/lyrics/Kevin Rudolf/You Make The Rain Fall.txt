You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

Well, your eyes are so deceivin'
Deadly as a loaded gun (Oh, oh)
Your words are so misleadin'
You tell me I'm the only one
And it feels so good tonight
But it gets me every time
And I, I know I'll never change my ways
But every single night I pray

You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

Hey, this girl make the rain drop
Givin' me pain in the same spot
Go in my pockets, my wallet, I got it
She gettin' my dollars the same waup
Umbrella's lit up on the same block
The weather keep pourin'; this dame's hot
Lil' mama handle herself on the pole
I can throw some more fish off the same dock
Clouds over my head
Thunder and lightnin', she flashin' for bread
She make a storm, I'm already prepared
Who do I want, 'cause I cut the checks
Shorty, she more than Jacuzzi with jets
Can't use a mop for this when it's wet
They start to drizzle when I walk on the set
I got the bar, girl, I'm tellin' you, bitch
You might also like
You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall, you make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

And I want you bad, so I stand in line
You tell me the lies to keep me up all night
And I don't even know your name
But every night I pray, yeah
(Woo) You make the rain fall
You make the rain fall

You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall, you make the rain fall
You make the rain fall
You make the rain fall
