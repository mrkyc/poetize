Don't try to be someone you're not
It always comes down to people who blow up spots
E-Everyone's the same when the music stops
So tell me what do you got that I don't, I don't got?

I can tell by the look in your eye
That you're dying to find somebody to change your life
I don't know who you're trying to be
But it sounds a lot of better when you're lying to me

In the world when nothing's free
How do you live so comfortably?
You should really love yourself
Cause in the end you won't have no one else

Don't try to be someone you're not
It always comes down to people who blow up spots
E-Everyone's the same when the music stops
So tell me what do you got that I don't, I don't got?

What do you got that I don't got?
Tell me, what do you got that I don't got?
You might also like
Did you forget where you came from?
We both know your stories, so don't play dumb
I don't know who you think you are
But I promise that it's never gonna get you far

You know in life, there's no guarantees
But you fall through the crack so easily
You should really trust yourself
Cause in the end, you won't and nothing else

Don't try to be someone you're not
It always comes down to people who blow up spots
E-Everyone's the same when the music stops
So tell me what do you got that I don't, I don't got?

What do you got that I don't got?
Tell me, what do you got that I don't got?
What do you got that I don't got?
Tell me, what do you got that I don't, I don't got?

You can feel it, gonna make it
You'll do anything it takes
Now it's my turn to persuade you
Believe me when I say

Don't try to be someone you're not
It always comes down to people who blow up spots
E-Everyone's the same when the music stops
So tell me what do you got that I don't, I don't got?

What do you got that I don't got?
Tell me, what do you got that I don't got?
What do you got that I don't got?
