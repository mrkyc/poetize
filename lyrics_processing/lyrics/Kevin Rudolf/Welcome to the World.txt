Welcome to the world, welcome to the world

You got your popstar, I'll be your rockstar
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You'll get your fifteen, and then they take the spot

(Let's go, let's go) And then you're ready to go
(Let's go, let's go) Cause it's the end of the show
(Let's go, let's go) So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent, and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination

(Let's go, let's go) Cause it's the end of the show
(Let's go, let's go) So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

Life's a tour, I'm so sure
The ex will come before you exit, girl
No more games, I confess, far from lane
I'm just so fresh, who be me, It's the big boss
You get on the block, Mr. Rudolf, two stars
Hold your applause, hold it down to y'all's own guitars
Half my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up, every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the big cuts, only be the best sport
Get your mix up, took my time, she's loving each touch
When she closes her eyes, it's what she thinks of Boss

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
