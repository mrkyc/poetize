Yeah
Three 6 Mafia
Hypnotize mine

She's my-my late night automatic, automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic

We in the club, we on patron, we in the VIP doin' wrong
Like Michael Phelps, it was me on the bong
Call in my state, this is me on the phone
I want to get with her and sip a little liquor
I try to come down from all these spinners
Yeah, she's the one, she can make the booty wiggle
She from Pittsburg and her body is a winner
I love me a girl that can deal with this here
That can walk, that can ride, that can drive, that can steer
That can dance, that can drip, that can move through your hair
Break it down to the floor, take a shot, drink a beer
There's a weight on my car just to get them jars
On the roof, on the roof, on the beer, on the wall
Like that's mess, mane, Juicy J, I'm a dog
Like that's mess, mane, I'm a fiend, want it all

Ain't nothin fresh about the studio, darker than a fish
Who should I, who should I, who should I hit
Up on the tell her, tell her what time it is
And see who down and gon' roll by the crib
Ain't nothin better than a late night tip
Or a day time tip, or a anytime tip
Best part about it, she ain't even got a tip
She ain't gotta hand out, she ain't on that trip
But she down for it all, she ain't never scared
Ten feet from ya boy like concierge
Anytime I'm in me, she gonna be there
No if's, no and's, no but's, let's jam
Just like that, she down like that
Got my back like that, from the back like that
She stank like that, super fine like that
Breasts and hips and thighs like that
She's my-my late night automatic, automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic
She's my-my late night automatic, automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic

She stays home and there's nothin' at all
She waits until I hear the baby and then it's on
And she's not ashamed to be the for the child
She's my, my late night, call her my late night

She's my-my late night automatic, automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic
She's my-my late night automatic, automatic
One call automatic
