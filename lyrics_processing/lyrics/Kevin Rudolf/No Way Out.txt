Fuckers, it's settled

All the train came trippin' through the station
This mad hatter, he was beamin' at me
You cool cat, you think that you know me
I'm not the same person that I used to be
Cards dealt, you're playing them wrong, boy
And there's a few things that you need to know
I took the elevator up to the top
And I followed that rabbit all down the hole

I told myself I believed it
But who was I kidding?
Out of these eyes, I could see it
But it's all a lie
The end is near, I can feel it
Yeah, it's comin' around
But now, there's no doubt it's settled
And there's no, no way out, no way out, ayy

Switch got me caught up in a twister
I'm skippin' all down that yellow brick road
I said to the tin man, "Sorry, can't help ya"
They ripped my heart out a long time ago
And now I'm feeling like the cowardly lion
I wanna break out, but I'm paralyzed
The yellow bricks led me straight to the wizard
He said it's all your state of mind
You might also like
I told myself I believed it
But who was I kidding?
Out of these eyes, I could see it
But it's all a lie
The end is near, I can feel it
Yeah, it's comin' around
And now, there's no doubt it's settled
And there's no, no way out

And there's no, no way out
And there's no, no way out
And now there's no doubt it's settled
And there's no, no way out
No way out, yeah
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I told myself I believed it
But who was I kidding? (Uh)
Out of these eyes, I could see it
But it's all a lie (Oh)
The end is near, I can feel it
Yeah, it's comin' around
But now, there's no doubt it's settled
And there's no, no way out, no way out, yeah
And now there's no way, there's no way out, uh-huh, uh
And now there's no way, there's no way out, uh-huh, uh
