Yeah
Cash Money heroes
Private jets

CHORUS
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!
Verse 1
Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight, yeah
But now I'm on top
I told you to let it rock (rock)
The money's fallin' from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it

Verse 2
Rooftop, hella choppa burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin' and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain, make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna
CHORUS

Ooo I made it
I made it...
I made it...
I, I, I made it...
Verse 3
Yo ay ay ay listen
See I don't live for glamor, and I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me
Then they calling my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I done gone platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down-nnnnn
CHORUS
Verse 4
Came from the gutter, lookin' like my motha'
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash Money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy, we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world, if I change hands
Uh it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building, got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money
CHORUS

I look to the skyyy!!
I made it!
Ooo!
Made it, I made it
Yes, I did
I made it
