I've heard all the stories
I've seen all the signs
Witnessed all the glory
Tasted all that's fi-ine

But nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord
Oh, no
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord
Oh, no

I see all the people
Wasting all their ti-ime
Building up their riches, yes
For a life that's fi-ine

But nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord
Oh, no
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lo-ord
Oh, no
You might also like
Those words that were spoken and written by the Apostle Paul
Apply just as much to our lives today just as they did two thousand years ago when he wrote them
That in our lives no matter where we could go
Or who we could meet, or what we could see, or what we could earn, or be given to us, or accomplish
There is nothing in our lives that will ever even come close to the greatness of knowing Jesus Christ our Lord

I find myself just living for today
'Cause I don't know what
Tomorrow's gonna bring
So now matter if I rise or fall
I'll never be alone, oh no

My Lord, nothing compares
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord
Nothing compares
Oh, no
Nothing compares
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord
Nothing compares
Sing it to Him now, nothing compares
Nothing compares
Nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You, Lord, oh no
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to You, Lord
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to You, Lord
Nothing compares, nothing compares
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to You, Lo-ord
No, oh

Nothing compares to You, Lord
Nothing compares to You, Lord Jesus
Hallelujah, Lord
You are so beautiful
You are so wonderful to love us
So many need You, find Your faithfulness, Lord
We love You, Lord Jesus
May the Lord
May the Lord bless you
And may He keep you
And may He give you peace
God bless you all
You have a great night
