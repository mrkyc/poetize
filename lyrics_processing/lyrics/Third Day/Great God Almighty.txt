Moses came  in the red sea
He blew the children all around
Pharaoh coming over right behind him
Said "mow you over and watch you drown"
But before that Pharaoh got there
Moses looked up to the sky
Lifted up his hands to heaven
And this is what he cried

Great God Almighty
Won't You save Your children
Lord in heaven won't You lend a hand?
Ain't no way we gonna do this without You
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can

David bout to fight  Goliath
That giant still ten feet tall
Don't know how he could ever deny it
David must have felt oh so small
But before he threw those stones
David whispered him a prayer
Lifted up his eyes to heaven
And this is what he said
You might also like
Great God Almighty
Won't You save Your children
Lord in heaven won't You lend a hand?
Ain't no way we gonna do this without You
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can

So if you think that you can't make it
And you feel like no one cares
You just lift your eyes to heaven
And you whispered out this prayer
You said

Great God Almighty
Won't You save Your children
Lord in heaven won't You lend a hand?
Ain't no way we gonna do this without You
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can
Great God Almighty
Won't You save Your children
Lord in heaven won't You lend a hand?
Ain't no way we gonna do this without You
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit I know we can
By Your spirit
Great God Almighty
