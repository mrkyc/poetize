Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
The old has gone and the new has come
Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
Jesus people help me sing this song
Hallelujah, I'm a new creation

Well I didn't know I was drowning
Didn't know I was dead
Didn't know I needed forgiveness
Didn't know I owed a debt
Then a preacher told me
Of sin and grace
Then I know one day I'll see Jesus' face

Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
The old has gone and the new has come
Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
Jesus people help me sing this song
Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
The old has gone and the new has come
Hallelujah, I'm a new creation
Jesus people help me sing this song
