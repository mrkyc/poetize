Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die

Now you won't see no sad and teary eyes
When I get my wings and it's my time to fly
Call my friends and tell 'em there's a party, come on by
Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die

Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
A-just roll me up and smoke me when I die

When I'd go, I'll have been here long enough
So sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
Just keep the music playing, that'll be a good goodbye
Roll me up and smoke me when I die

Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die

Hey, take me out and build a roaring fire
Roll me in the flames for about an hour
Then take me out and twist me up, and point me towards the sky
And roll me up and smoke me when I die

Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
