In the beat, city alight
We'd steal ourselves away and hold on tight
You were there, yeah, we were all there
Too young, too smart, too much for this one town
We'd get so high, we got lost coming down
When we were kids in the street, kids in the street
When we were kids in the street, just kids in the street
Remember when we
We used to laugh, we used to cry
Live and die by the forty-five
Take me back, I'll go there
Who could stop us, and who would care?
Always keep, to the kids in the street
We were dreams, we were american graffiti scenes
But no war, no peace, no hope, no means, just us
And the songs, with the words we'd sing wrong
Yeah we'd drive until that jealous sun fell down
Just to wash ourselves in the moonlight summer sounds
When we were kids in the street, kids in the street
When we were kids in the street, just kids in the street
Remember when we
We used to laugh, we used to cry
Live and die by the forty-five
Take me back, I'll go there
Who could stop us, and who would care?
Always keep, to the kids in the street

(huh, huh, huh) and we'd dance, all, night, under the sky (under the sky)
(whoa, whoa, whoa) and we'd live (we'd live), we'd breathe (we'd breathe), we'd die (we'd die)
(whoa, whoa, whoa) when the world, stood, still, for you and I
Just (you and I)
Candles burn, cause the world will always turn
And I'll burn both ends until my fire's out
Lost in the darkness, I can still scream out (aaah)
We used to laugh, we used to cry
Say goodbye to i-35
Take me back, down a dirty road
Where it went, we didn't care to know
A glory night is a story saved
Mark the chapter, but turn the page
Always keep, to kids in the street
When we were kids in the street
Just kids in the street
(whoa)
