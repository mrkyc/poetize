You were so young
And I guess I'm old
Open your eyes
I'll keep mine closed
I prefer standing
And you take your seat
I'll be wide awake
You'll fall asleep

And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could, but I wouldn't go
I guess that sometimes (only sometimes) we both lose our minds
To find a better road

I can be pensive
You can be so sure
You'll be the poison
You'll be the cure
I'm alone on the journey
I'm alive none the less
And when you do your very worst
Mmm it feels the best

And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could, but I wouldn't go
I guess that sometimes (only sometimes) we both lose our minds
To find a better road
Mhmm
Mhmm
Mhmm
And you'll fall down a hole
That's the one place in this world that we both know
You take me with you if you could
If you could I'd lose everything

La la la la la
Can't you see the faces melting as the sun rains from their eyes (ye ye ye eyes)
Who are you to keep your head with the hearts that you hang behind
Look at yourself, look in the mirror, don't you see a lie?
That you tell yourself again a thousand times
And the truth that makes us laugh will make you cry
You want to die? No?

So you fall down a hole
That's the one place we both know
You take me with you if you could, but I wouldn't go
I guess that sometimes (only sometimes) we both lose our minds
