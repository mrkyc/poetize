I'll never forget
When we started out
The beat of the drum
A face in the crowd
It's better this way
It's better this way
How far we've come now
Not a soul can change

Remember the road
Running under our feet?
We'd shoot for the stars
But we'd aim at the trees
It's better this way
It's better this way
Gambling with life
It was our turn to play

It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind
We bought the ticket
So we'll take the ride

Every trial
And every test
We'd drive to the east
And we'd fly to the west
Just running away
Just running away
We can't be different
'Cause they're all the same

Every night
That we'd ever start
And every beat
Of every heart
Is running away
Just running away
Catching our breath
At the end we could say

It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind
Every taste we could get
Was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment
We let go of life
We bought the ticket
So we'll take the ride
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling was an art
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling was an art
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time

For some it's a god
For me it's a fact
We'd make a mistake
And try to take 'em all back
It's better this way
It's better this way
Out of the grind
And then into the grave
It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind
Every taste we could get
Was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment
We let go of life
We bought the ticket
So we'll take the ride
We bought the ticket
