Do you remember when we didn't care?
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls

Yeah, I remember when we stole the night
We'd lie awake, but dream until the sun would wash the sky
Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all

What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

Talk to me, I'm throwin' myself in front of you
But this could be the last mistake that I would ever wanna do
Yeah, all I ever do is give
It's time you see my point of view
