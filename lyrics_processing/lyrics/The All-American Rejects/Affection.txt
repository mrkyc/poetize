I always wonder where you are
I'm right beside you, you're so far away
Moments you're not facing me
Moments you're not chasing me
I don't believe in good good-byes
Cause even when the roses die
There's still some thorns left in your side
It's like a funeral for the bride
And i know candy girls, yeah they just rot your teeth, but
I've always been such a sucker for sweets
I need affection

All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to point your direction
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes me have to talk to you about affection
I need affection

Somewhere alone is when I died
On the banks of some canal
Yeah the river bed of tears i tried to hide
And even fools will believe in lies
And if every word you ever said were true
You'd be my god and i'd just pray to you for affection

All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to make a confession
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes a man come unglued
Oh, affection, I need affection

Why won't you dance with me?
(covered in gas you couldn't catch fire)
There's no more romance with me
(I know there's someone else burning in your eyes)
You don't think I see you
But I see right through you, baby

Whoa, affection
All I wanted was affection
All I needed was affection
What you do (what you do)
What you do (what you do)
Where would you go?
Affection
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
And don't think I see you
I see right through you
You don't think i see you
