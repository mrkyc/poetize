Hey, you
So you never really found your way?
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today?
(You never make it through the day)

I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame

Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me

No, don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
'Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around
(That's when I'm coming around)

When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But I'm the only one you need

Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way
If it's me that you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight, I know
You're never gonna find your way

Soon, when I get you, I won't let you go
Ooh, if I let you, you can take away
(All that I thought was wrong)
And if you hear me, there's not much to say
There's gotta be a better way


Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
I know you're going to find your way back to me
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when the lights go out tonight, I know
You're never gonna find your way
If it's me that you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight, I know
You're never gonna find a way
You can pace around the world 'til you're with me
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
