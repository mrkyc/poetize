I got to breathe
You can't take that from me
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
And you had to leave
And that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind

I know there are times
You're so impossible that I should sign a waiver
And you will find
Someone worth walkin' on when you ask me to go

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath, there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by, but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows

There was a day
You threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay
But since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through

And I know there are times
You're so impossible, and you ask me to go

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath, there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by, but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream, there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave, but just know

As I lay in solitude
Oh, what's a boy supposed to do?
I shake the very thought of you
And me together, I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late
All I'd do is wait and wait
You're never comin' home to me
That's the hardest thing to see
(That's the hardest thing to see)
I got to breathe
You can't take that from me
But I can finally say we're through

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath, there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by, but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream, there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you'll ever go
