Can somebody save me?
'Cause I'm thinking maybe
That you can take me piece by piece, yeah
Then you got your reasons
But I didn't need 'em
And either way I'm on my knees, yeah

You knew when I was wrong
You say that I'm deranged
I can see that you're uneasy
And its not gonna change
And no matter how far
Wherever you

Wherever you go, I'm calling
Even when you're breaking my heart
Wherever you go I'm crawling
Even when we're falling
Even when we're falling apart

You say that you're leaving
Say that you don't need him
And all I do is give and you just take
I guess that I knew it
I can't make it through it
But I'm gonna try this anyway

Yeah, looks like we're falling apart

We're in your garden where the roses sleep
I can make you anything you wanna be
When that body's close to me
I can give you anything you'd ever need
When I fall to the floor
'Cause I can't feel anymore
You can have my heart, girl
You don't have to steal anymore
When I look to the stars
Wherever you are
Yeah, wherever you are
Wherever you go, I'm calling
