If only for tonight
Yeah i could dig myself a grave
But even 6 feet down i know
I'll be found feeling this way
If only i could find
Yeah just a reason to believe
That there's nothing that's up your sleeve
Even though you're wearing that tank top
Love me or leave me but just not behind
We don't need money the way we spend time
Cause if it's real tonight, you and i could really do something

You go fast. I'll go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright, (it's gonna be alright)
If it's me and you tonight (if it's me and you tonight)
You go fast, i go slow
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's going to be alright (it's gonna be alright)
Are you ready now? I'm ready now

If only i were bright (if only i were bright)
Then i could let go of my brain
Put a tourniquet on and your sweet injection into my vein
And oooh, that's the stuff (that's the the stuff you give to me it's like a-)
And i say that you're the drug
Twelve steps wouldn't be enough to kick you're just that rough
Make me a crazy i just can't define
There's not a closet for you in my mind
Oh, but you puzzle me tonight
Let's play with your bits and pieces

Baby
Oooh i want to take my time. (i need you baby...)
If you stay with me once again, once again
It's a heart attack, heart attack
Cause i want you so bad. (oh i want you too)
Well i hope (this lasts) for ever (and ever)
You go fast.. I'll go slow
