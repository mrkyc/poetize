Hold on tight
And wrap your arms around me 'til your
Knuckles are burning white
And all your tears (All your tears)
They couldn't match the bitter taste
Of all these wasted years

And all tou take take
Everything that wasn't even yours
Wait wait
You don't got a hold of me anymore

In a clear view, there's a silhouette
And I watch you, and I can't forget
(Knew we were done when you locked that door)
Yeah, I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close, do you feel regret?
(Keeping me down when I hit that floor)
And I figured it out, girl
Breaking's what your heart is for

I've had to bite my tongue, but what's the
Point if the feelings gone?
I turn my head (I turn my head)
A blind eye only sees a memory
But all I see is red (All I see is red)

Now, don't don't say it didn't happen that way
I won't won't believe another word that you say

In a clear view, there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
(Knew we were done when you locked that door)

And not a soul sleeps
Another heart skips a beat
It's every note that you wrote
And I hope that you choke on the lines
You're wasting my time
Another heart beats tonight

And I watch you, no, I'll never forget
