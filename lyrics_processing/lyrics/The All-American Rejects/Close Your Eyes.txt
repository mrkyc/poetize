From the tongue, it slips some simple twist of fate
To shape and shake the room we were standing in
And I remember then the silence made me weightless
In the tonic of you once again
Where ignorance was bliss
Ignorance was this place we could exist and then surrender
Do you remember?

The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll make you regret it


Now I'm staring at the ceiling wide awake
Man, shit gets real when you're alone
(I wonder if you'll ever know)
There's these voices in my head
They're screaming words I should've said
But I don't know
I can't let go
And you are down
Your taste was in my mouth
The lipstick on the window
You were gone

The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll make you regret it


It comes and goes around
Burn your bridges down
Kiss the ground and turn the other cheek
Why don't you close your eyes one last time for me?
