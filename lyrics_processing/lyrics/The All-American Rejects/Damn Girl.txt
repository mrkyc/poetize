If you feel like running today
You know I'd understand
You don't, but you long
It's easier to give it away
When on the other hand
You know I

I'm not much better without you
I'm like your victim and all that you need is an alibi
It's one thing about you
I don't wanna make you cry

Damn, girl, dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl, you can't see
When he's inside, you know there's no room for me

Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm-mmm mmm-mmm

If you can take a chance
Find you that better man
Your life seethes from your quick disease
You're giving all my loving away
Tell me to understand
'Cause you know I

I'm not much better without you
I'll press your lips and I taste everyone that you've had tonight
It's one thing about you
I don't wanna taste tonight

Damn, girl, dry your eyes (Dry your eyes)
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No, girl, you can't see (You can't see)
When he's inside, you know there's no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need

(Nah nah nah) And there you go again
(Nah nah nah) Ooh, you think that you can just push me around
(Nah nah nah) Yeah, and there you go again
You lift me up and then you throw me back down
Damn, girl, dry your eyes (Dry your eyes)
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No, girl, you can't see (You can't see)
When he's inside, you know there's no room for me (Damn that girl)
Damn, girl (Damn, girl) Dry your eyes (Dry your eyes)
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside (Damn that girl)
No, girl (Damn, girl) You can't see (You can't see)
When he's inside, you know there's no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need
