I woke up on this side, I thought it was a dream
At first, we learned to walk, then learned to scream
You can't understand when you're fed from a TV screen
And you can't see the things that I can see

But I forget that you thank God and pray
Some things just never stay, and we all just slip away

This can't be the real world, now
I don't believe it when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world, now
The old are carried in only to poison youth
Am I the only one who thinks it's tragic?
'Cause I know this can't be the real world, now
Oh no oh, oh no-oh

I look for some hope in every face, there's a vacant stare
The shadows come, but no one seems to care
The darkness floods every light that could promise change
She passed sound asleep when the blood is stain, but blood is pain

Somewhere I know that I'm not all alone
With this bated breath I hold, my lungs want to explode

This can't be the real world, now
I don't believe it when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world, now
The old are carried in only to poison youth
Am I the only one who thinks it's tragic?
'Cause I know this can't be the real world, now
Oh no oh, oh no-oh
This can't be the real world, now
Oh no oh, oh no-oh

Just as soon as we see every flaw and every need, we'll understand
And for the first time (time)
A child to a man says only pure words that he can
And he's too late, this man, he knows it, he said
With all emotions set aside, "In a whisper, say goodbye"

This can't be the real world, now
I don't believe it when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world, now
The old are carried in now just to poison youth
Am I the only one who thinks it's tragic?
'Cause I know this can't be the real world, now
Oh no oh, oh no-oh
This can't be the real world, now
Oh no oh, oh no-oh
This can't be the real world
This can't be the real world
This can't be the real world now
