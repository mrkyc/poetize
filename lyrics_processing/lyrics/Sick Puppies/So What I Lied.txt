I see her and I'm filled with doubt
I don't know if this parking place
Is just another empty space
Words I've said aren't coming true
I don't know if it's me or you
This promise is too hard to keep
I have to speak
So what, I lied
But the truth would've been suicide
Monogamy is all she wants from me
But I see my life and it's way too short
Don't blame me
For not being subservient to others' needs
I'm at the point where honesty
Just doesn't fucking work for me
I did my best to try
And be a mirror of society
But we both know the mirror's cracked
And everybody's in the act
Faking what they cannot feel
Hoping they can make it real
Reality is killing me
Is killing me

But the truth would've been suicide
Monogamy is all she wants from me
But I see my life and it's way too short
Don't blame me
For not being subservient to others' needs
I'm at the point where honesty
Just doesn't fucking work for me
Monogamy is all she wants from me
But I see my life and it's way too short
Erect a life I'll never see
I'll stand back from the scenery
And laugh at all the other guys
Who never could escape in time
Stuck like flies on sticky tongues
Chewed up 'fore their life is done
I'm not here to compromise or apologize
So what, I lied
But the truth would've been suicide
Monogamy is all she wants from me
But I see my life and it's way too short
Don't blame me
For not being subservient to others' needs
I'm at the point where honesty
Just doesn't fucking work for me
Life is too fucking short
It's too fucking short
