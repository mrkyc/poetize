Get into a fight just to make the sex better
You got a hold of me but there ain't
Nothing here that's holding you down
I believed in this except it wasn't getting better
You got me in the middle but I never found the center
Even when you know what I know
It's not stopping you now
I can't always see what's in front of me
No I can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
All over the ground
Tell me when it's over
Wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never met you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
Where are you now?
I should've known better
I got a new plan but it ain't nothing but a mirror
Of everything we had just before you became a winner
The love the lie is nothing but a memory now
You might also likeI can't always see what's in front of me
No I can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
All over the ground
Tell me when it's over
Wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never met you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
Where are you now?
I should've known better
You take me for a ride and I don't even know the setup
Get into a fight just to make the sex better
You got a hold of me but there ain't
Nothing here that's holding you down
I believed in this except it wasn't getting better
You got me in the middle but I never found the center
Even when you know what I know
It's not stopping you now
I can't always see what's in front of me
No I can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
All over the ground
Tell me when it's over
Wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never met you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
Where are you now?
Tell me when it's over
Wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never met you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
Where are you now?
I should've known better
So wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never loved you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
