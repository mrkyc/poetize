Every time I end up breaking you
You change into something worth keeping
Every time I'm close to saving you
You grow into a sin worth believing
You're everything I ever wanted, but
It's never enough, you're never enough

I'll take
Whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it
If it ever comes

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more!

I never knew until I got a taste
What a waste, for what I have been through
Cause nothing ever really makes that change
I'm so ashamed, of what I did to you
I had to let you in to feel that rush
You were too much, way too much
You might also like
I'll take
Whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it
If it ever comes
I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always hate you more!

I never knew until I got a taste
I'm so ashamed, of what I did to you

I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
But I will always
I hate you when you're gone
I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me
