Oh.. He gives me

Strength to make it
Strength to take it
I've got the strength to know that
Everything will work out fine
Strength to suffer
Strength to conquer
I've got the strength to know the blessings of the Lord are mine

Oh...be strong in the Lord in the power of His might
Know in your heart every battle He will fight

Oh......
(My my strength) My strength
(Strength in my darkest hour) My strength
(He is my strong tower) My strength
(Strength to know you're coming soon) My strength
(I know your strength can be renewed)

Be strong, you be strong
I was strengthened in my spirit when He spoke to me
No more fear, I have peace
Who the Son sets free I know clearly is free indeed
You might also like
Oh.. Be strong
Be strong in the Lord with the power of His might
Know in your heart every battle He will fight

My strength
(Wait on Him, He's coming soon) My strength
(I know your strength can be renewed) My strength
(Strengthen my spirit, my inner man) My strength
(He upholdeth me with His hand)

Oh... Oh.... Oh....
He gives me all things
Through Christ that strengthens me
I can do all things
(Anything I gotta do anything I wanna do I can)
Through Christ that strengthens me
(New Life, New Life sing with me) I can do all things
(He lives in me) Through Christ that strengthens me
(I respect His authority)
I can do all things
All things
All things
All things
All things (I can plant a seed)
All things (I can meet the need)
All things
All things
All things
All things
Oh...Oh...Oh...
He gives me strength
