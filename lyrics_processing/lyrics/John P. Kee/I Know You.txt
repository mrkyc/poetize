I met you one night
And oh to my surprise
I fell in love the night
You entered into my life
Now love is so brand new
It is all because of you
Volitional ability to choose
To know you
Just to know you
A relationship that caused my life to change
To know you
So very glad i know you
I'll worship and adore your Holy name
(I know you)
I've had so many friends
But I can't even think
Of one who is so special to me now
To live without your love
Would be impossible
That's why inside it means so much
To know you
Just to know you
I discovered you are a compassionate friend
That will never leave you, no
Just to know you
Is to love you
I'll worship and adore your Holy name
(I know you)
If I could just get through
To one who never know
What real love
What it can do for you
You're the perfect reason for
The joy that's in my life
I'll do more than just reply
I'll shout it from the mountainside
To know you
I'm so glad i know you
I'll worship and adore your Holy name
I do love you, I love you
I'll worship and adore your Holy name
I'll worship and adore your Holy name
In order to worship you, i must first know you
Not just for who you are in melody
Or in my sing
But who you are and always will be in my life
Vamp
I know you
Jesus is a friend indeed
In the time of need
He's the reason i sing
I wouldn't trade him for anything
Know you as a friend indeed
Know you in the time of need
You're the reason that i sing
