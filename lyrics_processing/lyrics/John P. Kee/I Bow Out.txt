So if leaving means being obedient to God, I'd rather do what the Lord says do. Atlanta I love you, stay encouraged, stay in the will of God. God bless all of you. Listen to this little song

I bow out gracefully
After all that you have done
Gracefully
You are my morning sun
Gracefully
As I leave I bow out gracefully
I'm going home
Oh Bless the Lord

I will - I bow out gratefully
No hurt, harm or danger came before me, no
Gratefully
The bus returned to South Park every weekend safely
Gracefully
As I leave, I bow out
I say bye bye, I say bye bye bye

I-I bow out gratefully, I'm outta here
A few enemies I still have
Gratefully
Every void in my life You are there
All I want to say is
Gratefully
As I leave, I bow out
I'm grateful
I'm moving gracefully
Gently with form
Meek and humble
I've got to go
I've got to go
I've gotta go
