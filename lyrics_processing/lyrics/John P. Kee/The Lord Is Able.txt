Just be encouraged, hold your head up to the sky
Every one of your obstacles, you can overcome
Shout Hallelujah for the battle's already won
There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper
He's able to keep you, the same shall free you
He's able to see you, see you through
Now that it's over, hold your head up high
Just be encouraged, hold your head up to the sky
Every one of your obstacles, you shall overcome
Shout Hallelujah for the battle's already won
There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper
He's able to keep you, the same shall free you
He's able to see you, see you through
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities
For we know deep in our hearts, He shall not, He won't forsake me
There is no weapon formed against you that shall prosper
He's able to keep you
The same shall free you
He's able to see you
You might also likeSo lift up your head so God can use you
And He will come to your rescue
If you draw nigh to God
It's true that He will draw nigh to you
He's able to keep you
The same shall free you
He's able to see you
