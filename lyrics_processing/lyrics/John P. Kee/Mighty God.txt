In Him I place my faith and trust
For He knows, I shall never give up
Bridge over troubled waters
He answers all my prayers and hears my pleas
He is the source of my life, the source of my strength
He is the Lord that empowers within
King of king, In Him I believe
He is Almighty God
In Him I place my faith and trust
For He knows, I shall never give up
Bridge over troubled waters
He answers all my prayers and hears my pleas
He is the source of my laughter, the source of my strength
He is the Lord that empowers within
King of king, In Him I believe
He is Almighty God

He's a well that shall never run dry
Fruit of my spirit, He's the apple of my eye
He's a corner stone, He's a way when times are hard
He's Jehovah-Jireh, He's a mighty God

In Him I place my faith and trust
For He knows, I shall never give up
Bridge over troubled waters
He answers all my prayers and hears my pleas
He is the source of my laughter, the source of my strength
He is the joy that empowers within
King of king, In Him I believe
He is Almighty, Almighty, Almighty God
