The thing I hate the most, I hate the most
About being a ghost is no one believes in me
When I say death is near
And no one else can hear
It's so frustrating to watch you go, don't you know?

Look down and button up your shirt
'Cause no one's looking in your direction, oh woah
Sometimes the world makes it hurt
But that's okay because you're geared for action, woah woah
You're geared for action yeah!
Geared for action, oh
Oh, oh!

All you want is more, so much more
Time before you have to leave this medium
And watch today just fade away
Tomorrow comes to take its place
Everyday, everyday, everday-ay-ay
