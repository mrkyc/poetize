They steady hatin' on me
Though i'm steady stackin' the dough
I'm never lookin' back though
I'm steady go with the flow
I'm thanking god for my blessings
I still pray on my knees
I remember when I didn't have nothing to eat
It was only me, and my momma, and my sister, and my grandma too
In environments
Yea you know how it is how we came up
My friends knew I had them noodles now we changed up
