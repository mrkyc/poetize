Shawty wanna be my bae
Shawty wanna chill with me today
Aww we could chill
Tell me how you feel
Baby we could chill
Tell me how you feel
Shawty wanna be my bae

Working so hard
I'm out on my grind
Hellcat as a youngin
But I did all my time
Back then it was fine
In and out with them dimes
Break it down
Used to strike all the time
It's on my mind
In and out of detention centers (RYDC)
Is you here for me
Momma was there for me
Granny looked out for me
Auntie took care of me
But it was hard to see
Everything there for me
Everything coming so hard pressure on me
I don't think that you understand
I'm so lonely
Solo making a plan on this earth (Yeah)
So cold being a man in this world girl
A million things that I been through
You can't tell me
About the struggles that I been through
They won't own me
I seen the closet switch for the fame
We not homies
You used to be my brother
You lame speaking on me
You see it ain't the same
You lames got the game from me
No it ain't the same (Super hard)
You see it ain't the same these lames tried to shine on me
Thought I left the gang I don't change and you switched on me
For a couple bang these chicks don't mean none to me
The only thing I want is a rang and these companies
So keep it on the facts
Matter facts you look up to me
So what the hate for you showing all this jealousy
I looked out for you when I ain't have shit
At 15 I calmed down
Time to get rich
Ima gone and get it
Everybody gone eat
Everybody gone win (3x)
You might also like
Silento mob
Everybody gone get it
Everybody gone win
Everybody (Get it Get it)

Shawty wanna be my bae

Shawty wanna be my bae

Tell me how you feel
