You shut your light, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether you're black, whether you're white
You always left me in the gray
And my shadow's cruel, but I never knew
Now I'm tasting blue, while you're changing hue
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get that time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this lovin' causing pain
Wish you wore my shoes, 'cause I've torn them through
Though I wore that proof, I'm so confused
I'm not dealing too well, 'cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the gates of heaven or hell
And I trust you, 'cause I just can't tell
I know you so well
Remember when we fell
Remember when we fell

I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
And I'm drowning in emotion, your quicksand suffocating
Wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
You might also like
It's a storm brewing, on the horizon
No matter what I'm choosing, baby, I ain't decidin'
Is suicide, suicide
Like you told me catch a knife
I trade your promise for my life

I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water
Babe, I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion, your quicksand suffocating
Wish I was a little taller
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water

I can't walk upon the water, no
I'm attracted to the ocean
But I slip right through, I slip right through
I drown for you
Babe, I slip right through, I slip right through
I drown for you
