Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
Woo, woo, woo

There's magic inside of my cup
My eyes red just like firetruck
This room's starting to look down-side up
And outta mind, and I don't mind

Phone blowing up, they wanna come through
It's cool if it's you and your crew
Them other hoes better find something else to do
That ain't the vibe, no not tonight

It's going down like domino
When the smoke fill up the place, can't see in front of you
Tell the DJ run it back, loco
Yeah, the sirens that you're hearing ain't the 5-0
I'm that siren on the track

My Snap gon' be so lit as fuck

We outta line and I don't mind

It's cool if it's you and your crew
