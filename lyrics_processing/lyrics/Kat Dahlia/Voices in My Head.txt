I gave up, jumped out the plane
And hopped inside a drop of rain
Look, in my eyes, a hurricane
The wind, it smelled like sugarcanes
I spread my borrowed wings and flew
But couldn't reach the clouds, who knew?
And, sky, it wasn't even blue
It was hotter than a crimson flame

You in that lovely light, like a fluorescent painting
You In that lovely light, like luminescent stains
Sunsets make great goodbyes, like iridescent waves
You In that lovely light

I got voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Telling me I'm dead, that I'm dead, that I'm dead
Voices in my head, in my head, in my head

I gave up and left my brain
In salivated pillow stains
Then took a trip through tallest grass and
Through the trees into the masses
And when I reached the people there
I saw the trucks and gases 
Gases flew up to the sky
And clouds, they cried from way up high
You might also like
You in that lovely light, like a fluorescent painting
You In that lovely light, like luminescent stains
Sunsets make great goodbyes, like iridescent waves
You In that lovely light

I got voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Telling me I'm dead, that I'm dead, that I'm dead
Voices in my head, in my head, in my head

Illuminations of our creations
One light, one light, you and I
And wave all to the sky

I got voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Voices in my head, in my head, in my head
Telling me I'm dead, that I'm dead, that I'm dead
