One day baby we'll be old, oh baby we'll be old
Think of all the stories that we could have told

Just another one of those nights, welcome to my city
I'm feeling kind of lonely but got all my people with me
Ain't nobody got stop me now, all my people gone hold me down
Came from nothing I made something, ooh mama look at me now
Doing my thing and I'm living my life one day at a time, just let me be
I'm doing me so beautifully, how it feel to be living free
One day I'mma be made, one day I'mma be great
One day I'mma behave, until then I'mma get it mane'
I'm rolling, yeah I'm rolling and I'm riding
And I'm coasting, cause' one day I'mma be older
And I'm still focused, life is short but love is tall, I'm just hoping
That I stay true to myself and keep it going


One day I'mma be so so paid, hurt my wrist when I whip that Range
Y'all behind when I switch them lanes, I'm kicking ass and I'm taking names
Ain't nobody gone' stop us now, all our people gone' hold us down
Told us we wouldn't make it, ooh hater look at us now
Hold up, watch me roll up get my dough up
Man you know what, y'all ain't hear that I'm what's up
And y'all are so what, ain't gone' be satisfied until everyone know us
Time to go nuts
Man I'm rolling, yeah I'm rolling and I'm riding
And I'm coasting, cause' one day I'mma be older
Still focused, trying to get it how I can and keep it moving
Cause when the going gets tough the tough get going

Do whatever I please

Do whatever I please

Now freeze

Man I'm rolling, yeah I'm rolling and I'm riding
And I'm coasting, cause one day I'mma be older
Still focused, life is short but love is tall, I'm just hoping
