Three's for the luck in this hand I was dealt
Good on my own, I don't ask for no help
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' don't flatter yourself
C'mon and I know I'm the best
Respect to a few, middle finger to the rest
C'mon, never ask for no help
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' don't flatter yourself
Yeah I does it, I really fuckin' does it
Did it all like it wasn't nothing
In Margaritaville with your girl, call me Jimmy fuck it
I'm all in, trying, told y'all I wasn't bluffin'
People tell me my jeans too tight
And gangster ass dudes say my voice too light
Real question: do I give a fuck though?
And if you wanna know, the answer is no
I dress fancy, I'm handsome, oh, and I'm dope
And I plan to blow, bitch, and I go
Harder, further, and farther, young fire starter, you should try harder
You know I are a young superstar
Girl, anyone ever told you how beautiful you are?
Fuck takin' a picture, I paint it, a beautiful day, ain't it?
Celebrate, we made it

C'mon, never ask for no help
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' don't flatter yourself
Yeah they like me, they really fuckin' like me
Maybe 'cuz there ain't nobody out that's fuckin' like me
A needle in a haystack? Yeah I fuckin' might be
Save the princess, tell the queen to fuckin' knight me
Now, 'til we all in a better place, tell the homies ain't worried about no resumes
Rub the cake in her face: wedding day
I'm so right, nothing left to say
If you give me the ball man I promise I'm gon' make it in
Standing on the foul line, deep breath, take it in
New mission: make sure they never pick on Dave again
New girl, new mattress, let's break it in
Say she a actress but she actin' camera shy
Need a girl that's funny and fine, like Amanda Bynes
We on the beach, sun, no tan lines
I'm richer than Oprah. What, can't I fantasize?
Hey, one's for the homies, two's for myself

C'mon, never ask for no help
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' don't flatter yourself
Ah, and now I don't need to justify what I do or when I do it
Man I'm just lovin' life
Balloon boy, trying to touch the sky
All you dudes in the attic, y'all ain't doin' nothin' right
I'mma cop everything on my wish list, fuck every chick on my hit list
And do this in memory of everyone who never got to witness
The step to the plate, like man I'm about to hit this
Out of the park, I'm out of your league
I'm out of my mind, I'm out of class, I'm ready to leave
Geez, I graduated, trying to get my master's
If I sign a deal, I'll be trying to get my masters
Still a bachelor, maybe soon I'll settle down
Life's a game of football, never let them get you down
Cause I ain't fumbling, and I ain't puntin' it
Having a ball, might as well run with it
Hey, one's for the homies, two's for myself
Three's for the luck in this hand I was dealt
Good on my own, I don't ask for no help
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' don't flatter yourself
C'mon and I know I'm the best
Respect to a few, middle finger to the rest
C'mon, never ask for no help
