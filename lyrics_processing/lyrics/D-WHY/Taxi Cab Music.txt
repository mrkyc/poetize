Taxi!

White shirt, black tie, black lights, white lies
No socks, black pants, tailored to the right size
Crib is a mess but if you're around you should stop by
Take her to Chow's but every other night I'm eating Popeyes
It's raining outside but I'm dressed like man fuck it
Oxford on, sleeves rolled up, pants got them tucked in
Feeling like a young JFK, Manhattan's my Nantucket
Trying to fill it all the way up till' I kick the damn bucket
Fuck a Maybach, a couple May's back I was amazed that
Pops was in prison, every fight turned to a cage match
My girl tell me she just want to see the old Dave back
But me and disappointment go way back, I pray that
I make it home soon, lean back watch the fare rise
Windows down, Funkmaster Flex on the air live
Trying to get there cause' I think, no I swear I'm
Too sick to dap the homie so I throw him air fives
Giving directions, at different intersections
If Flatbush is at your left then we should be there in a second
Like damn man, I think we took a wrong turn
Not a Tigers fan but I hope you fuckers all burn
This ain't Maybach music, this that I can't believe I made that music
Fuck that, this that I can't believe he had the nerve to say that music
That Brooklyn rooftop chilling, laid back music
I'm laid back, Ima' bring it down cause'
What goes comes back around and
All I know is that you reap what you sow
Pay back's a bitch until she gets what she is owed
So I'm an old soul, young body, I'm probably
Going to trot along by myself, live and love, die alone
And I think that I'm the best like Dylan
Phone ringing like a fire alarm, I am giant strong
Hot with an iron on, I don't need to try it on
This Louis Vuitton is real boy, yours is iron on
I am on some take me to Zion
I'm eyeing the prizes mom and I don't know my right from wrong
I should write a poem, roses are dead violets are gone
In the taxi cab chilling, wake me up when we finally home
Yeah, wake me up when we finally home
Taxi cab chilling, wake me up when we finally home

I'm just trying to be, what they want me to be
So I'm staring out the window riding in my taxi
I'm outta' here for all of y'all
