Close your eyes for this one
Close your eyes
Because I'm about to open them

Staring out the window thinking how should I end it before I even begin it
Seven steps ahead, shit I'm about to set a Guinness
Record for the most vetted, most anticipated, most hated
Before they even heard it, young and whose destined for greatness
Lost three homies in the past year, guess that life works in ways
That I can't comprehend, I swear it almost hurts to say
The night you left this earth, Sam I fucking cursed the day
She telling me calm down, and I wasn't raised to curse this way
Son there's a different way, so I'm on my different shit
Different shit, different day, same attitude
But I'm a different Dave, my nights getting started but it's getting late
I'm running on time, never behind, let us pray
Thank God for blessing me, with the recipe
To recite all the necessities and keep away my enemies
And pen the phrase that never cease to make them cease, rest in peace
They say that I'm living the dream, sounding like a mess to me
Sunday morning, still ain't made it to mass yet
Monday morning, still ain't made it to class yet
Tuesday morning, still ain't got off my ass yet
I'm thinking on Wednesday, I should arrive in fashion
So I'm late out this bitch, dressed up like I'm going on a date out this bitch
Sometimes I wish that I could just fade out and quit
Or end up in Hawaii with a couple lays out this bitch
She ask me if I'm religious, I say baby I'm just spiritual
Good things happen for a reason, that's what I call miracles
Should have seen me a year ago, I was more pissed off than urinals
I need a confessional, baby stop undressing though
See this is serious, are you hearing me?
She driving me crazy, but lord knows what is steering me
All the news reports and TV shows put this fear in me
Engaged by the fame but this game is saying marry me
I solemnly swear to cherish and hold
Till death do us part, for better or worse, we're growing old
Through sickness and health, through the flames and the heat
Spark now or forever hold your peace, peace
I'm James Dean behind the wheel, Kurt Cobain behind the needle
I aspire like a steeple around a cathedral, your feeble
The devilish reincarnation of Evil Kenevil
Stunting on everybody, like it's fun and it's funny
I'm running miles ahead, y'all hours behind
My seat recline, promises I'm keeping mine
I promise I don't need reminded, but I need re winded
Cause there's a hidden message in my lyrics, see if you can find it
It's meant to scare and promote, have a perilous result
Just be careful because it may leave you impaired and provoked
Dare to evoke, lack of awareness, a careless adult
A parent who runs his errands and leaves his kids there all alone
Sends a shot through the skull but doesn't bury the bones
Cries hysterically for our lives as he carries them home
The answers his phone (hello) in the scariest tone
And worries his wife that he married that she'll end up all alone
Red roses mean love but they also mean blood
A young god amongst men held below heavens above
The next question is now, weapons or drugs
Cause there just numb to the pain and so inept from the shrugs
Ain't nobody cared about them, or tried raising them up
It takes a lot to make it out and even more to make it up
Tired of seeing it happen, I hope that your waking up
Because my homies in a cell now, he probably just waking up
I know they hearing this like "D what's got into you?"
I killed myself just to ghostwrite this very shit I spit to you
The devil let him through, that's something that I'll never do
UPS, Fed Ex my flow to make sure that it gets to you
Damn, damn I feel like I saved it all up
Change your heart, young Ari Gold but I'm giving out hugs
Red roses mean love but they also mean blood
A young god amongst men held below heavens above
We're back to that question now, how should I end it
Back to the money, how should I spend it
That broken heart, how should I even start to mend it
How should I prevent jumping off the deep end without swimming
And I'm living in fear that I'll meet a crappy ending
And it's met with laughs from happy women
I'm gritty, I'm sinning, I think I need an intervention
So I go out this bitch the same way I came in it
