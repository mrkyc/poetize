Uh huh
Huh, what's good?
Um, I wanna shout all my Pittsburg family right now
I.D. Labs
E. Dan what up?
Jerm, Josh, I see ya'll
Wiz, what up?
Taylor Gang
Mac, Q, Most Dope
Ok, we in NY right now
But um, let's get it

Ok baby here I go
Tip the waiter
Tip the vallet
Tap dancin' on these haters
Life is such a ballet
Got a ballerina
Look like Halle Berry
In the Audi
Belly button steeze bitch I'm outie
And I'm chillin' in the spot
With my people
Got it locked until the morning
I'mma do by 23
What they couldn't do by 40
Got a shorty with a Beamer
Her ex-boyfriend was a cheater
So I'm driving while she's laughing
Cause he keeps trying to reach her
They ask me son why you stuntin'
I say because I love it
It so fun I'm trying to get it in abundance
My girl does the same shit
She trippin'
So she got a lotta luggage
And that Louis bag is speedy
So she runnin'
You might also like
I'm on Bedford and Halsey
We livin'
We the same but we so different
I'm telling you right now I'm bout to get it
So when I do it
You can say you was there when I did it
I flip it
Inside out I raid the fridge
I'm breakin' all the dishes
The great debator no prisoner taker I see you later
Turn a friend out of a hater
Turn a loser to a Laker
A winning mentality is what makes the great even greater
Girls tell me I'm handsome
But I look even better on paper

All the rumors, all the gossip
All the hearsay, all the nonsense
Can be deaded if you just keep bringing hot shit
I told them baby watch us
While we look at our watches
And talkin' shit is too much fun
So I ain't bein' modest
I'm sayin'
Ya'll ain't with us
So I know what you're upset bout
Ain't been home in a week
But I look like I just stepped out
Louis'd up
Gucci down
Hermes'd out
Damn, ya'll just missed out
Devil horns to all my haters
Dirty weed up in your papers
Get your food spit on by waiters
Ask your girl for dirty favors
Shave for days with dirty razors
Get your face bit off by gators
Hope you never meet your savior or your maker
And you end up all alone
Die slow
Fuck your feeling's bitch
Combat boots got me feeling real militant
Outfit crazy
Wrist game villanous
Black shades got me feelin' real Bob Dylan-ish

Yeah and I don't care if ya motherfuckers like me
Bigger problem
I just got barbecue sauce on my white tee
Wardrobe stupid
But look what's standing next to me
You can stunt
But a bad bitch is always the best accessory
Grew up in townhouse
That shit ain't have no yard
So I'mma go hard
Until I can afford Goyard
And Gucci that's my motherfucking duffel
Half-caff Macchiato
And a Belgium shuffle
Let's go
I'm in an ally
With a chick I think named Allie
She from Cali
Plays volleyball in the Valley
Booty calls and rockin' Bally
Hips are crazy
Lips are pouty
Shit is rowdy
Bitch I'm outtie
Always riding for the mounties
But I'm still in New York City
It's cloudy
I'm waitin' for the sunshine
Watching for the one time
Babe I think I've done fine
Hey
Let me slow it down
Thought I told you
D-Why's bout to come around

If Don't Flatter Yourself is a movie
Then consider this a trailer
If you wanna size me up
Then you can catch me at the tailor
See you later sailor
I'd rather be a winner than a leader
For a leader can lead his team onto failure
Let's go, let's go, let's go
I'd rather be a winner than a leader
For a leader can lead his team onto failure
Let's go, let's go, let's go
