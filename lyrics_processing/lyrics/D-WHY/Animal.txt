They try to bring me down
They try to turn me off
But baby, it's okay cause we're just gonna piss 'em off
Middle finger in the air
Got my head up in the clouds
Hoping they don't miss me too much
I'mma make my momma proud
I'll be back next week sometime
I just need some space and need some time
Everybody wants a piece of mine
Got to clean my thoughts and ease my mind
Either I go crazy or they stop acting so shady
Lately, i've been wanting yeses and they keep giving me maybes
I'm not concerned with my mistakes because I am learning
Just when you think it's over that's when the tables starting turning
They say love is an adventure and life is a journey
And sometimes I get afraid that everyone is out to hurt me

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal

Hey, hey, hey hater, killer
Girl you look so familiar
Nice ass, nice mask
But you could have been so much realer
You may have hurt my pockets
But I will never let you hurt my pride
Pretty around the edges
But we both know you're ugly on the inside
You try to change me, tame me, I'm the same me
How come everybody else always fucks up and they try to blame me?
No more hiding, no more wildin'
They be drinking, I be drivin'
Thinking about life, I be ridin'
Down the highway late at night and
Watch the sunrise with my dogs
We ain't have no luck at all
But we still gonna have us a ball
The night is ours
You can have tomorrow
Yes I am an animal
My life is zoo and
I hope that I'm still human
Don't know what I am doing

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal
I asked them if they could show me the way
And they said no
I told them I am gonna be somebody today
And they said no
They told me I am to young and that I didn't even hear a lot
That I don't know
But it's okay, ask me if I give a fuck
