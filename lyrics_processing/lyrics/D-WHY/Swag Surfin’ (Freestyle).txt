And my little brother Matt
And they both got more swag
Than your boyfriend ever had
I'm surfin', I'm surfin', for certain close the curtains
I be hurtin' and they tryin' so hard but it don't be workin'
I'm as pretty as a picture ridin' with a Mona Lisa
She be whisperin' sweet nothings in my ear, "it's nice to meet ya"
Here I go, there I go, blarin' through your stereo
Karma's a bitch, what goes around comes around like a merry-go
Oh, yes I swear, I'm so alive that it's a miracle
They say it's funny how I made it ha ha ha hysterical
I'm laughing to the bank and then I'm laughing to the mall
And then I'm laughing my ass off cause I'm laughing at 'em all
It's like a comedy, I'm what you want to be, cause you're a wannabe
I told my ex-girlfriend to get ghost and now she's high on me
I'm on the scene and honestly I wanna leave so me and you should reconvene between the sheets and play some naked peek-a-boo
Oh, what we need to do, Charleston's got a problem
Mikey told me that I got 'em, that I got 'em, let me holla
That Scotty, Scotty beam me up, take a shower to clean me up
One second I'm an asshole, the next they say I ain't mean enough
Fuck, why girls gotta be so confusing and stupid
I'm only rapping cause girls like guys who are into music
They say Jesus, "do you need us?" Why you being so facetious?
I think I saw your girlfriend on an episode of "Cheaters"
Nah, I'm teasing. Be easy, I don't need no confrontation
I know that I'm dope as fuck, I don't need no confirmation
Thanks for waiting, sorry I'm late, and you know I've been busy
You can say my flow is slutty, everybody fucking wit me
Come and get me if you want me, I be everywhere you never are
And girl I don't mess with drama, that ain't in my repertoire
Nah that will not get you far, looked at her and said "let's bounce"
She took me to her crib and said "please excuse the messy house"
And pushed me on the bed and asked me if I was impressed now
It's funny how she got all dressed up just to pull her dress down

Did he have to do it, well they say old habits die hard
Your outfit gets a fail (fail) but I mean, I guess you tried hard
If you're a swag surfer, ha, I'm a lifeguard
Cause you don't know how to stay balanced, you leaning, you fallin'
And splashin', I'm laughin', you sinkin'
I'm sayin' what you doing? You just made yourself look stupid
You had the perfect opportunity but you just blew it
They scared of me, man I'm what you dare to see
Your parents wish you'd marry me, Mazel tov, on a chair they carry me
Apparently, this white boy be killin' I'm like Larry B
And my flow is crazy I think I should go to therapy
Sick, need some Theraflu, there are few comparin' to
Wait, I take it back, there ain't no way that I can marry you
A bachelor like the TV show, they send me to an oasis
And baby you don't need to know (no) but you need to go
Somewhere and just know that if you can't beat us then join us
Everybody points at me while everybody gives you pointers
On the track like Jackie Joyner, I don't mean to be annoying
But girl there's something about the smell of fresh air in the morning
Why you acting gucci you and your dude are flashing in matching koogi
I might smash a groupie then grab a smoothie while at the movies
Actually I'll pass but I act it if you pass it to me
And like half a glass will have your girl showing her ass and boobies
What you doin' shopping? If I want it I'm gon' buy it
Ain't no need to try it on already know my sizes
Call me GQ D-Why always on some fly shit
