I'm sittin' back with my head to the sky
Trying to get this bullshit out my mind
I'm livin' life one day at a time
I got a license to chill so im chilling

Im all in it, authentic, ahhh didn't
He do it like that before, yes he did im back bitches
With a couple new outfits, im out with
A chick makin out, mouth to mouth, no blouses allowed
Take your shirt off, let the top down
They tell me to stop, I tell 'em not now
See I ain't hot now, I'm just getting warmed up
Man I thought I warned you, from here to California
Beverly Hills, call me Rodeo Dave
Shopping therapy, gotta take the pain away
Yeah, I'm tryna be a Boss like Hugo
I'll never be a Christian like Dior, but you know
I'm tryin' God willing I'mma be
A nice guy, I think she on to me
An asshole honestly
So shore I'm on the beach, breeze in the sky
All I got in life is my word, balls, and pride

I'm sittin' back with my head to the sky
Trying to get this bullshit out my mind
Livin' life one day at a time
I got a license to chill so im chilling

I turned nothing into something, now I gotta keep I coming
Runnin like a politican with that money and I'm hungry, I go
Where they ain't never been, legend of the hidden temple
Bump the instrumental, from a soldier to a general
This is a coming of age story, no road paved for me
My life, my pain, my gain, my glory
It's my turn bitches I told y'all not to worry
Super Dave will be there in a hurry early never fear
I'm always present but I'm never here
Solid metal gear, throttle pedal on the floor as I'm shifting gears
Wisdom like I'm 60 years old hot as a kitchen stove
How does this kid envision such wicked shit I didn't know
He went hard as martyr as if he died tomorrow
You would think ghostwrites for Mr. Carter, get your daughter
Before she gets heartbroken, I start going and I ain't stoppin
Till I top the charts, or pop like tarts
Breakfast for the early bird snack for the late nighters
Touch like Midas, pockets gettin stuffed like sinus
I'm tryna be Brooklyn's finest Bed Stuy and
Rooftop chillin on my throne your highness

I'm sittin' back with my head to the sky
Trying to get this bullshit out my mind
Livin' life one day at a time
I got a license to chill so im chilling

I can see the clouds from where I'm sitting, up here its different
They judge the kids appearance, cuz what I'm wearing is different
Yeah my clothes fitted, I'm just clothes minded
They so blinded, they closed minded I'm so fine that
I could go for days, broke or paid, tryna get broker paid
Thats a mean mug it ain't a poker face
No mistake, I hate to show up late, will you hold my place?
My lifes a rollercoaster, you on rollerblades lame
You ain't fuckin with the young showstopper
Globetrottin ironic, im fresh but so rotten
Dead but not forgotten, since I came to Gotham
City I been runnin no joggin, scouts honor
I'm the troop leader, in the coupe two seater
With the roof missin either I'm dreamin or I did it
I can feel it in the air, is that success that I smell
And baby girl please, don't flatter yourself

I'm sittin' back with my head to the sky
Trying to get this bullshit out my mind
Livin' life one day at a time
