Heyyy, Heyyy, Heyyy
This that macchiato music
Everybody rocking to it
Always staying on some new shit
And I think I'm bout to lose it
No graphic tees, all the homies wearing oxfords
Got your girl sleeping over, she wearing my boxers
Wake up in the morning she getting us both coffee
Half cafe skinny macchiato, yeah that's what she got me
I'm funny I fuck good and I'm a fly dresser
Run and tell your girlfriends that you just found the trifecta
Tell your ex's try better, why sweat her, why you asking
I'm only bout three things sarcasm, orgasms, and fashion
I be laughing at em all cause I'm on and they off
So come on take it off and whats that an alarm
I feel like a modern day James Dean in the same jeans
New chick, new whip, new crib, new shit but I'm the same me
Doing my thing I'm riding around I got my people with me
We some bachelors looking for Sex and the City
Need a girl who
Acts like Charlotte
Works like Miranda
Dresses like Carrie
Fucks like Samantha
You might also likeI'm Mr.Big baby, I be on it why you stressing hey
Is your closet walking you should run out and catch it what
Goodbye for now, baby girl I'm gone
I told you this wasn't gon' be no love song
Cause the good ones are either married or crazy
Or had some rough years in high school and ended up with a baby
I'm saying I'm up in Starbucks trying to enjoy a little coffee
Y'all really messed my mood up thanks a latte baby ahh
There's some things I gotta do but some more I gotta say
I just wanna be alone will you please get out my face oh
Heyy Heyy Heyy (come on)
Heyy Heyy Heyy (I'm gone)
I'm kinda stressed you don't need to know what's up
I apologize I must have forgot to give a fuck
Heyy Heyy Heyy (come on)
Heyy Heyy Heyy (I'm gone)
Ahh, I'm only in it for the benefits
Princesses and presidents big fences on my residence
Dressing like I'm JFK pockets full of JFKs
Super Dave will the save the day get that stuff off layawayy
Ayy, ayy
You can find me in the Venetian this weekend
I'm sleeping and eating and praying and seeing
Not preaching, believing that everything happens for reasons
Just keep on achieving and keep it a secret
When they losing I be laughing
I be cruising they in traffic
Why you do it what just happened
It's like magic ahh
My dream girl drives a Ferrari
Dresses and listens to Marley
She down to ride like a Harley
And looks like Malibu Barbie
She got a nice smile
Cute laugh, ass and a face
Bad bitch
Even her period comes fashionably late, whoaa
Goodbye for now, baby girl I'm gone
I thought I told you to show up here with nothing on
It's no wonder she'll do anything for me
She may have gotten here late but she ended up coming early
That's why I eat when I'm hungry (ok)
Fuck when I'm hard (yeah)
Sleep when I'm tired
Deal with all that bullshit tomorrow
There's some things I gotta do but some more I gotta say
I just wanna be alone will you please get out my face
Heyy heyy heyy (come on)
Heyy heyy heyy (I'm gone)
I'm kinda stressed you don't need to know whats up
I apologize I must have forgot to give a fuck
Heyy heyy heyy (come on)
Heyy heyy heyy (I'm gone)
This that Macchiato Music everybody rocking to it
I be staying on some new shit
