They say I'm full of myself
Fuck that, I'm feeling myself
They say I'm full of myself
Fuck that, I'm just feeling myself

Making out in her '09 Benzo
Look at you just sitting in the friend zone
They've been fucking with me since wind blows
E-Trayn my brother, that's my motherfucking kinfolk
You ain't fucking with us? Cool, well aight then
Shit, them other guys, man, we don't hype them
Thank God that we ain't nothing like them
Amen, Jesus saves, but I spend
I could be your side dude, you my side chick
You know, someone cool I can chill and ride with
Your man too lame, he could use a stylist
Tell them baby boo you need to get on your D-WHY shit
You know what, I feel like a young Yeezy
(Huh, you feel like a young Yeezy?)
Cause I'm the new kid wearing preppy ass clothes
Shitting on the game, I make it look easy

They say I'm full of myself
Fuck that, I'm feeling myself
They say I'm full of myself
Fuck that, I'm just feeling myself
They say I'm full of myself
Fuck that, I'm just feeling myself
You might also like
Yeah, I only half-like rapping
Thinking 'bout career change, might get into fashion
Model a little bit, maybe get into acting
Too busy stunting right now, so we'll see what happens
Married to the money, I don't need prenup
Flow so dirty I could use a clean up
She said, "Dave, these fuck boys can't see ya"
Fuck a label, I'm 'bout to sign to Wilhelmina
(Stunt, stunt, stunt)
Tryna make it so everyday is the first of the month
Only smoke a little bit, but she always rolling a blunt
And don't party too much, but she down to have some fun
Always on my boss shit, you on your lacrosse shit
Still rocking Lacoste shit, acting like it cost shit
Tossed it, almost lost it, but I Moss'd it
Go so hard, turned a prayer circle to a mosh pit, ay


(Let them know)
I feel like I deserve a fucking cold one
I feel like you should feel like a no one
I feel like I don't even really smoke, but after this long ass day, someone should probably roll one
I feel like I should take a victory lap
I feel like you should take a fucking nap
I feel like I should be able to feel like whatever I wanna feel like and not have y'all react
I feel like I deserve some paparazzi
Goddamnit, this outfit fire
I feel like walking in work tomorrow and telling the boss
"Motherfucker, you fired" (With yo lame ass)
You know what, I feel like a fucking gold mine
This is what they want? Got me flowing like it's '09
Imma hold mine, no O-line, it's go time
Feeling myself, I'm my own fucking cosign
