The devil is watching me
The devil is watching me

They want to hear that real real shit, do you feel shit?
Do you want to be Uncle Phil rich?
Do you want to pop some pills and just act like some little children?
Got the Henny chilling, Henny spilling, in love with that Henny feeling
Bitch when I walk in the building, bow in the presence of brilliance
Shine in the presence of darkness, act smart around the retarded
End shit before it gets started, rest in peace dearly departed
Amen may Jesus save my soul
May heavens gates be paid with diamonds and gold
May the lights shine down on me in the final hour
Shoot me after dinner, I still have to take a shower
I'd rather be the freshest motherfucker in hell than the freshest motherfucker in jail
And they saying

Getting paid like pose' to
Smoking blunt after blunt like we pose' to
Fucking all these bad bitches like we pose' to
You don't know how, let us show you
Give in to temptation, give in to temptation
Give in to temptation like you pose' to
Give in to temptation, give in to temptation
Give in to temptation like you pose' to

Suck my motherfucking dick, kiss my ass and wipe my shit
Don't care if you like this shit, not sure if I like this shit
I might be rich, I'm probably broke
I'm might be might be psycho though
God didn't save me, oh but maybe I'ma call up Geico though
I need some damn assurances, these days I ain't sure of shit
Girl take off your shirt and shit
Watch your purse, I'm swerving bitch
In and out of lanes, I'm in and out of brains
Who am I these days, don't even feel like Dave
I pray to lord Jesus he protect me from my enemies
For all of my homies we gone' pour out shots of Hennessy
When I'm dead and gone I just hope that y'all remember me
Fuck y'all for tempting me
