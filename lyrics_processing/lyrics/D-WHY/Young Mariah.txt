Hey beautiful, how you doin'?
You look beautiful, you know?
Did I tell you that shit already?
Well, I mean, I told you so, uh
Cause the way you make me feel inside
You a young Mariah, give me butterflies
Feel like this the 90's summer time
And I hate everything, but I'm lovin' life
So come, come, come with me
We can not give a fuck together
We can not give a fuck right now and
We can not give a fuck forever
Let's dance in the rain, hold some metal shit
Hold our feet to the floor, push the pedals in
Leave before we have a chance to settle in
Do not talk about love, it's too delicate
We're a heartbreak away from tragedy
It's a beautiful thing when you're mad at me
But I wanna see you happy, hopin' I make you
Hopin' some day that this world don't break you
Girl

Speak it all the time, speak it all the time
And I'll never tell you what is mine
I dont know what it means, but I see it, it's fine
It's hardly any other it can borrow inside

Sandy stilettos, machiottos, came from the ghetto
Lookin' like a model, let me be your fellow, hello
Where you at? Vancouver?
Is it cool if I come over?
You could be my damsel, I'll be your soldier
Cold as Minnesota, in a Range Rover
Switchin' lanes, whippin' it like yoga
Otis Yoda, do what I'm supposed to
Hold up, you know what, let's get a bit closer
Look right inside the storm as we blow up
Happy to see that you're happy to meet
Such a happening dapper young fellow like me
Hopin' some day that maybe we can be
Together, forever, live happy and free
Go


Let me sing for you
If that's all I do
We should take our time
Cause we gon' be together all night
