Fell in love last night, woke up with a broken heart
Knowing my luck I've been doomed from the start
In this life you either live or die
You either touch the sky or stay on the ground, hey
Time is money, if I had it I'd spend it on you
I ain't grown up yet but girl I am beginning to
And I have been praying, but I have been sinning too
So I chill, cause I don't know what else to do
Reap what you sow, sow what you reap
Won't you let your actions speak because all that talk is cheap
In the dark night sky, you are all that I see
Young. loved, hated. broke man that's all I can be but

At least we're still young and we're still here
It's just us now baby
And they don't like it, but I'm excited
The time is right now, so we say

Some people like me, and some don't
But it's alright, that's just how it goes
Keep your enemies close
When you're young, loved, hated and broke
Wipe those tears and make a toast
Pack your bags now hit the road
You got to let it go
When you're young, loved, hated and broke
Young, loved, hated and broke
Young, loved, hated and broke
You might also like
Fell asleep just now, woke up from a daydream
Everything in life ain't always what it may seem
Don't you know it's all give and take, we all make mistakes
And we live and learn, hey
Go out and get it man, don't just wait and see
I got it locked down cause' I'm living so free
They try to kill my high so I keep it low-key
Cause' I never met a hater doing better than me
Do what you do, move how you move
Love who you love, may all your dreams come true
In the hardest of times, may you always get through
Young, loved, hated, broke man I'm trying to tell you, that



Listen darling, don't settle down you should come with me
And we may have nothing, but we got each other and we live on free
I said, little darling, don't settle down you should come with me
And we ain't got nothing, except each other and we'll live on free
