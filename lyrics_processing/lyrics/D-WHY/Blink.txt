It's a late night, walking down a back street
Blink my eyes twice and I'm sitting in the backseat
Of my old black jeep, with both my hands tied
Masked  men, outside of the car, they're on standby
Blink again, now I'm in a new place, with another new friend
She starts to undress me, I accidentally blink again
Now I'm on the couch in my living room, trying to read the message I just sent to you
Man I hope it gets to you
I always have, so much on my mind
I swear if thoughts could kill I'd go to jail a thousand times

When I lay down, I can't fall asleep
Cause' I'm feeling like, what if I
Don't wake up again, is this really life
Lie awake, pray to Jesus Christ
Hope he hears me right, not a fear in sight
Just another sleepless night alone
Alone, alone
Just another sleepless night alone

And them dark days turn into them bright nights
And I got my eyes wide shut from the twilight
Blink again, now I'm on a roller coaster, screaming I'm riding
It grows wings, and it's about to crash, they need a pilot
I start to fly it, passengers start to riot
Blink once, blink twice, we've crashed on an island
Trying to survive so we build a campfire
Wood burns in the sand and my clothes are damp
I've become friends with the stewardess, we're holding hands
Suddenly I blink again, now I am an old man
Married to the woman of my dreams
But her face fades away, I hear screams

I'm trying to fall asleep but all I hear is

I'm trying to fall asleep but all I hear is

I always have, so much on my mind
I swear if thoughts could kill I'd go to jail a thousand times
