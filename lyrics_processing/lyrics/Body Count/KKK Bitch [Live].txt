Right about now, I wanna tell you a little love story
You know what I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story
Check out the lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down south last year on tour
Out on tour, yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys
She got wild in the backstage bathroom
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum
Said, "I love you, but my daddy don't play
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK"
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad
You know what I'm sayin', so we was down south fallin' in love
You know D-Roc had this Nazi girl
My man, mooseman had a skinhead
I fell in love with Tipper Gore's two twelve year old nieces
It was wild, you know what I'm sayin', it got even worse, you know
So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians
We had our hoods on, we were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a Goddamn rage
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass, she said, "Oh my God"
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, I love her when she sucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad
So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves everybody
We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls
It really don't matter, if you from Mars, and you got a pussy
We will fuck you, you know, that's all we're sayin', word
So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw orgy in every little Southern town
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi girls break their necks
To get to the party, it ain't like their men can't nut
Their dick's too little and they just can't fuck
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets
I know her daddy'll really be after me
When his grandson's named little Ice-T
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, she love me when she sucks me though
(I, I, I)
Love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad
(I, I, I)
