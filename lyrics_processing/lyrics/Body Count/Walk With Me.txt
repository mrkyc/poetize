I fought the darkness that would've crippled most men
You've never seen it
Disgaged from a poison pen
I'm not like you
Motherfucker, don't you forget it
Walk straight down a venomous road
Soak it up just so I can spit it

How can you understand me
I don't fucking understand myself
How can you even help me
I gotta play the fucking hand I'm dealt
I fight to control it
The monsters inside my brain
Decimate my enemies
Slow torture, bottomless pain

Walk with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one is safe
Come with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one escapes

You're staring at me
You don't see what I am
A deadly viper in the skin of a normal man
I dwell in shadows
Motherfucker, you are my enemy
The eyes of a snake see visions of the end
I fall like the night and take you down with me

The beast is unleashed upon victims verse after verse
I place my hands on my forehead and the violence pours out like a curse
In the day I seem normal and I smile and joke and laugh
When I write late at night, I'm a murdering sociopath

Walk with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one is safe
Come with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one escapes

No one is safe
No one escapes
There's no escape

Walk with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one is safe
Come with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one escapes
Walk with me into the darkest recesses of my mind where no one is safe
