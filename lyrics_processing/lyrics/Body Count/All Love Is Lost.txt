I thought you were my friend. I gave you my trust. I would've died for you
Then the second I turn my back, you fuck me over?
All love is lost!
Now you have the nerve to tell me you're sorry?
All love is lost!
You've got to be out of your motherfucking mind!
All love is lost!
You never loved me, you never fucking did!
All love is lost!
Once you betrayed me that is the fucking end!
All love is lost!
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a fuck about you, you can fucking die
I couldn't fucking care less when you fucking cry
My heart's so cold, you left a broken soul
You destroyed everything I thought was true
And now you talk shit cause I don't give a fuck
And now I'm long gone, focus on you
I don't care where you are, don't care what you do
You say you hate me? Cool, I fucking hate you
(Hate you!)

You see you the kind of motherfucker with no honour
The kind of motherfucker with no loyalty
Motherfucker you can't trust
Cross me, and then you want another chance?
One strike and I don't care about your fucking life
You're not no friend to me, you're fucking dead to me
Don't give a fuck about the shit that you was going through
You did some shit to me that I could never do to you
'Cuase I'm not no fake champ, I'm not no punk bitch
You're lucky I ain't put your ass in some dark ditch
And now you want some type of sympathy from me now?
If you were stabbed on the floor I'd watch you bleed out

H - is for the Hell I unleash
A - arise the Apocalypse
T - I am your Terror
E - destroy the Enemy
People say I'm cold-hearted
Why?
Cause you fucked over me?
Cause you broke every promise to me?
Because you said you were my friend and then you stabbed me in my motherfucking...
