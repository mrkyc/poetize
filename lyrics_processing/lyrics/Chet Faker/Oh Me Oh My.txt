Music does something
Most don't know what it does
Just accept it as the sky is blue
But for some people
They got a window half open in their souls
When the breeze blows, it blows
Now, one particular person climbed right through that window
Went so far looking, he forgot what it was that was missing in the first place
Like I said, music does something
After a while, he realised he might well be starvin' to death readin' a cookbook
And there ain't no amount of thinking can fix thinking
So he climbed back through
Into the here and into the now
He checked in, heart and soul
To a place they call "Hotel Surrender"

Get out the way, I'm comin' through
Well, pardon me, I feel for you
'Cause what I say, that's what I do
So get out the way, I got the truth
Hey, you tell them lies one at a time (Uh, three, four)
I don't wanna be just another life, yeah (C'mon)
I'll be the fool for all of you
Bet you wanna see how I'm gonna do
Another day, another lie
If you go to sleep, that's the way to die, ooh
Take it easy with a happy eye
End my days with a healthy sigh, huh
Sing it
You might also like
Oh me, oh my (Uh)
I'll sleep when I die, yeah
Oh me, oh my
I'll sleep when I die (Uh)

It's not what I say, it's what I do
So just let it be, 'cause it's comin' through
Don't you realise it's your own life?
So if you gotta be weird, you better do it right (Weird, alright, huh)
B-but because I'm here, I'm gonna see it through (Uh)
If you wanna be a million dollar fool, hey
Now there comes a day when you wanna die
But as for me, I'm gonna take my time (Oh)
Take it easy with a happy eye (Mmm, yeah)
And end my day with a healthy sigh

Oh me, oh my
I'll sleep when I die, yeah
Oh me, oh my
I'll sleep when I die
(Oh me, oh my)
I'll sleep when I die
Oh me, oh my
I'll sleep when I die
Oh me, oh my
