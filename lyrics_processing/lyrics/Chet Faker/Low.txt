Just because I feel low right now
It doesn't mean all that I've got has run out
Just because I feel low right now
It doesn't mean all that I've got has run out

Look, whatever, I'm good
It doesn't mean that I'm perfect
Still I gotta find purpose
In whatever I've done
Like whatever I should
Doesn't mean that I'm worth this
I don't know if it's worthless
Just to sing a damn song

So what if I don't tell? (Don't)
What if I do it?
What if I see you all in hell?
So what if it's not real?
And what if I'm still here?
So what if a fire is just a light for you to get to know?

Just because I feel low right now
It doesn't mean all that I've got has run out
Just because I feel low right now
It doesn't mean all that I've got has run out
You might also like
You know I think you look good
For whatever it's worth, yeah
I think you got purpose
I think you got song
You know I think that you should
Do whatever, it's worth it
Just to get to that place there
I don't think it takes long

So what if I don't tell?
And what if I do it?
What if I see right through it waiting to call?
So what if it's not real?
And what if I'm still here?
So what if a fire is just a light for you to get to know?
