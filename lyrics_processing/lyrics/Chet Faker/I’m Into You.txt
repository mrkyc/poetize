I got a feeling we are gonna win
Our bodies make it perfect
And your eyes can make me swim
Then again, everything seems new
I can barely hold my tongue
To say the least, I'm into you
And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk
And warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs
Are kisses from the outside, girl, that's all I need

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I'll find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
The rhythm was all I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
You might also like
Is that your knee resting on mine?
Can you feel that?
If I move, I can

When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart
So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue
The shit we do could warm the sun
At night
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I'll find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
The rhythm was all I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
I know you don't want a love you can't sing
The music was at the start
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
The rhythm was all I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
