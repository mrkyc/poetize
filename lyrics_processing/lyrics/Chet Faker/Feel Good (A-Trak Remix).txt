Why you so pretty?
I'm asking you really
Please, baby, don't hurt me
With the keys to my city
With your eyes and your hair
Kinda make me don't care
'Bout anything else
But the voice in my head
I just wanna know about
Whatever love gets you there
I just wanna let you know
I like the kinda things you wear
Come with me, come with me
Let me do things you do
And whatever it does

Set me free
You start to move
Taste like diamonds
Shades of blue
Come and get me
Come and get you
Falling asleep
Yeah, everything moves
Put me in under
Let me dream you
I wanna stay under
Whatever I do
I, I, I feel you
