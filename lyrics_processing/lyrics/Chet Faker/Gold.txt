You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I never loved a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it

I might as well be in a garden
I said, uh, a smell in the air is a dripping rose
(You can be the one for me)
Another soul to be my void then
Of anything there that's made of gold

A physical kiss is nothing without it
And you close your eyes to see what it's done
The body that lies is built upon looking
Is all that remains before it's begun

You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it
You might also like
A heart will swell before it's hardened
With the flick of the hair, it can make you old
Another hole to dig my soul in
I'll leave anything bare that keeps me sole

A physical kiss is nothing without it
And you close your eyes to see what it's done
The body that lies is built upon looking
Is all that remains before it's begun

You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
It's gotta be love, I said it
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a
'Nother one, another you
