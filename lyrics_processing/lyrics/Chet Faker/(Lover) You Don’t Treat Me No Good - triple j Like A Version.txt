I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back
Girl, but before I get to going, I've got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And now, all you do is you treat me cold
When the love stops burning, you got to do what's right
Woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good, no more, no good, no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Well, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back
Girl, but before I get to going, I've got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And now, all you do is you treat me cold
Gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door
But before I get to going, I've got to say
There was a time, oh woman, when you used to shake it for me
But now, all you do is just treat me cold
Gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door
