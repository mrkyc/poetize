Help me breathe, you're breaking up my speech
While you smile at me, you got the whitest teeth
You won't leave me alone
Every time I rest, you're in my head
Breaking bones, breaking bones
You make me lose my tongue and fall all over the words
I'm not the kind of one to lose myself in the hunt
You gotta move that body, that's the shape I want
Everything you say is on fire
You've got the easiest position to destroy my life
All you have to do is arrive

Melt my happiness
Some kind of fucked-up mess
Looking out for you is a kind of waiting game
That leaves me running circles into my brain
Hell, my loneliness
Will take no part in this
O-O-Overdose

Wasting my time with you, now
There's only wasted sunshine in my watch
Wasting my time is just the start
I'll be erasing my mind with what you've got
Too much nerve coming into here
Turning loose and making more to fear
Goddamn it, boy, you're so hot (So hot)
It's no excuse to make my pulse stop
I need a bit of coffee and a warm sun
Your dusty ideas, only half-spun
The verse I'm singing, only half-sung
Half-flirting and I'm half-sprung
Didn't mean to let it get this far
I'm playing hard to get, you're playing your guitar
Goddamn, you should be so shy
Been working hard to drop me inside
I have dreams of breaking all, breaking all my bones
Before I break it off, I break it off alone
You might also like
Melt my happiness
Some kind of fucked-up mess
Looking out for you is a kind of waiting game
That leaves me running circles into my brain
Hell, my loneliness
Will take no part in this
O-O-Overdose
Melt my happiness
Some kind of fucked-up mess
Looking out for you is a kind of waiting game
That leaves me running circles into my brain
Hell, my loneliness
Will take no part in this
