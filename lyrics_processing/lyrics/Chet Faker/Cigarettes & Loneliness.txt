Maybe this could be the kind of one where I sit on the words
We're talking through each style, everything is overheard
See, everything that I take upon loses worth
Well, now that you're not the one that I thought you were
And it hurts that I'm done

Now I don't believe in nothing
Avoiding night, you tell me you know

Maybe I could be this lonely guy that'll sing on a song
Another tease will come along with everything I don't want
And you won't see me
Walk past with another one

I, I cannot dream this enough when you're gone
You want me to stomach a night without eating at all
Everyone's coming, but now there's a hole in your heart
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love

Love, are you done with my tongue?
I open my mouth, but you hear me wrong
Love, are you done with my tongue?
I open my mouth, but you steer me wrong

Maybe this could be the time to run before I spit on the world
I'm walking through each smile, everything is overturned
See, everything that dies, I take a small piece to rust
Well, now the stone's been thrown, the trust is dust

Now I wanna be a loser
For a little life where you tell me, "No"

Then I can be in this small world where I sit on the stones
Guaranteed not alone, everything I had before
And you won't see me
Walk past with another one

I, I cannot dream this enough when you're gone
You want me to stomach a night without eating at all
Everyone's coming, but now there's a hole in your heart
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love
Breathe, this is love without love, without love
Without love, without love
Love, are you done with my tongue?
I open my mouth, but you hear me wrong
Love, are you done with my tongue?
I open my mouth, but you steer me wrong
