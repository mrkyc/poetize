Living on free food, tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do? Hmm
Tears from little sister crying
'Cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
Oh, but you know she'll get by

She is living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can, she can

It's a good thing you don't have the bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
A walking to town to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And it chills to the bone, boy
You'd better go home where it's warm
You might also like
You can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can, she can

Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You take them in stride family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lotta love and a warm conversation
And plenty of prayer
Making you strong, where you belong

Well, you live in the love of the common people
Be the pride and the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love you just as much as she can, she can

Living in the love of the common people
