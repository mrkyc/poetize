I went from being a third-grade punk to sixth-grade cool
I still hold the land speed record down County Road 509
Judge Taylor said he was real impressed but wouldn't waive the fine
I still got my picture on the bait shop wall
With a six-pound smallmouth bass
I see that I'm still loved and hated on that overpass
Yeah, I got a name in this town
Some good and some bad that I'll never live down
Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd
But I got a name in this town, yeah, I got a name in this town
Might have to fight my way out of Lucy's when I show up tonight
'Round here it seems old scores, old flames, man they never die
Then again it might just be a bunch of backslappin'
When I walk through that door
Hear the same ol' stories that keep getting bigger than they were before
I packed my things and hitched my dreams to a shooting star
And if the world out there don't give a damn about me or this guitar
It won't matter at all
Yeah, I got a name in this town
Some good and some bad that I'll never live down
Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd
But I got a name in this town, yeah, I got a name in this town
You might also likeI got a name in this town
Been called a few things I can't say right now
A little hard-headed and a little too proud
But I got a name in this town, yeah, I got a name in this town
Risk taker, heartbreaker, troublemaker
Man, I got a name in this town
Big dreamer, dead ringer, not a bad singer
Yeah, I got a name in this town
S.O.B., wild and free, you know me
Man, I got a name in this town, I got a name in this town
