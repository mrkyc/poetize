Heading straight to somewhere I don't even want to go
Eggs and bacon in my belly and a Folger's coffee buzz
Good ol' radar detector it protects me from the fuzz
Well, I do what I gotta do to get through working that 9 to 5
It's killing me but then again it's keeping me alive
It puts the gas in my truck, butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts beer on the table
Eighteen bucks an hour and a million dollar tan
Women whistle at me while I'm working for the man
Making me some cold hard cash out in that summer sun
Come Friday I'll have money but by Monday I'll have none
Once the bills are paid and that bass boat tank has gone from E to F
I fill that big ol' cooler up there ain't a whole lot left
Well, I got gas in my truck, butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts the beer on the table

All I need 's a few good friends and a good job
And a good dog, maybe a woman that understands
A little gas in my truck, some butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week, yeah, puts the beer on the table
Puts the beer on the table
