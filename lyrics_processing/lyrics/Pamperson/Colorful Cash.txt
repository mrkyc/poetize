Pull up to the scene, and i got a new car
I'm a Beaner everybody always seems to know that
Taking James put him in a jar, gotta
Big load of cash, buy some books, bizarre
Gotta lot, going up my ass
Take you out, on a date, go to jack, in the box, yeah
Hoping that'll bring a crisis back
Thinkin back to 08, a big recession
No more money, no more money
I am broke, can't buy no twitter blue
This is a sad day for most of us
This is gay day hay day lay on them tittays
Give it a shot, you love genshin impact
Talking bout tony, he loves to snort some crack
Maybe it's the bitches he lacks
Possibly all the men he calls black

Shit, out my heart, hope I'm having a heart stroke
Pulling up steam, buying bitches, they ain't there
Looking elsewhere, when i stumble on a bloke
Looking up high, all i see is some gay hair

No one knows his name, I'm one that can say hey
Gonna go say it loud and clear
James' real name is
(TaniRift)
Goin out on a rampage
Gonna crank all day get that ez dub
Ever since '45
I've been on the low, joining the weeb club
Nobody knows just who i am
Just what i am just where i am
Just know i'm just a little boy
Who loves to play with gacha toys
Y'all don't got no fashion sense
You dress like rarity ain't real
Go on a hike, fall off a bike
Look at my rhymes, amazon prime, stop acting all fine
Lose a ball, on a fall
Taking trips inside a mall with paul
Grab a dick, now go lick
