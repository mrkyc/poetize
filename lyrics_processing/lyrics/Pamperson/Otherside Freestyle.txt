On the Otherside of the story is when i saw the sign
Your blinding eyes still within the name of the brine
Heading down the stairs, like a 7 second vine
Your hardware is not supported by this new redesign
Reassigned, by the new way you spell
Keep in mind, ring the liberty bell
Call it self realization, making this cameo
When im taking all this shit from god damn zuko
Who knows, dealing with glucose, hitting a new low
Show myself while riding the rainbow
Checking myself out call me a john doe
The world comes to an end, and life is the actors
You can a star, or a prop, or a dancer
God is not Dead, everything matters
Imma make a scene, imma be dead after
(TaniRift)
Ok, I say ok, but i can't really shake the universe
These dumb raps probably spread like a disease or a gloomy curse
Getting canceled for these rhymes. I get canceled all the time, but
I don't really care, because i'm already stuck, in this interstellar express
I don't really know where it's going, i'm just kinda hoping it's god damn blessed
To remove the goddamn stress
But to be honest, it's just kinda a test
To remove the mess
Like a game of chess
I'm not really like ques
Nor like nullity, hes kinda obsessed
But I'll try my best
To give it a final rest

Im living for the planet
Since i was in pamper
Switch it to Jpampers
(Pamperson)
All these rappers in the space time continuum
Shakin out the can hittin the hay how ridiculous, maybe
Try to find a place to make history, nobody want
Fappers that's a sin to the mystery, yeah yeah
Losing all the talent from this new generation
So many inventions, no one tryin to think bout the
Fact that we are killing this world, bout the
Fact that what we do will change this world
We can fix it
Going up to the top, try to find god
Seek the help we need to end this war man
Time is of the essence we gotta do what we can do
Give up now and you can see the earth dead in a few
Try to see the change that we can all accomplish, if
We can take the time out our hands then we can do it, yeah
Our time is now, we can't sit for longer
Our time is now, and won't be for longer
Takin up the challenge, this ain't no joke bro
Tryna find a reason, not to give up yet
Pushin myself through this, already losing
Seein all these politicians ruin
Everything we've worked for
Everything we've strived to be
Prices going up and up and up and
Nobody's doing a thing
Everybody's sittin on their couch playing fifa
