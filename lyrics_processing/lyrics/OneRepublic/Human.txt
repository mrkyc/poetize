Yesterday I talked to God, we had a conversation
Told him that I'm sorry I lost communication
But I just, I just needed some holiness
I said that the things that I've been trying end up in frustration
Life ain't what it seems in any situation
Then he said, he said, he said the strangest thing

He said, "How does it feel to be human
Does some of the best plans you make get ruined?
Do people curse you when flowers ain't blooming?
How does it feel?"
He said, "How does it feel to be human?
If I could for one day I just might do it
Dance 'til the sun comes up to my music
How does it feel?
How's it feel?"

Yesterday I talked to God, we had a conversation
I asked him why this life is a crazy combination
Of numbers, numbers, numbers we can't read
Yeah, for sure I got some friends but we got complications
Most of us are happy with some medication
But I could, I could really use some wings
