I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black, that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
Woo, I'll be running, woo, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles
But Mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said, "Do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out, yeah

Run for God, for fate, for love, for hate
For gold and rust, for diamonds or dust
