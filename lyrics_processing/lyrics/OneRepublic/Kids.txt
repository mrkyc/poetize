Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters, hey

And on most of the days, we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town we were raised
Yeah, 'cause we were done
I remember
We were sleeping in cars, we were searching for Oz
We were burning cigars with the white plastics tips
'Til we saw the sun
But we said crazy things like

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now, I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters, hey

We were dancing in cars, we were looking for Oz
We were naming the stars after people we knew
'Til we had to go
And we were saying things like

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now, I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights, they're turning
But something 'bout this feels the same
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now, I swear we'll never change
