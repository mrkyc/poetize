Papa is a rollin' stone
And he's behind the wheel
With a full-grown tiger in the back seat
Cuttin' corners like Mamma's in the front
Hands pressed on the dash like the tiger's comin' up
I'm at tippin' point, and you're about to push
A little too hard for me to stay hush
The words that left me are makin' a comeback
Seasoned with a salty taste for the lunch rush

I had a feelin' the feelin' that I was feelin'
Wasn't leavin' me until I found a reason
I had it comin' the second I started runnin'
Runnin' out of a reason for even leavin'

Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So you better cut me loose
Yeah, you better cut me loose
Boy, you better cut me loose
Cut me loose, cut me loose
Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So cut me loose, cut me loose
One shot to the belly so the pain will end

Mamma is a beauty queen
And she rules her scene in a way
That makes people kinda crazy
On the corner, white chalk is on the ground
In what used to be the picture of a woman in a crown
She's at a tippin' point
And she's about to snap a little too far to ever come back
Go ahead and test her, she'll make you run back
Screamin' like your heart went red to pitch black

She had a feelin' the feelin' that she was feelin'
Wasn't leavin' her until she found a reason
She had it comin' the second she started runnin'
Runnin' out of a reason for even leavin'

Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So you better cut me loose
Yeah, you better cut me loose
Boy, you better cut me loose
Cut me loose, cut me loose!
Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So cut me loose, cut me loose
One shot to the belly so the pain will end

Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So you better cut me loose
Yeah, you better cut me loose
Boy, you better cut me loose
Cut me loose, cut me loose
Looks like I'm foamin' at the mouth again
So cut me loose, cut me loose
One shot in the belly so the pain will end

So cut me loose
Cut me loose
Cut me loose
