I said it once, I'll say it again if I really want
I'm saying everything I wanted if I really want
I say it once, I say it twice
I'll say it right into your face
Take a step back I got a lot more I gotta say
You're dumb as doorstoppers, wait
Wait, you're as dumb as rocks, go
Dumb as doorstoppers you really need to stop
Knock you over with a statement that will shock
Your mother should've left you in the balls of your pops

I said it, I said it
I'm saying that I said it
I admit it I don't care I don't care and don't regret it
You needed to hear it and I needed to say it
I'm not playing I just said it, no I don't regret it
I said it, I said it
I'm saying that I said it
I admit it I don't care I don't care and don't regret it
You needed to hear it and I needed to say it
I'm not playing anymore, you started a fucking war!

I didn't like you from the start
If you disappear tomorrow
The world and I will throw a party
There'll be no sorrow
Be no tears
Be no horror
No funeral tomorrow
People lined up crying layin' flowers atop your artificial body crying artificial blues
You art-officially an asshole times two
You're not that special, there's a hundred-thousand you's
In every single city that you think belongs to you
