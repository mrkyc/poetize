No, I shouldn't have mentioned
Wasn't worth the attention
Wasn't worth it when I thought about it
I wish I that I could take it all back
Can we go another direction
So we can enjoy ourselves?
When I give it everything, I wanna love it
And never have to give it all back

Forget about every lie I said, and the ones you told me back
Forget about every way I bled just to get nothin' back
Yeah, I did it for a second too long, now I'm done with that
'Cause everything I'm doin' now is gonna have a purpose, yeah

What if it was all left up to us?
What if we decided it was up to us?
What if we divided it up for once?
A side for glory, and a side for guts
A side for them, and a side for us
What if it was all left up to them?
We would be divided and conquerin'
And conquer them

You could've mentioned
That you needed attention
Is it even worth it now to talk about it?
I wish that we could take it all back
Can we go another direction
Instead of tryin' to enjoy ourselves?
Give me everything you got for one last, final moment
'Cause I could never leave without that

Forget about every lie I said, and the ones you told me back
Forget about every way I bled just to get nothin' back
Yeah, I did it for a second too long, now I'm done with that

A side for glory, and a side for guts
A side for them, and a side for us

We would be divided and conquerin'
And conquer them
I don't wanna go this far anymore
I don't wanna go this far anymore

What if it was all left up to us?
