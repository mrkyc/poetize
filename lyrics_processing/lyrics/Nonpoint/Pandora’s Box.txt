Save your stories for someone who cares
Leave your looks and your stares at the door
Grab a chair this is gonna take a second to explain and I'm not repeating myself anymore
Look at all of the damage you've done
You crossed a line that you don't cross with me
So game's over and reality has come, and now the Boogey Man is standing front and center with a gun

Dream time's over and the nightmare has begun
You broke the lock on Pandora's Box and everything inside was lost
Even if you ran around picking up the pieces
Even if you found them all, where's it gonna leave us?
Right here dealing with a box, top wide open with a broken lock

Where's it gonna leave us?
Where's it gonna leave us?

Every single one of your feelings are clear
The glass covered words you're pouring in my ears are leaving scars that I'll be carrying for years
So don't expect a reaction when you're turning on the tears
I heard that excuse
Try living in the truth
You're fucked up, confused and lost without a clue
And your intentions weren't us it was all about you, you, you

Right here dealing with a box, top wide open with a broken lock

You could try and sleep for days
You would still wake up the same way
Blind, deaf and dumb to the truth that you're constantly running from
I would waste my time explaining, but we both know I wouldn't be saying anything I haven't said before, before
It's time to wake up

Dream time's over and the nightmare has begun
You broke the lock on Pandora's Box and everything inside was lost
Even if you ran around picking up the pieces
Even if you found them all, where's it gonna leave us?
