Operatic, overdramatic
Erase my one life left to live
A day in the life with nothin' to give
But my last dyin' breath
Never really wanted the everyday time
Operatic, overdramatic
Erase my one life left to live
A day in the life with nothin' to give
But my last dyin' breath

I'm fillin' my chest with my last dyin' breath
I'm fillin' my chest with my last dyin' breath
And this war will lay to rest
With my last dyin' breath, yeah
Oh
This war will lay to rest
With my last dyin' breath

The weight of it all, state of it all
And everything that's coming
Fate of it all rests on the one chance
Both you and I have left
The weight of it all, state of it all
And everything that's coming
Fate of it all rests on the one chance
Both you and I have left
