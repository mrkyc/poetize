It wasn't just the words that were thrown around
The sound that they made when they hit the ground runnin'
You were out for blood, and I was still tapped out from the battle before
I remember the smell in the room, it was a bad tattoo, like cheap perfume
Rainin' with the windows open, just hopin' that the sun breaks through for a moment
Days turn week, months into a year
I gotta bring up all the things that are harder to hear
Then the same ole pat on the back
It'll all work out, and everything'll be alright

Losin' sight of reality, while losin' the fight to try to forget
All I have are the memories of every single word you said
Every single word you said

I remember that day everything changed
I remember that day. That image never fades away
I remember that day somethin' died inside of me
I remember that day that everything changed

It wasn't just a senseless situation
No sense of making somethin' out of nothin' now
I know it would be pointless at this point in time to point out any problems now
Are you forgettin' the rumors and reputation don't help your situation?
When all you have to show the world is how you act out your problems like a little girl
And if memory serves me right, you were servin' up nothin', but a plate of lies
And it was covered in flies
Rotten from the inside out
Excuse my reluctance to put it in my mouth

Yeah, losin' sight of reality, while losin' the fight to try to forget
All I have are the memories of every single word you said
Every single word you said

I remember that day everything changed
I remember that day. That image never fades away
I remember that day somethin' died inside of me
I remember that day that everything changed

You say I have a problem now?
I think we have a problem here
You say I have a problem now?
I say, "There is no way for us out of here!"

I remember that day everything changed
I remember that day. That image never fades away
I remember that day somethin' died inside of me
I remember that day everything changed
I remember that day that everything changed
I remember that day. That image never fades away
I remember that day somethin' died inside of me
I remember that day that everything changed
