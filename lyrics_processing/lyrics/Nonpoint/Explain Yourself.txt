The fact you feel you have to is enough evidence
To see right through all the bullshit
And the stories you create
I didn't ask to be a game for you to play with
Didn't ask for anything in return
That wouldn't be asked by anyone else
Respect is something I demand
Worked hard enough to understand
People say what you want to hear
If something comes out of it for them
Even some of the people you're calling your friends
Are waiting for the second they don't have to pretend
What I expect from you is straightforward no frills
No lies unless they kill
I don't want to die from a truth that you never told
A book that you never closed
Read the rest and come back
When you've learned what you're supposed to
I didn't ask you to explain yourself to me
The fact you feel you have to is enough evidence
To see right through all the bullshit
And the stories you create
I didn't ask to be a game for you to play with

And if you know me well enough, you know I burn bridges
With flaky motherfuckers and stool pigeons
They have their own agendas
And the people that they burn
Will eventually see everything crystal
Then fire like an automatic pistol
They didn't ask you to choose the way you did
All your wrong words, wrong looks
Judgments passed, closed books, bad reactions
No apologetic actions took, by either stubborn side
So you return to your lonely life
I didn't ask you to explain yourself to me
The fact you feel you have to is enough evidence
To see right through all the bullshit
And the stories you create
I didn't ask to be a game for you to play with
I didn't ask you to explain yourself to me
The fact you feel you have to is enough evidence
To see right through all the bullshit
And the stories you create
I didn't ask to be a game for you to play with
Didn't ask to be the one
The one to make you see
You chose me
I didn't ask you to
I didn't ask you to explain yourself to me
The fact you feel you have to is enough evidence
To see right through all the bullshit
And the stories you create
