Sittin' on your ass all day
Thinkin' 'bout your hangover and the par-tay
You left your fuckin' keys, and had to beg for
Ride from a stranger that I never met before
He acted so friendly that I had to take the ride
But for some reason, he resembled that guy
Wanted for a robbery and beatin' on his kids
"You remind me of my stepson," he chuckled with a grin

What was that move that they taught in self-defense?
You block the killer's knife move with some confidence
The signal when you're trapped inside a movin' car
I wonder if he'll drive real far?

What a day, what a day
Shoulda stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
Should think next time before you start to play, yeah
What a day, what a day
I wonder what'll happen today

Rub your eyes from
No sleep this week
Tap your heels home
And fall asleep

Sittin' 'round lookin' for a fight
Kinda pissed off how I'm turnin' my life
Upside-down from insecure insecurities
Makin' up my mind through old hypocrisy
Up and out of harm's way
Down 'cause I wanna be there
Here because you want me
Not because you're caught in my stare

What was that move that they taught in self-defense?
You block the killer's knife move with some confidence
The signal when you're trapped inside a movin' car
I wonder if he'll drive real far?

What a day, what a day
Shoulda stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
Should think next time before you start to play, yeah
What a day, what a day
I wonder what'll happen today

Rub your eyes from
No sleep this week
Tap your heels home
And fall asleep, asleep in bed
You'll do somethin' tomorrow instead
What a day, what a day
Shoulda stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
Should think next time before you start to play, yeah
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
