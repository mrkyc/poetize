When I drop you, I'm gonna stomp you
Pick you up again, and then drop you
Lift my foot again, and then stomp you, then grind
And when I stomp you, that'll be the end of you, that'll be it
That'll be the end of you, time to jump ship
'Cause I'm a psycho and I'm crazy
And If you're too close, you're gonna get hit

Everybody down, everybody down
I'm comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
Everybody down, everybody down
I need everybody, I need everybody down
Everybody down, everybody down
I'm comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
Everybody down, everybody down
I need every single person right now on the ground

Now that I got you right where I want you
Gonna twist you up, and tie you up, and knot you
Break you, so that it takes you
Six months to recuperate you
Whoa, that's the end of you, that's it
That's the end of you, time to jump ship
'Cause I'm a psycho and I'm crazy
And If you're too close, you're gonna get hit
