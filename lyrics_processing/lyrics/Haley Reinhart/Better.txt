Now I'm right where I wanna be
Out on the road back to the 818
Back to the place where I can breathe
Where it just feels better
You think you treated me like a queen
But I don't feel like no royalty
Well, things are finally clear to see
You want forever; I'm thinking never, never

I threw your ring into the ocean
And now I'm feeling better, feeling better, feeling better now
I watched it sink and now I'm floating
And now I'm feeling better, feeling better, feeling better now
Mmm, better
Mmm, better, yeah, mmm

Just because you're looking fine
Baby, that won't keep me satisfied
You wear that smile like a disguise, yeah
But I just need something better
Well, jump down off your pedestal
Not even you can have it all
Don't drive by, please don't call
When I said "never," I meant forever

For so long, I felt so weighed down
Anchors aweigh now, I'm finally letting go

I threw your ring into the ocean
