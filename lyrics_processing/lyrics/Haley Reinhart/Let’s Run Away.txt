Ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh

I wanna know you more than a friend
I wanna kiss you lyin' here in the sand
Ooh-ooh, feels like paradise (Ooh, ooh)
I wanna know you more than ever before
I've had enough and I still want more
Ooh-ooh, I'm drowning in your eyes

As we sail into the distance ooh-ooh-ooh
Pull your body close to mine

Let's run away my love (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Follow the stars above (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Who knows just where they'll lead
They shine for you and me (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Celebrate, celebrate, make a toast for love
'Cause we got it, we got it
Celebrate, celebrate, make a toast to us
Woo, ooh

If there's so many other fish in the sea
Why am I so dizzy when you're looking at me?
Ooh-ooh, something's going right
What's the use of keeping track of the time
Knowing I've already lost my mind
Ooh-ooh Feels like paradise

Now I'm losing my resistance
As you take me by the hand

Let's run away my love (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Follow the stars above (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Who knows just where they'll lead
They shine for you and me (Ooh-hoo-ooh)

Live forever in this moment
It don't matter where we're going
Let's run away my love
And after every word is spoken
We go deeper than the ocean
Let's run away my love
Celebrate, celebrate, make a toast for love
'Cause we got it, we got it
Celebrate, celebrate, make a toast to us, whoo-oo
Let's run away my love (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Follow the stars above (Ooh-hoo-ooh)
Who knows just where they'll lead
They shine for you and me (Ooh-hoo-ooh)

Let's run away my love
Follow the stars above
Where they'll lead
They shine for you and me
Let's run away my love
Follow the stars above
Where they'll lead
