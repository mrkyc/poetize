He's got a lo-fi soul, he won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I oughta know
I've got a lo-fi soul, or so I've been told
Taken back by the days of old
Sending chills right to my bones
He's got a lo-fi soul

Ooo, I knew love would feel so old
Don't worry, baby, it's a good thing
I know that you know
The way that you move, well, it speaks to me
It sings to me, it swings with me
And it's all that I need

It started out with just one glance
And quiet gazes, soon enough we finish each others phrases
We just met, yet I've loved you life times before
Familiar feelings, ooo, how I adore

He's got a lo-fi soul, he won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I oughta know
I've got a lo-fi soul, or so I've been told
Taken back by the days of old
Sending chills right to my bones
He's got a lo-fi soul
He's got a lo-fi soul, sending chills right to my bones

It started out with just one glance
And quiet gazes, soon enough we finish each others phrases
We just met, yet I've loved you life times before
Familiar feelings, ooo, how I adore

He's got a lo-fi soul, he won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I oughta know

Sending chills right to my bones
