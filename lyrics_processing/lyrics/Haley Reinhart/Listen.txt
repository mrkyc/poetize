Take me
To a place you have never been
Make me
Feel like I'm breathing again
Paint me
Color me with your inhibitions
Save me
Show me how, things I've been missing

Nothing scares me more
Than losing out on the unknown
Open up the doors
We're stronger together
So wake up

Can you hear the pastor ringing? Yeah they're calling out our names
Can you see the tide is rising? Coming closer every day
You hear me?
You hear me?
You hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear the whistle blowing? Yeah they're calling for a change
Can you feel the sun is getting warmer? There's no time to waste
You hear me?
You hear me?
You hear me?
Can you hear me?
