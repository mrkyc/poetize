Mmm, whoa, whoa
Ohh, oh my, oh my

Hot hot heat between you and me
Mmm, I'm burning up inside
You shock me with your ways
Ain't polite for me to say
Like a firecracker blowin' up the sky

You don't know (You don't know)
You don't see (You don't see)
All this static electricity
And every time you touch me right, it's like
Oh-oh-oh, oh my!
Oh my! (Woo, yeah)
Oh my! (Oh-oh, oh my!)

Sticky skin in the summer night
All this tension is mad
You rock me with your touch
And I'm liking it so much
'Cause you're the best thing I ever had

Uh, she likes the phrases I make up from scratch (Oh)
Uh, She likes my raps
Uh, she like my racks, how they hold up my slacks (Ooh, oh)
She saw me when I snuck in the back - relax
Slapped a couple daps, took a couple photos
Took a few snaps like that, soon as she turned her back (Oh my)
I was gone in a flash, in the blink of an eye
Got a speeding ticket for living my life too fast
I said, "Sorry sorry pretty lady, it's a race against the clock
And I don't like contracts" (Oh my)
So let's make it a night to remember
Before last call, 'nother round, two glasses (Oh)
Shaken not stirred, this is my word
All I need is one night and you 'gon call me fantastic! Ha
