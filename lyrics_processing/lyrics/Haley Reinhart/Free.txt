It's not like I'm invisible
You still wear me under your skin
When we talk, we don't talk at all
Too weak to leave, too stubborn to give in

Who is gonna be the first to say a truce?
It's not enough that we should part can't stop fighting too

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you, and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Well, oh, can't you see? I wanna be, I want you to be, free

It's not like she isn't lovin' you
It's just that you can't be alone for too long
I'd like to wish you all the happiness
Maybe the truth is it will kill me if you move on

Who is gonna be the first to say enough?
Who is gonna be the first one to find true love?

I still need you, and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Well oh, can't you see? I wanna be, I want you to be, free

Let it be, let it be, just a beautiful memory
Anything that starts will have an ending
Let it go, let it go
Yeah, 'cause we both know this will only be over when we're free
Yeah, oh, when we're free
Oh, I know, oh

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you, and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Why can't you see? I wanna be, I want you to be, whoa, free

I wanna be, I want you to be, oh, can we be?
Free
