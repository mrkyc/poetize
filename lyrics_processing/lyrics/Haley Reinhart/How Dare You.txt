Thought I knew
Thought I knew
Thought I knew
Thought I knew

Like a snake in the water
Nothing is what it appears to be
If you've come to bite me once again boy
You've got another thing coming

All my friends come and ask me
Why the hell are you so polite
I tell 'em don't yous worry bout a thing
You see the venom will come and get 'em in good time

Everything I thought I knew
Watched it all go down the drain
Too soon, too soon
All the things you said were true
Weren't true, how dare you
How dare you

There you go playin' the martyr
Down on your knees for all to heed
Gather round down in the quarter
Those wounds, they don't look too real to me

Now your fate is sealed in cellophane
Transparent as the Dead Sea
Nothing can stop you from going under
Once your lies have been set free

Everything I thought I knew
Watch it all go down the drain
Too soon, too soon
All the things you said were true
Weren't true, how dare you

Hey wait, won't you say your sorry
For the things you've done to me
You've done to me
Hey wait, won't you say your sorry
All the things you've done to me
You've done to me
Everything I thought I knew
(Hey wait, won't you say your sorry)
Watch it all go down the drain
(All the things you've done to me)
Too soon, too soon
(You've done to me)
(Hey wait, won't you say your sorry)
All the things you said were true
(All the things you've done to me)
Weren't true
(You've done to me)
How dare you
How dare you
How dare you
How dare you
