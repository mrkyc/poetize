Caught somewhere between a nightmare and a dream
Not sure whose game it is or what it all even means
Not sure who to be, do you want the good or bad of me? Mmm
Not sure what you expect to find
But I'm certain I can change your mind
You ask what kind of girl am I?
Well do you want the good or bad kind?

You know I'd stay, every morning, every evening
Boy I'd stay, just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay, wrap myself around your body, can't let go
Ooh, you make it hot, hot, baby come on

I can be as sweet as a summers day
Forfeit your fantasies once I whisper your name
Here you come running one more time
Mister, do you want the good or bad kind?

You know I'd stay, every morning, every evening
Boy I'd stay, just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay, wrap myself around your body, can't let go
Ooh, you make it hot, hot, baby come on
