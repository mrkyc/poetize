Listen
Do I have to spell it out for you
What part of this don't you understand
It's not the things you say or do
But the way you do
That struck a nerve
It hit a chord baby
Way way deep in the depths of my soul
Hate to break it to you Mister
Do I have to tell you one more time

Didn't your mama tell you not to go
And make things uncomfortable
Don't you know
You're pullin' on my heartstrings baby
It's tearing me apart
And oh you make it impossible
Now I know
This feels like a broken record on a minor chord
Broken record on a minor chord

Woo, you better listen good
Broken record on a minor chord

Mmm, hope you got it all figured out
So let when the sun goes down
You can sleep at night
Without a frown
Whether or not I'm by your side
Just know we're on each other's minds
Oh the bliss you'll find
If we stay aligned
Can I get it through your head
Do I have to say it again and again and again
Come on and tell me!

Didn't your mama tell you not to go
And make things uncomfortable
Don't you know
You're pullin' on my heartstrings baby
It's tearing me apart
And oh you make it impossible
Now I know
This feels like a broken record on a minor chord

Broken record on a minor chord
All I ever wanted was everything
To go silky smooth
(Broken record on a minor chord)
Live in serenity both me and you
Say it!

Didn't your mama tell you not to go
And make things uncomfortable
Don't you know
You're pullin' on my heartstrings baby
It's tearing me apart
And oh you make it impossible
Now I know
This feels like a broken record on a minor chord
