I know everything about you
Ever since we were kids
We never kept secrets
But there's something that you missed
Came up on North Push Street, in between the winter days
Ain't it funny how some things get lost along the way

Just when you thought you got it all so figured out

What you don't know could hurt you
What you don't know could save your life
What you don't know has been right here
If you just open up your eyes
You don't have to believe everything you're told
'Cause to me all your scars are beautiful
What you don't know could hurt you. what you don't know

I know she tore your heart out
Went and threw it on the floor
Don't mean that you're worthless
To me you're something more
Trying to get to your attention
It's like water into wine
Guess ignorance is bliss
And even broken love is blind

Just when you thought you got it all so figured out

What you don't know could hurt you
What you don't know could save your life
What you don't know has been right here
If you just open up your eyes
You don't have to believe everything you're told
'Cause to me all your scars are beautiful
What you don't know could hurt you, what you don't know

I can't sleep at night
Wish you were next to me, more than a friend to me
Can't keep this inside
I need to find a way to tell you everything
Everything that you don't know

 could hurt you
What you don't know could save your life
What you don't know has been right here
If you just open up your eyes
You don't have to believe everything you're told
'Cause to me you're so damn beautiful
What you don't know could hurt you, what you don't know
Can hurt you
