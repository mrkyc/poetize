Wake up to the city sirens
Breathe in the dusty air
Got no A/C but you still have me
Smilin' from ear to ear

Laughin' in the face of chaos
Ask each other what to do
Sure life can be a little messy
But I like gettin' dirty with you

Oh, you and I
Roll with the dice, two of a kind
No, it's not always nice
Can't put a price on our paradise

(Oh la la)
'Cause you're my guy
(Oh la la)
And I'm your girl
(Oh la la)
Livin' lovely lives
(Oh la la)
In this strange world
(Strange, strange world)
In this strange world
(Strange, strange world)

Luxury at its finest
Smirkin' the night away
Sleepin' on silk while we're in shambles
What a silly game to play

Not gonna waste a minute
Tryna make sense of everything
When it comes to making lemonade
Honey you and I could make it all day

Oh, me oh my
If I'm by your side, it turns dark to light
Love, just let it be
And naturally, we'll be just fine

(Oh la la)
'Cause you're my guy
(Oh la la)
And I'm your girl
(Oh la la)
Livin' lovely lives
(Oh la la)
In this strange world
(Strange, strange world)
In this strange world
(Strange, strange world)
Oh, me oh my
If I'm by your side, it turns dark to light
Love, just let it be
And naturally, we'll be just fine

(Oh la la)
