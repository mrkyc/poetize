Hold tight, mama used to say
It's alright, no need to be afraid
Oh confusion, is the damnedest thing
One day you're flying, the next you've lost your wings

But I'm getting tired of all this fronting
It feels like I'm running on empty for nothing

Now I'm telling you, I can take no more
Cause I feel the weight of the world on me
Tell me the truth, that it's not in vain
Broken promises, they can't be saved
To this day, I believe there's no shame
Cause love is worth fighting for

When it takes you, it's the grandest thing
It'll make you, it can break you just the same

But I'm getting tired of all this fronting
It feels like I'm running on empty for nothing

Tell me the truth, that it's not in vain
Broken promises, they can't be saved
To this day, I believe there's no shame
Cause love is worth, love is worth, love is worth fighting for

Tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Can you tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Is it worth fighting for?

Now I'm telling you, I can take no more
Cause I feel the weight of the world on me
Tell me the truth, that it's not in vain
Broken promises, they can't be saved
To this day, I believe there's no shame
Cause love is worth, love is worth, love is worth fighting for
Mmm, I said love is worth, love is worth, love is worth fighting for
Yes I said, I said it, love is worth, love is worth, love is worth fighting for
