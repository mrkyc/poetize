I watch you look at your reflection
On the night you're so pretentious
How do you look, my love?
A silly boy with a porcelain smile
It was fun just for a while
How do you look, my love?

As I'm running for the door
I gotta say

Hey!
I thought you were the one
But this happiness is gone
Wish I could bite my tongue
You never get me
I can't just play along
What was sweet is now so wrong
Watching the tables turn
I'll take the check please
Oooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Oooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Oooh, I gotta get out now
I gotta get out now

Whoa, our future's looking grim now
See the lights are getting dimp now
How do we look, my love?
Ooh, I've got too much on my plate now
And I need some stimulation
How do we look, my love?

As I'm running for the door
I gotta say

Hey!
I thought you were the one
But this happiness is gone
Wish I could bite my tongue
You never get me
I can't just play along
What was sweet is now so wrong
Watching the tables turn
I'll take the check please
Oooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Oooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Oooh, I gotta get out now

I bet you don't even know
All the things that you've done, dude
You're real cute but you're dumb
It's like I don't even know you
I bet you don't even know
All the things that you've done, dude
You're real cute but you're dumb
It's like I don't even know you

As I'm running for the door
