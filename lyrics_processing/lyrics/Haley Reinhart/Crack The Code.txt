Should we throw it all away
Or pick up the pieces we once made
Should we say goodbye today
Or save each other from the pain

Did we build this thing up
Just to break us down
Can we lift each other once again
Can we play this thing out

Can we crack the code again
Can we let love win

Mmm you got me lost in your love (you got me lost in your love)
And I'm spinning round and round and round and round
You got me lost in your love (you got me lost in your love)
And I'm spinning round and round and round and round
Mmm...

Can we grow together babe
Make room for both of us to change
Leave it light like yesterday
And move on to brighter days
