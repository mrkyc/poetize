It was a birthday gift of a Mexican Telecaster
From this day on I will play along
To all my Young Pioneers records
And there will be a poetry
Spoken silently between me and the stereo
I'll work mornings
And you can work through the night

Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it
Across the state line
We might as well lay down and die
'Cause if Florida takes us
We're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from, yeah
Will be the death of us

And I cannot help but hold on
To the handful of times
When what was spoken was a revolution in itself
And what we were doing
Was the only thing that mattered
You might also likeAnd how good it felt
To kill the memory of nights spent
Holding your shirt for the smell
I heard you used to cry
When you made love to him
But this band will play on
'Cause all we can do is what we've always done
And on and on and on

Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it
Across the state line
We might as well lay down and die
Because if Florida takes us
We're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from, yeah
Will be the death of us
Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it
Across the state line
We might as well lay down and die
Because if Florida takes us
We're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from, yeah
Will be the death of us
Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it
Across the state line
We might as well lay down and die
Because if Florida takes us
We're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from, yeah
