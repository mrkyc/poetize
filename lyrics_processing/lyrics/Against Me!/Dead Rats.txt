Pez machine in hand, riding a BMX
Running barefoot through the graveyard
Drawing pentagrams on tombstones
Her bloodbath visions are for him, not me
And I'm just living in your house
Sleeping in your bed
It was a nice dream, but it was a naive fucking fantasy
Two thousand pricks stabbed into my back
Well, there are certain words I won't ever believe again
Is that all it means to you?
A little push and a little screw?
Smoke it down to the last match
There's nothing here worth left to say
And I'm just living in your house
Sleeping in your bed
It was a nice dream, but it was a naive fucking fantasy
I'm just living in your house
Sleeping in your bed
It was a nice dream, but it was a naive fucking fantasy
Dear succubus, I miss you more than the rest
But there's a little bit less to find each time I look back
In the eaves of your attic, I know how to haunt
Shallow graves for all dead rats
I like the dark clouds the best

I'm just living in your house
Just sleeping in your bed
It was a nice dream, but it was a naive fucking fantasy
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves for all dead rats, I like the dark clouds the best
Shallow graves, dead rats
Shallow graves, dead rats
Shallow graves, dead rats
