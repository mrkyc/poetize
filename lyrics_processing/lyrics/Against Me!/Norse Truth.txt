Hard cocks, hard cunts
Line 'em up
Walking on broken glass while holding my breath
I wouldn't dare step on a single crack
Dig up your bones out of the graves in our homes
If you're looking for revenge, well here's a fucking pound of flesh
Just because I can intellectualize it doesn't mean I feel it in my chest
Just because I can taste it, doesn't mean I sink my teeth into it
Always dogs running, always dogs
They're just grinding down axes to the last cigarette
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
But it wasn't
Come on, shape shift with me!
What have you got to lose?
Fuck it!

Christ fucker, rape me
Unwashed and unclean, these statements sounded true to me
We used to be cocaine and xanax
Now, a kiss isn't worth the lipstick
There once was love, there now is nothing
The easiest way to untangle a knot
Just forget I was here, cut me out of your heart
Your body's not a stranger to me
How can I look you in the eyes when I have known you so very intimately?
New drawers for new secrets, new withouts to sleep with
I practiced detachment to perform numbness as art
You're free to do nothing, go ahead and rot
Menthol crush, you have faded from me
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
But it wasn't
Always starts with Galaga in a bar and ends in a broken heart
Last cock you sucked to the last cunt you fucked, I'm forever your girl
Please, please, please, say that you love me
All the places that we never went, all the things we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
All the places that we never went, all the things we never had
Want 'em back now, want 'em all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
Wanted our love to be more real than all the rest
