You've gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're comin' with me

I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinkin' of things that I just can't abide

I know the roads down which your life will drive
(Which your life will drive)
I'll find the key that lets you slip inside
(Lets you slip inside)
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
(Not behind the door)
But, you know, I think I recognise your face
But I've never seen you before
