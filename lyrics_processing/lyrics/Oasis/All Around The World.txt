It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I wanna be
I don't believe in everything I see
You know I'm blind so why d'you disagree?

Take me away
'Cause I just don't wanna stay
And the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days
But they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard
You know it's gonna be okay

What you gonna do when the walls come falling down?
You never move, you never make a sound
And where you gonna swim with the riches that you found?
If you're lost at sea, well, I hope that you drowned
You might also like
Take me away
'Cause I just don't wanna stay
And the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days
But they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

All around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
And all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be okay
