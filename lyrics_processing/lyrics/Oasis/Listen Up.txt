Listen up, what's the time?
Said today I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day, there's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think
And the words they won't let you say

One fine day gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad if I had more time

Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic, life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own

Listen up, what's the time?
Said today I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day, there's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think
And the words they won't let you say
You might also like
One fine day gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad if I had more time

Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic, life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own


Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic, 'cause life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
