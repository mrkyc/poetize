I'm a far away traveller
I travel alone
Searching in the mist
For what I know exists for me
Out there

Solitary awaits me out there
I know she will
She was there before the rain
Before these dunes, before they made
The pyramids

Oh, it's been so long
Have I finally found the road to lead home?

The moon was low, and the road dusty
When I was captured by some thieves, my pockets empty
And I said: "You'll have to kill me
To cut this jewel out of me
So let me go"

Stopped at the next bar for a neat drink
Across from where I sat a man gazed at me
He looked just like James Dean
On the silver screen, our eyes did meet
And he winked at me
See Black Country, New Road LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also like
Is this the one?
Have I finally found the man to lead home?
"Will you help me and my horses on our way
Through night and day?"

Oh, I can see my destination on the line
And if the stars are aligned
Not gonna be a next time
I'll check him as he's sleeping
Can never trust a man who's drinking whiskey at the bar alone
His arm's around your waist
And your hair is blowing in the wind and it felt alright
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And on that second night he came for me
He took a knife out of his boot and silently I learned the truth
He was a liar
A leech and a beggar
And through the embers
I watched him kill my horses
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
River, river take me
Down to the waterfall
Won't come back at all
Just let me fall
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah
