I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Oh, look at me now, ah, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
Oh, there's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Oh yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know, ah, that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
Mamma mia, even if I say
"Bye-bye", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
"Bye-bye" doesn't mean forever
Oh, Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you? Oh yeah
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Oh yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
