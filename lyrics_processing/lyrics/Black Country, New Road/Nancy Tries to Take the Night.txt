There's a time and a place and the place it is now
Take the smile off your face when you're dressed like a cow
When you're frolicking round, legs in the air
Smile on your face but it's covered in hair
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

You run through the streets like the whore that you are
And you hope pretty soon you'll be struck by the car
But the light of the day tries to keep you afloat
While there's pain in your stomach and pain in your throat
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

Mother would you take me, and on, and on
For I have nothing, no more baby, she's gone, and on
(3, 4)

I tried to take your word on what you said
I tried to take the word but the word was dead
I did not want it
And in the light of day it all seemed well
Or was it just a dream, she could not tell
With how she wanted it?

There's a time and a place and the place it is now
Take that smile off your face when you're dressed like a cow
When you're frolicking round with your legs in the air
Smile on your face but it's covered in hair
Do you want it? Oh
Do you want it? Oh

Just imagine a life with a baby and wife
What the times would look like when compared to the night
But the money's not there so you sit in despair
Curse at the sky when the quiet's not there
Do you want it? Oh now
Do you want it? Oh

For after all, the autumn eve lead to a fate no-one believed
Taken to the table where she wrote, she held herself a vote
A vote between the good and bad, with all she'd seen and all she'd had
Nancy tried to take the night, but now she's gone removed from sight

And now oh, mother would you take me, and on, and on
For I have nothing but my baby, she's gone, and on
If I could take it back now
Would I take it back now?
If he could take it (yeah) back (mm) now
Would he take it all back now?
