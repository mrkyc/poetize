Get raw with the fever on the dance floor

Now who got the fever for the flav'
Who can dig da way that I flex on a track
I'm causin' rampage
Ricky Rick on point wid da 9-5 style from ma lips
They'll be rollin' da mad joints
So put ya hands in da air
Coz there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer
And we can get our fever on
I'm wid it, so let me put my big brown beaver on
I'm comin' wid da disco
I can flip so
I'm a drop the solo tip
Somethin' for da honeys in da crowd
Lend me yar ear so I can turn the party out
Til tomorrow afternoon
'cause when I grips ma steel, no one leaves da room
So tell me can you feel the
Mad skills comin' wid da fever fever fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah-ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
You might also like
Step to the side
You'd better run and hide
Move to the side
Everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody's in da house
We had to run this back
So you can break ya flares out
N-Trance and da only one
We got it goin' on
So let me get ma flowin' on
It's a blast from the past and ya heard o'
Me and da boyz comin' down wid murder
And its gotta be the way
Everybody wants to make a move so just party
And we can have a jam
So get ya move on, I'm a take this groove and slam
Flip it how we want it flipped
From da back to the front when I drops me the manuscript
'cause I got da moves
And I'm always done ma flow with the crazy crazy grooves
So tell me can you feel the
Mad skills comin' wid da fever, fever, fever
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah-ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Step to the side
You'd better run and hide
Move to the side
Everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody in da house come on an let me hear ya say "Ho" (Ho!)
Everybody in da house come on an let me hear ya say "Ho ho" (Ho ho!)
Everybody in da house come on an let me hear ya say "Ho" (Ho!)
Everybody in da house come on an let me hear ya say "Ho ho ho" (Ho ho ho!)

It's about time everybody in da house
Bust a move to ma vicious raw rhymes
Ricky Rick on a tip wid ma boys
Bringin' disco noise as I drop da wickedness
Gettin' sharp wid da flow
We took a Bee Gees loop and broke it down like Lego
A disco lick that's deeper
'cause we gotta get wid da fever, fever, fever
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah-ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
