You should see my (Smile)
You should see my
You should see my

I remember when you told me I could never fly
Try to crush my dreams, self esteem once wide
Like a high uppercut, got a black eye
But he knows, don't you know girls don't cry?
Not the girls like me, we get even
Pack it up, ship it out, spring cleaning
Well, I'll be honest, it was hard to see you leaving
Then I remembered what a douche you've been being

I let this go too damn long, forward turn to a sad country song
Now look who's crawling back tryna suck my dick, damn
Apologies, man, get off you knees, stand
"Why'd I treat you this way?" that's all you can say
Try to stop calling, I'ma keep doing me, yeah

You should see my hair
You should see my heart
You should see me now
You should see my style
You should see my money
See my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
I know you want it again
You should see my hair
You should see my skin
And in every city
Go to see my name
You should see me happy
With my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
You should see my smile

Now  and I was puking up
And just the thought of you or mention of your name and ugh
I could barely eat 
Was who you fuckin', who you lovin', who you kissin' on?
Does she dress like me? Is she good enough?
Does she do it like me? Is she real rough?
Well, I can tell you, nothing better than your hotdog
I got a craving every morning when I'm waking up

I  opened my eyes
Rolled out of bed
And I stepped outside
Yup, I see the sun still shines
Stared straight at it 'til I stung my eyes
Now I'm out on my funk
No more bags in my trunk
And Lord gave me a chunk
Now I'm 'bout to take a bite

You should see my hair
You should see my heart
You should see me now
You should see my style
You should see my money
See my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
I know you want it again
You should see my hair
You should see my skin
And in every city
Go to see my name
You should see me happy
With my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
You should see my smile
And still I get a million dollar bill when I smile
Sticking my flag on those hills for a while
Singing A to the N to the J-U-L-I-E
'Member me, 'cause you will soon see my smile
Everywhere, from the Wall Street
Girl, cash it to your best friends
Screensave it, can't escape
Every face that you see is the face of me
You should, you should, you should, you should see my smile
You should see my smile, you should see my, you should see my

You should see my hair
You should see my heart
You should see me now
You should see my style
You should see my money
See my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
I know you want it again
You should see my hair
You should see my skin
And in every city
Go to see my name
You should see me happy
With my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
You should see my smile
You should see my hair
You should see my heart
You should see me now
You should see my style
You should see my money
See my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
You should see my smile
You should see my hair
You should see my skin
And in every city
Go to see my name
You should see me happy
With my new boyfriend
You should see my smile
