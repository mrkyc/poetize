Smell your sweat, feel your blood pumping like fire
Breathe you in, breathe you out
Taste you like wine
Is it me getting hot or are the stars burnin' the black sky tonight?

You're in my brain, in my skin, makes me wanna (Ah)
You're in the air, push you in, makes me wanna (Ah)
It's all I crave, I bleed that fatal kind of (Ah)
That fatal kind of (Ah), f-f-fatal kind of

If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
I would give you my last

Yeah, lying there, steal the kiss, got you all my
Eyes lock, got me by the throat and thigh
You're the king of my jungle
Every day and night I can feel my heart throb
You might also like
Say my name, whisper it, makes me wanna (Ah)
Wearing no clothes, this is it, makes me wanna (Ah)
It's all I crave, I bleed that fatal kind of (Ah)
That fatal kind of (Ah), f-f-fatal kind of

If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
I would give you my last

I would die for this
I would die for you
Would you die for it?
Would you die for me too?

If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
If you were falling
Somewhere down to a fast death
If you were drowning
I would give you my last breath
I would give you my last
I would give you my last
