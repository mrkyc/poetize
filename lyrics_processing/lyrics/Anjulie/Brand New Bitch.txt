Don't need your sad face, sorry, baby
But I made up my mind, I made up my mind
Don't need a re-run, been there done, done
You're still back in time, you're back in time

Yeah, I know that the sex was good
I remember I was showing you what to do, yeah, yeah
Up against the walls, bathroom stalls
Boo, I was so fucking blind, so fucking blind
And now I'm singing

Oh-oh, been feeling so fly since you've been gone
My face to the sky, sunglasses on
Turnin' up the beat, so sick
I'm like a brand new bitch
Oh-oh, been feeling so fly since you've been gone
My face to the sky, sunglasses on
Turnin' up the beat, so sick
I'm like a brand new bitch

Don't need a rescue, it's all good
Baby, I been hittin' my stride, hittin' my stride
I got my red lipstick on, engine's revving
You're so far behind and I'm taking mine
You might also like
Yeah, I know that you (Ah) me good
I remember it, I showed you a thing or two, yeah, yeah
Got the wind on my back, look at me, yeah
Bet you thought I'd never survive, well, I'm still alive
And now I'm singing

Oh-oh, been feeling so fly since you've been gone
My face to the sky, sunglasses on
Turnin' up the beat, so sick
I'm like a brand new bitch
Oh-oh, been feeling so fly since you've been gone
My face to the sky, sunglasses on
Turnin' up the beat, so sick
I'm like a brand new bitch

I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand new
I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand, brand
Turnin' up the, turnin' up the, turnin' up the beat, so sick
I'm like a brand new bitch
You wouldn't recognize me
Steady now that frown on your face
Nothing like I used to be, be, be
And now I'm singing
Oh-oh, been feeling so fly since you've been gone
My face to the sky, sunglasses on
Turnin' up the beat, so sick (Yup, yup)
I'm like a brand new bitch

I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand new
I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand, brand
Turnin' up the, turnin' up the, turnin' up the beat, so sick (Yup, yup)
I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand new
I'm like a, I'm like a, I'm like a brand, brand
Turnin' up the, turnin' up the, turnin' up the beat, so sick
