I'm barely holdin' on
To all the things I knew so well
Worried about my mental health
And you
Got it all figured out
You know just how to 'em last
Don't get too caught up in the past
You probably think I'm the one
Just 'cause I look good on your arm
You're takin' me home to your parents
Talkin' 'bout marriage
Passin' the carrots
You give me this funny feelin' it's gon' be alright
You put up with all the twisted bullshit in my mind
You know that I'm prone to runnin' every single time
You fuck with me even though I
Might fuck up your life, oh I
Could really, really fuck up your life, oh I
Might fuck up your life
Could really, really fuck up your life
But I really hope I don't, no
You might also likeChange
All of the friends I had
Too many vultures on the deck
Beggin' and breathin' down my neck
Love
Love is a losing game
I knew the fairy tale was fake
The minute you said forever, babe

You give me this funny feelin' it's gon' be alright
You put up with all the twisted bullshit in my mind
You know that I'm prone to runnin' every single time
You fuck with me even though I
Might fuck up your life, oh I
Could really, really fuck up your life, oh I
Might fuck up your life
Could really, really fuck up your life
But I really hope I don't, no
Used to wake up and be gone
So good with bein' on my own
Don't need no mans takin' care of me, yeah
Don't throw my love on the blade
Not runnin' out, I'll just stay
Here for a little bit longer, babe
But you give me this funny feelin', ah yeah
But you give me this funny feelin', ah yeah
You give me this funny feelin' it's gon' be alright
You put up with all the twisted bullshit in my mind
You know that I'm prone to runnin' every single time
You fuck with me even though I
Might fuck up your life, oh I
Could really, really fuck up your life, oh I
Might fuck up your life
Could really, really fuck up your life
