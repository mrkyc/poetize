I'm getting caught up in him but I don't wanna
I'm getting off track and I can't control a thing, a thing
I'm telling myself it's not a good idea
But the more I hesitate the more I fall for him
I'm tryin' to erase his face from my memory
And then a boom shalaka, he's walkin' up to me
Boom shalaka, he starts to talk to me
Boom shalaka, my heart skips
Boom shalaka laka, boom, boom
The more I hang there the more I get wrapped up in him
Imagine myself in the chair I was sittin' in
And every little thing he said comin' back to me, to me
The more I get scared of losin' I'm afraid to say
Where can I go? At the same time it excites me
Gotta get him outta my head, get on with me
And then a boom shalaka, he's walkin' up to me
Boom shalaka, he starts to talk to me
Boom shalaka, my heart skips a boom
Shalaka laka, boom, boom

Boom shalaka, starin' me down talk
Boom shalaka, my heart skips
Boom shalaka laka, ah
He make my head go boom, boom
He make my breath go shaka laka
And then my heart goes boom, boom
And everything goes shaka laka
I tell myself, no I'm not gonna do this
I promise myself, no I'm not gonna do this
Doesn't matter what he says
I know he's no good for me, no, no, no, no
And then a boom shalaka, he's walkin' up to me
Boom shalaka, he starts to talk to me
Boom shalaka, my heart skips
Boom shalaka laka, boom, boom
Boom shalaka, eyes come in contact
Boom shalaka, starin' me down talk
Boom shalaka, my heart skips
Boom shalaka laka, ah, ah
He makes my heart go, ah, ah
