Well I don't know just how to tell you this
In a telephone call from so far
That I'm never coming back
Say you don't understand
One day you'll understand
Why, I'm never coming back
Some other mother please believe
Like I believed in you for everything
I tried and tried again but I never could conceive
What you wanted so so badly
Now I'm drowning in my dreams
And I don't know just where I'm going but they

They don't know me yet
(The day will soon come)
They don't know my best
(The day will soon come)
Sure as the sun has set
The day will soon come
Yeah, the day the day the day will soon come

And what I really want
I really really want
Is what I haven't got yet
That's what I really want
Am I the only one
Don't everybody want
To try to get get get
What they've been dreaming of
Some people say
I don't know my way
I can't find my place
And my dreams are much too big
For the head they're in
When you gonna give it all up?
Say I'm stranded in my own world
I'm going nowhere
I thought you knew me better
You might also like
They don't know me yet
(The day will soon come)
They don't know my best
(The day will soon come)
Sure as the sun has set
The day will soon come
Yeah, the day the day the day will soon come

My baby is crying
Said he can't compete
With all the fire in my belly
And the fire is rousing
To the words I speak
Barely express the thing I mean so deep
Boy I hear what you've been playing at your radio
But I've been bumping something special through my head-head phones
You can say I'm dumb
Say what I'm doing is wrong
Say it at the top of your lungs
Boy don't you underestimate me

They don't know me yet
(The day will soon come)
They don't know my best
(The day will soon come)
Sure as the sun has set
The day will soon come
Yeah, the day the day the day will soon come
The day the day the day the day the day the day the day the day
The day will soon come (The day will soon come)
Demand the days and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait
The day will soon come (The day will soon come)
The day the day the day the day the day the day the day the day
The day will soon come
