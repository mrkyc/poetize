You were my BFF-F
You were my butterscotch
The best I ever had-had
You love me, love me hard
Introduce you to my friends
You're looking starstruck
You're morally retarded
Looks like you just got caught

You don't want love
You don't want friends
You just want money
You just want head
You don't want love
You don't want friends
Look out behind you
It's Karma Bitch

It's creaking up from the floor
It's breaking through the cracks
Banging down your bedroom door
You'd better move fast
You're crying up like a baby
Calling to apologize
Take back all that shit you said
'Bout time you realized

Uh huh uh uh-uh uh uh

It's Karma Bitch

It's been a long time
Since I needed
Anythin', anyone, done dreaming
I was stupid, incomplete and
Opened up, let you in
And along the way, I lost the way
Look behind you, Catching up now
Watch your back, watch your back

It's Karma Bitch!
Did you think you'd get away with it?
Uh huh uh uh-uh uh uh
Uh huh uh uh-uh uh uh oh
It's Karma Bitch
