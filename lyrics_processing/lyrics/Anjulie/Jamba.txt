(Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba)

Gonna teach you a brand new dance
Gonna make you work off those pants
Put your hand there do it like that
In the backyard on the grass
In the club on your boyfriends' lap
Barefoot now shake it like that
It's not a hip-hop video scene
It's not about choreography
Let yourself go, let yourself free

Up, down, turn around Jamba Jamba
Bend down, touch the ground Jamba Jamba
Doesn't matter if you in the Yoga Jamba
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
Let your hair down go Jamba Jamba
Listen to the beat go bomba bomb
Feel it in the beat yeah, bomba bomb
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
(Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba)

Gather around this camp fire
Hail to the power higher
Let your body be inspired
Can't do it in your tight tight pants
Let your belly out clap those hands
An out-of-body experience
You might also like
Up, down, turn around Jamba Jamba
Bend down, touch the ground Jamba Jamba
Doesn't matter if you in the Yoga Jamba
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
Let your hair down go Jamba Jamba
Listen to the beat go bomba bomb
Feel it in the beat yeah, bomba bomb
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba

Shake it off shake it off with me
Want too everybody-body
Like a fishy fresh out the sea
Shake it off shake it off with me
Want too everybody-body
Like a fishy freash out the sea

Up, down, turn around Jamba Jamba
Bend down, touch the ground Jamba Jamba
Doesn't matter if you in the Yoga Jamba
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
Let your hair down go Jamba Jamba
Listen to the beat go bomba bomb
Feel it in the beat yeah, bomba bomb
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
Kick your legs out say Jamba Jamba
Doesn't matter which way Jamba Jamba
Lack around just stay straight Jamba Jamba
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
Turn them like mall truck Jamba Jamba
Sweet like Jamaican Rumba rum
Stir it like your power with your Bumba bum
Jamba Jamba, Jamba Jamba
