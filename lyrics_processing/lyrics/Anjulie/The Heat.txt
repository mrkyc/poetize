I can't sleep, can't dream, wake up every night
Chills runnin' down my spine, my fever is so high
The thought of you and I got the
Boy, you don't know what it's like, it looks like
It feels like, acts like, taking on a life
Oh, it all started in my mind
It spreads to my insides, it's takin' over my body
I got the heat, see the red in my cheeks
It's suffocating me, got the hot, hot heat
She got the heat from her head to her feet
She tried to shake it, shake it, shake it
But she just can't beat the
Here comes the heat like a fire in me
Burnin' up through my blood, got the hot, hot heat
He got the heat and he put it on me
Like a spell from the devil, now I just can't beat, heat
See the fire in my eyes but don't stare
Don't look too long or boy you might catch fire
Say you don't mind if it eats you alive
If it pokes out your eyes, you come close
You're playin' with fire
You might also likeSee the changes in your touch it's a rush
The passion in your blood bubbling up
Ooh, a crush can't touch this lust, boy
I got the heat, see the red in my cheeks
It's suffocating me, got the hot, hot heat
She got the heat from her head to her feet
She tried to shake it, shake it, shake it
But she just can't beat the
Here comes the heat like a fire in me
Burnin' up through my blood, got the hot, hot heat
He got the heat and he put it on me
Like a spell from the devil, now I just can't beat, heat
Burning, I'm burning up
Burning up, burning up, can't beat the heat
Burning, I'm burning up
Burning up, burning up for your love
Burning, I'm burning up
Here comes the heat
Burning, I'm burning up
Burning up, burning up for your love
I think it's something in the air, it's out there
She got it, he got it, you got it, I got it bad
Got me walkin' in circles, seeing in purple
Saying ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, oh
Got me spinnin' in a spell, I'm not well
I'm at home listening to Nina Simone
Boy, you're so contagious how much more can I take of this
Takin' over my body
I got the heat, see the red in my cheeks
It's suffocating me, got the hot, hot heat
She got the heat from her head to her feet
She tried to shake it, shake it, shake it
But she just can't beat the
Here comes the heat like a fire in me
Burnin' up through my blood, got the hot, hot heat
He got the heat and he put it on me
Like a spell from the devil, now I just can't beat, heat
I got the heat, can't beat the heat
She got the heat, can't beat the heat
He got the heat, can't beat the heat
