You're getting lost in my eyes
I wish it wouldn't feel so right
It's making me quiver and making me moan
It's not about black and white
It's not about how you tried
It's not about what your wife's like
So hot it shivers whenever you're close
Feel my body wave
Feel your body wave
Push me and I play
I don't ever stay the night but I'll stay with you
You say she's on her way home
You say she's on her way home
And if she happens to come home
And if she happens to come home
Gimme one more minute alone
Baby, I'm not ready to go
Keep your clothes off
I'm not rushing out like some dumb whore
Gimme one more minute with you
'Cause it's time you tell her the truth
Let's just hold up
I'm not running out like some dumb whore
You might also likeTrying hard to resist
Trying not to let your lips
Come too close to my lips
It's making me quiver whenever you're close
It's not about black and white
It's not about how you tried
It's not about what your wife's like
So hot it shivers whenever you're close
Feel my body wave
Feel your body wave
Push me and I play
I don't ever stay the night but I'll stay with you
You say she's on her way home
You say she's on her way home
And if she happens to come home
And if she happens to come home
Gimme one more minute alone
Baby, I'm not ready to go
Keep your clothes off
I'm not rushing out like some dumb whore
Gimme one more minute with you
'Cause it's time you tell her the truth
Let's just hold up
I'm not running out like some dumb whore
Feel my body wave
Feel your body wave
