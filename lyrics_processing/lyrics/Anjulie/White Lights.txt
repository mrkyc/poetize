Love songs, limousines
Never could cut my heart, my heart
Wish it was make-believe
Crawl around in the dark, the dark

I'm burning, I'm bleeding, I'm feening
When I go fill my cup, my cup
I'm chasing, I'm searching, I'm yearning
Never can get enough, enough

I got a new school, old soul
Never can knock it out, it out
Who's cool, what's cold
I don't want care about, about

I'm burning, I'm bleeding, I'm feening
I'm yearning, I'm searching for something
I'm twisted, I'm turning, I'm tempted (Tempted, tempted)
I wanna go, go, go, go, go

Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna go, go, go, go, go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white
Where the white
You might also like
I got a new school, old soul
Never can knock it out, it out
New phase, time shows
I don't want hang around, around

I'm burning, I'm feening, I'm leaving
I'm waiting, I'm searching for something
I'm twisted, I'm hungry, I'm tempted (Tempted, tempted)
I wanna go, go, go, go, go

Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna go, go, go, go, go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white
Where the white

Falling fast and I'm not afraid, no, not afraid, no, not afraid now
I'm built to last
See the ground come, ground come close
I can't change it now
It's too late, too late to save me from my fear
I wanna go, go, go, go, go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna go, go, go, go, go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white lights go
Where the white
