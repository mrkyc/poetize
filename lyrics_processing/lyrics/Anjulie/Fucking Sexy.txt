Everything I do is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I am is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I got is fucking sexy, yeah
All that I'm about is fucking sexy, sexy
Everything I do is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I am is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I got is fucking sexy, yeah

Something 'bout me and my aura
Got to, got to, got to know

Cut my hair, dye it green
Couldn't care less what you think
Rip my dress, think I'm sweaty

Baby, I'm no primadonna

Make them fly, no pijamas
Look like they boujie too
How I rock, traffic stop, keep on, keep on looking
Cold as ice, don't think twice, keep on, keep on looking
You could fake it 'til you make it
But you're never gonna got it like I got it
'Cause I got it for real
Try to fight it, try to fight it
I could cut it up a hundred bits, pure as hell

Everything I do is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I am is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I got is fucking sexy, yeah
All that I'm about is fucking sexy, sexy
Everything I do is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I am is fucking sexy, yeah
Everything I got is fucking sexy, yeah
