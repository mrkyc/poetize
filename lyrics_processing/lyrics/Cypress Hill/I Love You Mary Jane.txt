Look who's back on the program
Hookin' up another fly joint
When I flow on the slow jam
When I shift I kick the gift
Like a fat drunk and I light up a fat spliff
Take a whiff! Can you smell that in the air
When I'm smokin' up the building from everywhere
Shit I still get down so just sit down
When my thought starts clownin'
Time to skip town when
Yet I go wrong I got to hit my bong
Later on then I'll be getting high all along
I got a friend named Mary Jane
And she makes me feel strange
Now I've got to call out her name

Can I call mari-juana
If you wanna party
Well, shit, I'm gonna as soon as she comes
Around to my neighborhood
Damn and she always smells good
Let me make this understood
Are you experienced
Have you ever been experienced
Not for the lightweight... make you delirious
Why is the room spinnin'?
I can't stop!
Now I must have been drinking
Cause this ain't pot
That's doing me like this
I feel ill, now I'm calling out to Mary
Cause I just can't deal
I love you, Mary Jane
Sugar come by and get me high
I love you, Mary Jane
Sugar come by and get me high
I love you, Mary Jane
