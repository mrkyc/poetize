Riding on up of you
What I do, what I do ooh-oh
How we do, how we move, who are you show me your soul-ul
So.. strip of the pole oh
We don't want no more (we don't want no more)
I've been having on coming home, coming home (on coming home)
Devil sin, leave him all alone, all alone
Thinking it's time that I'm coming home, coming home

See you on a taller
I've been on a hallow, I've been on a hallow back
See it on a caller
Said that imma call her
I've been on a callin' back
Don't you doubt me, man
I don't want you back, I don't buy my friends
I don't wanna lie, I don't play pretend
You should keep tapping only twice and than I
Thought you're everything that I had
Gave you everything that you want then you ask
Said that you wanna come with me
Maybe you're keeping me busy, oh
Take me back to the road
I'ma about to give you the biggest damn show
I'm about to lay it all on the lane
Oh I'll go, I'll go my way way way
In the middle of the night
I'll call you back, would you up, would you ride
I'll come be by your side, by your side
Now you wanna lie, would you lie lie lie lie lie
Now I'm wide-awake
Violet sky fit me right away
Thinking I might fly, let me fly away
Going back class, I'll be miles away, ooh
Now you cut me down
Miss my call, show me round, roll me round, round, round
Said you hold me down, will you down down down
Say you love me now any how
(Now, now would you love me now)
You might also like
Riding on up of you
What I do, what I do ooh-oh
How we do, how we move, who are you show me your soul-ul
Strip of the pole
We don't want no more (we don't want no more)
I've been having on coming home, coming home
Devil sin, leave him all alone, all alone
Thinking it's time that I'm coming home, coming home

Riding on up of you
What I do, what I do ooh-oh
How we do, how we move, who are you show me your soul-ul
Strip of the pole
We don't want no more (we don't want no more)
I've been having on coming home, coming home
Devil sin, leave him all alone, all alone
