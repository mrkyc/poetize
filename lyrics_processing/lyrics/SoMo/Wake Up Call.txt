She been watchin'
See me poppin'
She want me to
Save her
See me havin'
Seen it happen
And she want me to
Save her

Why you wanna wait 'til I change
Why you wanna wait 'til I'm way up
Why you wanna lose to the game
I didn't wanna choose to be player

Wow, now I'm on a flight
Now I'm tryna keep my circle tight
Now you're tryna bite
Now you want me to be in your life

You think that it's time for it all
I think that it's time for a wake up call
You might wanna change how I'm logged
You can lock me in under wake up call
You might also like
She been watchin'
See me poppin'
She want me to
Save her
See me havin'
Seen it happen
And she want me to
Save her

Is it really love or pretend
Do you want my heart just to share my wins
Will you be at home when I'm sick
Do you wanna fuck just to say you did

Now I'm on a flight
Now I'm tryna keep my circle tight
Now you're tryna bite
Now you want me to be in your life

You think that it's time for it all
I think that it's time for a wake up call
You might wanna change how I'm logged
You can lock me in under wake up call
She been watchin'
See me poppin'
She want me to
Save her
See me havin'
Seen it happen
And she want me to
Save her

I'm ashamed
I tried your way
My mind has changed
Right away
Recognized your face
From miles away
You just want the prize
Didn't pay the price
You would rather die
Giving love away
Out here tellin' lies
I think it's your pride
You should save those
Cries for another day
You think that it's time for it all
I think that it's time for a wake up call
You might wanna change how I'm logged
You can lock me in under wake up call

She been watchin'
See me poppin'
She want me to
Save her
See me havin'
Seen it happen
And she want me to
Save her
She been watchin'
See me poppin'
She want me to
Save her
See me havin'
Seen it happen
And she want me to
Save her
Save her
