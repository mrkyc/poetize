Girl, are the lights low?
Would you just tell me?
Am I just dreamin'?
I must've fell asleep, oh, no

Sleepin' alone's when you come alive
When you come alive
But you say you've had enough
Say what you want
Don't you lie to me
Don't you hide from me
Girl, don't you go coverin' up
I been doing things
Insinuating I've been on the run
Yeah, we've been on the run
We gon' do things
Let's evaluate
Think we've seen it all
Think I've woken up

But that's when you call
You were hesitatin'
You're all
You've been steady, wait
I've been sitting by the fire, wait
Girl I was burnin' up, wait
I've been doing things a lot
Never get pity for
I've been thinking to myself
I've been sleeping by myself
Is it just a dream, dream?
Thinking time will tell

You know when you read about me in the bedroom
Know that it don't have a thing on us
Know that it don't have a thing on you
I wish this upon a star that we'll go far
You could go jump up in any car
But you picked mine, what's up
You can do anything that you put your mind on
Oh, oh, whoa

Then I come back and you run your mouth

You start yellin' that you're jugglin' (Oh, wow)
You da thought you been smugglin' (Wow)
How we gonna make ends meet? (Oh)
