I don't wanna hold you too long
Yeah, I know you gotta get going
I don't wanna hold it against you
But I want you holding on
Tell me all the things that you been through
You don't gotta tell me too much
I just wanna know what you're into
Tell me, baby, is it so wrong

Yeah, whoa
Whatcha want, you leaving or what? 
Stay when you want, leave when you want
I can see it in your eyes, you're leavin' tomorrow
I can order a ride and you can stay 'til the morning
And you know I got the key, but the doors stay open
For you, for you, oh-oh, oh
For you, for you

Slow rider
Rough side first
There's no words for a touch like hers
Say that you'll stay all night
Bathe in my touch all right
Tell me all the things you like (hmm)
But you gotta stay all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
All the nights, all the nights, all the night, all my life
You might also like
Yeah, whoa
Whatcha want, you leaving or what?
Stay when you want, leave when you want
I can see it in your eyes, you're leavin' tomorrow
I can order a ride and you can stay 'til the morning
And you know I got the key, but the doors stay open
For you, for you, oh-oh, oh
For you, for you

I can tell by the way that you walk
I can tell by the way that you talk
I can tell by the way that you move
I can tell by the way that you drop
You wanna rock with me all through the night
Stay with me every single night
Play with me all through the night
Just stay with me, girl, oh, stay with me here all night

Yeah, whoa
Whatcha want, you leaving or what?
Stay when you want, leave when you want
All night long, all night long
I can order a ride and you can stay 'til the morning
And you know I got the key, but the doors stay open
For you
