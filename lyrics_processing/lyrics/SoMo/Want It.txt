Got you tied up in the sheets
The darker side of fantasy
Yeah, you'll get exactly what you need
Feel the pressure rising when you breathe
Don't take your eyes off of me
Only know you're alive when you bleed

'Cause I love the way you want it
I don't wanna stop ya
If I'm being honest
I think I'm gonna hurt ya
And you gotta know I got this
I don't wanna stop yet
Know I love the way you want it

Got you feeling like
Oh...

G-got me feeling like

If I'm being honest
I think I'm gonna hurt ya
And you gotta know I got this
I don't wanna stop yet
Know I love the way you want it
