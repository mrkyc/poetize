Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for
There's a room full of singers
What you following me for
This ain't a fucking singalong
So girl what you singing for
It's cuz we're blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(The Loft)
They see my brain melting
And the only thing I tell em
Is that I'm living for the present
And the future don't exist
So baby take your clothes off
A chance like this
You may never get to show off
Show off, show off but tonight
(Wicked Games)
I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
You might also like(High For This)
You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
(Next)
You just want me 'cuz I'm next
You just want me 'cuz I'm next, baby
You just want me 'cuz I'm next
(The Birds Part 1)
So don't you fall in love with a singa like me like me
Don't make me make you fall in love
With a singa like me like me
(The Initiation)
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high then
(High For This)
Open your hand
Take a glass
Don't be scared
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me girl
You wanna be high for this
(Rolling Stone)
Getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yea I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'mma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note
(The Morning)
Oh but until thennn
I'm screaming all that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be folding
Girl put in work girl girl put in work
Girl put in work
(The Fall)
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
(The Knowing)
I swear it's okay
Cause I know everything
I know everything
(Same Old Song)
Bet you miss me now baby bet you'd kiss me now baby..
But now you're the same old song
