Verse 1:
Back then I was a college kid
Big man on campus running all of it
Started seeing you around all the clubs bars and shit
Red chucks and jeans on too cool to be bothered with
Damn, you were on a power trip
And you knew that you could have me if you wanted cause I already dropped the hint
So you were playing hard to get
I knew the game so I played along with it
I knew the game didn't drop the ball with it
I knew the way I had to get involved with it
I knew you weren't fallin' for that drama shit
So I played it cool sat back and calmed my shit
And then I sang a song and did my thing when you came home with me
And we got together I never felt better we'll face any weather oh
