We just hit that
In full throttle
I've been on it like full auto
Livin on the edge
We hit the lotto

And it made me deal
All the words
That I wanted to say in my brain
You know I'm insane
You know I am crazy
You know I might go all the way yeah
I copped a feel
And it made me deal
All the words
That I wanted to say in my brain
You know I'm insane
You know I am crazy
