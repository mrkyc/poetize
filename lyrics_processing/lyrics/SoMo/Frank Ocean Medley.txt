Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you
(You, know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
She's workin' at the Pyramid tonight
She's workin' at the Pyramid tonight
Pimpin' in my convo's
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playin'
Top floor motel suite, twistin' my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
You might also likeBut it's a bad religion, for her to love someone who will never love her
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
I'm about to drive to the ocean
I'm about to swim from something
Bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good
Swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good
Swim good
Good
I'm goin' numb
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You, know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya? Do ya?
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
PAUSE
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man & woman
But between love and love
And I believe you when you say that
You've lost all faith
But you must believe in something
Something something
You gotta believe in something
Something something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try
The girls try
The boys try
Women try
Men try
You and I
