You say you're guarded
I hate these pardons
You don't know what that does to me
Think that you're hardened
I left you heartless
Told you I'd be there then I just leave

I been living fantasies
Blurred out all the things that you like
Don't need the finer things
You don't want it all
Just wanna be my wife
Girl we made a baby, what'd you thank me for?
You gave me her life, gave me worlds, gave me hope
Gave me all I wanted, gave me love, gave me more
Love her all the time
Need you both or I'm broke

So, stay here right by my side
Love me all the time
Say you'll love me all the time, oh no
Don't say no, no, no, no, no, no
So, stay here right by my side
Love me all the time
Say you'll love me all the time, oh no
Don't say no, no, no, no, no, no
You might also like
You say you're haunted
Tore up a promise
You don't know what that does to me
Guess that's the part of the story that's darkest
Tried to protect you as if I could see

I been living fantasies
Blurred out all the things that you like
Don't need the finer things
You don't want it all
Just wanna be my wife
Girl we made a baby, what'd you thank me for?
You gave me her life, gave me worlds, gave me hope
Gave me all I wanted, gave me love, gave me more
Love her all the time
Need you both or I'm broke

So, stay here right by my side
Love me all the time
Say you'll love me all the time, oh no
Don't say no, no, no, no, no, no
So, stay here right by my side
Love me all the time
Say you'll love me all the time, oh no
