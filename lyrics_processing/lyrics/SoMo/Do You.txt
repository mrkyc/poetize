There's a boy on his own
Hardly dreaming, never home
Broken heart, still he tries
Barely breathing so he searches the sky
For the motivation to climb
Need an innovation of mine
One may say he lives life on the road
He didn't know they mean life all alone

But what they don't tell you
Is the road is the loneliest part
And the girls, yeah, they'll tear you apart
But I know that you'll always be there
That's the only thing keeping me here
All alone in this bed, yeah, I sleep
Every night, every day, every week
But I know that you'll always be there
That's the only thing keeping me here
You might also like
Do you wanna love me?
You wanna touch me?
I feel frustrated from all these temptations
I popped a xanny
She dropped her panty
We got the henny, woah
She had me tongue tied
No need to unwind
I found some sunrise, woah
I'm feeling anxious
The same old places
Too late to change it, woah
I'm going crazy
I'm fucking basic
But still I lace it, woah

Say I let her go
Say I let her down
Say I never showed up
I am not the one saying what I want
So I spin the wheel
21 on love

But what they don't tell you
Is the road is the loneliest part
And the girls, yeah, they'll tear you apart
But I know that you'll always be there
That's the only thing keeping me here
All alone in this bed, yeah, I sleep
Every night, every day, every week
But I know that you'll always be there
That's the only thing keeping me here
