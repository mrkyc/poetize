I caressed your body
Had you coming when you called (called)
Now I need somebody
That can handle what's involved (-volved)
Gave you all you wanted
Took you down the boulevard (-vard)
Now I need somebody
I can lean on when it's hard (hard)
Time is getting rougher
I need time to make some sense (sense)
Saving all my money
I've been tryna to make it flip (flip)
Candles burning out
You don't leave candles in the wind (wind)
Need someone to love me
You can love 'till the end

Baby, baby, baby, baby
You say you feel the phases
I told you I was aching
You know I need you more, oh
Baby, baby
You say you feel me fading
I warned you I was crazy
You know, you know, you know
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You say you feel the phases
I told you I was aching
You know I need you more, oh
Baby, baby
You say you feel me fading
I warned you I was crazy
You know, you know, you know
Baby

Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Will you hold your weight up
Or will you let it fall?
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Say you'll hold me tight
You'll hold me right
You'll hold the weight up
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Will you hold your weight up
Or will you let it fall?
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Say you'll hold me tight
You'll hold me right
You'll hold the weight up

Pray you'll hold me up
Hold me tight
Will you fight the fight I fight? (fight)
Stand there by my side
When I've got nothing left in sight (sight)
You deserve this life
I told you every single time (time)
I've been slippin', right?
I need your hand to help me climb (climb)
Would you, would you hold the weight?
If your heart is beating dry, oh
Would you hold the weight?
When I'm on the other line, oh
Would you hold the weight?
Could you go beyond the pine?
If we're soul mates
Would you hold the weight?
Moonlight, then you close your eyes
Lay here with a lonely mind
Sunlight, when it's you and I
Say you'll love me all the time
I've tried for the longest time
That maybe there's another rhyme
But all the time, means all the time

Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Will you hold your weight up
Or will you let it fall?
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Say you'll hold me tight
You'll hold me right
You'll hold the weight up
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Will you hold your weight up
Or will you let it fall?
Come back with me, ah
Can you hold the weight?
Say you'll hold me tight
You'll hold me right
