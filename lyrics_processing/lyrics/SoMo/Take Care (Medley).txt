Overdosed on confidence..
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments..
Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?

And they notice, and I know this
That when a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world..
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl..
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting..
And it's all because she don't want things to change
I know things get hard..
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go..
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfucka's want to waste your time
