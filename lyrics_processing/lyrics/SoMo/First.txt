Promise that you won't kiss and tell
I'm for real, I wanna give you a supply
Of how it feels when your heart is beating fast
And sweat drips off your body
I'm roaring loud (say it with me)
We're roaring loud

You lose if you get it first
Get it first, let it burst
My job is to make it squirt
Don't hold it back, get it first
You lose if you get it first (Raining, pouring)
Get it first, let it burst (Raining, it's storming)
My job is to make it squirt (Raining, pouring)
Don't hold it back, get it first (Raining, it's storming)

I got a Tonka truck, baby, can I put it in drive?
Wanna pull your hair, woo, I got some things on my mind
I ain't lying, girl, I just wanna roar right now
Say it with me, baby, we're roaring loud

You lose if you get it first
Get it first, let it burst
My job is to make it squirt
Don't hold it back, get it first
You lose if you get it first (Raining, pouring)
Get it first, let it burst (Raining, it's storming)
My job is to make it squirt (Raining, pouring)
Don't hold it back, get it first (Raining, it's storming)

Let me go crazy, I wanna dive in face first today
I'm playing Russian Roulette with that
Are you gon' let me kiss on your neck or not?
I've tried to neglect how I feel, but it's go time
Close your eyes and know

You lose if you get it first
Get it first, let it burst
My job is to make it squirt
Don't hold it back, get it first
You lose if you get it first (Raining, pouring)
Get it first, let it burst (Raining, it's storming)
My job is to make it squirt (Raining, pouring)
