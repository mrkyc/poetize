Head first, chest hurts
Never thought it'd get worse
Head first, chest hurts
Never thought it'd get worse

You say you hate me for what I did
But how can you blame me for choosing this?
Now everything's faster, more money spent
You think that I'm happy, except I'm losing it
Baby, baby come back you were the only friend
That seems to see passed all over that bullshit
I'm on reckless disaster, you're the innocent
It's like I'm on track crash, I'm falling in, I'm falling in

Head first, chest hurts never though it'd get worse
Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups
Let's just go back in the story, replay
To that day that you pray, that I never stray away
Wish I never strayed away oh no

You gave me an option, you let me choose
Believed in the music and what I do
But you wanted a promise, to stay true
Except this ain't a contest, you weren't a fool
Baby, baby come back you were the only one
That's full of pain but so full of love
Stuck in this heartache like it's a drug
Relapsing and I'm back, crash, I'm falling off
I'm falling off

Head first, chest hurts never though it'd get worse
Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups
Let's just go back in the story, replay
To that day that you pray, that I never stray away
Wish I never strayed away oh no

Wish I never strayed away, never strayed away
Filled with empty promises I never should've made
Wish I never strayed away, never strayed away
Filled with empty promises I never should've made

And I traded, what I waited for my whole damn life
No debating, you were jaded, thought you'd be my wife
Ooh, ooh, and it feels like I'm crashing down
(And it feels, and it feels, and it feels)
Like I'm crashing down

Head first, chest hurts
Never thought It'd get worse
Head first, chest hurts
Never thought it'd get worse
Head first, chest hurts never though it'd get worse
Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups
Let's just go back in the story, replay
To that day that you pray, that I never stray away
