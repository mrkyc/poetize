Pretty lady
Come here baby, I just wanna love your body right
Thinking maybe
I can go crazy, yeah yeah yeah
Until the morning light

Girl the way you flaunt it
Those hips flow like water
Dip it low, I'll watch it
This love hits like rocketships from outer space
I'm in the highest place with you

Baby I just wanna show off
Come on baby, take your clothes off
We can keep on bumpin' and grindin' and lovin' so wildly
You know I wanna show off
Tonight I wanna show off, baby let me show off
I'm gon' take your legs up and wrap them and squeeze it then smack it
You know I wanna show off

Pretty lady
You're driving me insane
We can do some things that you ain't never done before
I just wanna show off
Baby here's your roll call
I'mma be your teacher, you gon' learn the details
Then I'm on a test, you'll just follow the leader
