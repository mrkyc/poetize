Saddle up right now
Should've known, when you picked up your phone
It goes down in this town
You don't have to be alone
I can fuck you right
I can make you scream and moan
Imma do this right
Imma take you to that zone

Uh, uh, little freaky shit
In the mirror, mirror
Uh, uh, X-rated shit
In the mirror, mirror

Let's get up out this club, club
Lemme get you outta here, here
Imma get you out the clothes, clothes
Make them panties disappear, -pear
I pin your ass up on that wall, that wall
And then I rip my shirt off, off
Run my hands up to your hair, your hair
As I fuck you in the mirror, mirror
You might also like
Had enough by now
Should've known when you hopped in these sheets
That I'll hold it down
You don't have to be alone
Turn the light off
Futuristic mindset running miles
Say you wanna wife up, wearing white gowns
You got me thinking 'bout it the way you slide down
The way you slide down

Uh, uh, little freaky shit
In the mirror, mirror
Uh, uh, X-rated shit
In the mirror, mirror

Let's get up out this club, club
Lemme get you outta here, here
Imma get you out the clothes, clothes
Make them panties disappear, -pear
I pin your ass up on that wall, that wall
And then I rip my shirt off, off
Run my hands up to your hair, your hair
As I fuck you in the mirror, mirror
Strapped up
Yeah, you know what I'm looking for
Lips, lie
Girl you know what I need you to say
Hips, roar
Tell your girls that you gotta get going
It's two o' clock in the morning

Uh, uh, little freaky shit
In the mirror, mirror
Uh, uh, X-rated shit
In the mirror, mirror

Let's get up out this club, club
Lemme get you outta here, here
Imma get you out the clothes, clothes
Make them panties disappear, -pear
I pin your ass up on that wall, that wall
And then I rip my shirt off, off
Run my hands up to your hair, your hair
