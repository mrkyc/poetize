50, 50 feet up underground
You know I keep my feet on the sound
50, 50 feet up underground
You know I keep my feet on the sound
I'm around, baby I'm around
Underground, but you know I'm around
I was down, lately, I've been down
Ran around, now I'm back I'm found

Pour the wine up
You're silent
Why though?
You know you like
This style of
This side of
I know you like it

I fucked you right, I did
I loved you every single night
You know you like, that dear
You know you like it when I ride
You owe me all of it
You told me every single time
I'm holding on to it
I'm holding everything that's mine
I fucked you right, I did
I loved you every single night
You know you like, that dear
You know you like it when I ride
You owe me all of it
You told me every single time
I'm holding on to it
I'm holding everything that's mine
You know it

Popped a pill
What's the deal
I don't feel it anymore
Popped, popped a pill
What's that?
You know I've been down on the floor
I cried everyday
You know this ain't real anymore
It's a dream on the door
It's a dream on the board
It's the life and you warned me, hold tighter
Reminiscing on old times with my red lighter
Said you'd feel it in your throat, when I sing
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

I fucked you right, I did
I loved you every single night
You know you like, that dear
You know you like it when I ride
You owe me all of it
You told me every single time
I'm holding on to it
I'm holding everything that's mine
I fucked you right, I did
I loved you every single night
You know you like, that dear
You know you like it when I ride
You owe me all of it
You told me every single time
I'm holding on to it
I'm holding everything that's mine
You know it
50, 50 feet up underground
You know I keep my feet on the sound
