Get out of bed with me on your mind
Baby, you know it's just a matter of time
Drop me a line, whether it's 3 in the morning
Raining, but it's you that's storming

Run it back, done with that
Thought you were never coming back
Oh, don't do that, heart attack
You're the only one that I want (You're the only one that I want)
And I've been waiting for this call for so long
You know I've been waiting so damn long

I got you, I got you, I got to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
Oh, you like it like that, oh
I want you, I want you, I want to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
Oh, you like it like that, oh
You might also like
Oh, it's getting (Hot)
I can feel your (Pulse)
Whispering, "Don't (Stop)"
I need you the (Most)
How many nights have I blessed ya?
How many nights have you called my name?
Don't play, I know you wanna stay, yeah, so let's just

Run it back, done with that
Thought you were never coming back
Oh, don't do that, heart attack
You're the only one that I want
I've been waiting for this call for so long
You know I've been waiting so damn long

I got you, I got you, I got to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
Oh, you like it like that, oh
I want you, I want you, I want to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
Oh, you like it like that, oh
Hundreds of doubts, hundreds of trials
Woah, you've been holding up what's broken in my heart
I've been down from the start
Oh, I've been down from the start
Oh-woah-woah, comin' down from the stars
Oh-woah-woah, comin' down from my heart
Oh-woah-woah, see the wave, make it part, make it part
All I'm really trying to say

I got you, I got you, I got to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
Oh, you like it like that, oh
I want you, I want you, I want to
Hold on to, hold on to, hold on, no
I hold on to the curve in your back
While you lie on your back
