Everybody's watching
I know what you're waiting for
This ain't your decision
Girl, this ain't no magic door
Give me one good reason
Are you different from the ones before?
You know that I'm seasoned
Girl, I've seen this place before

I don't wanna fuck you like this
I don't wanna touch you like this
Take over your body, control your everything
I know you wanna love me like this
I know you wanna trust me like this
Take over your body, control your everything
Girl, you got me singing on the low like I'm alright
Girl, you got me singing on the low like I'm alright

Everybody's watching, everybody knows it
They don't wanna see who I'ma make it home with
I'ma take you back, but that's just 'cause I'm able
It's the weekend, we can do it on the table
I could even make you love it with the light on
If you wanna, we can turn on some of my songs
Just remember, when we're done, I'm gonna ride on
This could only last a night, I'm outta my zone
I'm about to do it like he's never done it
I can see it in your eyes that you're full of wonder
I'ma sing a song, I'ma sing it better
I'ma sing it like he couldn't, baby, you ain't never been wetter

I don't wanna fuck you like this
I don't wanna touch you like this
Take over your body, control your everything (I know)
I know you wanna love me like this
I know you wanna trust me like this
Take over your body, control your everything
Girl, you got me singing on the low like I'm alright
Girl, you got me singing on the low like I'm alright

Everybody's talking (Everybody's talking)
I don't care what they say
This ain't their decision (This ain't their decision)
They can't get in our way
I'ma do it right now (I'ma do it right now)
Hold up, wait, I changed my mind
I can't do this, oh no (I can't do this, no)
I just need to do what's right

I don't wanna fuck you like this
I don't wanna touch you like this
Take over your body, control your everything (I know)
I know you wanna love me like this
I know you wanna trust me like this
Take over your body, control your everything
Girl, you got me singing on the low like I'm alright
