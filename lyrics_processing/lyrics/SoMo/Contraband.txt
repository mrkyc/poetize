Put you in action
This ain't uh
For satisfaction, no, no, no
I am not a actor, oh no no
And you are not a actress
So don't you go, pretend that you love me
Don't pretend that you don't want it all
I want it wholly
All I wanna, hold you down for love
I hold it holy
Hold ya down for life
I wanna hold you like a rolly
Round and round, we twist the sounds

Gotta keep this thing between us, we can't creep too loud
Said your mom named Billie Jean, well let her teach you how
If I pull up in my Jeep truck, I'm comin' to beat shit down
I'm fiendin' like a survivor
Spark in my heart like a lighter
Squeeze me, we could be tighter
Promise I won't get tired, I'm wired for you

You're a bad girl, but I like it
Came off time, but I swear you're timeless
On fire, I like her
I like the way she walks, on fire
I like the way she talks
I like her
I like the way she walks, on fire
You might also like
I like the rhythm of her boat
Damn, she's so bold
She drippin' with the flow and everybody knows
Walkin' through the door, is it me you're lookin' for?
I bet I want you more, come and take a tour

Gotta keep this thing between us, we can't creep too loud
Said your mom named Billie Jean, well let her teach you how
If I pull up in my Jeep truck, I'm comin' to beat shit down
I'm fiendin' like a survivor
Spark in my heart like a lighter
Squeeze me we could be tighter
Promise I won't get tired, I'm wired for you

You're a bad girl, but I like it
Came off time, but I swear you're timeless
On fire, I like her
I like the way she walks, on fire
I like the way she talks
I like her
I like the way she walks, on fire

We used to dance
You held my hand
You would tell me all the time
Wave your flag, just surrender
And I would throw it on the line
Get you wet, spread your legs
Let your knees just drop the dime
Contraband, contraband
Baby, throw it on the line
This ain't nothin' I don't know
This ain't nothin' I ain't done before
I put soul in every stroke
Can you admit that you still needed me?
With my tongue all down your throat
Can I lick that place, love the the way you taste
Are you teaching me, or are you teasing me?
Spark in my heart like a lighter
Squeeze me we could be tighter
Promise I won't get tired, I'm wired for you
You're a bad girl, but I like it
Came off time, but I swear you're timeless

Say that you're a rider
Girl, it ain't a trial
Everybody knows it, now you gotta try it
Say you wanna start it
Say you want a fire
Say you wanna love me
