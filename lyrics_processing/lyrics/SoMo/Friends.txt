Friends, they wanna pretend
They don't got them ends though
They don't got them ends, they doubtin'
Your friends, they wanna come in
They don't got them ins though
They don't got them ins, they doubtin'

Oh, lord, where'd ya go?
Where's the soul, that you sold?
What's the goal?
Pay the toll
Get involved, show your role
I read my bible, respect thy rival
You want it, then work it, you're not entitled
I made my mind up, don't waste my time up
You want it, then work it, don't mess my grind up

Friends, they wanna pretend
They don't got them ends though
They don't got them ends, they doubtin'
Your friends, they wanna come in
They don't got them ins though
They don't got them ins, they doubtin'

I remember back when we were friends, we were friends
We would hold each other hands, would ya do it all again?
There was hurt in the words
There was pain in the dirt
There was IDGAF, then it's see ya in a month
Then it turned to a year, then it turned to three
Where did I go wrong?
Who to blame, you, me?
If it burns much more, it'll need IV
Gonna need it OD
Who am I without these?
Friends, they wanna pretend
They don't got them ends though
They don't got them ends, they doubtin'
Your friends, they wanna come in
They don't got them ins though
They don't got them ins, they doubtin'

Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop in the Jeep

Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop in the Jeep
You wanna turn it up
