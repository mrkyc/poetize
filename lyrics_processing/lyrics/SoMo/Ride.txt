Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, yeah, oh
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah

Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body, baby, this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we've run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fuckin' runnin', feel the heat between us too

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady, all night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet
You might also like
Woah, and we can go slow
Yeah, we can go slow, oh, woah

Lay on your back, like you right there
Don't have to say it twice, love, there's nothing here to fear
Takin' it back, back to where it's clear
Rollin' on and on sounds of love are in the air

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet
Love, love
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Sun's coming up (Oh), you're on my side (Oh)
I rub your thigh (Oh), you look in my eyes (Ah)
And I just see the sky (See the sky)
I'm so high (I'm so high) but I ain't smoked yet (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm just comin' down from this

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride (Ride)
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body (Your body)
I'll be gentle don't you scream (Don't you scream)
It's getting hotter, make it softer (Make it hotter, make it hotter)
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride (I'm gon' ride)
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night (I'm gon' ride)
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top (Kiss your body, oh)
All the way down to your feet
