Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Maybe "I'm sorry"'s outta line
Maybe I'm selfish, I should've tried
You know I lost it, but I've been found

I know I'm wrong
Baby, I'm wrong, so wrong
For letting you hurt so long
Ohh

And I can't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please

'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
You might also like
Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I lied
Maybe I rushed us outta time
Maybe I felt it, I put up a fight
Holding emotion I shouldn't hide

I know I'm wrong
Baby, I'm wrong, so wrong
For letting you hurt so long
Oh

And I can't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please

'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home
I'm just a man

But I won't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do?
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home

I'm just a man, oh
I'm just a man, oh
I'm just a man, oh
Oh
