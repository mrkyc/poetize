I wish we'd go back to the heart of it all
We were born and raised to love with our soul
City wide
We were running wild
So young and so bold
We'd never grow old, woah, no
I wish for the sunny days
And the moonlight ending on your face
You and I
And a little grace
Don't give up it'll be a waste
See a star fallin' from the sky
Shinin' bright like a lullaby
Oh, I
Ohhhhh

I wish I may, I wish I might
I told you things I wish I lied
Oh, if I may, oh, if I might
I'd take back things I did that night
I wish I may, I wish I might
I told you things I wish I lied
Oh, if I may, oh, if I might
I'd take back things I did that night
You might also like
Wish we'd go back to the normal days
When we could laugh through the pouring rain
Need to fall back into what we made
Wearing, wearing all black since you walked away
Missin' those eyes when we'd conversate
Holding my breath when you're not with me
Losin' my head over what has changed
Been, been fallin' up since you walked away

Flip it on back from the other side
Don't fill it up with doubt 'cause your lover lied
I'm singing this out till' you come back
'Notherl love round
'Cause you know you're lover tried
Flip it on back from the other side
Don't fill it up with doubt 'cause your lover lied
I'm singing this out till' you come back
'Notherl love round
'Cause you know you're lover tried

I wish I may, I wish I might
I told you things I wish I lied
Oh, if I may, oh, if I might
I'd take back things I did that night
I wish I may, I wish I might
I told you things I wish I lied
Oh, if I may, oh, if I might
I'd take back things I did that night
I wish I may, I wish I might
I told you things I wish I lied
Oh, if I may, oh, if I might
