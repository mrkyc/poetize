Woke up but you're back in my bed
We broke up, how this happened again?
I always end up letting you in
When I start drinking, not thinking
I should have listened to all of my friends
Same road and the same dead end
I'm loving while she pretends
So I keep drinking, not thinking

First love is hard enough
Even worse to give it up
I can't forget her when she's gone
But she can't leave when I'm holding on

So what can I say?
I made a mistake
This time you'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
It's always the same
I'll take the blame
This time I'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
Girl, I should have known better

Every time that I start to forget
I drive at the spot where we first met
You had nothing on underneath that dress
We were just drinking, not thinking
Just two kids, it was way too soon
Didn't realize what we had to lose
No way to know we wouldn't make it through
Didn't know we'll end up seeking

First love is hard enough
Even worse to give it up
I can't forget her when she's gone
But she can't leave when I'm holding on

So what can I say?
I made a mistake
This time you'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
It's always the same
I'll take the blame
This time I'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
Keep leaving me with nothing
Someday I'll live my life
Right now I'm losing this fight
Lust ain't the same as trusting
Can't figure out this love thing
Guess it ain't happening tonight

So what can I say?
I made a mistake
This time you'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
It's always the same
I'll take the blame
This time I'll never change
You're nothing but trouble and I should have known better
Girl, I should have known better
