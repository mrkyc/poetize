I'm leaving tonight
Down the same dirt road
A million times
I've driven just to get home
And I ain't ever looking back
For nothing
Headed for the coast
Looking for the high life
Everybody knows
It's nothing but a good time
And I sold everything I had
For something
I can't seem to find

So this is the life they talked about
This is the I can't live without
When the real world crashes down
Oh if they could see me now
When all the dreams of "on your own"
Turn to nightmares all alone
It hits you right between the eyes
This is the life
This is the life
See Hinder LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
These four walls feel more like a prison
Instead of paradise
I couldn't wait to live in
So I just drink myself to sleep
Again
Can't escape my mind
This ain't like a movie
It's getting hard to hide
The more it's doin to me
Don't know how long I can keep
From going
Crazy all the time

So this is the life they talked about
This is the I can't live without
When the real world crashes down
Oh if they could see me now
When all the dreams of "on your own"
Turn to nightmares all alone
It hits you right between the eyes
This is the life
This is the life

Nothings ever what it seems
Maybe that grass ain't so green
Nothings ever out of reach
When you're seventeen
So this is the life they talked about
This is the I can't live without
When the real world crashes down
Oh if they could see me now
When all the dreams of "on your own"
Turn to nightmares all alone
It hits you right between the eyes
This is the life
This is the life
