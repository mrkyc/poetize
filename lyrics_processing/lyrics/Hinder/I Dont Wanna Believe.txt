Everything good just goes away
I never had a taste of heaven
Without a little hell to pay
All I ever needed was someone to give instead of take
But something about you makes it right to give it one more try
And I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you
But I'm ready to fall if you're the one that I'm falling to
And tell me you're the one, 'cause baby I don't want to waste another day
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you
I never been so scared, I was going nowhere, but now you're here
I'm holding you too tight, pushing you away is my darkest fear
I don't wanna break you, I don't wanna make you disappear
I feel deadly kind of pain, but you take it all away
And I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you
But I'm ready to fall if you're the one that I'm falling to
Tell me you're the one, 'cause baby I don't want to waste another day
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you
I'm giving you, what's left of me
So you can put me back together
You're giving me what I needed all along
