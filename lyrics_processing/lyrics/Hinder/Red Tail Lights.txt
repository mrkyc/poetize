You're waitin' by the car as I pull in
And this is where the ending begins
Lookin' like you made up your mind
Like anything I say would be a waste of your time

But it's too little too late
Too bad that we can't save it
Are we really gonna leave this way?
Give it all up and drive away?

Girl, I swear I wasn't runnin' around
Just got sick of you puttin' me down
And who died and made you queen?
You can't put this all on me
Girl, our love's on the line right now
Should we fight or turn around?
I know there's gotta be more to this thing
Than two hearts goin' their separate ways
Red tail lights in the pourin' rain

And baby, just roll that window down
I really wanna talk this thing out
And we ain't gonna get nowhere screamin'
But if you believe every word you heard
I'm probably better off, that you're leavin'

Give it all up and drive away?
(Too little), I'm just a little too late
