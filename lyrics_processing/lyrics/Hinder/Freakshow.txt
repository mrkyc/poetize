Passed out in the bathroom, feeling no pain
Daddy's at the strip club, loving that lap love
Burning those bills up, making it rain
Sister's got the TV, nothing but reality
Showing her how to be a dirty little skank
Brother's got a new dress, pretty as a princess
Working in the lux, gets money and the pain
Step right up, yeah, you don't wanna listen
Everybody's got a ticket
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Living on the front row, welcome to the freak show
What more, what more
Jumping off the tight-rope, everybody's psycho
Sneak a peak, have a seat, ready, sex, here we go
Welcome to the freak show
Super sweet in real life, super slutty house wife
Fighting for the spotlight, feeling no shame
It's good to be a trainee, put it on the internet
Making sure they don't forget my pretty little face

Ain't nobody gonna stop me
What more, what more
Everyone's a fake team, they shoot for the fifteen
Nobody can resist it, everybody's twisted
Sneak a peak, have a seat, ready, set, here we go
Welcome to the freak show
Whoa oh, whoa oh
