And if you ain't the king
And you can't make it rain
Hell no, you can't heal my pain
If you ain't got no chains
And if you ain't got a cage
And you can't calm the rage
You ain't changing anything
Already made the news
Slipped out of every noose
I've cut my demons loose
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
Raged on fumes
There's nothing left to use
My middle name's abuse
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
If you can't part the sea
And you can't pardon me
If you don't like what you see
You don't know how to save my soul
Cause I've been in the trenches
Fighting off the devil's wenches
I've had all the scars and stitches
To make you see, make you see
Get the fuck away from me

My middle name's abuse
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
If you take a look at my life, you'll see in my eyes
A whole world full of hurt, addiction and lies
I've been through it before but somehow I survived
Now I'm flirtin' with death but never been more alive
Already made the news
