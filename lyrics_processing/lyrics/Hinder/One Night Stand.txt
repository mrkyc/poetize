Makin' memories I might remember
So sweet and so shy
Cause tonight you know
It's not forever
Be my biggest fan
Scream as loud as you can
Cause you know it's just a one night stand
And I said
Don't leave your number, no I'm not callin
Sex's not love and no I'm not fallin'
For you
So sexy girl stop stallin'
She stripped her skirt and screamed out
Whoa oa oa oa oh oh
Whoa oa oa oa oh oh
Whoa oa oa oa oh oh
She stripped her skirt and screamed out loud
Still high, from the ride
Stumble from my room with sex hair
She shook me all night
I guess I shoulda got her number
