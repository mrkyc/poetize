I'm living life with no regrets
They're on their way buy ain't here yet
I just left Las Vegas in bad, bad shape
I only call home if I get the chance
Every other night a new romance
Wake up just in time to miss the day
And now I'm talking to the man in the mirror
And I think I heard him say

What ya gonna do
When the whiskey ain't working no more?
Life don't feel like before
What ya gonna do?
What ya gonna do
When the ride ain't climbing no more?
Nobody's beatin' down your door
What ya gonna do?

And I'm still closing down these streets
I'm high enough to make believe
That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground
The one that got away from me
Every now and then she calls to see
If I'm alive or plan to settle down
Well, I called her drunk last night
And I think I heard her say

What ya gonna do
When the ride ain't climbing no more?
Nobody's beatin' down your door
What ya gonna do?

I can't sleep and I can't hide
'Cause the voices in my head are getting louder
Getting louder every night
I'm living life with no regrets
They're on their way but ain't here yet

What ya gonna do
When the whiskey ain't working no more?
Life don't feel like before
What ya gonna do?

When the ride ain't climbing no more?
Nobody's beatin' down your door
