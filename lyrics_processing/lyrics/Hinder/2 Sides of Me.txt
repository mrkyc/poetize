HEY!

This ain't a love song
But don't get me wrong
I'm gonna love you all night long
While you're turnin' me on
Til the lovin' and the liquor's gone
But if you wanna like me
Girl you better find me
Before the sun goes down
And if you wanna hate me
It ain't gonna take me long just stick around
It's like a match to gasoline
I'm nice as hell 'til I get mean

I'll be your prom king early
Mr. Clean charmin' your Momma at your front door
And then your late night, bar fight
Damn right I'm the guy passed out on your floor
Don't gotta spin me around to see
There ain't no in-between the 2 sides of me

This ain't rehab
I ain't that bad
Too many good times to be had
I ain't hangin' my hat
Til I'm stumblin' down that path
But if you wanna like me
Better catch me right before
The shot goes down
And if you wanna hate me
I won't think you're crazy
There's other girls in town
Right now I'm Mr. Right
But that ain't gonna last all night
