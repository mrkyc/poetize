I've never been so happy to see a girl leave
Take your filthy little hands off my dirty ripped jeans
You told me you hated my GNR shirt
Shoulda known then, this is never gonna work
But like what you like, it don't matter to me
Just leave the Jack and take your Hennessy
Take your Kanye out of my player, please
Led Zeppelin 45 is stayin' with me

Hey ho, ain't nothin' little 'bout rock 'n' roll
Hey ho, rap it up and hip hop down the road
Hell no, don't turn down my radio
If you're a dirty little rocker
Baby come on and let it show and scream "Hey ho!"

You never liked any damn song I wrote
You spent my money and you smoked my smoke
Pumpin' lame-ass beats in your foreign car
It ain't real music without guitar
I like Jimi Hendrix, baby, don't you know?
I like gettin' high, not ridin' low

Hey ho, ain't nothin' little 'bout rock 'n' roll
Hey ho, rap it up and hip hop down the road
Hell no, don't turn down my radio
If you're a dirty little rocker
Baby come on and let it show and scream "Hey ho!"
See Hinder LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like

Shake your ass all night, but I'm gonna
Find a rocker chick that'll bang to Nirvana
Yo, ho, you gotta go, you ain't nothin' but a

Hey ho, ain't nothin' little 'bout rock 'n' roll
Hey ho, rap it up and hip hop down the road
Hell no, don't turn down my radio
If you're a dirty little rocker
Baby come on and let it show and scream "Hey ho!"

Never been so happy to see a girl leave
Take Lil' Wayne out of my player, please
Shoulda never let you smoke my smoke
I like gettin' high, not ridin' low

If you're a dirty little rocker
