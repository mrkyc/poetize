By the time that the Stones came on
We were stoned out of our minds
I know it's only rock n' roll
But it's the soundtrack of our lives
No matter how crazy life gets
I can feel right at home sweet home
Every time I put that record on
The first time I got a whole lotta love
I wanted a whole lot more
In the back seat baby made me feel like maybe
We were knockin' on Heaven's door
And "Walk This Way" still to this day
Makes me wanna drink all night long
Every time I put that record on

(Come on, come on)
Turn, turn, turn it up loud
Light you one up and pass it around
The song remains the same as life goes on
(And on, and on)
Turn, turn, turn the page
Back to that first time and place
When you felt like you were living in that song
And put that record on
See Hinder LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
Life's been a crazy train
Barely kept in on the tracks
If you think it's a shame that I act this way
Blame it on "Back in Black"
I'm glad I did everything I did
And I forget what I've done wrong
Every time I put that record on

(Come on, yeah)
Turn, turn, turn it up loud
Light you one up and pass it around
The song remains the same as life goes on
(And on, and on)
Turn, turn, turn the page
Back to that first time and place
When you felt like you were living in that song
And put that record on
And let it play, and take it back to yesterday
(Come on, better sing it now)
Turn, turn, turn it up loud
Light you one up and pass it around
The song remains the same as life goes on
(And on, and on)
Turn, turn, turn the page
Back to that first time and place
When you felt like you were living in that song
And put that record on
Put that record on
Put that record on
