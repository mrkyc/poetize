Before I showed up here drunk and all
Messed up from the last time we talked
When you hung up on me
It's Saturday, it's three a.m
But I'm not sorry that I'm here again
And I'm going crazy thinking you're with him
And I don't wanna leave
You alone for another minute
In that bed without me in it
I've tried all there is to try
I'm not ever saying a lie
To make myself believe in something
I know isn't true
I've drank all there is to drink
I've thought all there is to think
I'll disappear forever, if you want me to
And I'll find somebody new
But I can't love anyone but you
Oooh
Anyone but you
(I can't love anyone)

But that was six months ago, yesterday
And it ain't like I counted the days
But I can't take one more
That's why I'm out here in the rain
That's why I'm willing to take the blame
That's why I only ever wanna say your name
I've tried all there is to try
I'm not ever saying a lie
To make myself believe in something
I know isn't true
I've drank all there is to drink
I've thought all there is to think
I'll disappear forever, if you want me to
And I'll find somebody new
But I can't love anyone but you
(Anyone but you)
If this is want you want
Then look me in the eye
But I'm praying you won't
Say your last goodbye
I've tried all there is to try
I'm not ever saying a lie
To make myself believe in something
I know isn't true
I've drank all there is to drink
I've thought all there is to think
I'll disappear forever, if you want me to
And I'll find somebody new
But I can't love anyone but you
(I can't love anyone)
Ooh
(I can't love anyone)
Anyone but you
(I can't love anyone)
(I can't love anyone)
Anyone but you
You said we need a little break
But that was six months ago, yesterday
