I guess we're living on the darker side
I thought "I do" meant until we die
But I guess I was mistaken
You had me thinking you were Heaven sent
But you were gone once the money was spent
You're a nightmare that just won't end
And I'm not even sleeping
But I won't hurt anymore...
There's no more tears for me to cry
No more lovin' you tonight
I won't regret you
I'll just forget you
You're dead to me
There's no more pieces of my heart
I've been broken down so far
You took it all, selfishly
You're dead to me
So much for a second chance
I gave you one too many of them
You can sweet talk a heartless man
You stole it, then you broke it

Ain't that where you like to be
You can stay there until they bleed
'Cause I'm not giving in
There's no more tears for me to cry
No more lovin' you tonight
I won't regret you
I'll just forget you
You're dead to me
There's no more pieces of my heart
I've been broken down so far
You took it all, selfishly
You're dead to me
I'd give you a chance to speak your mind
But I know it'd be a lie
Your not even worth the time
It takes to say goodbye
There's no more tears for me to cry
No more lovin' you tonight
I won't regret you
I'll just forget you
You're dead to me
There's no more pieces of my heart
I've been broken down so far
You took it all away from me
You took it all, selfishly
You're dead to me
(You took it all away)
Ohh, dead to me
(You took it all away)
Ooh, you're dead to me
