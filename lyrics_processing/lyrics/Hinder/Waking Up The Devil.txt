Almost midnight
I'm just sittin' at the bar
You slide ride up
Whisper "I know who you are"
And you want a little company tonight
You need a little love, I can give it to you right
Be careful what you wish for
If I'm gonna drive, girl it's gonna be one hell of a ride

Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know I oughtta leave
Him locked up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Wakin' up the devil

Up walks some guy
Starin' a hole through me
Grabs her too tight
Then he pulls her off my knee
See Hinder LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also likeI didn't come here lookin' for a fight
But if you're gonna bark boy, you better have a bite
I ain't been crazy in a really long time
But you're about to meet a good friend of mine

Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know I oughtta leave
Him locked up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Wakin' up the devil

Pretty girls and whiskey
Quarter bags and dimes
Put it in my face, I'm gonna do it every time
But try to keep me quiet
Try to hold me down
Damn it feels like heaven every time he comes around

Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know I oughtta leave
Him locked up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
