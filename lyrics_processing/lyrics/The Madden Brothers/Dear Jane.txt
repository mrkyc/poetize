And this whole thing started when I just asked for your name
You said, "It's Jane"
Now we're three months, seven days into this thing
And I can't help thinking that it's all been in vain
Yeah, all in vain
Now, dear Jane, yeah I'm writing you to say we're no good together
Oh Jane, yeah I'm going to find a way to float away like a feather
I don't want to hurt you but I got to make a change
Oh, all I can say is that I hope you feel the same
Dear, Jane
Oh, we can't make it from the bar way to prince
Without bumping into some other guy who says he's your friend
Just another friend, huh?
Want to go out when I want to stay in
You want me to love you but I just can't pretend
Just can't do it no more
Now, dear Jane, yeah I'm writing you to say we're no good together
Oh Jane, yeah I'm going to find a way to float away like a feather
I don't want to hurt you but I got to make a change
Oh, all I can say is that I hope you feel the same
Dear, Jane

Now, dear Jane, yeah I'm writing you to say we're no good together
Oh Jane, yeah I'm going to find a way to float away like a feather
I don't want to hurt you but I got to make a change
Oh, all I can say is that I hope you feel the same
Dear, Jane
Oh, Jane
You know it's easy to write that you want it to end
But the hard part comes when you got to hit send
No I never could send it now, I never did send it
You know it's easy to write that you want it to end
But the hard part comes when you got to hit send
