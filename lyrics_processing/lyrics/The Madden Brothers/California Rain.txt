We can make it, we got to try
Baby I believe in California rain
Yeahhh
Let me take you back before the lights, before the crowd, before we made a sound
All I wanted was to make my mother proud
She told me "Son well from the side of town, no one even makes it out"
Before we created, before they hated
Before anyone anticipated, we just want to make it
They said your crazy nothing's ever changing
So I packed up all my things and headed out towards the ocean
In my imagination California's waiting
She'll take me by the hand say "Hello, I'm so glad you finally made it"
Here comes the rain
Little Darling don't you cry, even California's cold sometimes
We can make it we got to try
Baby I believe
Summer's waiting, on the other side
There's no limit we can touch the sky
Baby I believe in California rain (Yeah)
It's been a long time coming, a long road running
You know what I'm saying, if you ever wanted something
So bad that you could taste it, couldn't sleep until you make it
And you know when you got it no one else could ever take it
When I met her she was easy she was happy just to meet me
She never wanted nothing just something to believe in
But the storms start raging come all the tribulations
When the fire starts fading, you've just got to recreate it

(California rain, California rain, California rain)
Everything ain't what it seems, California rain on me
