(Yeah)
Gonna shout it loud, shout it loud
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Where is the blackman's paradise?
That Marcus Garvey fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
That Mob Marley fight for today
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
Martin Luther King fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
This maybe harsh to say
But to live in a white world
It's a statement that many futters say
But Jah is our protector
And we not fear to say
It's a prejudice world
(Yeah)
In a prejudice world
You might also likeWhere is the blackman's paradise?
That Marcus Garvey fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
That Mob Marley fight for today
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
Martin Luther King fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
Is there unity and the philosophy
That gives them superiority, calling us minority
And in their hearts they know we are the majority
It's a prejudice world, in a prejudice world
Where is the blackman's paradise?
That Marcus Garvey fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
That Mob Marley fight for today
And we're still fighting for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
Martin Luther King fight for yesterday
And we're still fighting for today
Take a moment to sit down and meditate
History will recall and everything we convey
I hope the message in this song
Will provide the strengths
We'll need to shout it loud
It's a prejudice world
(Yeah)
It's a prejudice world
Where is the blackman's paradise?
Nelson Mandela fights for today
Louis Fara come fights for today
Where is the blackman's paradise
That the rastaman fights for today?
That the ghetto youths that cried for today
Where is the blackman's paradise
That the singers sing about today
That the musicians played for today
Where is the blackman's paradise?
What will tell the ghetto youths say?
What will we tell the children's?
We cry, we cry
