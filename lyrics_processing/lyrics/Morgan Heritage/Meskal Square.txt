The story of Meskal is all about this
A vision given to a Queen
By the name Helena, of how to find the cross of the Saviour
In the vision an angel told her, at that time
Ways of going about finding the cross of the Saviour, Jesus Christ
So the foundation of this mystical vision (A vision)
Was to light up three bonfire and where the smoke led they were to follow
For it was to be their guide (It was to be their guide)
To the True Cross of Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
And when they lift the earth the cross was there, it was there
