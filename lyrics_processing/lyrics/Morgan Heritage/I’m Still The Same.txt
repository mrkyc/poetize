Verse 1:
Yo, if it wasn't for my name
Wasn't for the fame
Would you wanna be my main, squeeze baby?
If it wasn't for the hype
Would you have the time
To have an interest in my life?
I don't think so baby
If it wasn't for the diamonds and the pearls (diamonds and pearls)
Would you wanna share my world? (my world?)
You need not say a word
Here's some questions for your mind (for your mind)
Do you love Rastafari?
Or even Rasta for your life?
'Cos if its all about the hype, girl
I can't have you in my life
Chorus:
'Cos I'm that same roots Rastaman yaw

Baby your the only girl i tried to be with more than twice
Now tell me why all of a sudden
That i'm the only man you wantin'?

Doesn't mean i've changed
