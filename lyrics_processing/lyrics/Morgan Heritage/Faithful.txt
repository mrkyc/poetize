Diamond rings will come and go
But this is what u ladies need to know
Yo i know us brothers do a whole lot of things
That make you sisters think we ain't worth a thing
But let me tell you bout this one special thing
When a mans ready to be faithful
Its a feeling no man can deny and its a moment no money can buy
Cuz when it comes it comes that's when the playing is done
A woman's victory is won
This is what it means when man says he needs you
This is what it means when he says he can't breathe without you
This is what it means he says he can't live a minute without you
This is what it means when the playing is done and your victory is won
Thats when he's ready to be faithful
When we feel no shame crying in pain
When he's ready to be faithful
When we realize that games don't bring gain
When he's ready to be faithful
Hey hey yeah yeah yeah
Ready to be faithful
Faithfulness is a serious thing
But some of us we really fear the feeling but when we get hit with the
True meaning of when a mans ready to be faithful
We give up games and give you all that you like
We wouldn't even dear to tell you a lie
Cuz when it comes it comes thats when the playing is done
A womans victory is won
This is what it means when man says he needs you
This is what it means when he says he can't breathe without you
This is what it means he says he can't live a minute without you
This is what it means when the playing is done and your victory is won
Thats when he's ready to be faithful
When we feel no shame crying in pain
When he's ready to be faithful
Ready
Thats when he's ready to be faithful
The moment every woman is longing for
It's when he's ready to be faithful
When happiness comes knockin at your door
My love will make you feel better than your brain on drugs
When I'm ready I'll be faithful and my love will never rub you wrong
Girl, picture me and you girl. when the time comes if it comes
I would lace you with them diamonds and pearls
Let me know would you ride with me
If i get locked would you be there still rolling with me
Or would you snitch to the feds cuz you know bout me
Try to stop me on my grind and live your own dynasty
But if you wanna be my shining star I'll be there don't worry just be who you are
Ill give you all you need that house that car ill give you love
See im faithful
This is what it means when man says he needs you
This is what it means when he says he can't breathe without you
This is what it means he says he can't live a minute without you
