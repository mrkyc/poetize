It's real good when you find that one in a million
Not afraid to say I messed up
I seen a girl around the corner
All it did was made me think of you
And I, I'm missing you (girl)
Feel like I can take no more
I've been trying but you won't take my calls
And I (I'm missing you)
Girl I know I messed up but I fessed up
Thought a little time would bring you back
Now I'm a wreck 'cause it clearly wasn't so
So tell me what to do or what to say to make it right
'Cause I need your arms around me every night
To me you're worth a trillion
You're one in a million
I'll never find a woman like you
If you would give back your heart
I swear by our love
I'd spend a lifetime making it up to you
Every night coming home to you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah
You might also likeMy friends been saying time again
Gotta try to get yourself together
I, I'm missing you I do
Sure I get the magnitude
But refuse to give up hope you'll see that I
I'm missing you
Just want you to know that ten years from now
I'll still be knocking at your door now
Your love is irreplaceable (irreplaceable)
So tell me what to do or what to say to make it right
'Cause I need your arms around me every night
To me you're worth a trillion
You're one in a million
I'll never find a woman like you
If you would give back your heart
I swear by our love
I'd spend a lifetime making it up to you
Every night coming home to you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah To me you're worth a trillion
You're one in a million
I'll never find a woman like you
If you would give back your heart
I swear by our love
I'd spend a lifetime making it up to you
Every night coming home to you
