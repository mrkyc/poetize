We've seen so many die, we've heard so many cry

We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day (one day)
We'll all smile again
We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day
We'll all smile again (listen)

In our day and time
Prophecy fulfills
Nations fighting each other
Innocent blood spills
Children having children
Lots of mothers on their own
Mama does the best to raise her child alone
'cause daddy's long gone
Penitentiary's overflow and the graveyard's filled
Filled with lots of young brothers
Where in the streets they were killed
It's been a long, long time comin'
Our days have been fulfilled
Oh, I tell you real soon everyone will sing this tune
You might also like
We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day (one day)
We'll all smile again
We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day (one day)
We'll all smile again (Grampa)

One day, my friend ooh yeah
We will surely overcome
The ups and downs life has to offer
We've got to hold on
In time we'll get stronger

We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day (one day)
We'll all smile again
We're living in a time (time)

Lots of mothers on their own
Mama does the best to raise her child alone
'cause daddy's long gone
Penitentiary's overflow and the graveyard's filled
Filled with lots of young brothers
Where in the streets they were killed
Open your eyes and you'll see
All that we say
Hope you feel it in your heart
Everyone's taught to say

We're living in a time (time)
Where joy will turn to pain (to pain)
Sunshine will turn to rain (to rain)
One day (one day)
We'll all smile again
We're living in a time (time)
