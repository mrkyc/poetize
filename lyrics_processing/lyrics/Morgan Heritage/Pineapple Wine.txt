Sweet, sweet pineapple wine

Oh, she was a wahini
Rocking a bikini
Blocking my vacay rays
I was just a yardi
Kicking it in Maui
Digging my new found shades
Oh, my paradise

Sipping on sunshine
Sugarcane good times
That was my aloha goodbye
I can still taste it
Barefoot and wasted
Coconut kisses
The kahlua kind
Two parts magic
Man I gotta have it
Throw in a little love and sublime
Sipping on sunshine
Sugarcane good times
Oh my, oh my, my
Pineapple wine

Waves started crashing
On white sands of passion
Everything stood still that day
Under trees full of flowers
We laid there for hours
As petals fell down like the rain
Oh, my paradise

Sipping on sunshine
Sugarcane good times
That was my aloha goodbye
I can still taste it
Barefoot and wasted
Coconut kisses
The kahlua kind
Two parts magic
Man I gotta have it
Throw in a little love and sublime
Sipping on sunshine
Sugarcane good times
Oh my, oh my, my
Pineapple wine
(Yeah man)
Oh, oh (Nice) oh my my

Everybody wants to love somebody
Everybody wants to have some fun
Everybody wants to love somebody
Under the Hawaiian sun (Yeah man)
