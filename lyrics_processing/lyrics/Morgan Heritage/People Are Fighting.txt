Woaahhh God oh God
In the abundance of war there is peace
And in the abundance of peace there is war
Why do mankind fight so much? Please tell me God oh God
No more wondering why they're so close and yet they are so far
Oh woaah woah ehhhh

People are fighting
Fighting one another
Many fight for selfish reasons
Just to be a part of the season (and that's not that's not right!)

Some say, they're walking Your holy way
But in their heart lies the blood of violence
Help them oh God I pray, woooaahhhh
Some say, calling on Your name is not the way
But he that exalted themselves oh Jah
I know You shall make abase, woooyyyyy
Can't see the light of the day
So they can't walk Your holy way
Blood of violence on their shoulders
I know soon they'll surely pay, woooyyyy

Alright, not until di system provide some justice
Equal rights and love it haffi practice
We a' go witness a' whole leap a' madness
And that dem ting nah prevail, no Lord

Some say there's no God to judge their ways
How foolish they be to live like this?
Content with their evil ways
And I know, patiently God awaits
He gives them a chance to redeem themselves
Still they remain the same
Darkness override their light
So they can't seem to live upright
They love the life they're living
Just fighting and more fighting, oh Lord

That's why I say
People  and mek di world terrified
Anyting dem do dem have it well justified
That's why, I an' I must mek nuff sacrifice
Fi teach di world and mek dem realise, Lord
Dem must a walk in di Commandments of love
White as a serpent and harmless as a dove
See Jah Jah pon di ears an' sight
A' Him a' up above and inna yuh heart it musta run clean
And yuh clean out all evil
Lord, they can't see Your Holy light
So they can't seem to live upright
