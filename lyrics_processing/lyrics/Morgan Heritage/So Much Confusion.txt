Cha, bare madness a gwan ya nuh
Fire fi all of those that mislead Jah children! (Ha ha ha)
Threat not by sin because of evil doors
Neither be envious against the workers of iniquity
For they shall soon be cutten down like the grass
And wither as the green herbs of Rastafari

So much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastarfari children and his doctrin, ooii
So much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin, oh Lord

For so long I have been a witness
Of the stumbling of our people
Because we fail to recognize the truth, Lord help
That Rastafari is the king of Christianity in this time
Manifesting the return of Jesus Christ, oh Lord
I've seen the rising and the fall of many people
All of whom been called by the spirit of Jah
Drifting away from the divinity of Haile Selassie
Going about exalting their own, false illusion
You might also like
Causing so much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin, ooii
So much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin, oh Lord

A true Rastaman will tell you he's the ancient Christian
Through the line of Ethiopia
We find this truth in Lalibela
King Ras Tafari gave us the teachings
But some don't understand it
And before try to understand
Some even try to recreate it

So there is so much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin, ooii
So much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin
And while we're wasting our time
Ethiopians, calling on the creator - yeah
For what reason?  For all the children Rastafari inspired abroad
Ethiopians, calling on the creator - yeah
For what reason?  For all the children Rastafari inspired abroad

Still there's so much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin, ooii
So much, so much confusion
So much, so much misconception, (misconception)
Surrounding Rastafari children and his doctrin
