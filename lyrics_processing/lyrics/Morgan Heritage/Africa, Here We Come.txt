Woooaahhh oh oh oh oh woaah
Oh God

We came to earth and found ourselves in the West
Each day of our lives we seek that life which is the best
And as we lift our eyes to the East
We see that land flowing with milk and honey
Big ship is sailing home
So come along, come along, come along
Brothers and sisters going home
We are aware and prepared now
That time is here, so...

Africa here we come
We're driving to our fathers land
Africa here we come
We're driving to the Promised Land

We are the rightful owners
We're gonna  soldiers
We're crossing all different borders
Arriving at our final destination, Ethiopia
Oh mother of civilisation
We're tired of all this persecution
Welcome us home with love and grace
Oh mama Africa we see that smile on your face

It's a feeling that's deep down within'
Where Africans are broken hear our ancestors callin'
And as we lift our eyes to the East
We see that land flowing with milk and honey
Big ship is sailing home
So come along, come along, come along
Brothers and sisters going home
We are aware and prepared now
That time is here, so...
Africa here we come
We're driving to our fathers land
