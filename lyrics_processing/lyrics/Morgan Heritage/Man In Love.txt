Gotta get these thoughts off my mind
Gotta get them off my mind
I need them off my mind
Mind
See, they've just got me wondering why?
Wondering why?
Why, why, why?

Father, all I'm asking for is 4 minutes of your time
To sing a few words that's been plaguing my mind
See I don't have a problem with the way my life's been going
But I have thoughts and it's you I should be telling
You've given me five children by two different women
And I'll always love 'em both but I'm still searching
'Cause I haven't yet found my wife sent to me from heaven
And this is what I'm wondering...yeah

Is there a woman out there to truly love me and show me care
I've tried two times but I'm still yet not a man in love
What good is the world to me if it ain't got a wife for me?
When all I really wanna be is just a man in love

Listen
I don't live for myself but they don't understand
'coz you've gave me this gift to sing throughout the
Land
I know they're only women and I should show compassion
But they never stick around and wait for that to happen
All they see is that I'm all around the world
Thinking every country I'd have a different girl
Sometimes I say to myself, "why is she doing this to me?"
"Why is she tryna bring me misery?"

So, is there a woman out there to truly love me and show me care
I've tried two times but I'm still yet not a man in love
What good is the world to me if it ain't got a wife for me?
When all I really wanna be is just a man in love

Uh, I wonder why all my tries can never add up
To say bye bye all those times, yo I had enough
To see my pride go down the drain, and have to get up
Lord made me a man and I'm worthy of love so
Being ungrateful is the last thing I could ever think of doing
Achieving my dreams and giving my children a future is all your doing
But true love I'm searching for to be complete
Father send me someone 'coz I'ma patiently wait
So, is there a woman out there to truly love me and show me care
I've tried two times but I'm still yet not a man in love
What good is the world to me if it ain't got a wife for me?
When all I really wanna be is just a man in love

Is there a woman out there to truly love me and show me care
I've tried two times but I'm still yet not a man in love
What good is the world to me if it ain't got a wife for me?
