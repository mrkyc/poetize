I can't have it no... no no no
Yo
If it wasn't for my name
Wasn't for the fame
Would you wanna be my main
Squeeze baby
If it wasn't for the hype
Would you have the time to
Have an intrest in my life
I dont think so baby
If it wasn't for the diamonds and the pearls
Would you want to share my world?
You need not say a word heres
Some questions for your mind
Do you love rastafari
Or even rastafarian life
Cause if its all about the hype girl
I can't have you in my life
Im that same roots rastaman yo
You didn't want in your world
Remember you told me before id never come to nothing girl
I never change my lifestyle at all ,see and ive seen the world
So tell me why should i give you all and have you as my one and only girl
There was a time my heart was yearning for you to be in my life
Baby your the only girl i try to be with more than twice
Now tell me why all of a sudden that am a holy man you want me
Baby now because theres fame to my name doesnt mean ive changed
Do you love rastafari
Or even rastafarian life
Cause if its all about the hype girl
