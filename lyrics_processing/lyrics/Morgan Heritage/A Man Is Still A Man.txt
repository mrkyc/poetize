Chorus
A man is still a man whether him wear jacket and tie, or walk barefoot
The only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man whether him rich or poor black or white for sure
The only difference is whether him good or evil
Verse 1
Listen Friends. Lots of different people on the streets wiping car glass windows
This is what they do day to day just to get a little food to eat
Then you have others wearing suit and tie, work a good nine to five
And they take it for granted that they're living a better life
I say the color of our skin don't mean a thing if we do good or commit to sin
We're all judged by the same, and Jah is his holy name
So lets all be aware of how we entertain angels unaware
For angels do move through men, whether here or from there
Chorus
A man is still a man whether him wear jacket and tie, or walk barefoot
The only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man whether him rich or poor black or white for sure
The only difference is whether him good or evil

Everyman has freedom, ya
For the wealth of a man
Be sure when living life
We treat all men right
For we are all of the same
Hear the words I cry
Chorus
A man is still a man whether him wear jacket and tie, or walk barefoot
The only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man whether him rich or poor black or white for sure
The only difference is whether him good or evil
Hear these words again. Lots of different people on the streets wiping car glass windows
This is what they do day to day just to get a little food to eat
Then you have others wearing suit and tie, work a good nine to five
And they take it for granted that they're living a better life
Chorus
A man is still a man whether him wear jacket and tie, or walk barefoot
The only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man whether him rich or poor black or white for sure
The only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man(x3)
Only difference is whether him good or evil
A man is still a man(x3)
