Hear mi nuh baby. Whoa na na na na (Whoa na na na)
Baby whoa na na na (baby whoa na na)
Just one touch, one kiss from your lips, it's heaven, yeah
(Chorus)
Loving you is like the perfect love song
You know the one that you always wanna hear
And when my day's going all wrong
Seeing you is like the song in my ear
So all I need is you baby, body to body, with only you baby, and I don't need another
Cause baby what we got, we got a perfect, perfect love song
(1st verse)
Ah just di way you look pon mi when you see mi (see mi)
And di way you put it pon mi when you gimme (gimme)
Ah suh mi love when di fyah blaze, you see mi (see mi)
Nah guh see mi roam round like I'm a gypsy
You're like peas to a pod, queen to a king, bullet to a gun
What they got in common is they all belong together. And it's made me realize...
(Chorus)
Loving you is like the perfect love song
You know the one that you always wanna hear
And when my day's going all wrong
Seeing you is like the song in my ear
So all I need is you baby, body to body, with only you baby, and I don't need another
Cause baby what we got, we got a perfect, perfect love song

You got me overjoyed with the love that you're giving to me, and mi cyan't ask fi nothing more (nothing more) and all I need, I already have, cause you're here with me. Baby it's you and I forevermore. Baby you're like a plane to the sky, car to the street, key to the ignition, baby what they got in common is they all belong together. And it's made me realize that...
(Chorus)
Loving you is like the perfect love song
You know the one that you always wanna hear
And when my day's going all wrong
Seeing you is like the song in my ear
So all I need is you baby, body to body, with only you baby, and I don't need another
Cause baby what we got, we got a perfect, perfect love song
(DJ verse)
Baby! Everything about this love we share is perfect (perfect)
Nothing nuh deh a road weh can come near it (nuh worth it)
Every room you step inna, you light it up like light's inna
Times Square, New Years Eve, Electric City, Tokyo
Woman your love ah fall pon mi like di falls of Niagra
Lift mi higher than di peeks pon di mountains of Kenya
With you I reach a level that is ever blessed
It's made me realize (made me realize)
(Chorus)
Loving you is like the perfect love song
You know the one that you always wanna hear
And when my day's going all wrong
Seeing you is like the song in my ear
So all I need is you baby, body to body, with only you baby, and I don't need another
