Ey yo
Take a look around you, take a look inside you
Take a look at the things happening day to day
It's crazy.  Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo judge not
Cos in the last days the righteous shall be righteous still
And the wickedness of men manifest will come back in time to test
To see and prove all those that hold onto Jah bless and see the revelation continue to manifest

Judge not; let the righteous be righteous still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the unjust be unjust still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not, let the holy be holy still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the filthy be filthy still. Oh Oh Oh Oh

Judge not least ye be judged my friend, leave all judgment onto Jah we say, for who is man to play God?  We're as filthy as the dust from whence we came, we're like the green grass today and tomorrow we fade away

Judge not; let the righteous be righteous still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the unjust be unjust still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not, let the holy be holy still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the filthy be filthy still. Oh Oh Oh Oh

Behold Jah comes quickly with his reward my friend, Oh oh oh. To give every man according to his works shall bear, he's alpha and omega, first and last, beginning and the end we say.  Know that Jah is the creator of man, and all judgment dun rest in his hand, yeh

So Judge not; let the righteous be righteous still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the unjust be unjust still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not, let the holy be holy still, let Jah manifest his will, judge not let the filthy be filthy still. (X2)
Judge not (till fade)
