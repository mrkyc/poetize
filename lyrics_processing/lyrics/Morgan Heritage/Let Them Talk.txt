Blessed be Jah my rock who teaches my hands
To wage war and my fingers to do the battle
My love, my fortress, my strong hold, my deliverer, my
Shield in whom I've taken
Refuge and the one who subdues my people under me
Oh Jah, what is man? Man is breath, his days are like
Passing shadow
Oh, Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend, touch the
Mountains so that they
Smoke, flash forth the lightning and strike them, shoot
Forth thy arrows and
Confound them
