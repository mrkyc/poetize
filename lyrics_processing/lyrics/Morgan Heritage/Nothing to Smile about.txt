Nuff people come to jamaica and nuh know how we live
Think Seh EVERYTHING nice through we full of vibes and think
Dem say want feelin to dem heart when dem get fi overstand di real thing yeaah

Mi deh ya a town one day
A par with a white man weh come all the way from Norway
And him turn to mi and say
How comes Jamaica full of so much screwface
Same time mi lift mi head to the sky
And a tear drop fall from mi eye
Mi Say my youth come we go out for a drive
Mek mi show you why mi cry

Look pon di gully side
Do you see anything fi smile bout
Look at that hungry child
Do you see anything fi smile bout
Look at the school weh deh youth dem go fi get dem education
Do you see anything fi smile bout
Look at the conditions of our police stations
Do you see anything fi smile bout

Same time the bredda say
How can a nation believe in this way
And the next thing him say
How can the government play so many games
Same time mi heart fall to the ground
Cause dis much war where that comes from
Certain place they are worse dan slum
Youth man come
