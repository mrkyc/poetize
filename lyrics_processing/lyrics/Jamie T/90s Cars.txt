Live between the corners of my sheets
In a settling score I sell floats and flippers
Got too many shores
And high tides coming up the street
Drink too much when I'm trying to get to sleep
Same time I saw you
Same time that I knew
Tread water like a mortar in the company I keep
I came with a tonne of fifty on the ones
Still writing letters to the families of the deceased
I think too much when I'm trying to get to sleep
Same time I saw you
Same time that I knew

So set me on her love
Let her let me drain my blood
Sell by dates in 90s cars

I first saw you
It was at a party
Thought you wasn't cool
I'm so floaty
90s cars
See Jamie T LiveGet tickets as low as $138You might also like
Like an animal instinctively I creep
I'm the last of the bastards
Bar staff have to be nice to and save a seat
They talk to me the same way that they talk to police
With an air of distaste
A bell of hate
Welcome to the working week
And I don't mind
You know I keep keeping on to keep
And in a room full of doors
I blow smoke and mirrors
When keys don't unlock they bump you off your feet
There ain't no time like the present to leave
The same time I saw you
Same time they fade from my view

So set me on a love
Let me drain her blood
Let me live in pubs
Let her fuck me up
Sell by dates in 90s cars

I first saw you
It was at a party
Thought you wasn't cool
I'm so floaty
Haste in crates
Making love
Sell by dates in 90s cars
Smashed out windows
Broken glass
Egg shells walk on shattered hearts
Making a killing to make this last
Blood cells pump with cut up drugs
First time I saw you it's dark
First time they fade from my view

I first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide
Anything
Sell by dates in 90s cars
Oh I want you
Oh I want you
