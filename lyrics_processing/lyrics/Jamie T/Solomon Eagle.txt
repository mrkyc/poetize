I feel everything, deep in my head, it's spinning
Good and evil, lost in the city with the people
And it's ticking
We won't be forgiven

My name's Solomon, Solomon, Solomon Eagle
Run through the city, full of evil
Streets like the jungle, keep your head down
Keep your hands up when you move around
And God willing, they can all make a killing
I'm on top of this, dropping this, sipping a sequel
Stun guns and tear gas people
When police line up, pulling truncheons out
They beat the mob down to disperse the crowd
And God willing, we can all make a killing

It's not the devil pulling you down
This retribution comes from above
This is God, this is God giving up on us
This is God giving up

And it's bottles and bricks, makeshift wicks
Balaclav, Molotov, number-one hits
Coming with the trick, leaving in a whip
Wheezing out my lungs as the truncheon hits
And there's nothing like revenge hidden in success
Served so cold that the beef can't sweat
Solomon is blessed, Solomon sees you
Cower in the corner, looking up at the steeple
I'm the only get to know me
I'm the one with her blood on my hands
I'm here to show you, here to tell you
That I love you in the city of the damned
And though I love you, I will leave you
And I leave you in the desert hot sand
I'll introduce you to the devil
And the devil, he will take you by the hand

It's not the devil pulling you down
This retribution comes from above
This is God, this is God giving up on us
This is God giving up

I suppose the world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast. He, though not infected at all but in his own head, went about denouncing of judgment upon the city in a frightful manner, sometimes quite naked...

I feel everything deep in my head, it's spinning
Good and evil lost in the city with the people

It's not the devil pulling you down
This retribution comes from above
This is God, this is God giving up on us
This is God giving up
It's not the devil pulling you down
This retribution comes from above
This is God, this is God giving up on us
