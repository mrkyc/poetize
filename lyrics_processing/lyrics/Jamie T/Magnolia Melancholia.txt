Nice to meet you, boy, I know your mama knows
I fell in love with her seven-thousand summers ago
I was a runner kid, a too-much, too-heartily kid
Your mama helped me out
And now I'm here to pay the due back, Joe
Nice to meet you, boy, I knew your mama's song
I knew how she would move along to every rhythm
I know she'll best for you, she wants to get the rest of you
They're here to take care of you
Whatever you need to come home through

Sad, juiced up, loose cannon fodder
We used to be happily savagery
Fell rapidly into love telepathy
I must admit, before I slipped, your mother knew the best of me
Mad, clued up, we were not lovers
Band of brother, sister, Easy Company
Didn't tell me she was sick until she wrote to me
Then out of the blue, the years we knew
They all come flooding back to me

Magnolia melancholic love
Magnolia melancholia
Magnolia melancholic love
Magnolia melancholia

Like how she smiled and how I cried and how I finally fell
Like how I lied and how we died inside the Chelsea hotel
Like when she told me I had never had a broken heart
Well, I was mad, I said a couple of things I shouldn't have
We didn't talk for years, it's clear to me I was ostracised
She threw me out her heart, her head
Her soul, her whole damn life
Sitting on the other side of London, penance for shit
I guess this all just hurt too much for her to deal with it

This is just a story I tell
She's alive and well
Somewhere in the city swell
I guess I just miss my friend
As for the broken heart
It breaks every time I start
I guess I just miss my friend
As for the broken heart
It breaks every time I start
I guess I just miss my friend
As for the broken heart
