A lot of people around here
Lost the whites in their eyes
I see the lust inside your heart
So why don't you go and touch the sky?

Think with the head, argue with the gut
Drafty, though leave the door open
It might encourage customers in, I wish the barmaid shut
Look like shit, down on my luck
Two World Wars and one World Cup
Screamed by the desperate divided crutch
Used to have an empire, then we grew up
Lost everything, who gives a fuck?
Money in the jukebox rots all night
Same shit bands, too much hype
Everyone knows everyone sees fights
Everyone drinks on the corner, right?
Everyone knows as I see blood type
Same we match, and we match alike
I love her, she loves me, too
That's why we get together

A lot of people around here
Lost the whites in their eyes
I see the lust inside your heart
And I don't wanna touch the sky

He's dizzy for Lizzy, I'm dizzy generally
Scapegoated by a girl befriending me
Not that I care, it's the only use for me
She bounce off walls, through doors, I tend to be
Everything I wanna be and everything less
I stress this guess to front the mistress
Heavy and heavy on your lungs, down your spine
Shit, I got pleurisy
You're leaving alone but you came together
Who made the sun turn stormy weather?
Leaving alone but you came together
Who made the sun turn stormy weather?

A lot of people around here
Lost the whites in their eyes
I see the lust inside your heart
And I don't wanna touch the sky

She said, "Tonight, Jay, I'm gonna teach them a ballad"
An Englishman in every coward
I was kind of impressed by the way she dressed
I've scoured this land to find a girl empowered
Asked her again why her heart turned sour
One of the ones that the boys devoured
If you're gonna learn a song, gotta sing along
There's an Englishman in every coward
I got money in a jukebox, rots all night
Same shit bands, too much hype
Everyone knows everyone sees fights
Everyone drinks in the corner, right?
Everyone knows as I see blood type
Same we match, and we match alike
Well, I love her, she loving me too
That's why we get together
A lot of people around here
Lost the whites in their eyes
I see the lust inside your heart
And I don't wanna touch the sky
A lot of people around here
Lost the whites in their eyes
I see the lust inside your heart
