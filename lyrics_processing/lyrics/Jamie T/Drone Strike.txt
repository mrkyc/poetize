They're continuing to manoeuvre at the south-west
They're at the road junction now
One of them's carrying something, Sir
That looks like a large weapon
You see that? It looks like a large weapon of some kind
That looks like a fully loaded Gibson SG
Okay, we'll be coming inbound at four-zero; five-five-five
Yeah, yeah, you got it
Trick, trick, trick
Wa-hoo!

I remember way back, back in the day
When people used to roll up masquerades
Crazy Moschino on a pastel base
Paid more to gambalino on an accolade
Look pale, set sail, man, Livin' La Vida Loca
He's giving her a kiss and now he's giving her coca
I don't know much but he know how it choke her
You don't know much, but I know he's a joker
In any other case, pace matters
Bass at the back with a beat like Hammer
Drinks at the bar, no glitz and glamour
No hits, just bangers, these kids, they're crackers
In any other case, I'm flattered
You're lookin' like shit when you turned up battered
Everything I hit well, I miss with a clanger
I'm a moonlight manor and a shoe-tight scammer

Been doing this a long time, feel like I'm old time
But I still smell fresh, Bitches Brew
And I still laugh and you still gasp
Well, I guess what I say is dumbfounding you
Done clowning you, done changing up
It's not much fun 'cause you can't keep up
So I slowed down and I threw it up
On the wall like a dub in the train yard shut, but
Still goes overhead like an old football
In a barbed wire fence, but
I said what I said and I bled my heart from the start, regrets are
Just hard to get, harder to lose in the news, hothead
Smack in the mouth, pal, down you went
You deserve every stitch in the face, I swear

Watch out for the drones, drones, drones, drones, drones

I don't know how to let you go
And I don't how to let you leave
Guess we're all out here alone
Like ghosts in the machine
Guess we're all drones
All drones
We're all drones
Guess we're all drones

Watch out for the drones, drones, drones, drones, drones
