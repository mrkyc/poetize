This is out to the lost years parted
To the doom and the gloom boys (Woo)
To the tell, PJD and Kelly
To Bingul and all of the cage lot
And to all of the friendly faces
And to all of the family ties
And to all of my enemies hatred
I stand here and watch you with dilate eyes

She went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love, he went

So much happened, no tit-for-tat tapping
Got plucked from a stage in a Hounslow gaff, rapping
Got stuck on a page in a rage of my book
Everywhere I went, they stared, so I looked
Went over the hills and far away
Ended up alone in all manner of place
Ended up alone with only my face
Looking in the mirror to recognise Jay's
Got pills in the pocket and time to waste
A shitload of problems and a mind of a hate
A tic and a Bic and a violent shake
To get grits and fits and minor breaks, and
I looked up for faith then, fell down to break
Spent a lot of time battling
Haggling the matter with the devil I make

She clutched my hand in the Brixton Jamm
Then slammed another man in a foreign land
My heart sunk and I drunk and I understand
It's hard being rich in a poor man's land
Then my ma got sick, and then so did you
On the level, I'm a rebel
I was battling the devil that's bedevilling you
She couldn't talk or walk or remember me
My frustration, the patient, the A&E
The correlation between the diagnostics team
Led me to believe it was her heart on her sleeve that
Got her caught in a rut and made her drink too much
The loss of two children outside the building
When her Daddy shot that shotgun shot

She went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love
He went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love
Then out of the blue, seem to come to
Sitting with the devil that I definitely knew
He had news and clues for my point of view
He sold me up the river with the delta blues and I
Took a minute and stopped, I watched the sun come up
Thought of Matthew and Alex
And if they still had it, would they still give it up?
Plus I owe it to them both to live a full life of
Love and respect for what they gave up
Call to connect to Lolly, she picked up
All I could say is "I'm sorry", then choked up
Living in the old rock-bottom life
So downtrodden and rotten and fucked up
Can't stop stopping, I'm not beyond nothing
Still living with the devil, but the devil shut up

She went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love
He went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love
Wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
Caught in the crossfire love
He went wrang-ba-ba-boom, a crash-bang wallop
And she shut up shop
Caught in the crossfire of love
