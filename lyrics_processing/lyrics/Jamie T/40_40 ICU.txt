Well, loose lips, man, them sink ships, baby
I'm up in the punch, she in the back, gettin' ready
I had to take a detour to buy my girl a bevvy
This just ain't the right time to be comin' off a rem-y
I'm a bad boy, man, ya never forget-y
Had to bring myself down just to get on your lev-y
That's why I'm sad, boy, that's why I'm so damn heavy
Had to carry up the baggage, payin' penance for Penny

She was a bad girl, green eyes and lippy
Drippy from the clitty when I lost my virgin-y
She was a bad girl, and she lived in the Viccy
Just a bubble-wrapped boy, I came into her city
I'm on a flight now, it's why I'm high and trippy
The bloodsuckers are trying to leech off me
I tick-tick-tick, I'm like a time bomb, sick-y
I'm right at the brink, if you've been, come get me

I close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Feelin' all around and I see you blue
Standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view
Close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Lookin' all around and I see you blue
You're standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view

Said I'm past it, why don't ya bury my casket?
I mask it, and then I'll come back laughing
I cull it, and then I'll come back haunting
Juicin' up down and then I'll get your heart split
I'm on it, I've never been back off it
You want it, I know you need it, miss me
Used to please me, oh, bring me down easy
I ain't come down since September, cheesy

Runnin', off the kit, you're gunnin'
I duck down and I feel it's funnin'
And now I feel it, man, I'm up in the function
Ain't never been gone and now I'm back for corruption
And I leave it, leave it, asked to please it
You missed me? Aw, I missed me too
If you were easy, then I'd come and get me
But easy sheezy ain't gon' please-y breezy

I close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Feelin' all around and I see you blue
Standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view
Close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Lookin' all around and I see you blue
You're standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view
I close my eyes in the midday sun
Lived in a place where the demons run
The darkness hides a lot of fun
And I lost it all with you
But you can't leave me now
No, you can't leave me now
And you can't leave me now
Feet don't fail me now

I close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Feelin' all around and I see you blue
Standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view
Close my eyes, count one to a hundred
Hidin' and I'll seek you in the sickest function
Lookin' all around and I see you blue
You're standin' in the corner, hidin' in full view

One to a hundred, sickest function
See you blue, standin' in full view
One to a hundred, sickest function
