Bye-bye, baby, I'll see you later
Bye-bye, baby, I'll see you later

My man looks like the old Shakin' Stevens
He says I resemble like the old Steptoe
He sits down slow, but quick sniff up the blow
Reminisce about beans and how we all do grow
And the good man says, "Bloody feel like leaving"
But he's lean again, forgotten what I already know
Made enough money shotting Bobby, bills and po
He spent it all quick sniffing up on the blow

Hard for your playing, no smoking on the night bus
No shit, Holmes with your big boy Sherlock
The man got chickenpox at twenty-three
If you go down the docks, you better take all of your money
It ain't no dunny, it's a toilet
Great granddaddy got sent there, so go back home
Stop clogging up pubs with your bullshit talking
And the night buses are complaining at us
Peeps call us right-wing, but we're pretty fucking liberal
I shit you not, 'cause we're all for the equal
And yes, J, I agree, the first Predator
Is much better than the sequel
No question, the second one's feeble
Kids with skids are coughing up dust
Yeah, I waited, man, I cuss, must, oh man
Now bike chain broken, now that too much rust
And people slowly stepping in ways trying to cuss us

Here's ya getaway
I ain't gonna try to cry
(Hard for your playing, no smoking on the night bus)
And so I must say
(Kids with skids are coughing up dust)
I sad to see you cut the ties
(Good man says, "Bloody feel like leaving")

In these cities, hard to see the stars overhead
Can see the moon low, the street light turns it blood red
The star symbolises the cuts we bled
The mouth got fed, the winding alleys that we tread
The moon much bigger representing the dead
Who lie in the sewers under soldier's feet
They stir as you march, while you're asleep, they walk the street
Put your ears to the drain, you can hear them weep
So we all chatted about it and we decided you should

Get away, here's ya getaway
You're getting away, man, here's ya getaway
And bye-bye baby, I'll see you later
I'll see you later, here's ya getaway
Rob the bank, here's ya getaway
And I'll take my ticket, get out of this town
And get away, here's ya getaway
Ah, cha-cha, baby, here's ya getaway
Rob the bank, take the getaway
And I'll talk to the peeps, hear 'em as I say
Oh, oh, get yourself out of this city, oh, get away
Oh man, here's ya getaway
And I'd get away, get away, I'd get away
And I'd show up to the peeps, I'd see what I say
Oh, rob the bank, make a getaway
And I'll rob, rob, rob, but I'll take a getaway
Here's ya getaway
(Bye-bye, baby, I'll)
I ain't gonna try to cry
But I must say
(Bye-bye, baby, I'll see you later)
I sad to see you cut the ties
