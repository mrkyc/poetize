Upside down, inside out
If I had a gun, I'd blow my brains out
Fifty-thousand feet up in the clouds
If I had a gun, I'd blow my brains out

Rolling the dice, two and a three
There ain't nothing left if you're leaving me
Get out of my head, get out of my bed
Cannibal love, animal lies
Annabel's heart, Annabel's thighs
Everything now that you've ever dreamed of

Upside down, inside out
If I had a gun, I'd blow my brains out
Fifty-thousand feet up in the clouds
If I had a gun, I'd blow my brains out

Now that you're gone, now I can't breathe
I feel the rush from the empathy, yeah
And I wanna touch and all I wanna be
Is the only one you ever need
High strung maestro plants a seed, yeah
And I don't know and I feel like it's killing me
