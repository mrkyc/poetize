Bottle of wine and old 45s
Rifle in the corner that her grandfather left her when he died
Said, "No surprise, I've had to use it quite a few times
So Jay, don't you ever let us down, don't you ever
I'll have to shoot you and no one will hear a sound"

Bruised and bloodied, I'm lying on the ground
And I am aware that I let the poor girl down
Now I'm dying as a message to the town
This what happens if you fuck around
And meddle if you want trouble
Trouble, then you should meddle
But don't ever meddle with Emily's heart

She said, get your coat, come on
To the dog track with a money wrap
Yeah, we had some fun, left with more 'cause we won
I was under investigation on suspicion of doing her wrong
She said, "You've become a villain, accused of a hit-and-run"
(I've become a villain, accused of a hit-and-run)
Said, it hit me first and I say it's the worst
That I ever felt in a broken heart
Said, uh, blood stains on a shirt crease
I hope she pays the dues
When I left, she said that your last breath
Will be down by the station at two
So she shot me down

This is what happens if you fuck around
So meddle if you want trouble
Trouble, then you should meddle
But don't ever meddle with Emily's heart

She said I'm a user, and she's a loser with a gun
I said, "If you choose to, it becomes hard to include anyone
So if you stay, put it away, or should I run?"
She said, "I think you know the answer to your question"
So for the smiles and all of the miles the engine's done
The further I drive away, the closer we become
So if I stay, would you put it away and forgive this one son?
She said, "Jay, I think you know the answer to your question"

Bruised and bloodied, I'm lying on the ground
And I am aware that I let the poor girl down
Now I'm dying as a message to the town
