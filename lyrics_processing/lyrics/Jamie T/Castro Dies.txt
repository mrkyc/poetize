You're messing up my mind
You do it all the time
And that's why enemies, enemies and lovers
Will never be friends of mine

Speak treat west like a stain on the chest
Of a white collar, why do I bother? Money
Love hates, honour grates, if I look down, I'm a goner
I'll end up working for the BBC as a runner
Burning bills, sloughed my fish, wonder died of hunger
Friends stopped calling this time last summer
Sit, drown sorrows and I start to sigh
Gotta get there before Castro dies

So what happened? It just started?
A lawsuit
So what happened? So what happened?
J-j-j-j-j-just started?
A local story

Plight my guilt with highs that she smuggled with trouble
In bubble wrap up the gap strapped between her thighs
So surprising when you meet her, she seemed so shy
Considering she got balls that are twice the size
Of you plus me, first to give me, let me try
Better buy 'em all 'cause they're in short supply
So here's a conversation we can have when we fly
Gotta get there before Castro dies

You're messing up my mind
You do it all the time
I just can't take your lies
Boy, you're just going down on a low
I just can't take the lies
You're messing up my mind
And that's why enemies, enemies and lovers
Will never be friends of mine

I have a lesson learned, enemy burned, saving up my bandages
A non-believer turned can be the loyalest of advocates
On aggregate, I'm smashing it
I'm lacking, backing, but trashing it
I'm slacking and jacking the chips you're stacking
And spending 'm all on sandwiches
You ask me how it's done, well I just know how to handle it
See through critic cynic scum
Who think you're branded packages
And if you wanna come, you know what I'll be brandishing
A speaker full of lyrics, beats and loops that I've been sampling

You're messing up my mind
You do it all the time
I just can't take your lies
Boy, you're just going down on a low
I just can't take the lies
You're messing up my mind
And that's why enemies, enemies and lovers
Will never be friends of mine
So what happened? It just started?
A lawsuit
So what happened? It just started?
A lawsuit
So what happened? So what happened?
Just started? Just started?
A lawsuit, a lawsuit
So what happened? So what happened?
J-j-j-j-j-just started?
