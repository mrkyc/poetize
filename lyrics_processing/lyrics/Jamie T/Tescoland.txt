Jerry to aisle 5
'Peat, Jerry to frozen foods aisle 5
'S a clean-up needed
'S blood on the floor, 's been a suicide
Jerry? Jerry? Jerr!

I ain't got a first line, sing for whatever
Always in the heart beat a friend of mine
New York, New York in a hot, hot summer
Leaving the place low all of the time
"I just got my heart broke home in the winter"
"Oh no", he said, Paul laugh and a cry
Don't ever tell them the old broke record
They won't understand or even know of this crime, yeah

But it's hard for Americans
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walkin' through Tescoland

I wait on a long time friend undercovers
West 23rd words cursed in the wine
Doesn't matter how far in a bus I travel
I still feel the twist and the turn of Mean Time
I'm not gonna call her a thief or whatever
Breaking in the back doors of my mind
You look just like my old young lover
I relive the past in a last fast find, yeah
See Jamie T LiveGet tickets as low as $138You might also like
But it's hard for Americans
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walkin' through Tescoland

Tescoland, oh, it's a stand
Metro get ya, let's go Tescoland
Tescoland, Tescoland
Get ya Metro, let's go, let's go

I was just a fool too, singing a new low
What's new? I've fallen from my old high street
Base can get you through, I'm broader than Broadway
Broader than Broadway in my own defeat
Who am I kidding, man? I love to hate
Love to sail away like a rolling stone
Every plan I make is meant to take me further away
But I always end up back at
Home, home, back home

In Tescola-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-and

In Tescola-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-and
In Tescoland
I guess it's hard for an Englishman
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walkin' through Tescoland
