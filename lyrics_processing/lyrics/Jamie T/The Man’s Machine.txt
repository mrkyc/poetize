This song's one of our first songs off the new album
It's about punks, skins, straights
I was walking along the street, minding my own affair
Suddenly, two policemen grabbed me and I wasn't aware
They said, "Is your name Mensi?" I said, "Why, sure"
He says, "You're the punk that I've been waiting for
You're nicked"

Better the devil you know
Confess, I guess I was the lesser of the two evils
Convalesce about the stress the test caused
Had me up and on the board
Now I'm chairman of the board, I'm coming back for sequels
Do you ever really think you've won?
Nah, you're feeble, nothing on this far-gone son
Or his people know nothing of the shit I've done
Sailed the seven seas to catch a breeze
And took it back home in a trunk
Met a matador who said his wild woman is more
Terrifying than any red bull that he saw
Set a sail, set a rail, met them kings and queens
There's so many trust just the amphetamines
Well, her dream would've been that the boy's got clean
That her father never got his heart
Caught up in the man's machine
But it seems, even if I go away
There's always a part of me willing to stay

Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Underground travel in overcast weather
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Maybe one day things will get better
(Check, check, check, check
One, two, three, kick)

I met gods and monsters, women from Wisconsin
Swimming in linen with another that's not their partner
Chicago beats, a bass drum; on my journey, I met Ernie
Showed me spots where Al Capone got drunk
I'm a lover, I'm a brother and a son
I'm a traitor and I'm on the run, watch 'em come
As she said while she driving in her car
"Katie's drunker than the bar"
She's been smacking hard shoulders since before she's legal
I'm a dragnet running through the city of sin
And he's a hard-done bastard taking it in
Well, I see what I say, save it on the way
You can't sit and bawl but they're bawling away
Well, she's cried all the tears for all of their fears
Well, she run away, she set the place
Now we'll never see is the fears
Take it as she's seen it, get away
Well, there's always a part of her, she's willing to stay
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Underground travel in overcast weather
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Maybe one day things will get better

Run, run, boy-o, chase it to the border, border
Shoulda oughta sorta told her I was cannon fodder
Would've if I could've screamed to her, shout and holler
Then I could've saved the girl from the man's machine
Run boy-o, chase it to the border, border
Shoulda oughta sorta told her I was cannon fodder
Would've if I could've screamed to her, shout and holler
Then I could've saved the girl from the man's machine

Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Underground travel in overcast weather
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All we've got to keep us together
