Wrapped in cling film, staying 'til the morning
Working in a shop off New Bond Street
Lived in your building, high up on the ceiling
When she rushed, the floorboards creaked
Out in this town, haunting again
You're calling up my friends
Trying to find out where I've been
I'ma holding, holding again
Gave money to the man, he put a bag in my hand
Said, "Son, don't you understand?
This isn't the way out, this is the way in
You're doubling your troublin'"

He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
Millilitres down

Where you come from? Where you at, Jack?
Is it the clothes, the bullet holes or the shit up your nose
That makes your body contort like that?
Like a Denmark Street thief feeding the crack
The clap applauds the furore for the fractured jaw
That was given to the government tax
Way back then when Maggie-aggie-aggie
Always made him sad but she never made him happy
I was lost, weak, bleak in the street
Knocked me off of my feet
Hanging 'round with the people I should never meet
I always believed that the air that we breathed
Would choke our lungs and clog up our arteries
Now, down on my knees saying nothing to please
Take him down, throw him out and then you call the police
I'm up now, sitting in the gutter
Rollin' back down before you come upper

While the nameless are swapping infections
Ketamine Jim, he had a spin and went mad and got sectioned
I was outside trying to shotgun a ride
Off a guy who, like I, has no sense of direction
Tension is building in the White Hart pub
By the time we drove by, the floor's covered in blood
Man next to me said, "They're all fucking mugs"
I used to roll with them cunts before I fell in love
With a brunette rough-neck fits like a glove
Kept me back down when I came back up
When my feet hit the ground, man, I started to run
And since that day, that's all that I've done
So if you ever see me if the town falls down
Jester starts screaming as he steals the Queen's crown
You know they'll be lost and I'll be found
'Cause I'm three-hundred and sixty-eight down

He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
Millilitres down
It's the only way that you're getting out
If you hang around, boys 'round here, they'll bring you down
It's the only way that you're getting out
If you hang around, boys 'round here, they'll bring you down
It's the only way that you're getting out
If you hang around, boys 'round here, they'll bring you down
It's the only way that you're getting out
If you hang around, boys 'round here, they'll bring you down
It's the only way that you're getting out
If you hang around, boys 'round here, they'll bring you down

He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
He's three-hundred, three-hundred and sixty-eight
