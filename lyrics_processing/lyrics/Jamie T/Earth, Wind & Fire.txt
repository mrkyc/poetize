To the queen of hearts is the ace of sorrow
He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
If my love leaves me, what shall I do?

Queens in the pocket, girl in a locket
Say, "Oo-blay," say, "Oo-blay," say, "Boop-doop-da"
Boys wanna knock it, other wanna rob it
Say, "Oo-blay, bay-doop-bay, bay-doop-doop-da"
I see when you're coming, girl, you look stunning
Running for the friends of mine
Well, it's more for the power and the hour after hour
Well, he's itching for the powder one time
Well, it's dear for the fire, hate for the liar
Living for the bass and beat
Close to the wire, no one wanna hire
Didn't want a working week
Well, the old town crier looks for a buyer
Out there finding your feet
In scenes of schemes and drug-filled fiends
Will be fine for someone to meet

I own earth, wind and fire
It breeds the hunger
That keeps me on the road again
It's earth, wind and fire
I don't own thunder
It's owned by a love of mine

With a beat of the drum that made your head spun
See no, hear no, speak no, son
Look like a gun held by the young
In a far gone land shooting everyone
Fee-fee, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
Is the baggage in your bag becoming a problem?
Fee-fee, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
Is the habit that you have still fun?
Counting your losses, carrying crosses
Looking at your face in the dirt
Travelling buses, hiding from the rozzers
Pretending that you're an extrovert
Well, the girl you accosted and then took hostage
Escaped while you were at work
After three years, two days, paranoid drug haze
Couldn't stand to live a life of hurt

I own earth, wind and fire
It breeds the hunger
That keeps me on the road again
It's earth, wind and fire
I don't own thunder
It's owned by a love of mine
With water, blood and wine
She temps me back, time after time
Well, it's earth, wind and fire
I don't own thunder
It's owned by a love of mine
Sorrow
Tomorrow
Ooh

I own earth, wind and fire
It breeds the hunger
That keeps me on the road again
It's earth, wind and fire
I don't own thunder
It's owned by a love of mine
With water, blood and wine
She temps me back, time after time
Well, it's earth, wind and fire
I don't own thunder
