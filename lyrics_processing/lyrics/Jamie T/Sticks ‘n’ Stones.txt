When there's no one left to fight
Boys like him don't shine so bright
Soon as I see the dust settle
He's out on the town tryin' to find trouble
When there's no one left to fight
Boys like him don't shine so bright
Soon as I see the dust settle (Lightweight prick!)
He's out on the town tryin' to find trouble

I take a train again away from shame and blame of city pain
To see a friend I hadn't seen since I was drinking underage
I was a ten-a-day, how'd you say, "little shit"
White lightning heightening on my courage, quick wit
We were thick as thieves in Wallabees
Buttoned shirts and whisky, mutton dressed as lamb
A fan of bands like The Jam, Jam, Jam, Jam
I don't know who I am, he said, "I don't know if I can"
I said, "Yeah, man, you can-can"

When there's no one left to fight
Boys like him don't shine so bright
Soon as I see the dust settle
He's out on the town trying to find trouble
When there's no one left to fight
Boys like him don't shine so bright
Soon as I see the dust settle
He's out on the town trying to find trouble

Drunk and being sick, I feel like shit, I gotta quit
I hope I haven't missed the last train
Can't be stuck in Hampton Wick
With the boys across the platform shouting "Lightweight prick!"
I'm a featherweight champion, cheap to get pissed
Wish Candy were here with a beer, she'd deffa deal with it
Tell 'em all to shut their mouths and go suck their mamas' dicks
But seeing as she ain't, I'll hold three fingers down
Hold the other two up and I'll sing this proud

Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own

As I travel down the track, all my memories flood back
We were running out in some enemies
Back to your mama's flat
It's the only place but home I feel relaxed enough to crap
Know it sounds crude, but there's something in that
How's Danny doing? Hear he's high flying and that
Stockbroker in the city with a lady and a baby
And Fee, is she free from the demons she had?
Was it two months clean, routine to relapse?
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own

She smoked all of your weed
That's why the loved ones had to leave
Why when you take the lead
They stab you in the back 'til you can't breathe?
When you're bleeding on the floor
And no one hears your call at all
She screamed out to the party
"You are sheeps and cattle!"
I was hanging out with Louie in the shooting gallery
When the news got through to me about you and Jeremy
Pat on my back and a swig on my brew
You're still my friend, it's impossible to hate you
Cradle to the grave, I know we always misbehave
People let us down and then they rain on our parade
Girls we love leave when we want them to stay
Like today, remember what Joey say?
When there's no one left to fight
Boys like us don't shine so bright
Soon as I see the dust settle
Let's go out and find some trouble

Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
I take 'em home on my own
Running with believers, no time for fever
And I haven't got time for you either
With your sticks 'n' stones, sticks 'n' stones
