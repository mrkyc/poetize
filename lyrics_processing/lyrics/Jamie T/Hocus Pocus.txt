Bullets flying overhead
Hear 'em through the walls as you lie in bed
Know you're fighting for the one you love
This time, son, I'm telling you to run

Lost myself in things I shouldn't do
Came two years later without you
Things I've done and the things I've seen
I've been so wrong to so many
The team is all looking like they're all past up and away
Disowned from their homes and their families
Well, I can't see myself in the dream
The dream I saw was all around me, got

Hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend
I got hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend

Well, the joker's looking over as he pulling an ace
The militia take cover under my staircase
Witches in the kitchen, bitching and itching
Two old school friends haunt the hallways
The host proposed a toast to all of the ghosts
The ones that loved, us the hearts we broke, said
"I'll never make that promise again"
Once was enough too; all around me, got

Hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend
I got hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend, I got

As I came to, I looked for you
In the cupboards and the drawers and the toilet queue
Asked the medicine man if he had heard the news
He told me I'd thrown you out last June
Grabbed the politician by the neck, threatened to use
Fists in a fight to find out the truth
He said, "You set the scene son, every day
You can't blame the damned for your own mistakes"
While the mason, he was pacing in my living room
Emma had a child growing up in the womb
I said, "I'm staying in," I never felt like I left
My last breath was taken in conjunction with
Hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend
I got hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and all around me, got
Hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend
I got hocus pocus, three men jokers
Barristers, beast, policemen, thieves
Three queens and broken dreams
