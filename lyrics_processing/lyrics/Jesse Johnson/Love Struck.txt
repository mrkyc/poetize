I think you're all aflame
Everywhere I see you darlin'
Girl you are so vain
When you're talkin', talkin' sexy
Sexy all the time
I just want to kiss your red lips
Girl you blow my mind
Because I'm love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh
Everybody knows I am love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh oh baby
Every time I think I need you
You're busy on the line
Everybody says they want you
Makes me so uptight
On my knees I try to tell you
Love is not a game
Now you're all decked out in high heels
You drive me so insane
Because I'm love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh
Everybody knows I am love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh oh babe
You might also likeHorns
I think I want you, babe
When I think I see you coming
Baby, you disappear
With your platinum flavored lipstick
I star you on my dear
If I whisper in your earlobe
And dance into the night
'Cause you know I want your love girl
Do you all the time
Because I'm love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh
Everybody knows I am love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh oh babe
Every time I try to picture you with someone new
It can never be done
I guess you think that I'm just some kind of fool, baby
But let me tell you don't you know, you are the one
Love struck, love struck
Everybody knows I am love struck, love struck
Oh oh baby
Every time I see you, baby
I think you are fame
Everywhere I see you darlin'
Girl you are so vain
When you're talkin' tough now
Sexy all the time
I just want to kiss your red lips
Girl, you blow my mind
Love struck, love struck
Everybody knows I am
Love struck, love struck
Said over you
Break it down
