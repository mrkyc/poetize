(Oh wo oh)
(Oh wo oh)
Baby, if you would only talk to me
I think you'd know just what was going on
Baby, if you'd open your eyes and see
A broken heart, say now I know what's wrong
(Yes I do)
I tried to do the best I could for you
Gave you everything you could want
For that I lived in violent misery
But no more now since she came along
(Since she came along)
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
Baby, if you could only see through me
I think you'd know just how I really feel
Lately, she's more than just a fantasy
My love for her I no longer conceal
You might also likeHer sexy body makes me lose control
She makes it very hard to keep my cool
She said she'll never leave me out in the cold
I guess you know by now I'm over you
(Over you)
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
She's never tried to hurt me, baby
Or tried to fool around
She wants to show me how to party, baby
Come on, girl, ya got to let me scream and shout
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
Baby, if you would only dance with me
I think you'd know just what was going on
Maybe, if you opened your eyes to see
A broken heart, say now I know what's wrong
I tried to do the best I could for you
(Good god)
Gave you everything you could want
For that I lived in violent misery
But no more now since she came along
(Since she came along)
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
