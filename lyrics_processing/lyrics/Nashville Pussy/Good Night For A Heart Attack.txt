I'm a bad ass rolling stone
Remember them words and spell them right
On the head of my tombstone
Gonna be long gone
Ain't carrying on
There's one last thing that I gotta say
Come on baby let's go
Oh yeah
Write my will in lines of cocaine
Baptize myself in whiskey
Take every pill that'll fit in my mouth
And see where that'll get me
It's time I finally lived up to
The bad shit that's been said
So hey you whores here's my bread
Stand in line and give me head
It's a good night for a heart attack
I'm going to a drug fight
And I ain't coming back
So help me baby, get on with the show
One last line before I leave
And I hate to see me go
You might also likeWeed and Jack for my last meal
With Xanax wrapped in bacon
And y'all can kick me when I'm dead
To prove that I'm not faking
Aw, It's so hard to repent
With your foot right through the floor
So to save some time and my soul
Bring a priest right to the bar
It's a good night for a heart attack
I'm going to a drug fight
And I ain't coming back
So help me baby, get on with the show
One last line before I leave
And I hate to see me go
So raise your glass, baby here's to me
"He's the deadest man that'll ever be"
And if you got something to help get me gone
Baby, bring it on
It's a good night for a heart attack
I'm going to a drug fight
And I ain't coming back
So help me baby, get on with the show
One last line before I leave
And I hate to see me go
It's good night for a heart attack
And it's your last chance to fuck me
'Cause I ain't coming back
So help me baby, get on with the show
One last hit before I leave
