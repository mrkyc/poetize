If I live like a jerk
Can I keep on disguising
Can I make believe
That I don't deceive
No, no, no
Send the wild women out the backdoor
My wife's knocking at the front door
They made me a winner
They made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
While the preacher's shaking my right hand
They made me a winner
They made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
When I'm riding on top of
The wave of success
Will I lose my devotion
Will I fail to see
What I used to be
Oh, oh, oh

I'll have to carry on as two persons in one
