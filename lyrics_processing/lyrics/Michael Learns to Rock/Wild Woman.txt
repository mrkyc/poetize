If I live like a jerk?
Can I keep on disguising?
Can I make believe
That I don't deceive?
No, no, no
Send the wild women out the back door
My wife is knocking at the front door
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
While the preachers shaking my right hand
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
When I'm riding on top of
The wave of success
Will I lose my devotion?
Will I fail to see
What I used to be?
Oh, oh, oh
Send the wild women out the back door
My wife is knocking at the front door
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do

While the preachers shaking my right hand
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
I'll have to carry on
As two persons in one
Two persons in one
Two persons in one
Send the wild women out the back door
My wife is knocking at the front door
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
While the preachers shaking my right hand
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Send the wild women out the back door
My wife is knocking at the front door
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
While the preachers shaking my right hand
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Send the wild women out the back door
My wife is knocking at the front door
They made me a winner, they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
