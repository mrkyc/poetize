I'm not a stone
You're not to gather 
And break every bone
We labour beneath the weight of our sorrow
The crown of our grief

Just because I'm working and you sleep alone
Don't mean that I won't be there when you need me at home
Cos I will
Just because I'm working when you sleep at night
Don't mean that I won't be there in the nick of time
Cos I will

Last night when I was sleeping
I had a dream my body was a boat
In the mouth of an angry harbour
At the lip of an unfamiliar coast
Could not explain on waking
How you were the cape of certain hope
Couldn't paint it in pictures darling
I only wanted you to know
You might also like
You're making a mess
You cut up the curtains for your summer dress
We danced like we did
Like children who don't know what modesty is

When you're done spinning like an errant moon
Curl up on the carpet like you're missing the womb of your mum
You can take your battles to the king of the sea
I'll be right behind, you can count on me, my love

Last night when I was sleeping
I had a dream my body was a boat
In the mouth of an angry harbour
At the lip of an unfamiliar coast
Could not explain on waking
How you were the cape of certain hope
Couldn't paint it in pictures darling
At the lip of an unfamiliar coast
Last night when I was sleeping
I had a dream my body was a boat
In the mouth of an angry harbour
At the lip of an unfamiliar coast
Could not explain on waking
How you were the cape of certain hope
Couldn't paint it in pictures darling
