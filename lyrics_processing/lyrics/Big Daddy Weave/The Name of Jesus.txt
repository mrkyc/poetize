Every knee will bow
Every tongue confess Your name
Heaven coming down
Responding to the sound of Your name
The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus

For Your name is like a mighty fortress
Stronger than the grip of darkness
Rolled back the stone that could not hold You in the grave
Full of power that will shake the heavens
Love that will stand forever
Ripping through the prison doors to set the captives free
The name of Jesus, oh-oh-oh
The name of Jesus

Every knee will bow
Every tongue confess Your name
Hearts are crying out
We echo Heaven now as we praise
The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus
