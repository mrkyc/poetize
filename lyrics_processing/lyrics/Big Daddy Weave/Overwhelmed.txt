I see the work of Your hands
Galaxies spin in a Heavenly dance, oh God
All that You are is so overwhelming

If I hear the sound of Your Voice
All at once it's a gentle and thundering noise, oh God
All that You are is so overwhelming

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You
And God I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You

I know the power of Your Cross
Forgiven and free forever You'll be my God
And all that You've done is so overwhelming

I delight myself in You
In the glory of Your presence
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You
And God I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You
