Yours will be
The only Name that matters to me
The only One whose favor I seek
The only Name that matters to me

The friendship and affection I need
To feel my Father smiling on me
The only Name that matters to me

And Yours is the Name, the Name that has saved me
Mercy and grace, the power that forgave me
And Your love is all I've ever needed

Yours will be
The only Name that matters to me
The only One whose favor I seek
The only Name that matters to me

Yours is the Name, the Name that has saved me
Your mercy and grace, the power that forgave me
And Your love is all I've ever needed
