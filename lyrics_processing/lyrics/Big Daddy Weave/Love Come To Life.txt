I've been restless on the inside
Wondering about this heart of mine
I've been desperately trying to find
A way to prove that I'm still alive
Has the love I speak so loudly of
Quietly grown cold?

Has my life been an empty voice?
What I sing needs to be seen
I need to step out and make the choice
To let go of everything
Would You reignite this heart's spark
Here in the dark?

Bring Your love to life inside of me
Why don't You break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet
For the hopeless and the broken
For the ones who don't know that You love them
Bring Your love to life inside of me

The generation You're calling out
Living everything that we sing about
A revelation right here and now
Of love beyond the shadow of a doubt
Love that's greater than our own
Won't remain unknown when You
