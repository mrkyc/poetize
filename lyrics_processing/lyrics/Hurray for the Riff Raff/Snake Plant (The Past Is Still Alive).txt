Snake plants, Florida water
I only wanted ever be a good daughter
Soft hands, gold rings
Try to remember most everything
Like feeding grapefruits to the cows
Hold my belly while I'm laughing out loud
A bathing suit on a two-day drive
Malaria, you can't sleep at night
Lemon tree and a mango for the baby
Record player, you can call me Sister Sadie
Gonna cut a rope and tie her to the tree
When the hurricane comes, hurricane comes
I know your face, I know your smell
I know that you were living in hell

Pee in the bushes while I wait for a train
Under the bridge when it starts to rain
I never got to ride the sunset route
But I drank enough, a hundred proof
Campfire on the superfund site
Garbage island fucking in the moonlight
Play my song for the barrel of freaks
And we go shoplifting when it's time to eat and
They don't even really know my name
I'm so happy that we escaped from where we came

Tattoo with a needle and thread
Most of our old friends are dead
So, test your drugs, remember Narcan
There's a war on the people, what don't you understand?
There's fentanyl in everything
Don't become an angel with a broken wing, oh
We need you back down here on Earth and
Nothing is as painful as birth, well
Time flies when you're getting old, but
I was born with a baby boy soul
Maybe someday I'll see you again
In a field, a war, a kingdom of sand and
Maybe we could smile again, oh
Maybe we could dance again
I'd kiss your lips, I'd hold your hands, oh
Maybe we could dance again, well
I was young when I left home
I never stopped running, used to think I was alone
But nothing will stop me now
Nothing will stop me now

Oh, nothing will stop me now
Well, nothing can stop, nothing can stop me now
Me now
Me now
Me now
