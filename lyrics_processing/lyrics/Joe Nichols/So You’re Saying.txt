So you're saying every boat we're hanging at the beach in Costa Rica
Maybe then you'd let me buy you one or two rounds of cocoronaritas
And if I hear you right, if we were sipping on red wine somewhere in Paris
You might take me back to your hotel room, kiss me in the lights out on the terrace

So you're saying there's a chance
We get end up on the dancefloor
Your hands up in my pants, back pocket swaying
So you're saying there's a chance
We could wind up on your porch
Leaning you against your door
Slow-kissing, lip-twisting, hearts falling in a trance
One in a million shot of finding true romance
Oh baby, so you're saying there's a chance

So you're saying if I took this napkin and wrote a song about your blue eyes
Jump up on the stage, grab that guitar and sing my ass off in the spotlight
And if that song went straight to number one and you could crank it in your Camry
Then I'd have better odds of buying you just one more appletini

So you're saying there's a chance
We get end up on the dancefloor
Your hands up in my pants, back pocket swaying
So you're saying there's a chance
We could wind up on your porch
Leaning you against your door
Slow-kissing, lip-twisting, hearts falling in a trance
One in a million shot of finding true romance
Oh baby, so you're saying there's a chance

Just when I'm about to tip my hat and leave you sitting there
I notice that you're smiling at me playing with your hair
All this time you've been teasing, baby, that ain't rare

So you're saying there's a chance
We get end up on the dancefloor
Your hands up in my pants, back pocket swaying
So you're saying there's a chance
We could wind up on your porch
Leaning you against your door
Slow-kissing, lip-twisting, hearts falling in a trance
One in a million shot of finding true romance
Oh baby, so you're saying there's a chance
