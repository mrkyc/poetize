Girl, I know you know it's comin'
There ain't no runnin' from it
Your eyes can't lie
Yeah, we held out way too long
But we can't hold it off
Tonight's the night

It's so easy to slip out of touch
Girl, that's it, I've had enough
I know you want me to
So tonight I'm leavin' you

I'm leavin' you breathless, bitin' your lip
Leave you hangin' on the heat of the next kiss
Closin' your eyes, wantin' one more
Leave those goin' out clothes on the hardwood floor
Get you all turned on, all untied
Leave you thinkin' that you're losin' your mind
Yeah I'm tellin' you, baby, before the night is through
I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you breathless

When that red there in the bottle
Is way down in the bottom
And the candle's gone
Yeah, the curtains will be drawn
The shadows will be all
That we got on

I'ma take my time, lay you down
Take you by the hand
Whatever I gotta do
Tonight I'm leavin' you

I'm leavin' you breathless, bitin' your lip
Leave you hangin' on the heat of the next kiss
Closin' your eyes, wantin' one more
Leave those goin' out clothes on the hardwood floor
Get you all turned on, all untied
Leave you thinkin' that you're losin' your mind
Yeah I'm tellin' you, baby, before the night is through
I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you breathless
I'm leaving you breathless

I'm leavin' you breathless, bitin' your lip
Leave you hangin' on the heat of the next kiss
Closin' your eyes, wantin' one more
Leave those goin' out clothes on the hardwood floor
Get you all turned on, all untied
Leave you thinkin' that you're losin' your mind
Yeah I'm tellin' you, baby, before the night is through
I'm leavin' you (I'm leavin' you)
I'm leavin' you breathless (I'm leavin' you)
I'm leavin' you breathless (breathless)
