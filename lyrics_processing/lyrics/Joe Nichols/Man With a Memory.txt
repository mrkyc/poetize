Ol' Johnny's got a heart of gold
Ask anyone around here
But some nights his eyes are far away
And filled with tears
Sweet Mary Lou's just as good as they come
With a weakness for all the wrong men
From the look on her face tonight
She's been wrong again
Bartender's thinkin' to himself
As he rubs his towel 'round a glass

Now, there's a man with a memory
There's a woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever lookin' back
When you're living for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past

Bartender turns the TV down
Cranks that old jukebox up
Carefully selects which buttons to push
For what each song does
C-23 after J-19
It's a tonic for a broken heart
A little Stardust in the mix
It's a fine, fine art
Dim the lights a notch or two
The next round is on the house

For the man with a memory
And the woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever lookin' back
When you're livin' for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past

Oh, we've all got something
We've got to get around
Now and then, you get the chance
To help the lost get found
Stacking chairs and sweeping up
He can't help a little smile

Thinking 'bout the man with a memory
And the woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever looking back
When you're living for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past
You get a man with a memory
