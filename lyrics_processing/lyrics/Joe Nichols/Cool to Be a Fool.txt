Nobody with no one
And bein me
Ain't really all that fun
And leavin her wasn't very smart
Admitting I was wrong wouldn't be so hard
If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennys and a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost
The best thing he ever had
Hey I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
But we all know
The way it really is
You don't get recoginized
For doin things like this
You spend a lot of time
Feelin sorry for yourself
It doesn't really mean that much to anybody else
