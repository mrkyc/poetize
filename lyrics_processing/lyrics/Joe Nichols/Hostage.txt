What the hell can I say, girl?
I've been waiting all day long
To see you sitting on a bedside
Nothing but a T-shirt on
You know what you're doing
So go ahead and do it

Tie me down if you want to
Baby, I'm all yours
You got to know that I want to
Find out what that look is for
Your kiss feels so dangerous
But maybe I ain't scared
So let down your hair
Sit me in your chair
Go on and have your way
And take my heart hostage
Turn the key and lock it
Do whatever you want, I won't stop it

We'll light a couple candles
Put a couple shadows on the wall
Keep doing what you're going
'Til we've done it all
Girl I'll stay
Held up in this place

Take my heart hostage
Turn the key and lock it
Do whatever you want, I won't stop it
We can top it
Do it all again
Find a line and then cross it

Tie me down if you want to
Baby, I'm all yours
You got to know that I want to
Find out what that look is for
Your kiss feels so dangerous
But maybe I ain't scared
So let down your hair
Sit me in your chair
Go on and have your way
And take my heart hostage
