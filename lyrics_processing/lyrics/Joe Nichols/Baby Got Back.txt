Lord look come in here that girls a** is as big as a Buick
I want you to look, girl, look at that
Coach bag, she ain't got now f****n' Coach bag you
You know d**n well that came from Troy day, you know it did
She got that hair so stacked up
I reckon she thinks the high it is the closer to Heaven
She gon' need Heaven, she gon' need some Jesus in her life
Comin' in here doin' that Tennessee walk
Ain't nobody got time to look at that girl

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing up in your face, you get sprung

You know you wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans that she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'

I like big butts and I cannot lie
Oh, you other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing up in your face, you get sprung

Somebody been gettin' them beans and taters on time ain't they
I'm gon' take and run, that-that little lady right there
Been pushin' people from the table since she was early age

I like big butts and I cannot lie
Oh, you other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing up in your face, you get sprung
Oh baby got back
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

God d**n girl didn't even look in a mirror before she left the house
Either that or she has some mean a** friends
'Cause ain't none of them tellin' the truth
Ain't none of them tellin' her the truth
Oh hey, here she comes
Hey girl how you doin' baby?
It's so nice to, honey I love that purse
I do and them jeans look good on you
Yes, lookin' good, lookin' like a million dollars
You didn't go to Walmart for that hair cut

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout baby
You come in here and look good
Them jeans fittin' real nice baby
