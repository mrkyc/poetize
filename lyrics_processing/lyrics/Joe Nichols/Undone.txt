Sun shadows on the wall
And everything ain't about me

You don't even have to call
If you wanna come on over
Baby I wanna let ya
Been caught up in the moment
From the moment I met ya
I been watchin the hands on the clock
And I been leavin' the latch on the lock
Undone, like the buttons on your shirt
Undone, showin' every single curve I want
You so bad baby you know how
To make me come undone
Kissin all up on my neck undone
Catchin' every single breath I love
How easily you do something to me that just can't be undone
Girl you know you're gonna start a fire
When you touch me like that
So go ahead and pull me over the edge
I won't ever go back
Baby when you hold me
I can hold it together
Got a little taste and I want it forever
Just watchin' your hair fall
Oh girl you know how to get me off

How easily you do something to me that just can't be undone
I just wanna end up all tangled up
I just wanna get all wrapped in your love
