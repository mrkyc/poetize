Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent
She told me to hit the hole, I used to play running back
You niggas be fumbling, don't you give 'em no gun again
These bitches be flying out, yeah, 'cause money be coming in
Said the money be coming in, the money be coming in
The money be coming in, the money be coming in
See you niggas just run your mouth, yeah
My niggas, we run the city
The money be coming in, the money be coming in

Look, my bitch is on Tumblr
Your bitch need a tummy tuck
Since Jesus of Nazareth
The realest you've come across
I be with killers just coming home
They only hope is me and the Quran
They only wish is for a new chain
But they stuck up in the ankle bracelet
I get the money stacked
See the moon's where it's sunny at
And I move where the realest be
And the quickest, see, baby, you gettin' lapped
Yeah, the DMV on the map
That's a city, two states if you can count
I'm as real as I say, I never lie
So whenever I go, know I'm runnin' back, eh
