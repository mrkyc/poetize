Turn that beat, the music up
I gotta fight this, I wanna fight the music, on this one
I was gonna write you a poem today
But I was like fuck it, I was feelin' myself, you know?
Tha Biz, Tha Bizness

Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sister and I'm so proud the way she hold it down
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Pray you richer in confidence when I'm paying you mind, look
The illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive, yeah
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive, hold up

Working out 9-to-5, keeping them babies fly
Know the time, know what's like, no one notice your plight
No one notice your struggle, no one know what it's like
How you hold in emotion, nine months while holding in life
Man straight and no fucking, women's pain got her stressing
I can't touch her, so for pleasure, I get special attention
Yeah this the illest bitch alive, I love her freaky side
And the deeper that mean she get the sweeter, just rise

For that illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sister and I'm so proud the way she hold it down
Call her that illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind, ohh
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive, hah
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive, yeah, look

Baby father bullshittin', you two don't even speak
Ain't seen his seed in 14 days, that nigga too weak
Couple shy of a month, I ain't running you up
When it be too loose or you be too late, we ain't tying no knot
And I know it's double standards when you fucking with us
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love
New Louboutins when she dressin', Louboutin, please correct me
Stretch marks, make her self-conscious, I kiss 'em when we sexing
Yes it's the illest bitch around, flawless and brown
Smoking loud, blowing down when the law ain't around
When it comes to underwater, I get nautical shawty
Yeah you leavin' alone but came here with multiple shawty

Yes it's that illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sister and I'm so proud how she hold it down
Call her that illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind, ohh
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive, hah
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive

Fuck it though, I got a little bit for her, heheh
And I promised myself I wouldn't tell you this shit today
But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'ma say
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her
And the truth hurts that this world's mine but, the womb's hers
Ms. Mother Nature, I pray that our daughter's carry and favor your genes
And when you take off your jeans, you get all the me that you need, heh
That you allow me to work it 'til you know what your actual worth means
And for what it's worth, I hope a couple words can help you see
The illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive, uhh
