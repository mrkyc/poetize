I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." She says, "It makes me feel good."
Take this good advice
If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white
You'll be alright
Said, you'll be alright
Said, you'll be alright
Said, you'll be alright

Gucci S. Dots, whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hype beasts that's into fashion
Yeah, being for real, yo, try being Pharrell
When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real
No Lauren London, we was on a budget
You know, sharin' Old Navy, so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
'Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin' but how ya lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams, you know?

Viotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager managin' us
Yeah, I'm standin' in Lucky 7's, but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them J's for the low, low, and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift, then again, I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs, but the outcome is similar
'Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues 'cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone, income was very "uh"
On the 2nd and 16th, everyone would have every one
And Reebok would carry pump
And that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much, they'd be buried in them
I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." She says, "It makes me feel good."
