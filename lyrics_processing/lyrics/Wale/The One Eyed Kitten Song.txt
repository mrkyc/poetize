Romanelli custom, make it (Buy it)
Haters (Priceless) a hundred for the butters
I don't be with squares ('Less I'm sittin' on my luggage)
See that's a little different, Damier was a cover
Now won't you tell me somethin' 'bout the joint that you was thumpin'
Yeah Ralph, you know the girl that always askin' 'bout some money
Yeah, yeah, man cut that talk, I ain't ever spendin' nothin'
But some gas and some muh'fuckin' rubbers (Man)

Chillin' (Smokin') drinkin'

It was on (If it's on, then put on for the homie)
Okay, next time I got ya, I just caught in the moment (Bet)
When I bring friends in, her friends will get focused (Word)
Dogs will be dogs (Huh?) shones will be shonin' (Huh?)
