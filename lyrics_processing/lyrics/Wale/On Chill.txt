We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once? Yeah
Maybe we can be on chill tonight (One time)
Maybe I can give you chills too (Chill)

I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just want us be comfortable now, for real
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
Who don't care who you dated long as you care and you trustin'?
I'm tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
No, you not fighting alone 'cause I'm protectin' you from 'em, so chill
Life hard and ex-lovers is like scars
'Cause it stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was
I was a youngin, my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third rings fucking me up
So I don't trust

We've been on a tragedy for months (So I don't trust)
Why can't you agree with me for once? (And I'm tryna slow up)

Maybe I can give you chills too (Hey, shawty, look, okay)

Let me illustrate you, let my tongue repaint you
It's already waxed, have you had a brainstorm?
Everywhere a nigga take you, just know that my face good
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow
Maxfield, let it fly, I be up in there a lot
Just to show I don't care, gon' wear it to that nigga house
We don't share our whereabouts or the gossip the hood love
Just supreme confidence, if we good that's good enough, woah, yeah
