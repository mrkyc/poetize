I was supposed to have been a Jesuit priest
Or a Naval Academy grad
That was the way that my parents perceived me
Those were the plans that they had

But I couldn't fit the part
Too dumb or too smart
Ain't it funny how we all turned out?
I guess we are the people our parents warned us about

You know I coulda worked the rigs when the money was big
Or hopped a freighter south to Trinidad
And when they tried to draft me, I earned a college degree
Buyin' time 'til things were not so bad

But then I got a guitar, found a job in a bar
Playin' acid rock 'til I was numb
Tell me where are the flashbacks
They all warned us would come?

We are the people they couldn't figure out
We are the people our parents warned us about

Hey hey, Gardner McKay
Take us on the Leaky Tiki with you
Clear skies, bound for Shanghai
Sailing cross the ocean blue

Now I got quarters in my loafers, tryin' to fight inflation
When it only used to take a cent
Sometimes I wish I was back in my crash pad days
Before I knew what cash flow meant

Seems everybody's joggin'
Or heavy into health shit
Don't tell me that I ought to get rolfed
'Cause I love Cajun martinis and playin' afternoon golf

We are the people, there isn't any doubt
We are the people they still can't figure out
We are the people who love to sing "Twist and Shout"
Shake it up, baby
We are the people our parents warned us about

Isn't any doubt
Hey hey hey
Gardner McKay
I wanna sail away today
Isn't any doubt
They warned us about
Hey hey hey
C'mon now Gardner McKay
