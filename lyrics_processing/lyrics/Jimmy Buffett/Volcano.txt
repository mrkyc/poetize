Now I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows
Let me say now I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows

Ground she's moving under me
Tidal waves out on the sea
Sulphur smoke up in the sky
Pretty soon we learn to fly

Let me hear you now, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows

Now my girl quickly said to me
Man you better watch your feet
Lava come down soft and hot
You better love-a me now or love-a me not

Let me say now, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows
Mr. Utley!

No time to count what I'm worth
Cause I just left the planet earth
Where I go I hope there's rum
Not to worry man soon come

Now I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows
One more now, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows

But I don't want to land in the New York City
I don't want to land in Mexico
I don't want want to land on no Three Mile Island
I don't want to see my skin aglow
I don't want to land in Comanche sky park
Or in Nashville, Tennessee
I don't want to land in no San Juan airport
Or in Yukon Territory
I don't want to land in no San Diego
I don't want to land in no Buzzard's Bay
I don't want to land on no Ayatollah
I got nothing more to say
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows
Just a one more, I don't know, I don't know
