Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei

I know I don't get there often enough
But God knows I surely try
It's a magic kind of medicine
That no doctor could prescribe

I used to rule my world from a payphone
And ships out on the sea
But now times are rough and I got too much stuff
Can't explain the likes of me

But there's this one particular harbour
So far but yet so near
Where I see the days as they fade away
And finally disappear

But now I think about the good times
Down in the Caribbean sunshine
In my younger days, I was so bad
Laughin' about all the fun we had
I've seen enough to feel the world spin
Mixin' different oceans, meetin' cousins
Listen to the drummers and the night sounds
Listen to the singers make the world go 'round

Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei

E mea arofa teiei ao nei

Lakes below the mountains
Flow into the sea
Like oils applied to canvas
They permeate through me

And there's that one particular harbour
Sheltered from the wind
Where the children play on the shore each day
And all are safe within

Most mysterious calling harbour
So far but yet so near
I can see the day when my hair's full gray
And I finally disappear

Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teiei ao nei
Ua pau te maitai no te fenua
