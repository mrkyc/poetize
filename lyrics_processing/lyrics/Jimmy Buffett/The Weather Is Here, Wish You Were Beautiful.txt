"Play Ball!! (one, two, three, four)"
"Where's my per diem? (Ladies and gentlemen, the Coral Reefer Band)"
"Hey Bobby, where's the keys to the rent-a-car?"
"Jimmy, Jimmy, can I open the show in Atlanta please?"
"Warning! Don't ever start a band!"

He worked hard all year
Just wanted a few weeks alone
But his old lady's into modelin'
She can't get away from a phone

Besides, she bitches about the mosquitoes
She says, "Down there there is nothing to do"
Her goddamn phone never stops ringin'
He'll try the service in a day, maybe two

Well, he's on his third drink
Before the wheels of the plane leave the ground
Makin' points with the stewardess
High over Long Island Sound

She's also spending some time on the island
Too much city madness gives her the blues
They make a date to go dancin' and dinin'
It seems neither has that much to lose

The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
My thoughts aren't too clear, but don't run away
My girlfriend's a bore, my job is too dutiful
Hell, nobody's perfect would you like to play?
I feel together today

Well, now that's just the start
Of a well-deserved overdue binge
Meanwhile back in the city
Certain people are starting to cringe

His lawyers are calling his parents
His girlfriend doesn't know what to think
His partners are studying their options
He's just singin' and orderin' drinks

The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
The skies are too clear, life's so easy today
The beer is too cold, the daiquiri's too fruitiful
No place like home when you're this far away
I don't care what they say
He's goin' back to New York
Pack it up and let everyone know
It was something that he should have done
Such a long time ago

Still time to start a new life in the palm trees
Ah, Billy Clyde wasn't insane
And if it doesn't work out, there'll never be any doubt
That the pleasure was worth all the pain

The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
The skies are too clear, life's so easy today
The beer is too cold, the daiquiri's too fruitiful
No place like home when you're this far away
Time for to play

I need time for to play
Time for to play
I need time for to play
I need time for to play
I need time for to play
I need time for to play
I need time for to play
