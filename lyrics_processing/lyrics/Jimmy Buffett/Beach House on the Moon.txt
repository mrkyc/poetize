Cameron's getting logical, a Vulcan in disguise
The mysteries of the night are putting sparkles in his eyes
He's looking for sound reasoning, but the best that I can do
Is this transcendental story that I'll pass along to you

Past the falls they call Victoria, down the river named the Nile
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat, it's shaped just like a smile
And steered by a magician with the knowledge that he needs
To keep him on his destined course past the crocodiles and reeds

He's the admiral of the ocean
The lone eagle in the sky
He gave me my first sextant
And he taught me how to fly

It's been quite a lengthy passage from the dawn of time 'til now
He has weathered the infernal storms in his trusty petite dhow
He has soared above colossal waves, sailed the endless sea
Sometimes he resembles you, sometimes he looks like me

I saw him through my telescope
On a cloudless night in June
As he rested between voyages
At his beach house on the moon
You might also like
There are windows to the galaxies and hallways to the past
There are trapdoors to the future and a splintered ancient mast
There are relics from Apollo trips when the earth men came to play
And a hammock from a distant star out in the Milky Way

He's the admiral of the ocean
The lone eagle in the sky
He gave me my first sextant
And he taught me how to fly

I saw him through my telescope
On a cloudless night in June
As he rested between voyages
At his beach house on the moon

A striped bass breaks the surface as the sunset fades away
Our journey from the sea of storms takes us home beside the bay
We go fishing in the ocean, we go travelling back in time
Like the song says, teach your children to go fishing with their mind

Cameron's contemplating, I'm not sure just what he thinks
Is my dad some kind of lunatic with his stories and hijinks?
Then he says when I get old and gray and feel like I'm marooned
