I want to go back, to the islands
Where the shrimp boats are tied up to the piling
Give me oysters and beer
For dinner every day of the year
And I'll feel fine, I'll feel fine

I want to be there
Want to go back down and lie beside the sea there
With a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with good red wine
And I'm a chewin' on a honeysuckle vine

Yeah now the sun goes sliding across the water
Sail boats they go searching for the breeze
Salt air it ain't thin
It can stick right to your skin, and make you feel fine
Makes you feel fine

I wanna be there
Wanna go back down and and get high by the sea there
With a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with good red wine
And I'm a chewin' on a honeysuckle vine

Yes and now you heard my strange proposal
So get that Packard up and let's move
I wanna be there before the day
Tries to steal away and leave us behind
I've made up my mind

And I wanna be there
I wanna go back down and die beside the sea there
With a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with good red wine
And I'm a chewin' on a honeysuckle vine
Yeah with a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with red wine
And I'm a chewin' on a honeysuckle vine

And I wanna be there
I wanna go back down and die beside the sea there
With a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with good red wine
And I'm a chewin' on a honeysuckle vine
Yeah with a tin cup for a chalice, fill it up with red wine
