Darkness is on the rise
Here all alone with my misery
No looking back no thinking twice
I find the answers from your hollow words
Straight from the heart that's growing cold
Where's the place I could end my search
My treasure island the silver and gold
Pale is the light
That shines on my weary face
Just look the state that I'm in
Slipped from the path
And we're lost without a trace
Learn the lesson and learn it well
Don't turn your back don't walk away
Face the evil and you will live to tell
And to fight another day
No shortcuts home and no easy ways
On broken wings I have to fly
True emotions will show on my face
No matter how hard I try
You might also likePale is the light
That shines on my weary face
Just look the state that I'm in
Slipped from the path
And we're lost without a trace
Shadows across my face
Deepest emotions will never change
Shadows across my face
Deepest emotions will never change
Right is wrong and wrong is right
You changed the day into a night
Warm is cold and black is white
The battle is won before the fight
Pale is the light
That shines on my weary face
Just look the state that I'm in
Slipped from the path
And we're lost without a trace
Shadows across my face
Deepest emotions will never change
Shadows across my face
Deepest emotions will never change
Never surrender
I'm no pretender
Shadows rising
Just run and hide
Pale is the light
That shines on my weary face
Just look the state that I'm in
Slipped from the path
And we're lost without a trace
Shadows across my face
Deepest emotions will never change
Shadows across my face
