She's searching the wrong and the right, unaware that she's marked
Selfish and blind, out of time she's the plague from the past
Virgin and whore, rich to be poor all alone
In a far away land beyond light there's a lady in the dark
She's searching the wrong and the right, unaware that she's marked
Selfish and blind, out of time she's the plague from the past
Virgin and whore, rich to be poor all alone
As best as you can read the palm of my hand
The future demand, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
Passing of years brings out the tears
Surface the fears, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
With a slight of your hand you make a slave from the man of your time
The fortune turns sand and gone are the places to hide
Selfish and blind, out of time she's the plague from the past
Virgin and whore, rich to be poor all alone
As best as you can read the palm of my hand
The future demand, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
Passing of years brings out the tears
Surface the fears, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
Centuries turning to dust
I'm ageless
Desperate passion turns lust
I'm faithless
As best as you can read the palm of my hand
The future demand, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
Passing of years brings out the tears
Surface the fears, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
As best as you can read the palm of my hand
The future demand, the Fortune Teller
Lay it all down for everyone to see
Passing of years brings out the tears
Surface the fears, the Fortune Teller
