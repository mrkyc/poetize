I gotta get that shit, like, right
Feel me?
That shit could be hard
Lowkey

I send back the five, tell shorty I love her
She still gon' act like I ain't done enough
These bitches be lying, I ain't got the time
That's why I'm in love with my double cup
I'm out of my mind, my words be slidin'
I bought a new 'Maro to fuck it up
I bought Mercedes to fuck it up (Ice Starr)
I bought a AP to fuck it up
I'm just tryna run the cake up
Versace sheets just to make love
Got a private just to make drugs
'Cause I'm tryna flood the face up
I been fuckin' with the same plug
I been fuckin' with these rich niggas
Had to whip it with my wrist, nigga
Then I got it on my wrist, nigga
Yeah, yeah

Conversations of a rich nigga 'bout the consequences of a rich nigga
I seen too many niggas switch, nigga
I could never be a bitch nigga
Ain't nobody give me shit, I got it on my own
Score with no assist, nigga (Ice Starr)
Pyrex or a hit, nigga
Either way, I'll be a rich nigga
Have you ever been whippin' the dope so good, you think that the feds watchin'?
'Cause my OGs, they been whippin' the dope up
My niggas got most of they bread flockin'
Feel like burger, I'm stackin' the cheese
They nickname the trap house "Red Robin"
I was tryna push work with you
Your mans came, now the feds knockin'
Now I wanna run it up, nigga
Purple Fanta in the cup, nigga
VVS's straight from Avianne
You claim you 'bout it, nigga, why you lyin'?
Got yours, had to make mine
Push packs 'cross state lines
You bitches always tryna take the check (Ice Starr)
See a baller then they break they neck
Yeah, yeah

Young nigga got it out the mud (Uh)
Whipped my wrist and tore the vacant up (Vacant up)
And it's always been "Fuck the law"
So I can never pick the bacon up
I run the bands up, why you playin' with me?
My life a movie, livin' HD
My jeweler called, he got a AP (Ice Starr)
I keep my dogs, no snakes with me
Seen false niggas live a long time and the real niggas die young
Yeah, yeah
I seen a boss nigga get shot
He took a loss, then he got high
They look through the blinds, give them the time
Fuck the police, we just shake the spot
Put the Ps in the duffel bag
Lil' brother gotta take the Glock
Main reason I don't fuck with you niggas
You run them digits then you turn snitch
All your dogs got locked up
Then your best friend was a sherm stick
I wasn't born a baller, I had to stack it up, I had to learn this (Ice Starr)
Everything I got, I earned it
Sit back, wait your turn, bitch
I send back the five, tell shorty I love her
She still gon' act like I ain't done enough
These bitches be lying, I ain't got the time
That's why I'm in love with my double cup
I'm out of my mind, my words be slidin'
I bought a new 'Maro to fuck it up
I bought Mercedes to fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I bought a AP to fuck it up (Aw, yeah)
I'm just tryna run the cake up
Versace sheets just to make love
Got a private just to make drugs
'Cause I'm tryna flood the face up
I been fuckin' with the same plug
I been fuckin' with these rich niggas (Ice Starr)
Had to whip it with my wrist, nigga
Then I got it on my wrist, nigga
Yeah, yeah
