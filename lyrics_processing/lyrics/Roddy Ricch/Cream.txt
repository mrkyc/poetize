Yung Lan on the track
Den Beats
Hunnid bands for a kilo, nigga

I spent my whole life chasin' the bag and runnin' from coppers
And a nigga been drownin' myself in these codeine problems (Yeah)
Spent a couple thousand on my feet, then ran it back up in a week (Yeah, yeah)
I got these Jordans on my feet, 'til it get bloody underneath (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna fill this safe up 'til its bussin' out my jeans, dawg
Cash rules everything around me, dawg (Ayy)
I remember I wasn't havin' no money, now I'm the richest in the yojects
I had to take the safe up out the wall and put the faces in my pocket

I ain't even have no gas, I had to pursue the duffel, yeah
While I'm in the trenches, I did everything for the profits
I wanna pull up to the hood day fly as fuck, red guts in the Masi'
All my brothers gotta eat, and if I got a full plate, he know that he got it
I ain't even got a plug, nigga had to run it up, turn into the socket
Had to go and run the play
Niggas know that I'm the wave, like I'm a tsunami
If the nigga want it all, I gotta be my own boss like I'm John Gotti
A nigga can't play me out of my position
I just might fuck around and catch a body
See me a bag, and I done went at it
Had to go serve a lot of drug addicts
Gotta turn a Rollie into a Patek
Flex the money like a nigga ain't have it
I just pray to God that all my traps don't ever get no static, yeah
'Cause if a nigga try to take what's mine, I gotta cause havoc, yeah

Blue faces in the Rollie, you know I been Crippin'
'Member days when I was down for a minute
Now a nigga blow a thousand at Lenox
Doin' everything that they said that I didn't
At the Lear and it's only beginnin'
My name in the seats, they know it ain't rented
Wear my red bottoms like they're Air Forces now
I'm the youngest, richest, flyest, nigga outta Comp-town
Made my own lane, now all these niggas wanna copycat off of my sound
I just made $250,000, I don't know how
I had to get me some racks
I had to get me some packs, yeah yeah
I just be livin' what I'm talkin'

That's why all these hoes be around
She remember when a nigga was broke
