I can't express myself, don't know how to start
That's why I'm double cupped up, I go to Mars
Shawty was with me in the bando from the start
Now we in the Phantom, lookin' at the stars
When all this money came, these hoes played on me
I remained the same nigga, so please don't change on me
A lot of these hoes round a nigga, they be too fake
'Cause a young nigga been hoppin' out that new Wraith

All these problems got me drownin' in my codeine
Double up, the birds got me trappin' out them four wings
24/7, I just want you to be honest with me
You protected cause I keep the 9 under me
All them late night conversations in the loft
Didn't had to tell you, you knew we was gonna ball
But I've been havin' to explain to these hoes, gotta get off me
VVS diamonds in your ring, no Charles Barkley (Ayy)
I just got a number one rule, shawty don't lie to me
If you want a bad bitch in the threesome, we can find her
I'ma keep you flooded and on fleek in that designer
You know we be chasin' that bag, I'm right behind her

I can't express myself, don't know how to start
That's why I'm double cupped up, I go to Mars
Shawty was with me in the bando from the start
Now we in the Phantom, lookin' at the stars
When all this money came, these hoes played on me
I remained the same nigga, so please don't change on me
A lot of these hoes round a nigga, they be too fake
'Cause a young nigga been hoppin' out that new Wraith
