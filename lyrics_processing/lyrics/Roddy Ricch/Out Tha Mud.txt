June, you're a genius
Ayy

I just copped Amiri jeans, chains clanging, now she think she hearing things
I just counted up one hundred bands with all my dawgs at the Airbnb
All these niggas tryna be me, got a new Hellcat, stay clear of me
And I got extended clip for all these fuck niggas
I'm straight out the mud, I can't fuck with fuck niggas
Why he say where he from? I don't give a fuck, nigga
A lot of y'all switched up on me, I don't trust niggas
I just put my middle finger up, fuck a fuck nigga

Ayy, gang slide, gang slide, that's what I was doing last year
A lot of people say I'm being humble, nigga, this the last year
Got so many bands, I'm the cashier, ayy
A nigga retired the hats, bitch, I can't do no cappin' here
And I gotta keep the rachet with me
Take his knee, got him Colin Kaepernick-ing
Puerto Rican, she freaky, I bag the bitches
Migos throw me the pussy, I'm dabbin' in it
I'm a Crip nigga, but I gotta fuck with my slimes, mhm, ayy
Nike headband, got the check right 'round my mind, mhm
I just can't fuck with these fuck niggas
Sniper look like a goose, I can't duck niggas
I lay down on the pillow with plus three
Talking 'bout how they all wanna fuck a nigga
I ain't no lick, nigga, and I ain't no bitch nigga
My taxes is six figures, but I drop that on my whip, nigga

I be like fuck that nigga, he ain't talkin' no money
If it ain't got twenties, fifties, hundreds, I don't love it
Look at my cup, it's double
Doin' donuts in public, ayy
And codeine a hell of a drug
Sometimes a nigga gotta go'n and say fuck it
Bought a new coupe for her, know my baby love it
Stirred the pot like a nigga makin' butter
Holy water just to flood the face up
Natural bitches, I'm like, "Fuck makeup"
Like my bitches wearing Marc Jacobs
She poppin' it, I gotta smash
She trippin', I got her a bag
I'm Crippin', Chanel on the rag
I ain't got time for these fuck niggas, ayy
Keep a pistol on me, don't try your luck, nigga, ayy
If you ain't gang, nigga, I don't fuck with you, ayy
Fuck your kind, nigga, you a fuck nigga, ayy
