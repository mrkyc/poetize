This boy got a hit

I just want you hear me when I pull up, skrrt (Skrrt)
Have a conversation, don't wan' see you hurt
You ain't settle for him 'cause you know your worth (Know your worth)
Got it from the mud I got it out the dirt
These bitches tell you anything to get up in your pocket
These bitches fucking with me cause they know I'm all poppin'
Pull up in the i8 had these bitches jaw droppin'
She wanna go to my place, had these jaw droppin'
I got' tell my feelings, gotta tell the truth
You could be for these bitches they won't be for you
I had a damn, bitch, I ain't know what to do
I had to chase this rap shit and go get the loot (This boy got a hit)
And that don't mean that I ain't give the world to my bitch
I know she was down, so she deserve to be rich
Shorty I'ma go and get you Birkin bags
That Rolls Royce, you can be the first to have it
If I see it, I'ma grab it
Take you to Atlanta, we gon' flood out Magic
And you not by my side, shawty, I can't imagine
You make me choosin' you but you know rap my passion
I ain't tryna play you this not on demand
Tryna run that check up tryna get them bands
That bitch is my fan, I am not your man
I don't know these bitches, they just want my sand
Blow up twenty-piece 'cause I know I can
Put it on a ring so I can ask your hand
I'm just tryna blow while I'm on tour
So I can have the flowers hoppin' out the Benz
Huh, huh, look at you it's like lookin' the mirror
Bought you Cartiers know you seeing clearer
I bought that new Ferrari we gon take to dinner
Come fuck with double R, we some fucking winners
Get your best friend, I call Chris, he can tag team along
Talkin' 'bout my feelings I ain't tryna brag too long
I'm just tryna tell you that I'm all yours
Shopping bags, we can have a car full (This boy got a hit)
Slide down the window while I poured up
Backwoods had the windows rolled up
Just make sure that you never ever use me
'Cause I can never fuck with none these groupies
Your friends tryna tell you that I ain't the right nigga
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna have no life with ya
Just hang 'em up ,don't let them break the frame on my picture
They fuck the same niggas these bitches won't ride with ya
See, I'm just tryna tell you how I feel inside
Turn this music on when you ain't feeling right
Turn on Roddy Ricch when niggas tryna vibe
I'm in your mind (This boy got a hit), I'm in your mind
You might also like

Ayy, ayy, tell 'em I'm in your mind
Ayy, shawty do you mind?
