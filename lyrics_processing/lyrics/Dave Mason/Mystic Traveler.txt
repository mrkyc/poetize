A love light shines for all to see
'Cause in our hearts we know the way it goes
Sharing all that we can give
And living all that we can live
With freedom as our only cornerstone
Mystic traveler, he's the unraveler
And he will always bring you safely home
Mystic traveler, he's the unraveler
And when he takes your heart, you're not alone
And when he takes your heart, you're not alone
Time is on our side I feel
The light of truth will soon reveal
A reason for our fears of letting go
All of our life energy flooring between you and me
Where together though we're quite alone
Mystic traveler, he's the unraveler
And he will always bring you safely home
Mystic traveler, he's the unraveler
And when he takes your heart, you're not alone
And when he takes your heart, you're not alone
No more sailing on the sea of broken hearted memories
Understanding is the key, loving you can only be
A love for all eternity, two much time has passed
Thank the Lord, you're here at last
