He was a big man across the land
He conquered everything in sight
He had the world at his command
But somewhere deep down inside
He felt there were things he still didn't know
So he asked the wise men if they knew
If there was some place he could go
They said that in a far off land
Lived a man named Diogenes
Who possessed the kind of knowledge
That could put his mind at ease
Then stepping up, he said, "I'm here
Please tell me what it is I crave"
And the voice came back loud and clear
From the darkness of the cave
And said, hey, you're standing in my light
I said hey, you're standing in my light
You know that ain't right
Hey, you're standing in my light
Hey you, you're standing in my light

But I'm sure it's gonna be fine
And remember that whatever's been written
Is just the opinion of one man's mind
There are no easy answers
That I know that'll satisfy you
You just gotta take your chances
And do what you wanna do
Don't you know that in this world
You get what you deserve
So when your back's against the wall
You better not lose your nerve
And now you're standing on the street
Like you got something to prove
And the pavement artist at your feet
Looks up every time you move
And says hey, you're standing in my light
I said hey, you're standing in my light
You know that ain't right
I said hey, you're standing in my light
Hey you, you're standing in my light
Now get out of my light
So when you're headed for that goddess center
And the dream that lies within it
Just remember what the man said
There's one born every minute
I said hey, you're standing in my light
I said hey, you're standing in my light
Now that ain't right
Hey, you're standing in my light
Hey you, you're standing in my light
Now get out of my light
Hey, you're standing in my light
I said hey, you're standing in my light, no, no
