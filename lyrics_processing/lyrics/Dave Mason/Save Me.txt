Save me
Save me

She's not a star
But she'll go far
So she's telling all her friends
She's only young and just begun
To see clearly in her eyes

Nothing turned out like she thought it would
(Thought it would)
And I was waiting right there where she stood

She said "save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in"
She said "save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(I can't run, can't hide away)
I can't run and I can't hide"
(I can't run, can't hide away)
She said "save me"
(Save me, girl)
She said "save me"
Ooh

All on her own, she's on the phone
So sincerely, ooh, makin' a joke
There's no reply, she wonders why
And pays the rent one more time

Everybody's out there on the take
(On the take, woo)
And I was there when she began to break
(She began to break)

She said "save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in"
She said "save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(I can't run, can't hide away)
I can't run and I can't hide"
(I can't run, can't hide away)
She said "save me"
(Save me, girl)
She said "save me"
Ooh, ooh

Everybody's out there on the take
(On the take)
And I was there when she began to break

She said "save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in"
(Save me, girl)
She said "save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(I can't run, can't hide away)

She said "save me"
