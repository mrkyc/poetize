Mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah

You can't always get what you want
You can't always buy who you want, no
Wasted some time on it, wasted some cries on it
But this kind of stuff can't be bought

But you sit at the table with a bottle at the club
In a group full of strangers that ya swear that ya love
And ya still feel empty, don't ya still feel empty
And yeah I've been through it too and then I'd get home alone
To have a look in the mirror and I'd already know
It was all so empty and it's just not for me

Everybody's tryna get richer
Tryna do it better, bigger
But that don't feel right
I count my friends on my fingers
We cut the shit out with the scissors
That's just that, don't need a bank full of gold
I need a someone to hold
I don't wanna get richer
Cause I got love in the picture
You can't get richer than that

I'm sat in my car on my phone
I'm dealing with some unnecessary drama
I could let it bother me
But all that goes right through me
Cause it's all just words on a phone

Not gonna sit at the table with a bottle at the club
In a group full of strangers that I know I don't love
Cause it still feels empty, and it's just not for me

Everybody's tryna get richer
Tryna do it better, bigger
But that don't feel right
I count my friends on my fingers
We cut the shit out with the scissors
That's just that, don't need a bank full of gold
I need a someone to hold
I don't wanna get richer
Cause I got love in the picture
You can't get richer than that
Mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
You can't get richer than that
Mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah

Everybody's tryna get richer
Tryna tryna get richer
But that's okay cause
I understand cause I've been there
Yeah I've been there, mmmhm

Everybody's tryna get richer
Tryna do it better, bigger
But that don't feel right
I count my friends on my fingers
We cut the shit out with the scissors
That's just that, don't need a bank full of gold
I need a someone to hold
I don't wanna get richer
Cause I got love in the picture
You can't get richer than that
Mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
