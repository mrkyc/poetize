Take your shoes
Take your shirt
Take your jacket
Take the couch, the refrigerator magnets
Take the nights
Take the sheets
Take the mattress
Taking the reins, taking the dog
I ain't asking

I know it's hard for you to hear
I don't know what's between your ears
So let me make it crystal clear

You think I'm pretty, but baby I'm strong
You think I'm listening, but I'm moving on
You keep on talking to me like I'm wrong
I won't remember you tomorrow
I'm doing me, and you go think about you
And I never needed a table for two
It doesn't matter what ever you do
I won't remember you tomorrow
No I, I won't remember you
No I, I won't remember you
No I, I won't remember you
You might also like
Take the mirror, you look at it so often
Take the TV, all the stupid shows you watching
Take your habits, 'cause I know I'll never stop them
That's a problem
Yeah that's a problem

I know it's hard for you to hear
I don't know what's between your ears
So let me make it crystal clear

You think I'm pretty, but baby I'm strong
You think I'm listening, but I'm moving on
You keep on talking to me like I'm wrong
I won't remember you tomorrow
I'm doing me, and you go think about you
And I never needed a table for two
It doesn't matter what ever you do
I won't remember you tomorrow
No I, I won't remember you
No I, I won't remember you
No I, I won't remember you

I won't remember you tomorrow
But you'll remember this tomorrow
And the next day, the next day
The next month, or the next year
Oh baby, you won't forget me, no-oh
But, I may not forget you forever
But, I won't remember you tomorrow
You think I'm pretty, but baby I'm strong
You think I'm listening, but I'm moving on
You keep on talking to me like I'm wrong
I won't remember you tomorrow
I'm doing me, and you go think about you
And I never needed a table for two
It doesn't matter what ever you do
I won't remember you tomorrow
No I, I won't remember you
No I, I won't remember you
