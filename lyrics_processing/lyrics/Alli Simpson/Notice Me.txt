Please take your time
But I won't be here forever
One for taking chances
But keep in mind
That I won't be here forever
And I'm all ooooooo
What's a girl to do (oooo)
If I can't have you (oooo)
Then I don't want anyone but
If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a lightning storm to make you see
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me
Look at me
I'd walk a tight rope over stormy seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me
Like a supernova
You're blinding me
And we won't be here forever
When the day is over
Come look for me
Cause we won't be here forever
