Plastic and diamonds are nice till they lose their shine
Your super fishy reality, don't make my heart beat twice, no lie
I'm not one of those Barbie's hanging at the after party waiting for some kind of hottie, oh, no, no
Oh baby, I'm sorry, I'm not just a photo copy, I've got a head on this body, say it low
Yo-o-our lips keep moving, it ain't nothing but noise
You think I'm drunk then your missing the point
Y-o-o-ou tryin' to wind me up, but I ain't one of your toys
Go on and play with yourself
Material Boy (boy)
Material boy (boy), I'm not a doll up on your shelf (boy)
Material boy (boy), material, just a material boy
Wind me and dime me, it won't sweep me off my feet, (uh oh, oh)
Your playbooks so tired, it's putting me right to sleep, (uh oh, oh)
You wanna possess me like I'm one of your possessions, and add me to your collection, oh, no, no
You think you're perfection cause you get all this attention, guess you're not used to rejection? no, no, no
Yo-o-our lips keep moving, it ain't nothing but noise
If you think I'm drunk then your missing the point
Yo-o-ou tryin' to wind me up, but I ain't one of your toys
Go on and play with yourself, Material Boy (boy)
