And there's no smoke without reason
It's a sign there's something wrong
In my lungs there's a poison
I've been breathing in too long
'Cause there's no I
No I in We
And there's no You
No You in Me
'Cause I've been burned
Way beyond the third degree

'Cause your words are like gasoline
You pour on the fire
And the bridges you burned
Led to our dreams
It's just another thing that we lost
When the spark turned into a flame
And the flames grew much higher
And my hope, faith, and every last desire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost

Ashes fall just like snowflakes
That are warm against my skin
You say that we could re-build this
Wouldn't know where to begin
'Cause there's no snow
And there's no rain
To hide my tears
To douse these flames
'Cause I've been burned
Way beyond the third degree

'Cause your words are like gasoline
You pour on the fire
And the bridges you burn
Led to our dreams
It's just another thing that we lost
When the spark turned into a flame
And the flames grew much higher
And my hope, faith, and every last desire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
