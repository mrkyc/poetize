All I see are flashing lights
People wearing blue suits wanna know the real truth
How many did I have tonight?
Looking at the wreckage anyone would guess that all inside had died
But I'm alive
Wake up in a strange place angels over my head
One of them is shouting clear
1000 bolts of lightning bring me back to life
And it's a miracle that I'm still here
As I'm coming to life screaming out for you I need you by my side
Now I'm alive
No I didn't pray to God

No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just close my eyes and all I saw was you
All the things in my head everything left unsaid
I never got a second to say
Knew that I adored you the moment that I saw you
Just terrified you'd push me away
Though we're dying slowly just want you to hold me what are we waiting for
We're alive
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just close my eyes and all I saw was you
If I don't die lying in the rain and I live another day
Then I'd run to you
Cos I don't have regrets just things I never say I need you
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
