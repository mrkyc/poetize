Infatuated by the famous mr. bling
Intoxicated by the energy inside me that i ain't goin' do that cool

Some people say we're worthless cuz we never front around my way
Infatuated

We stomp my way cuz im from Baltimore
And you know that the dragon don't play
So from the jump to the middle when im pump we gonna give you want you want
