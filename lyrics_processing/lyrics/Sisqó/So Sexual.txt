Uh
Can you feel me, baby?
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
Oh yeah
Listen

It's givin' me a chill
Every time I think
About the love we make
It makes my heart sink
Deep into my soul
Everywhere I go
I'm always thinkin' of
When we make love

Wanna go back to the day
When I touched ya girl in every way
Gotta take the chance to hear ya say
That you want me girl
Girl, you know you rock my world
You might also like
I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
Oh oh
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
Oh oh

What's come over me
Never thought that love could be so addicting
The feelin' hurts so bad it makes my body weak
I can taste you even when you're not with me
Look what you've done to me

Wanna go back to the day
When I touched ya girl in every way
Gotta take the chance to hear ya say
That you want me girl
Girl, you know you rock my world

I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
Oh oh
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
Oh oh
Whoa
Ooh
Ooh
Baby
You are the only girl
I want ya in my world
You're where I want to be
Everything I need

I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
Oh oh
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
Oh oh
I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
Oh oh
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
Oh oh
I can't eat can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
Oh oh
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
