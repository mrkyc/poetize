Got a funny thing for the girl in my dreams
Preyin on me every night
Like a raven in flight
I'm wakin up hot tryin not to get caught
Cause my, girl's here with me
Light brown eyes with a perfect waist size
Got a body like pow, make me want it right now
Drivin me crazy while i'm layin with my lady
I hope she don't see
It started one night after we had a fight
No make up ? fresh ?
So i took a shower
Fell asleep in an hour
This hot hot pretty young th-ang
Picked me up wit a bang bang
Got me stuck and i couldn't say a damn thang
Can't belive the scene
I'm feenin for the girl in my dream
(chorus)
Last night had a dream bout a freak
Had me wakin up in heat from my sleep
The girl made me sweat
Got my sheets all wet
And i don't even know how she be
She fine as hell
I can barely handle it
Yo them breasts got me all outta breath
So fine
On my mind every night
Trippin off a dream but damn she was tight

Oh i'm startin funny
Like i'm creepin on my honey
It's a dream but it feel so real
Feel her body cover me
Waitin for the freak when i'm wit my lady
It's a shame i don't even know her name
But i know her measurements 36-24-36
Why am i seein her eyes
Them thighs
Could it be
That love just hit me
In the form of a hot girl fantasy
Hate to say it but the lady drive me crazy
That girl
Got me actin all shady to my baby
I can't shake the spell
Can't break it
Goin crazy thinkin of her butt naked
What to do every night i crave
Girl i can't behave
(chorus 2x)
Got me goin crazy
Could it be the last chance baby
I don't even know ohhhh
The vision of my lust
The vision of my eyes
Hunger for a touch
I can't understand why i want her so much
I can't understand
So at night i lay
With nothin ta say
Hennesy got me slowly driftin away
I'm so confused
What am i gonna do
But until then dreamin, uh
