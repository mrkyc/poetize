Can I live (video)
Verse 1
You knew i wan't faithful from the jump so dont font
Like i was quit acting up bugging
Since when we been messing
Flexing love has been good no doubt
But now trying to get me on lock down
Trying to figure out what i'm all about
If im going out
Who im chilling with
What im dealing with
Just can't, just can't handle it
You're not my girl and im not your man
Im a tell you again so you understand
Im not trying to be caught in i'm not moving
Not budging not tryin to get stuck in
Somethin i can't get out of
If you twice shorty then i doubt ya
Need to get off of my back
Your line to tight need to cut me some slack
So let go
Chorus
Can i leave
Can i breath
Inhale exhale get off of me
What i do
Where i be
Who i see you follow me
What is this
Can i live can i breath
Inhale exhale get off of me
Give me privacy
Verse 2
Met you in the club you was bumping
Drunk as hell off the henny with the thugs and smoking something acting like
Your cousins but you really wasn't
Plus i caught you with the horny face and i loved it
So i took you 2 the crib for some F*****g
Touchin hugging lotts rubbing few hours later
Not busting i hollered at you cuase your body was rite
Privacy
And i stayed smashing the s*** was tight
What was your plot coming here tonight
If you thought it was sweet it ain't not tonight
I won't go that route it is not my life
Im a baller you a dick you need to get it right
Stuck in my ways now why you testing me
Need to stop stressing me you can't handle it
Cheers and the memory
Chorus
Bridge
Meet em love em bust em leave em
That is just the way i treat em
I dont owe no type of reason
Not my girl so im not cheating
Never gunna have forever
With me you're not good enough
To fill me
Nothings changed from the beginning
This is the end so be it
Rap
I look and see a girl that i feel fatally attracted
Ain't trying to go home to the smell of old rabbits
Thats why we going to chill till i instill it in your cabbage
The meaning of your space and to clarify your status
You ain't my gina and i ain't your martin
So chill with that crazy bulls*** that you sparkin'
Pagin off the hook like you bent off of henrock
Reply's in your signature smothering my inbox
Call all the time but never saying nothing
You for now when you call boo, you get the end button
I never understood you ain't in
The woods hunting
So why you keep binoculars and like a cuffing
You gray baring me
Nah better yet F*** that boo
U scaring me
Fuck you want to marry me
Nah go stalk another n****
I ant grievin theres a reason
Why im pullin out the scissors
Now bounceo..
Tell me baby
Tell me baby
Can i live
Can i
Can i
Let me
Chorus
