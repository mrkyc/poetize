Yup
(sisqo)
Dance for me
I love the way you shake your lil body for me
(come on what's my name uh, say my name come on come on)
Dance for me
I love the way you shake your lil body for me
(said what's my name, come on come on, say my name)
Let me whisk you away
Better yet some fries and a shake
Come on girl now be late
Just kiddin
Cause you like that baller shit
That negative degrees on the arm and shit
Better hop in the hoop with that prada shit
Cause i ain't havin it
Girl i can handle it
Or maybe we can do a little cha-cha
We can do a little ah-ah
Gotta go
But before i gotta go
You gotta know you got a body like whoa
Or maybe we can do a little ah-ah
Right before we do the cha-cha
Lemme know
But before you let me know i gotta make this last forever
You might also like(chorus 2x)
Dance for me
I love the way you shake your lil body for me
Oh your eyes
Take over me
They holdin me
Fell like they controllin me
Moanin me
(sisqo)
Baby i like when you shake it
That freaky face when you make it
Girl you think you the shit when the beat hit
Don't stop
Make it drop, i can handle it
You know what you tryna do
All i know is that i know that i'm feelin you
Your eyes
Your eyes like a vesta view
From the empire state
But we could see the moon
Or maybe we can do a little cha-cha
We can do a little ah-ah
Gotta go
But before i gotta go
You gotta know you got a body like whoa
Or maybe we can do a little ah-ah
Right before we do the cha-cha
Lemme know
But before you let me know i gotta make this last forever
(chorus 2x)
Break it down
I don't mean no disrespeezy
I'm just tryna make you see that
Where i'm from
Yo shorty you the bomb
Don't get me wrong
I want you more than cause you're beautiful
So don't desecrate my virgin eyes
Infatuation passes by
No you shouldn't feel this way
Baby all i have to say is
Bring it back
(chorus 4x)
What's my name
Say my name
Come on what's my name
Say my name
Come on come on
What's my name
Yo say my name
What's my name
Now dance for me
Dance for me
Just dance for me
Come on dance for me
Uh-uh dance for me
Come on dance for me
Uh-uh dance for me
