Uhh, all eyes over here
We about to show ya ohh, you know
Ballers down the hilllll

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aiyyo my men-tal is keep the rock cut, keep the Glock up
Keep the rock pucks in the basement with the lock shut
Used to slidin under street lights, puff a peace pipe
Keep the heat tight by my side so I can eat right
All I knew was hit the block and how to crack deals
Make it hot with this rap shit and stack bills
All I'm used to is strugglin, jugglin
Buggin, with thoughts in my head knowin crack kills
Out for pape's, gotta let the Desert Eagle blow
I get cake, this rap shit is legal though
Check the resume, flip that spit that
They put my name in the game, Mr. Butch
I'ma shine 'til a nigga can't shine no more
I'ma smoke so much weed I can't find no more
I'ma keep my chest bluish
Keep hittin 'em hard like Ray Lewis
'til they can't feel they spine no more

Oh slow it down, walk away
And then you swear you've heard this shit before
Niggas say they from the ghetto
Legend has that they from Baltimore
Gotta get the niggas off the corners now
And we gon' hold it down
Associated, now we made it
What can stop us nowwww?  Uhh
You might also like
Aiyyo we bash in brains
Then hit a nigga pockets for the last of his change
Then put a slash through his veins
Bullies of the block we harass in the game
With a sound that's so hot it turns gas into flames
Y'all keep jumpin around like my raps entertain
Fuck around get beat down with some bats and some chains
When y'all was on them lots droppin cash on the Range
I was tongue-kissin blocks while we stashin them thangs
And now my nigga on, only half of the chains
See the corner's in the past but my ass is still deranged
I rumble in your ear like that flash when it rains
When it hits ya, get the picture?  Knock the glass out the frames
I rap for the name with dope, crack and cocaine
And I'ma drill it in your ear so you can lapse from the pain
And after the fame, I'm goin back to the wane
But for now nigga - bloaw!  Feel the wrath from my game


The whole swell hold it down for my hometown
Show the world how we live, how we feel we get down
That's my mission, show up through my diction
Rep Baltimore every show 'til there's tension
Ain't the fact that we arrogant, we just go hard
High confidence gottin us feel we should bogard
Take over like Bush did the poll sheets
A lot of rappers fallin off cause their flow weak
That's what we here for, to bring competition
Battle anybody, we them four lynchmen
Aiyyo I bet we won't LOSE; what track you wanna USE?
Let's do it a cappella, freestyle for your SHOES
Nigga, Make It Hot don't get it twisted, dumb gifted
Baltimore once again if you missed it
Can't miss The Butch, Make It Hot, Cooli Hi
Associates comin and we knockin niggas out

Infatuated by the clothes
But it's more than that you know
Uhh, we got style baby
Infatuated by the style
No it ain't no stoppin now, nowwww
Ohhh, ohh yeah
