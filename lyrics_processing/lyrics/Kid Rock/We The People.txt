If you down with love and wanna make things better
All we gotta do is just come together
Weather the storm, and take my hand
Then follow my lead to the promised land
'Cause we the people, we gotta unite
To follow that good time guiding light
Climb aboard this love boat
And rock that bitch up and down the coast
In order to form a more perfect union
Do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America

We the people (ooh, let's go Brandon)
We the people (ooh, let's go Brandon)
We the people (ooh, let's go Brandon)

Standing up, and standing tall
'Cause it's all for one and it's one for all
All, all, all

Let's go Brandon
Let's go Brandon
