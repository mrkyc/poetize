It's another night in hell, another child won't live to tell
Can you imagine what it's like to starve to death?
And as we sit free and well, another soldier has to yell
"Tell my wife and children I love them" in his last breath

Come on now, amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)

Habitual offenders, scumbag lawyers with agendas
I'll tell you sometimes people I don't know what's worse
Natural disasters, all these wolves in sheep clothes pastors
Now god damn it, I'm scared to send my children to church
And how can we seek salvation when our nation's a race relations
Got me feelin' guilty of being white?
But faith in human nature, our creator and our savior
I'm no saint, but I believe in what is right

Come on now, amen (Amen)
I said amen (Amen)

Stop pointin' fingers and take some blame
Pull your future away from the flame
Open up your mind and start to live
Stop short-changin' your neighbors
And livin' off hand-outs and favors
And maybe give a little bit more than you got to give, got to give
Simplify, testify, identify, rectify
And if I get high, stop bein' so uptight
It's only human nature and I am not a stranger
So baby, won't you stay with me tonight?
And when it calls away, they'll break a sign
I'm better now and I don't need someone
Oh, to be someone
Here just sittin' down and and holdin' back
I'll hold the door and won't and they don't say "child"
I wanna say, yeah

It's a matter of salvation from them patience up above
So don't give up so damn easy on the one you love (One you love)

Somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew
Just dyin' to be with you
You know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you
So just hold on, 'cause you know it's true
And if you can take the pain
And you can withstand anything
And one day stand hand in hand with the truth

I said amen (Amen)
I said amen (Amen)
I said amen (Amen)
And I said amen (Amen)

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
