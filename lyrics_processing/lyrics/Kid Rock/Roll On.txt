Mh
I love it when you play it like that
Come on, play

Sittin' here alone, I'm lookin' back on where I've roamed
And laughin' how I swore I'd win and not get burned
Left my family, left my home
I worked my fingers to the bone
And there was not a stone I did not leave unturned
And I was havin' a good time

Roll on, roll on, roller coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on, there's mountains to climb
Roll on, we're on borrowed time
Roll on, roller coaster
Roll on tonight
(Roll on tonight, yeah)

Money and success, I don't complain about the stress
I wanted this and now it's here, so I don't bitch
And I swear that time's a trick
It disappears in oh so quick
Man, I was just sixteen
And now I'm staring at thirty-six
But I'm still havin' a good time (Good time)

Roll on, roll on, roller coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on, there's mountains to climb
Roll on, we're on borrowed time
Roll on, roller coaster
Roll on tonight
(Roll on tonight)

And I know it's hard to see with the sun in your eyes
But one day you're going to say I saw the light

And now headin' for that hill and I just cannot wait until
My children grow up to have children of their own
And I'll be tellin' them about the times I turned the party out
And how I stood against an army all alone (All alone, yeah)
Drinkin' wine and staying high and realized it couldn't last
And how I turned myself around and went down another path
And the signs we must observe when life's changes do occur
But most of all I'll tell them just how proud I am of them
And always have a good time (Have a good time)
It's all the love and good times (Woo)
Let's all have a good time, yeah
Roll on, roll on, roller coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on, there's mountains to climb
Roll on, we're on borrowed time
Roll on, roller coaster
Roll on tonight
(Roll on tonight, roll on tonight, roll on)
(Just roll, roll baby, roll baby, roll baby)
(Hey, yeah, woo, roll on, roll on)
(I want you to roll)
(Roll with me, babe)
(Roll with me, babe)
(Roller coaster with me every time, yeah, hey)

Roll on, roll on, roller coaster
We're one day older and one step closer (Closer, baby)
Roll on, there's mountains to climb
Roll on, we're on borrowed time (Oh)
Roll on, roll on, roller coaster
We're one day older and one step closer (Closer, baby)
Roll on, there's mountains to climb
Roll on, we're on borrowed time (Oh)
