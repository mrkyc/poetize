And this is for the questions that don't have any answers
The midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
The can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers
The northern lights and the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
And all my heroes at the methadone clinics
All you bastards at the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and the fifths of stress
All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

For the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang
Wild mustangs, the porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six
The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!
