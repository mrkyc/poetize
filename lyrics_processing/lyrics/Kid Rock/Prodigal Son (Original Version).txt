What I think the major thing is, is that there's a place for hard rock. But it doesn't have to be like anorexic, spandex wearin', stupid, poofy haired, you know, jerks, hoppin' around like bunnies on stage.  It can be hard, it can be heavy, and it can be down without being stupid

'Cause growin' up I was never the logical one
Packed my shit and left home like the prodigal son
With a bottle of Jack and my shotgun strapped
I went lookin' for fame and yo I've never been back
Filled with spite, stayin' high as a kite
I was dealin' and stealin' everything in sight
Pool hustlin' trying to make that green
I've been ramblin' and gamblin' since the age 13
Workin' like a bitch, like a goddamn tank
Some disagree because my 'rents had bank
But all that's gold don't always glitter
So I'll take another puff from my one-hitter
I'm a slave to my trade, I'm paid to rhyme
Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine
'Cause money, money, money ain't shit to me
But I got to make a lot just to be free

And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch, and I'm everywhere
I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho, and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me, she feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back, one day she'll see as she come into my show

Please God, please I'll pay any cost
If you'd just stop the world 'cause I wanna get off
There's too much hardship, there's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers tryin' to get in my brain
I've been to your mountains, I've been to your seaside
And everywhere I went somebody's wanted a free ride
But parasites can't fade the Rock
And any suckers that step in my way are gettin' shot
'Cause I hold key to my own success
And suckers that step will be put to rest
Yes, I hold the key to my own success
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest
So pass the buddha, the funky Thai hooter
And watch me rip because I'm such a slick shooter
Not a generic dime a dozen MC
Never was in a posse, never wanted to be

I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch, and I'm everywhere
I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho, and I'm everywhere
Many nights she comes to me, she feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back, one day she'll see as she come into my show

Now I've been walking the earth since the beginning of time
And won't leave till I've received that 7th sign
All this talk they're going to drop the bomb
But life keeps going on, and on, and on, and on
The world's end don't worry me
And I'm gonna get where I'm going just don't hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushin'
Everything's slow motion like I'm trippin' on Tussin
Fussin' with the girls, they waste my time
Thrashin' and bashin', goin' out of my mind
Crucified by the critics every day
'Cause I really ain't got that much to say
I'm a slave to the trade, I'm paid to rhyme
I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time
I live my life just like The Skipper
But only at night because I'm a day tripper
Twitchin', shakin'
And I kick more bass than John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head
And I won't stop trippin' till the day I'm dead
I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch, and I'm everywhere
I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho, and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me, she feels me where I lay
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go
