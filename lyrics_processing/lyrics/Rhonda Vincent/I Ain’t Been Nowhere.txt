I'd been travelin' along, playin' anywhere I could
When along came a virus, and took away my livelihood
Somebody picked it up, and spread it worldwide
And now, for a while, we have to all stay inside
You ask me how I'm doin', and if I've washed my hands
And I say, "Listen, bud, I've had about as much as I can stand!"

I ain't been nowhere, man
I ain't been nowhere, man
Been sittin' in my chair, man
Growin' out my hair, man
Sleepin' out to my share, man
I ain't been nowhere

I've been to bedroom, bathroom, living room, dining room
Attic, basement, just to find an old broom
Hallway, driveway, same place as yesterday
Go cook, read a book, jog around the breakfast nook
Glass click, get a drink, straight from the kitchen sink
Can't think, eyes blink, man, do my clothes stink

I ain't been nowhere, man
I ain't been nowhere, man
Been sittin' in my chair, man
Growin' out my hair, man
Sleepin' out to my share, man
I ain't been nowhere
