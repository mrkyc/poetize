Locked in a kiss
Outside eyes cease to exist
We'll shut it out (of the fist)
Spiders cease to exist
We'll shut it out

Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say
Dozing off, the TV drones
Huskey makes the turn and heads for home

Locked in a kiss
Outside eyes cease to exist
Flayed of the fist
Spiders cease to exist
We'll shut it out

Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say
Dozing off, the TV drones
Huskey makes the turn and heads for home
