Why don't you answer?
What's the matter with me?
'Cause it's so hard to be
Free and easy
To disappear completely
Hardly as I've known
It's glad
Your heart is broken
And the doors are open
As you're hoping to be
There's brighter places to see
Hands need warming
Early in the morning
Hardly as I've known
A surprise
No, don't warn me
I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe
In love

I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe
I do believe
Another season
But the same old feelings
Another reason to be
I'm tired of aching
The summer's what you make it
