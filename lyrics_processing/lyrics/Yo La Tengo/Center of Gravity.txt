In crowded bars
Past subway cars

Whenever you're next to me (Ba-da-ba)
Center of gravity (Ba-da-ba)
Can't feel both feet on the ground

Walking home after dark
Past the softball park

Whenever you're next to me (Ba-da-ba)
Center of gravity (Ba-da-ba)
Can't feel both feet on the ground

It's clear to me
According to a rule
I learned one day in school
Basic geometry
Two halves make a circle, you and me

It's a familiar song
We've known so long

Your clever cuts into me (Ba-da-ba)
As long as you're next to me (Ba-da-ba)
Can't feel both feet on the ground
Whenever you're next to me (Ba-da-ba)
Center of gravity (Ba-da-ba)
Can't feel both feet on the ground
