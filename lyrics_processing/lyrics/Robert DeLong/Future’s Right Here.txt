You keep preaching that the stars will fall
And end it all, and end it all
You keep waiting for the sun to fade
The sky to gray and call your name

Who you gonna be when you're faced with your disaster?
What you gonna say when you wake the morning after?
Try to be a king in a game you'll never master
Making up an end won't make the end come faster

Let me know
When your war is finally over
We've been waiting all year
Get up and go
Don't you worry 'bout the future
Cause the future's right here
Don't wait until it's over
(Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Don't wait until it's over
(Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Don't wait until it's over

You keep looking for the light to change
Everyday you wait in vain
Keep retreating from the road ahead
You tell yourself there'll be nothing left

Who you gonna be when you're faced with your disaster?
What you gonna say when you wake the morning after?

We've been waiting all here
Get up and go
Don't you worry 'bout the future

Don't wait until it's over
