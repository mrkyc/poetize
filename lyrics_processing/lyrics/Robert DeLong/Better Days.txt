Paint by number
Hear the color
Push it further
I can feel
I can feel
I can feel

Your pulse beating slow
Blurred visual
Pull off the chain
I, I see the glow
Take off our clothes
And give them away

Better days about to come our way
Every day, a little more decay
Live it up for the better days
Don't you know you gotta love the pain
Don't dance alone, I won't make this face
Live it up for the better days
Live it up for the better days
Live it up for the better days

Pull off the chain
I, I see the glow
Take off our clothes

Better days about to come our way
Every day, a little more decay
