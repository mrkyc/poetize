I've been fucking with some girls,
and I've been told that makes me king.
I've been fucking with the law,
and I've been told that means nothing.
And I've been making plans to change,
and I've been told that's all I need.
And I've been fucking with the church,
and all the profits, all in Jesus name.

I want it all,
I want all I can take,
I want it all, I want it all.
Yeah, I want love, but I want it fake,
I want it all, I want it all.
I wanted mud in my eyes,
but now I want back my scales.

And I'm a free man
written on July the fourth in black and white
But I'm a slave to raise my hand
in spinning motion to the music
on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights
Proscribed to fall in love
with someone outside the cult
But Hosea married Gomar wrote the righteous bound to sin
Jesus said no revolt

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, uh oh-oh oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh-oh, oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
And if our main window will show things will change
The Catholics will use contraceptives know how
Gospel spirit slang
And as I show the world I'm absolutely right
If there thing will take their place out of my sight

I want it all
I want all I can take
I want it all, I want it all
Yeah, I want love, but I want it fake
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all
I want all I can take
I want it all, I want it all
Yeah, I want love, but I want it fake!
I want it all, I want it all. (I want it all!) (I want it all!)
I wanted mud in my eyes,
