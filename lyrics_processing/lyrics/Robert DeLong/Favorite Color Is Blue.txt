Locked up, naked with socks
I'm watching the phone ring
It's making me angry
It's making me mad
Maxed out, minimum wage
My brain is a time bomb
I'm saying goodbye, Mom
I'll see you again
Striking a pose
Smiling in photos without any reason
With people that I'll never know
I'm outta control, living a fictional prose
I took an oath, it's killing me though
'Cause I don't believe in the things that I do

And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite

Roped up, rat in a cage
I'm having a breakdown
Drinking at a playground, tequila for one
Too short, walking the streets, I'm hating my haircut
You say that you're here, but
You live on the Sun

I'm at a funeral, nothing unusual
Baby, I do what I like
Looking to fight, smoking a blunt and a pipe
Taking a bite, worm in the apple
I knew what would happen, 'cause honey the vermin survive
Swerve to the side, been driving all night
I'm thinking of changing my name, thinking of wrecking a home
'Cause loving and hating are one and the same
And I'm feeling like everyone's feeling alone
I'm just looking for something to soften the blow
A second inside of the truth
I don't see red 'cause

Now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue

And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
