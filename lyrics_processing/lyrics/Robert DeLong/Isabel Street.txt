You're not just anyone, when you're alone with me
But I'm gonna leave, cause that's what I do
Don't, don't, don't, don't hold it against me
Hold it against me
Hold it against me

Every second I'm somewhere else
I'm someone else
That's the nature of this thing
Hope it was fun for you
Hope it was something nice to do
(For a second)

It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street

Ask me how I could do this
Do have no empathy?
Do I feel nothing?
I don't know what you mean
I'm driving through South Africa and I feel everything
Like some new age-y white American
With a big brain brimmin' with tall ideas

Cause I'm cold, baby
I'm cold, baby
I'm cold like the Columbian river running through my childhood
I hop on a plane back to the States
But thanks, everybody for giving me something nice to do
(For a second)

It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street

On Isabel Street
On Isabel Street
A part
A part
On Isabel Street
Don't hold it against me
Don't hold it against me
Don't hold it against me
Hold it against me, hold it against
Don't hold it against me
Don't hold it against me
Don't hold it against me
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street

On Isabel Street
On Isabel Street
A part
A part

It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
But my heart, heart, heart is on Isabel Street
It's like a part is here with you
