People don't know what they mean when they talk
When they hear a sentence they hear a ghost of a thought
When they end it does it feel right?
Did the words fall off her tongue in the drunk night
Lays down the Ten of Swords and she whispers it soft

Feels like I was born to break your heart
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards
Seems like you knew it from the start
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards

He brings tobacco now, he drinks whiskey alright
Don't remember who he asked to come over last night
Did the bottle call the girl he let go?
What did he say or does he even want to know
As the Eight of Swords is laid, he's drunk, drunken to himself with spite

Feels like I was born to break your heart
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards
Seems like you knew it from the start
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards
We're building it up just to tear it apart
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards
Feels like I was born to break your heart
It's in the, it's in the, it's in the cards
