He drove fast, he drove at night
He didn't break, he had no time
Before she hadn't thought she might say that she had left me
Before I was alone, waiting blankets in the love seat
[Verse 2: Robert DeLong
Pulling covers over her eyes
Not making love, just keeping time
Before he hit the car, there was a woman in the backseat
Before she had the chance to say she didn't love me

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it
I don't stay sad
I gotta pay my bills, I gotta pay my bills

She was passing on his side
He came over the hill into the light
And they collide

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it

We're just trapped, like we're living in a snow globe
The world we had, it's always fighting with the 'don't knows'
You can't tell what you're gonna get
Go to hell, what we thought it is
I swear it felt like you wanted it

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it
I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
When it felt like, felt like you wanted it

I don't even know what you wanted at all
But it feels like, feels like you wanted it
And I don't feel the pain but remember the fall
