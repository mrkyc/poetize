You come here, you don't need an occasion
Just an ill-advised itching for the conversation
Got a good sub going, got a good vibration
Getting mixed results from mixing strong libation
When the sun-god rises I start sleeping it off
Hit the midday breakfast, swear I'm keeping it off
Hit the late-day exit, now I'm turning it off
Now the sun-god's rising as I'm sleeping it off

Still getting old
Space is
Still getting cold
Space is
About to fold
I've got all the time, the time, the time
Still getting old
Space is
Still getting cold
Space is
About to fold
I've got all the time, the time, the time

I came stone sober but I stayed after burning
Got a time travel problem with electrical yearning
Gotta scrap with the cycles, keep the seasons from turning
Gotta slow, slow, slow, slow, slow it down

And I see everything quite clear
But I don't get to feel it
And I see life outside of time
But I don't feel it

About to fall
I've got all the time, the time, the time)
