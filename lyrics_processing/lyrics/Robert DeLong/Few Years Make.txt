I held out for the afternoon
I'd call you late, but my head was
Out of the radio...
I went to Hawaii
On a Trip
And didn't
Come down 'till
I got
Home
Graduated Saturday
And left the real world
Drove out east in my white car
Played at a church with our band
I got drunk, and wandered off with my Friend's
Latest girl
A few years make
A difference;
A few years
Make a difference
A few
Years make
A differents
A few years make a difference...

I fell asleep behind the wheel
I never cry for my best friends save august 28th
I missed your birthday on a 5th
I held your hand it was for a joke
I stood close for body warmth
Against frozen Keeney's field...
Moved in to a smaller room
I settled in but missed the rain
I walked inside of second south and stayed in for a year
I mention the future as if I knew
I went out to school because I could
I never wanted anyone
Unless they were someone else..
Matt and I blazed a trail
Walked on rocks on the streams
Started the summer on a dock
The water was cold and green
I called her now but we're no good
The conversation is without gains
And I am not her future lover I'd always known I was
A few years make a difference
A few years make a difference
My sisters boyfriends old blue van
Snowflakes on the clouded glass
Christmas Lights and Jesus Christ
And visits from the dead
Sleeping in on Saturday
This old computer's constant ring
Golf with Edward weekday nights
He died when I was ten
Flannel t-shirts, house on stilts
Spaceships on the brand new couch
Mom and Dad I love you now more than I ever have before
The house was made a living space
But the sand was a battle ground
I found toy cars buried in the dirt behind the porch
A few years make a difference
A few years make a difference
A few years make a difference
A few years make a difference
Got a castle from Diane and Norm
Paper airplane club at three
Kissed a girl but didn't mean to kiss anyone else
I hung my own neck on a swing
When I was three I cried real hard
A coffee can I might have died every day since then
I gave god up to rationale
I met him knocking on my door
I'll die and tell him I don't know you
You never called me back
I closed my eyes and saw that I was never old or young or smart
