Hey, whatcha know?
Outside of the Beastie Boys show
Saw that kid that tried to get with me
He said, "By the way, where you been?
Are you still wit' that boyfriend?"
I said no with an evil grin
Wanna hook up, but I thought again

Met him on the train one day when I was wrapped in pain
He said "I love you" in more ways than I've ever heard
And before I got his name I thought that it might be okay
For use of service to take some pain away

I know guys that talk around town
Girls like me wanna keep it down
Dope boy fresh with all your clothes
Want that girl where anything goes
Yeah, B-boys want all the fame
Girls get hurt when you play that game
You real concerned with how I feel
No, thank you, I'd rather chill

Hey, what's the deal?
I'll let you know if things get ill
Can't hook up when you call the shots on me
But you got things that I'd like to see
Soft porn doesn't do it for me
I don't like sex and drugs to be
I don't like sex and drugs to be
You might also like
One day on the train will never lead my mind astray
"I don't deserve this" in more ways than I've ever heard
But instead of being scared, his words just went straight to my head
And I got nervous and laughed my love away

I know guys that talk around town
Girls like me wanna keep it down
Dope boy fresh with all your clothes
Want that girl where anything goes
Yeah, B-boys want all the fame
Girls get hurt when you play that game
You real concerned with how I feel
No, thank you, I'd rather chill

No, thank you, I'd rather chill
