Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me
Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me

You were talkin' to that woman
Like you could show her somethin'
And I didn't know what to do
You pulled out your pen and paper
And I know it, your number you gave her
I never thought this bad dream would come true, yeah

Baby, I want you to know
The suburbs to the ghetto
Joy is joy and pain is pain, pain
One day, sooner than you'll know
We'll be livin' tomorrow
And we'll be laughin' about today, today

Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me
Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me
You might also like
You were talkin' to your boys
And though y'all didn't make noise
You tapped him and you pointed at this woman
Then she turned around
As if she'd been found
And all I know, my heart started jumpin'

Baby, I want you to know
The suburbs to the ghetto
Joy is joy and pain is pain, pain
One day, sooner than you'll know
We'll be livin' tomorrow
And we'll be laughin' about today, today

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow

Beautiful baby, don't you know you mean the world to me
The moon would lose the sky if you don't stay
Did I ever tell you that you were my sunshine?
So basically if you leave, there is no day, hey hey
Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me
Yesterday, I rolled through the hood
And I seen somethin' and it hurt me

Instead of scorin' high in college, we're scorin' high in garbage
And not rememberin' who we are
And not to mention, forgettin' who God is
Don't you know that you're special
And God will never forget you?
The world is yours, watch what you do with it

Baby, I want you to know
The suburbs to the ghetto
Joy is joy and pain is pain, pain
One day, sooner than you'll know
We'll be livin' tomorrow
And we'll be laughin' about today, today

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
