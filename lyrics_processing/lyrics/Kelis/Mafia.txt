Somebody made me an offer and I accepted
Forever in debted to rep it, love, honor, and respected
But his image was different than what his character reflected
Word is he's seven-thirty his hands never dirty
All I know this so-called psycho never hurt me
Tips me down in Tiffs, shopping sprees on Fifth
With enough dough that could be carried out on forklifts
Earned his trust, together till we turn to dust
Until his theory disintegrated and burned to crust
What? What?

Death to a soft heart, that's what I vow to you
Love wise I'd bow to you, amazing how it's true
Talk codes on our phone, just to remind you
That I'm behind you, the feds won't find you

Relax, my love, the love I have for you is like the mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you, of course, since my love is like the mafia
And for you I would fry

Mister and Mrs., but I wonder where the bliss is
Sealed in blood and Corleone kisses
The shit I witnessed would give a bitch morning sickness
Decomposed bodies thrown in the ditches
As for snitches ain't nothing lower than that
Cuz getting pinched and squeal on your fam make you low as a rat
Got capos for flaming at those
Lame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap closed
You might also like
What would you doubt for? I'd never lie to you
Of course I'd die for you, I'd be your eye for you
My love, rest assured, I'll raise our sons for you
I'll save our ones for you, load up your guns for you

Relax, my love, the love I have for you is like the mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you, of course, since my love is like the mafia
And for you I would fry
Relax, my love, the love I have for you is like the mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you, of course, since my love is like the mafia
And for you I would fry

Rich in tradition niggas once held dear
Let it be known that your name alone spell fear
Gun for gun, hundred to one, forget about it
Petty shit, rise above and get up out it
Could give a shit about it, time to focus or fold
Many lives bought and sold, fortunes favor the bold
Connected like phone lines from racketeering to known crimes
Winners turning long shots to gold mines
The high speed chases, I'll do them just like you
I'll give them dust like you, turn around and bust like you
Then I'll disappear and return like Jedi

Relax, my love, the love I have for you is like the mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you, of course, since my love is like the mafia
And for you I would fry

For you I testify
