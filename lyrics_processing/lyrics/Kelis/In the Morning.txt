Hi, baby
What you doing?
Your flight left yet?
Pshh, I'm halfway there
I can't wait to see you
So tell me, have you left yet?
Damn

I'm running late to the airport
Every time we do this
In my mind saying should I go through with this?
All I see is you kissing me
Last time shut my eyes
Plane goes higher, higher
Hotel's booked
All I have to do is get my key
I can't wait to have you walk up and hold on me, yeah
I've never felt this way before

But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight

Casablanca has always been my dream
I heard that it's absolutely radiant in spring
In the garden drinking shots of Hennessy
Calm my nerves, it's been way too long for me
Finally, we're driving in a far out dream
Nothing seems even real or close for me
Afternoon sun showers change the way I see
I've never felt this way before

But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
It's okay, it's okay
(It's okay)
It's okay, it's okay
Yeah (Yeah baby)

But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait (I'll be back)
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
