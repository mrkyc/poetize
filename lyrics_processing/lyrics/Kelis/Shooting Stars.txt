It's a full moon (Look in the sky)
Bright as can be (This is one of those nights)
Enough for the whole world to see (I feel amazing)
And the wind's (I feel it) danced with clouds
And the stars shining so nakedly

I said you're something
You're special
You're blessed, too, and you guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me and don't let go of me
I said your wings are white, they're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah yeah

It's amazing
I can't believe this
It's like a dream

The ocean tugs with God's galaxy (Everything's the way it should be)
It's so beautiful when twilight arrives (This is my favorite time)
As I sail and move with the tides (And nothing in the world matters)
This is what I see when he speaks to me (Every time)

I said you're something special
You're blessed too and you guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me and don't let go of me
I said your wings are white, they're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah yeah

I know the phrase far-fetched
Could never seem this far (I love the way you talk to me)
But did I ever tell you you're my shooting star?
Warmer than a house
Faster than your car (There's nothing like it)
Did I ever tell you you're my shooting star?
It's a cold night
But you would never know (You keep me warm)
And there are more blues than any I could ever see
It's like a melody (Like this song), every breath is heavenly
A deep, deep sea
I'm lost completely
When he speaks to me
(When you speak to me)

Said you're something
You're special
You're blessed, too
You guide me (Tell me more)
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me (Yeah)
And don't let go of me
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah yeah
(I love it when you call me that)
Said you're something (Something) special (Special)
You're blessed, too, (You're blessed, too) and you guide me
(And you guide me)
You protect me (You protect me) from this cold world
(You changed my whole world)
When you hold me
And don't let go of me (It's like a fantasy)
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly, yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah yeah
Said you're something
You're special
You're blessed, too
And you guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me
And won't let go of me
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah, yeah yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah yeah
Hey
Look out the window
It's raining
Rain rain, rain rain, go away
Would you mind comin' back another day?
Rain rain, rain rain, go away
Would you mind comin' back another day?
Rain rain, rain rain, go away
Would you mind comin' back another day?
Rain rain, rain rain, go away
