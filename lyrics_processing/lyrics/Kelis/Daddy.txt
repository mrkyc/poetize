He has an appetite for sex and cash
He hangs on the corner talking trash
Or rollin' in his freak mobile
Mercedes Benz on 20 inch wheels
Gets calls all day on his cellular phone
From nasty girls, they won't leave him alone
He's got 'em cryin' cause they can't see
Why he's in love with a girl like me
Innocent, kinda polite
The kinda girl that says her prayers at night
He picks me up everyday from school
And all my friends, they just dream and drool
And on the way, the music blasts
We hit my street, he lets off the gas
Just before my house appears
He pulls over and whispers in my ear

Hey little mama, let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahh
Now take it back girl
You might also like
My mom's met him, my dad refused
Yesterday he brought me some shoes
Dolce, and Gabbana
And a bag made of Iguana
And a blazer, and a chocolate tie
Get it: blaze, chocolate thai
So this kept on, and it kept on
Like the beat don't stop until the break of dawn, c'mon

I can't help it, I just love the boy
I just love the boy, wait a minute, oh
I can't help it, I just love the boy
I just love the boy, oh no

I got shining things like diamond rings
And designer chains, man the way I bling
Had teachers from school callin' home
"Mr. and Mrs. Nice, what the hell's going on?
I snatched a letter from your daughters desk
From her bad boyfriend who was talking fresh
How he wants to see her later today
Face to face so he can say"
Hey little mama, let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahh
Now take it back girl

But you gotta know that the dough come first
Gotta know if you stray, then no, there are no words
Ma, look, I see it in your face, aw, look
Thought I was a nice guy, huh? Nah, look
You say you'd never leave me, love
Well, are you sure that it's me you love?
Gotta ask, cause I can't tell if it's me, or the V12
Hell, it's suspect, but you'll swallow my pride, now let's ride

I can't help it, I just love the boy
I just love the boy, wait a minute, oh
I can't help it, I just love the boy
