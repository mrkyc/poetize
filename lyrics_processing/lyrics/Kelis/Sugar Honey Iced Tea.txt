I woke up this mornin' and seen somethin' bright
Was that you?
Then I heard a voice, sound like birds outside
Was that you?
(S-Sugar-Sugar honey iced-iced tea-tea)

But I bet you didn't know
You're my sugar honey iced tea, baby (Hold it now)
You're just as sweet as can be (Hold it now)
Your momma must be made of sugar
Your daddy makes honey
And that's what makes sense to me, oh!
(S-Sugar-Sugar honey iced-iced tea-tea)

Not sure if I was dreamin' of you and I
Was that true? Oh, I don't know
Smilin' and squeezin' in the bluest sky
Wasn't that true?
(S-Sugar-Sugar honey iced-iced tea-tea)

But I bet you didn't know
You're my sugar honey iced tea, baby
You're just as sweet as can be
Your momma must be made of sugar
Your daddy makes honey
And that's what makes sense to me, oh!
(S-Sugar-Sugar honey iced-iced tea-tea)

Open my arms
See, my love's a window, it's open for you, not to hurt you
Actually, reverse effects like that's in a Tide commercial
We'll be blowin' free in the wind
It's a sunny day, I sip your love and grin
(S-Sugar-Sugar honey iced-iced tea-tea)

(Hold it now)
(Hold it now)
Two steps to my love, baby (Hold it now)
Two steps to my love
Two steps to my love, baby (Hold it now)
Two steps to my love
Two steps to my love, baby (Hold it now)
Two steps to my love
(Hold it now)
