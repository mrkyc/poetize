Yeah, yea, yea, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh, yo

Ladies love what I been through, blood on my Tim boots
Snub noses, club closes, down when my men shoot
But she can't stand, I'm sharing everything wit the fam'
That means them too, flat screen, Benz Coupe
Plus I entertain bosses
At my Spanish style, Lagerfeld furnished up fortress
But look at "Ms Thang", in Alexander McQueens
Giuseppe Zanottis, the sexiest bodies
And I, betcha she prolly, heard how I love 'em and leave 'em
But she still wanna suck 'em and eat 'em
Cause I'm a poet, a preacher, and a pimp wit words
A thief who stole her heart, a prince she deserves

I should have known, by the way that you stared
Eyeing passes by, like your rich but life ain't fair, but ya

Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip

I would have never talked to you
If I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug (Ya damn right)

I take, I don't ask for nothin'
You fake, I look past ya frontin', for cash I'm a glutton
I'ma, bad influence yo, I'll ya marriage ruined
By hangin wit me, you get ass from some new chicks
My life's so affluent, cash & music
Honey's I hit, hear my songs and get mad and lose it
Cause I'm a sexed crazed bastard
I lace Kelis with a cushion cut engagement ring, we done, that's it

I should have seen, in the way you touched my hand
Shuffling your car keys, it sounded like a gentleman, but ya



I don't mean mug or ice grill, cause I don't have to
My eyebrows shaped like a half moon, and I don't raise 'em
The kid you can't budge him, or phase him
My money's amazin', honeys Black, Puerto Rican, and Asian
What a made look, me and you. The king is hooked
Got you the Cayenne green Porsche, ta push
They off the hook, givin haters nightmares walking
You smothered by a popular gangsta, perfect boyfriend
I should have heard it, in the way you said my name
While I analyzed your tone, you were formulating games, but ya
