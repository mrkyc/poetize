Let's just say I like to take chances
Kelis!
Blindfold me

When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like

Told him what I like when it heated up one night
Made him stand behind my door and watch me (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And I couldn't believe the type, he was saying all the right whispers
Gettin' mami right, I was (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
So I had to get the ice, homie wanna fly the kite
Had to show him what a pro I was (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I was headed for the light, he refused to take a bite
Till I put my blindfolders on, I'm saying something like

You just takin' it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me

When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like

Hold up, let me take this off
Just to see where I can catch my breath at all
Hold up, you got a pretty strong team
Got somethin on the bench that Kelis ain't seen
Hold up, why you treat me like that?
Bout the third or fourth time you ain't had to do that
Hold up, won't you let me cheat once?
And I promise you won't never make me keep this on

You just takin' it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me

When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like

The last thing you get's a blindfold and a cigarette
You willing to bet?
Like a ocean cruise, mami, I'm so addictive
How long I been stroking you gives you motion sickness
Grant your wishes, I leave you four senses
Smelling, feeling, tasting, and hearing
One minute I'm gone, next I'm reappearing
The bed is the Bentley, I'm doing the steering
I got your eyes in the veil
With your hands all over my tattoos like you're reading the braille
Like my wine with a spicy aftertaste
Though you fine, I like to cover up half your face
If you blind and can't see what I'm 'bout to do
The suspense so intense won't allow you to move
Gonna surprise you, like Hugh Grant in 8 and a half weeks
Kelis and Nasty
You just takin' it all, what's gon' be left for me

When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him
When he want it he blindfolds me
