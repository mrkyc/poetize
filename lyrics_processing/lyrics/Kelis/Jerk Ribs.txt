In my ear drum, reminds me
This name was just way down in my feet
And these moments move like the breeze
You can't control something that's getting free
And the rhythm's exciting
My window's down, let's roll through the streets
I'll let you get this one for cheap

In Harlem, where I started to breathe
The beat was like a soundtrack to me
I was the girl, my daddy was the world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

The bass vibrates right through me
The brass, the strings, I love everything
Have fun playing, forget the time, and keep staying
Lock the doors, dance, and give it away
Just surround me, I hear it
The melody was right over me
But whistleblowers happened for me
You might also like
It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

In Harlem, where I started to breathe
The beat was like a soundtrack to me
I was the girl, my daddy was the world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me
It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

It feels just like it should
And we got this, and this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
