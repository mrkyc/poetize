I'm not ashamed of winning
But it wasn't that way in the beginning
It was this way, it was kiss me, come kick me and diss me
I had to give it up
Now it's a way different feeling
You took my soul, I had to steer it back
Now it's this way, now it's flipped, babe, a mistake, just listen
I had to give it up
I drove an old school Beamer
You drove an eighteen-wheeler with nuclear bombs
Slowly dropping them down for fun
But I didn't run

All of this rain you've been given
Is just a reminder of living
It was crazy, had a baby, he's amazing, he saved me
And this time it's just us
You raised me up, I can say that
I was too young, I'll never get that back
Now it's this way, now it's flipped, babe, I'm happy, just listen
I had to give it up

I was super cool, but now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose, but I was super wrong
It was the circumstance I got the power from
I was super tough, but now I'm super strong
Super strong

I'm a Braveheart, I'm a Braveheart
I'm a Braveheart, so come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
I didn't run

I was super cool, but now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose, but I was super wrong
It was the circumstance I got the power from
I was super tough, but now I'm super strong
I was super cool, but now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose, but I was super wrong
It was the circumstance I got the power from
I was super tough, but now I'm super strong
I was super cool, but now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose, but I was super wrong
It was the circumstance I got the power from
