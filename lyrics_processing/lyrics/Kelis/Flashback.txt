Flashbacks of the last summer
It was hot and I was bored
I took a walk to the corner store
I was at the counter
And that's when you walked by
Holding your St. Ides
You just brushed right by my side
I swear I got butterflies

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah (You make me come alive)
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
You might also like
Oh shit, there you go again
Speaking can't be a sin
So I fingered you over
Caesar and tattooed shoulders
Girls know your name badly
But to me you're my daddy
Though you only shook my hand
Could have sworn you held me

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah

Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah (You make me come)
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, alive)
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
I'm so blessed I found you
You make all my days brand new
Late at night you call my name
And early in the morning
The thought of sex is soaring
Like a plane
I'm so blessed I found you
You make all my days brand new
Late at night you call my name
And early in the morning
The thought of sex is soaring
Like a plane

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you make my body go
(You make me come alive)
