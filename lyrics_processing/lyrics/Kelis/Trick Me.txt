This is it
Yeah

Said I paid my dues for all that I've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has always been a trick
Freedom to you has always been whoever landed on your dick
Seen it in you one too many times
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice, no

Might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice, no
Might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
No, I won't let you trick me twice

Those days are old and overdone
And it's only 'cause I'm not with you that you make me number one
Though I may love you, it hurts me deep inside that
Now you no longer have to hide
I used to be down with the late night hit
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready
Used my past to get in my mind
So I fell for your lies like all the time
I thought you were the shit to be playin' around
Call the police, there's a mad girl in town
Couldn't get even here without a sound
It's not how I wanna get down, yeah

No, I won't let you trick me twice

And I paid all my dues for all that I've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Ah, trick me, I won't let you trick me twice

You might trick me once, I won't let me trick you twice
You might trick me once, no, I won't let me trick you twice, no
You might trick me once, no, I won't let you trick me twice
