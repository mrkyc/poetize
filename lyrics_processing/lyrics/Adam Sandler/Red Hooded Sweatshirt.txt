The brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen
She got an extra large so I wouldn't grow out
"That's too big for you!" the other children would shout
But we stuck together, we didn't quit
And now the children say, "What a perfect fit."
I love you sweeeeatshirt

I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch
It makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch
And I don't care if the weather's no good
I say "See you later rain" as I pull up my hood
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap?
I used you as a pillow on that Spanish lady's lap
I love you sweeeeatshirt red hooded

Dip dip dip sweeeeatshirt
Shama lama ding dong

Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together like that time I played in that shirts and skins basketball game and I had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym. I was midway through the game and then I saw you looking at me. You were staring as if to say "Adam, you suck at basketball, you dribble like a damn woman." I was so mad I challenged you to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt, even though I beat you 11 to 9, deep in my soul I know you missed those lay-ups on purpose. You let me win and that why I'll forever feel this way
