Hey, it's great to have us all out on a road trip again this is gonna be fun
Whoa, do you smell that skunk?
Yeah
You know, even though it stinks it kinda reminds me of growing up
It kinda reminds me of smelling weed
Hey, it reminds me of smelling a pussy
It reminds me of smelling an ass
It reminds me of smelling a 60 year old guys ass
M4: "Hey, screw you guys! I am who I am! Deal with it"
I'm glad we got rid of him. He was a weirdo!
Oh my God, that was a little out there, hey check out a water slide, man, those things always remind me of my 13th birthday party, remember that
Hey, it reminds me of that girl I met last year who was a lifeguard at one of those things, she was unbelievable
Hey, it reminds me of that rich girl I went out with and when her dad went out of town we fooled around in his Jacuzzi
It also reminds me of the time I saw a 60 year old guy slide down one of those things and he was going so fast his bathing suit fell off, and I just stood there at his big beautiful hairy balls flopping around, holy geez I wanted to lick em'!
I hate you guys, you tricked me into sayin' that. You'd better not tell anyone!"
You might also likeI always knew that guy was a little weird
Hey, there's a pizza place it smells awesome
It reminds me of the time I used to work in a pizza place
It reminds me of my first date with this girl named Ginger, I took her to a pizza place
Hey, it also reminds me of the time I ate a slice of pizza, and then went over to a 60 year old man's house and made him fuck me in the ass in front of his kids
Don't get all high and mighty! He wanted me to do it! Screw you for judging me!
Man, they were all crazy. Hey, what's that!
Cow: "Moo"
"Oh my god! Aaaaahhh!"
