Okay
This is a, this is a song that, uh
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and, uh
Not too many Chanukah songs, so, uh
Wrote a, wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go

Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much fun-ukah
To celebrate Chanukah

Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me

David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowzer from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzarelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need "Deck The Halls" or "Jingle Bell Rock"
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, both Jewish
You might also like
Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonic-ahs
Celebrates Chanukah

O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of Famer Rod Carew, he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish, not too shabby
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is, all Three Stooges
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonica
On this lovely, lovely Chanukah

So drink your gin and tonic-ah
And smoke your marijuana-kah
If you really, really wanna-kah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
