Hey how ya doin'? My name's Barry Lakin and I'm here with the man on the street
Quiz. This weeks's show is a doozy man, it really is. I went around the country
With my tape recorder and I taped different people having sex. I would just sit
Outside their bedroom windows without anybody knowin' and I would press record
And these people would wail away on each other man they would really go at it
And I captured it on tape. Also I went around the country and I taped people in
Weight rooms workin' out man. I would just sit there with my tape recorder
Press record, and these people would have themselves a workout man and I got
That on tape. Now I'm gonna play these tapes for people on the street and see
If they know the difference between people working out and people havin' sex
Sir, what's your name?
