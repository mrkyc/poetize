Alright guys we're gonna do this one
This is a very special song I hope you like it it means a lot to us
Here we go

The first time I saw him he was sweeter than shit
Plaid jacket and belt too tight, he wasn't even doing a bit
Then he cartwheeled around the room and slow-danced with the cleaning lady
He was an one man party
You know I'm talkin' about, I'm talkin' about my friend Chris Farley

On a Saturday Night my man would always deliver
Whether he was the Bumblebee Girl or livin' in a van down by the river
He loved the Bears and Ditka, danced at Chippendale's with Swayze
When they replaced his coffee with Folgers he went fuckin' crazy
The sexiest Gap Girl and Meatloaf in the band
Without him there'd be no Lunch Lady in Lunch Lady Land
You know I'm thinkin' about, I'm thinkin' about my boy Chris Farley

After a show he'd drink a quart of Jack Daniels then stick the bottle right up his ass
But hungover as hell that Catholic boy always showed up to morning mass
We'd tell him "Slow down, you'll end up like Belushi and Candy"
He said "Those guys are my heroes, that's all fine and dandy"
I ain't making that shit up, that's the truth about my boy Chris Farley
You might also like
I saw him in the office crying with his headphones on
Listening to a KC And The Sunshine Band song
I said "Buddy, how the hell is that makin' you so sad?"
Then he laughed and said "Just thinkin' about my dad"

The last big hang we had was at Timmy Meadows' wedding party
We laughed our balls off all night long, all because of Farley
But a few months later the party came to an end
We flew out to Madison to bury our friend
Nothing was harder than sayin' goodbye
Except watching Chris's father have his turn to cry

Hey buddy, life's moved on but you still bring us so much joy
Make my kids laugh with your YouTube clips or Tommy Boy
And when they ask me who's the funniest guy I ever knew
I tell 'em hands down without a doubt it's you
Yeah, I miss hanging out watching you trying to get laid
But most of all I miss watching you fuck with Spade
You're a legend like you wanted but I still wish you were here with me
And we were getting on a plane to go shoot Grown Ups 3
Yeah, life ain't the same without you boy
And that's why I'm singin' about, I'm singin' about my friend Chris Farley
And if we make enough noise, maybe he'll hear us
