M1: "Ms. Murphy is such a pain, man."
M2: "We just had a test a week ago. Now we gotta take another one tommorrow. This sucks!"
M1: "And it counts for 80 percent of our grade."
M2: "Well we better study our butts off."
M1: "Well we came to the right place, the ever so quiet library."
M2: "Ok, enough talking, let's study!"
M1: "All right."

M2: "Uh oh"
M1: "Oh no! Fatty McGee is coming. We'll never get any studying done with him in the library."
M2: "Oh god, he's taking the stairs! That means he's going to be way out of breath!"

M1: "Oh no, he's going to sit with us."
Fatty:  "Hey fellas, studying for the big test?"
M1: "Uh, yes Fatty, we were."
Fatty:  "Great! I'll join ya."
M2: "Hey Fatty, why don't you go to the bathroom 'till you catch your breath?"
Fatty: "No, no, I'm catching it!"
M1: "Ok, ok Fatty, but try to keep the wheezing level down, we're trying to concentrate."
Fatty:  "Sure, no problem."
M1: "Oh man."
Fatty:  "This test counts for eighty percent of our grade, you know."
M1: "Yes Fatty, we know, we just said that."
M2: "Fatty! Please keep it down!"

M2: "Is he sleeping!?"
M1: "No, it's his deviated sceptum. Seriously Fatty, keep the breathing down." 
M2: "Ahh geez Fatty, what's wrong with you!?"
Fatty:  "I'm trying."
M1: "Fatty, you know what's going to happen! Stop breathing so heavy! Please we gotta study!"
M2: "Oh no, that one's going to do it!"

M2: "Fatty, the fire department thinks the fire alarm went off again!"
Fatty:  "I'm sorry!"
Fireman Ray: "Fire! Man the building!"
M1: "Sorry Fireman Ray, it's not the fire alarm."
Fireman Ray: "Fatty McGee, is that you again!?"
Fatty:  "Yes."  "Sorry." 
Fireman Ray: "Didn't we tell you not to take the stairs anymore!?"
Fatty:  "But I like the stairs!"
Fireman Ray:  "Why!?"
Fatty:  "They're fun!"
Fireman Ray: "Oh Fatty McGee, you're the fattest!"
