Heard Joe Farmer say, 'scuse me please
Those were the days, but so are these
Pull over park, turn off the key
Let's go walkin' just you and me
Sometimes always, sometimes never
Been this way damn near forever
Promises that don't deliver
Let's sit down to Patchwork River

Patchwork River, Patchwork River
Me and Joe Farmer walk down together
Talk about hopes, talk about schemes
Talk about salvagin' some of our dreams

Heard Joe Farmer say, if I may
Serve you breakfast on a supper tray
Got no eggs but I saved some shell
Lost the clapper but I found the bell
This man's father is that man's son
Brothers and sisters, has he none
Look in the shavin' glass, what's he see?
Looks like mama but he talks like me
You might also like
Patchwork River, Patchwork River
Me and Joe Farmer walk down together
Tell a few jokes at our own expense
'Bout life on the other side of the fence

Heard Joe Farmer say, don't be shy
Same rules apply as in days gone by
Styles may vary and the lingo bend
What it all boils down to in the end
Pay your dues and take your chance
Don't mistake hunger for romance
Forgiveness is nifty, but enough's enough
When they keep on pullin' that same old stuff

Patchwork River, Patchwork River
Me and Joe Farmer walk down together
Talk about wealth and the worry it brings
Lack of satisfaction and other things

Vision is simple by moonlight, everything black and white
No colors to construe, just a range black and blue
Softer tones, fewer voices
Freedom from too many choices
New born moon, a silver sliver
Gleamin' on the Patchwork River
Heard Joe Farmer say, just in case
You feel like cutting right to the chase
I would never stand in your way
But there's one thing I wanna say
What you do for love alone will last
The rest just clutters up your past
If you don't know that much by now
You're never gonna learn it anyhow

Patchwork River, Patchwork River
Me and Joe Farmer walk down together
Talk about hopes, talk about schemes
Talk about salvagin' some of our dreams
Patchwork River, flowin' with song
Patchwork clouds are driftin' along
Talk about hopes, talk about schemes
