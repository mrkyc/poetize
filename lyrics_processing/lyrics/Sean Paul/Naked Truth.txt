You kept me waiting but I was patient
Now your my favourite
Wasn't that hard to choose
Sex so amazing, I can't replace it
Don't wanna waste it

I wanna call you up sometimes
Whenever you cross my mind
When I go back in time good love's hard to find
I know you remember when we used to be more than friends
I know that was way back when
But can we fuck again?

Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth

Ain't no secret, you can keep
When i give it good to you
You want me and I want you
And that's the naked truth
