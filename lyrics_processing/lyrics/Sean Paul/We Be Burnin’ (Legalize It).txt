So when yuh see di S.P. floatin', don't provoke him
'Cah di weed weh we smokin' need fi soakin'
Best ting fi di meditation
And di best hygrade a Jamaican
When we a bun a weed we supportin' and promotin'
Low di crack and di coke ting, yeah, we soakin'
Herb a di healin' of di nation
Legalize it right now, we gwaan blaze one

Everyday, we be burnin', not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turning 'cah we mind de pon we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds, all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it

This purple haze it mek me crazy
Mek me write nuff tune and dat's what pays me
But it's dat not di only occupation
Going to get some, I give yuh education
When a farmer grows it he knows to close it
Econimical benefit help fi those who a fi deh yah pon di hard jugglin'
'Cah di system only keep man strugglin'
Studyin' people a use it, don't abuse it
'Cah di concentration well reputed
Dat's why herb man dem a di wise one
And it found on di grave of King Solomon
And it good fi di eye sight and di chest sight
And it give yuh nuff inside, just gimme di light
And mek we blaze it, we shoulda neva waste it
