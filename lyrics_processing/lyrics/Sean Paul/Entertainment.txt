Yessir (Ayy, girl)

I'ma hit the club, hit the weed
Hit the gin then hit the drank
Pop a bottle, buy the bar
Before I came through I had to hit the bank
Always toss a bitch or two
You know that's what trippy niggas do
Thirty girls in the V.I.P
Got you pussy niggas spooked
Still hood, now I can buy the hood
My bitch bad, she fuck good
Mob around all through the town
I wish one of you hatin' niggas would
Life of a millionaire
On the way to be a billionaire
All I like is stripper poles
And white hoes in their underwear

Girl, you bad, girl, you bad, girl, you bad, girl, you need a spankin' (Ayy, girl)
Here come them bottles, tell me what you're drankin' (Ayy, ayy, girl)
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib (Ayy, ayy)

Girl, you bad, girl, you bad, girl, you bad (Spank), entertainment
Girl, you bad, girl, you bad, girl, you bad (Spank), entertainment

Everything I do is dope, you would think I was a crack dealer
Big money, fast cars, hoes all in my lap, nigga
So far I done head the game, I might as well just lap niggas
Milk the game, lactose, she could see my chain from the back row
Came in with my niggas, left out with some bad hoes
I got a black ho, a white ho, a Spanish ho and a Chinese
Yeah, they call me 2 Chainz and my first chain's a Siamese
That's your favorite part, what you gon' do for it? (Ayy, girl)

She might say yes to me and no to y'all
