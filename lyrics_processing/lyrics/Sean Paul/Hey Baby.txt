Rookie up on the latter
Hey baby
I'm tryna front, but you're driving me crazy
All these other pretty girls don't phase me
I'm sharp, but you're making me hazy, hey baby

Tell me you ain't got a man like too me
Let's dance like you already knew me

All I saw was you, you know what I wanna do, hey baby
Acting like you never knew, you were looking brand new
All eyes on you, hey baby
I wanna break you out the box, so when the beat drops
You'd know what to do, just see me
And if I play my cards right
We'll be leaving here tonight, just us two

I'm sharp, but you're making me hazy, hey baby

Let's dance like you already knew me
