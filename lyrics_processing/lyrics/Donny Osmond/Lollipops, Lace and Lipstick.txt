Everybody to his own kick
(Yeah)
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Mine is lollipops, lace and lipstick
When I was just a kid
I really fell in love with a little girl on my block
I tried and tried to win her love
But she loved only lollipops
I tried in every way I knew
Just to win her little heart
Until one day I gave her lollipops
Then Cupid shot his dart
Oh...
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Everybody to his own kick
(Everybody sing)
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Mine is lollipops, lace and lipstick
Now I'm in my teens and I began to notice
That my taste was changing fast
From buttons and bows
And a turned up nose
To her lipstick, ribbon and lace

And she's really got some class
She's got a wiggle in her walk
And a giggle in her talk
All covered in ribbons and lace
Oh
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Everybody to his own kick
(Yeah)
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Mine is lollipops, lace and lipstick
As I grow up I know I'll learn to love
The gentle touch of her fingertips
But there's one thing that I've got to do
Taste the lipstick off of her lips
Then one fine day
I'll say goodbye
To all the joy, the laughs and tears
For some day I'll make this girl my wife
And be the guy with the lipstick smears
Oh
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Everybody to his own kick
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Doo de doo de doo doo doo wop
Mine is lollipops, lace and lipstick
