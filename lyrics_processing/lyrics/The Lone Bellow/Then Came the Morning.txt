Then came the morning
It was bright like a light that you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from your storm that you kept from my heart

Take the dog with you when you leave
Wash my hands of all this broken heave
Never forget what you thought you'd never be
If you ever let me
Break the spell and try and
Leave it when we couldn't find it

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light that you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from your storm that you kept from my heart

Take my words, breathe them out like smoke
Burn every single letter that I wrote
Let the pages turn to ash, I don't want them back
Everything you've always said to me
Starts to sound like broken glass on streets
Spreaded out all over places where I sleep
Now you've finally left me, done with all your lyin'
Joy comes in the morning and you won't see me cryin'

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light that you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from your storm that you kept from my heart

Then came the morning
It was lost when you left, when you took what I felt
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning

When the storm breaks the cold
Not towards the line I thought you stole
Start to feel what I felt way before
You broke down my front door
Popped my heart up off the wood floor
Now I don't need your smile anymore

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light that you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from your storm that you kept from my heart
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
