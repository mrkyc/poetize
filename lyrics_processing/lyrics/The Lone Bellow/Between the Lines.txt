When you got problems at home
Like the garage versus your dad
And that old bronco led him on
That ratchet set that left those bloody knuckles soared so high
Like an eagle flying home landed black on your blue eye
What I need to tell you
You don't need the hurt
To make something you love
To tell you what you're worth
And you don't need regret
To guide you through the night
You and I were made to stand up straight
And read between the lines
You and I were made to stand up straight
And read between the lines
They say you only see things when you're sad
When you've got a heavy load
When the doctor says you're dying
And your mama won't call your phone
Yeah the only time you truly see is when you're all alone
And all your friends have reached that point
Where they don't know you're home
