And you did not want to pray
Looked outside your window
As I went outside away
The street it was much warmer
On my bare feet than the rain
That fell out of the sky
Just like my thoughts fell from that day, oh
I poured out one more handful of the rain that fell that day
I collected in my spare time
As I walked back home that way
In the night you said you're sorry
In the night my colors changed
I waved at you from outside
As you screamed of all my shame
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear on all that I keep safe
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul

Your tappin shoes, your wicked grace
Your precious time, your darker days
The days I left you with no space
To breathe or even think of me
Without the worry that I'll always leave
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear on all that I keep safe
I'll never leave, I'll always stay
I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear
But it gets harder and harder

But it gets harder and harder
But my love is older than my soul
But my love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul
A tree I'll grow, to let you know
My love is older than my soul
