Time's always leaving, heading out my door
Saying goodbye, pacing my floor
I can't seem to tell her, but I wish she would stay
Time's always leaving, let her go on her way
Time's always leaving, never takes off her coat
Packing her bags, never leaving a note
Seems I'm always believing she'll stay for the night
Time's always leaving

Before I can tell her to stay, stay
I'm not through with her yet
I'm afraid of the morning, morning
And I dread the sunset

Time's always leaving, sneaking peeks at her watch
Always whispering sweet little lies 'bout her thoughts
Always saying everything's gonna be alright
But time and time again, I give up the fight

And tell her to stay, stay
I'm not through with her yet
I'm afraid of the morning, morning
And I dread the sunset
Oh, time won't you stay?
You're all I've got left
I'm a man on my knees
Begging you please
If you just have to leave
Oh, take with you my regrets

I slip away, put the blame on her
I slip away, put the weight on her
I slip away, slip away with her now
Oh, I slip away, put the blame on her
I slip away, put the weight on her
I slip away, slip away with her now

I'll tell her to stay, stay
I'm not through with her yet
I'm afraid of the morning, morning
And I dread the sunset
Oh, time won't you stay?
You're all I've got left
I'm a man on my knees
Begging you please
If you just have to leave
Oh, take with you my regrets

I slip away, put the blame on her (I'll slip away with her now)
I slip away, put the weight on her (I'll slip away with her now)
I slip away (I'll slip away with her now)
I slip away, put the blame on her (I'll slip away with her now)
I slip away, put the weight on her (I'll slip away with her now)
