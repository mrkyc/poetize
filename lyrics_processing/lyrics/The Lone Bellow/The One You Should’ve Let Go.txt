I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
Out my door, on the street
You will walk next to me
Through the cold, through the heat
Calm me down in my sleep
Grab my arm, whisper deep
I'm alone when I think
You're my soul, we're in sync
I'm your crutch
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go

City streets, city crushed
All my songs, all my dreams
Yeah, I ponder what you think of me
As you sit, do you pray
Do you wish for a break
All my promises made
I'm your crutch
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
I will work my hands till they bleed
So my little babies can sleep
And all of the plans that we made
Fall just like a rose on a grave
I will work my hands till they bleed
So my little babies can sleep
And all of the plans that we made
Fall just like a rose on a grave
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
I am the one you should've let go
Come on, my love
I'm not the one that you were looking for
I'm not the shoulder you should cry on
