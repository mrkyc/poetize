Honey, I never call you honey
Unless somebody's watching
I know it drives you crazy
Baby, I reach out for your hand, I know
You probably try to let it go
Get by all on your own, baby

Walk it out in the middle of the street now
In the middle of the night
Where we used to go when we didn't know
Better

Honey, I never call you honey
Unless I'm feeling lonely
Or I'm just being lazy
Baby, you like to let the nighttime come
You're not afraid to be alone
You know that drives me crazy, baby

Walk it out in the middle of the street now
In the middle of the night
Where we used to go when we didn't know
Better
Walk it out in the middle of the street now
In the middle of the night
Where we used to go when we didn't know
Better
