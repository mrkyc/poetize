Every man here done the same
What's happening here?
What's happening here?
The pavement cracks beneath my feet
Spirit rising with the heat
What's happening here?
What's happening here?
I'd like to think I'm a survivor
But my skin is getting tired
I go a little deeper in the water
Oh I go deeper in the water
I'd like to think I'm a survivor
But my bones are getting tired
I go a little deeper in the water
Oh I go deeper in the water
I feel the pounding of the clock
Ground beneath me starts to rock
You do your best to make it stop
What's happening here?
I try to stand on my two feet
Try to keep up with the beat
What's happening here?
What's happening here?
