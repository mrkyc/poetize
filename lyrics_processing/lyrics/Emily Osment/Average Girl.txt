February 14, you say you want to see me
I'm thinkin' chocolate and flowers
We meet for breakfast, I'm feeling restless
Been getting ready for hours

And you walk through the door
I go to give you a kiss
But you turn your head to avoid my lips
And who's this girl you're with?
Does that mean we're over, over?

I gave you my heart and a sweet love letter
But you gave it right back, said, "I like her better"
That's when my whole world came crashing down
And she's walkin' around like the girl of your dreams
With her Angelina lips, double zero jeans
Can't believe I didn't see this coming around
She's just so beautiful
I'm just an average girl

He says, "I'm sorry, I just keep smiling"
Inside, it feels like I'm broken
I say, "It's okay, happy Valentine's Day"
The biggest lie I've ever spoken
You might also like
They're walkin' out the door
And I wave goodbye
As soon as they're gone, I start to cry
Put my faith in the wrong guy
It's over, over

I gave you my heart and a sweet love letter
But you gave it right back, said, "I like her better"
That's when my whole world came crashing down
And she's walkin' around like the girl of your dreams
With her Angelina lips, double zero jeans
Can't believe I didn't see this coming around
She's just so beautiful
I'm just an average girl

Now they're gone, and I feel fatal
Scratch his name out on the table
He's a jerk, he's a loser
He's a love abuser

February 14, I'm feeling sad and lonely
Nobody here wants to hold me
I gave you my heart and a sweet love letter
But you gave it right back, said, "I like her better"
That's when my whole world came crashing down
And she's walkin' around like the girl of your dreams
With her Angelina lips, double zero jeans
Can't believe I didn't see this coming around

I gave you my heart and a sweet love letter
But you gave it right back, said, "I like her better"
That's when my whole world came crashing down
She's just so beautiful
She's just so beautiful (beautiful)
She's so beautiful
