All I get from you is double, double, talk, talk
Every single day, day, every word you say, say
When you move your mouth, mouth
That's all that comes out, out
Just a just a lot a lot a, double double talk talk

All I get from you is double, double, talk talk
Every single time, time, make me lose my mind mind
When you move your lips, all I'm hearing is, is
Just a lot a double double talk, double talk

Hey hey, get your story straight straight
Maybe hesitate, baby wait
Cause you know it's gonna blow up in your face
Where were you last night, don't give me those lies
No surprise that I feel
I feel like a detective on a case

I wish that I could trust you once again
I wish that I could count you as a friend
Hit me with the truth, come on, it's me
I need some honesty, yeah, honestly
