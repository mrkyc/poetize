Misunderstood, everybody feels that way sometimes
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could fit in with all the rest, but I
Oh, oh, oh
Got my own style, got my own way
I don't care what people say, yeah, 'cause

Being myself, there ain't no doubt about it
I won't cry any tears
I'll just live without fear
I'm so happy 'cause I'm living my life
And I don't think about it

A shooting star twinkling across the sky at night
Oh, oh, oh
Near or far, wishing that everything would be all right
Oh, oh, oh
Got my own dreams, got my own plans
Gonna get there anyway I can 'cause
