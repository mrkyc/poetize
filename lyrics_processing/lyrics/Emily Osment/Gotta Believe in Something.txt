Alright turn it out
Live without a doubt
All that we need is something
Alright turn it out
Live without a doubt
All that we need is something

I'm feeling fine, it's not a crime
I got my money in the trunk so lets ride
And who are you to say we're through
You know this back and forth is just what we do
I got my future in my sight tonight
I just sit back and enjoy the ride
I look my past straight, straight in the eyes
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Right now, live out loud
Gotta believe in something
All right, turn it out
All that we need is something
Right now, live out loud
Gotta believe in something
All right, turn it out
All that we need is something
Right now, live out loud
Gotta believe in something

Alright turn it out

You got your criminal side
I got my miscreant mind
Let's show the world
We just know how to get light
Won't take to all the wrong streets
This is my identity
I live the life of one
Who wants to be free

I got my future in my sight tonight
I just sit back and enjoy the ride
I look my past straight, straight in the eyes
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Right now, live out loud
Gotta believe in something
All right, turn it out
All that we need is something
Right now, live out loud
Gotta believe in something
All right, turn it out
