Boom, boom, super sonic boom, super sonic boom
You make my heart go, you make my heart go
You're so mono, together we could be stereo, st-st-stereo love
You look so low, low, together we could get hi, hi-fi st-st-stereo
Boom, boom, super sonic boom, super sonic boom
You make my heart go, you make my heart go
Boom, boom, super sonic boom, super sonic boom
You make my heart go super sonic boom, super sonic
You got me high, you got me low
You make, make me go, go, go out of control
I l-l-like the way we flow
Let's go, go, go get me that sensory overload
Got me, got me love, got me love, got me lovesick
Got me, got me love, got me love, you got me lovesick
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, you turn it up
You're the needle scratching on my vinyl
G-g-gambling with that delicious thing
It takes two to dance four on the floor
Hot like an 808
(Hot like an 808)
Hot like an 808
(Hot like an 808)
