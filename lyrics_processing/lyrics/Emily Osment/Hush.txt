You say that you're never gonna leave me
Well two times that ya tell me that ya need me
Well this line is mine, just think about it
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
Don't say you'll never find somebody like me
Well keep quiet baby, I don't wanna hear you speak
The words you say, they don't mean a thing
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
Hush now baby don't say a word
You better give it up or you're gonna get hurt
Hush now baby don't say a word
You better give it up or you're gonna get hurt
You think I don't know
That you don't mean it
That you don't mean it
And you don't think it shows
That I still need it
That I still need it
You think I won't go
If you don't feel it
If you don't feel it
We fall in, fall out, follow
Hush, hush, hush don't say a word

Hey, you say I'm only hearing what I want to
But you don't wanna hear a word if how I need you
And I know we both don't hear a thing
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
So don't say I need to learn to listen to you better
You'll pull it away from me forever
I just can't get my head around it
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
