You know I used to hear a voice that said
Trouble's coming, better stay in bed
Then I even tried to run away
'Cause I didn't even know my own strength
I was shocked, no, I couldn't believe
My world rocked, it was news to me
When I looked in the mirror today
I looked back and I heard me say

I gotta own it, breathe it, live it like I mean it

There's a hero in me, it's all I wanna be
Someone to rely on, looks good on TV
Save the day, it's part of the routine
Out of my way, this is the job for me
(Uh huh, it's my job)

I could fly if I just had the cape
X-ray vision would be cool one day
Meet the power, come on, feel the rush
You'd better look out for my one, two, flip, hey!
Now I got my own boots to fill
New identity, what a thrill
Break it down, gonna right the wrongs
In my mind, I can hear my theme song
