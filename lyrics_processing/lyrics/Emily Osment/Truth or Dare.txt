I got a secret, I'm telling everyone
Don't wanna keep it, I wanna play it dumb
I made a promise I think I'm ready to break

It's just a question, there's nothing wrong or right
But your intentions could keep you up all night
You play with fire, you need a way to escape

And when the lights go out, go out
We're just beginning
And all around, our eyes are looking down
We spin the bottle round and round
And round and round

(Truth!)
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Were they his? (Talk, talk)
Or was your heartbeat beating?
(Dare!)
Time's up, are you ready or not? (Tick-tick, tock)
So don't stop when you get that feeling now-ow-ow
Talk, talk, 'cause your heartbeat beating now-ow
It's just a game
You might also like
I feel uneasy, I feel a little scared
I see the danger in being unprepared
I try to hide it before I make a mistake

So when the truth is ou-ou-ou-out, is ou-ou-out
We're just beginning
And not a sound, our eyes are staring down
We spin the bottle round and round
And round and round

(Truth!)
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Were they his? (Talk, talk)
Or was your heartbeat beating?
(Dare!)
Time's up, are you ready or not? (Tick-tick, tock)
So don't stop when you get that feeling now-ow-ow
Talk, talk, 'cause your heartbeat beating now-ow
It's just a game

I'm ready, so ready
So take me on (So take me on)
Keep steady, don't drag this on
And on, and on, and on
(Truth!)
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Were they his? (Talk, talk)
Or was your heartbeat beating?
(Dare!)
Time's up, are you ready or not? (Tick-tick, tock)
So don't stop when you get that feeling
(Truth!)
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Were they his? (Talk, talk)
Or was your heartbeat beating?
(Dare!)
Time's up, are you ready or not? (Tick-tick, tock)
So don't stop when you get that feeling now-ow-ow
Talk, talk, 'cause your heartbeat beating now-ow
