You're so mono
Together we could be stereo
St-st-st-stereo love
You look so low, low
Together we can get high, hi-fi
St-st-st-stereo

Boom boom, super sonic boom, super sonic boom
You make my heart go, you make my heart go
Boom boom, super sonic boom, super sonic boom
You make my heart go super sonic boom, super sonic

You got me high, you got me low
You make make me go go go out of control
I l-l-like the way we flow
Let's go go, go get me that sensory overload
Got me got me love, got me love, got me lovesick
Got me got me love got me love, you got me lovesick
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, you turn it up

You're the needle scratching on my vinyl
G-g-gambling, with that delicious thing
It takes two to dance four on the floor
Heart like an 808 (Heart like an 808)
Heart like an 808 (Heart like an 808)
