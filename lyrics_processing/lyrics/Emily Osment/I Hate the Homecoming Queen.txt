Little short skirt with a big attitude
She wants to be a model, wants to be on the tube
Yeah, it's one thing or another
She's trouble, trouble
Watch out if you're near
She could bring you to tears

She's got two boyfriends and three wannabes
They follow her around like she's Aphrodite
She's number one rated, but she's already jaded
She's following the trends in her Mercedes Benz

Everyone wants to know her name
Walking down the hall, she's every guy's dream

I hate the homecoming queen
I'm pretty damn sure she can't stand me
She thinks she's on the cover of a magazine
I hate the homecoming queen tonight
That's right

Non-fat, sugar free, mochachini
She says, "Give it to me now, you can keep the receipt"
Drinking one after the other
She's trouble, trouble
Tossing back her hair and she just don't care

Everyone wants to play her game
Walking down the street, she's every guy's dream

I hate the homecoming queen
I'm pretty damn sure she can't stand me
She thinks she's on the cover of a magazine
I hate the homecoming queen tonight
That's right

She gets everything she asks for
But she's somehow always wanting more

Little short skirt with a big attitude
She wants to be a model, wants to be on the tube
Yeah, it's one thing or another
She's trouble, trouble
Watch out if you're near
She could bring you to tears

I hate the homecoming queen
I'm pretty damn sure she can't stand me
She thinks she's on the cover of a magazine
I hate the homecoming queen
I hate the homecoming queen
I'm pretty damn sure she can't stand me
She thinks she's on the cover of a magazine
I hate the homecoming queen tonight
That's right, yeah
