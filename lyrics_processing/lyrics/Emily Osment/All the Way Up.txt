I like to bite my nails and play the air guitar
I like to keep my suitcase packed 'cause I'm going far
I think you're nice, but I don't wanna waste my time
I may seem crazy, but don't worry, I'm just fine

All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout
Want it my way, I do what I do
I know what I like, and maybe it's you
That's right
It's a temporary life
It's a ride that takes you
All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout

I like to go out walking in the pouring rain
I want my rock 'n' roll to make the window shake
I wait 'til 3AM to call everyone I know
I'm gonna bring the noise
I'm ready, here we go

All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout
Want it my way, I do what I do
I know what I like, and maybe it's you
That's right
It's a temporary life
It's a ride that takes you
All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout
You might also like
It's my life and it's a riot
Come on baby, you can't deny it
Don't deny it

All the way up, all the way down
Holdin' my breath, lettin' it out
Want it my way, I do what I do
I know what I like, baby

All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout
Want it my way, I do what I do
I know what I like, and maybe it's you
That's right
It's a temporary life
It's a ride that takes you
All the way up, all the way down
Never look back, it's time to breakout

It's time to breakout
