Forever is a long time, I'm not gonna lie
Is that a promise you can make?
Are we in the right place at the wrong time?
Right now, I really need some space
Together on the front line, look me in the eye
Tell it straight to my face
Are we gonna work it out, or pack it in?
Guess this is the chance we take

'Cause you are the only one
That gets me, knows me, feels me, hurts me
And you are the only one
Who's close enough to drive me crazy
Frustrate me, complicate me
Make it harder than it needs to be
But the things that you do, and the things that you say
Make me wanna stay

Everything is alright, some of the time
Are we going through a phase?
Are we moving too fast, going too slow?
Am I just afraid to make mistakes?
I wanna keep it real now, don't make a sound
I wanna see it in your eyes
Are we gonna shake it up, or knock it down?
But deep inside, I know that we'll survive
You might also like
'Cause you are the only one
That gets me, knows me, feels me, hurts me
And you are the only one
Who's close enough to drive me crazy
Frustrate me, complicate me
Make it harder than it needs to be
But the things that you do, and the things that you say
Make me wanna stay

Through the ups and downs, I do
Just wanna be with you
With you

'Cause you are the only one
That gets me, knows me, feels me, hurts me
And you are the only one
Who's close enough to drive me crazy

'Cause you are the only one
That gets me, knows me, feels me, hurts me
And you are the only one
Who's close enough to drive me crazy
Frustrate me, complicate me
Make it harder than it needs to be
But the things that you do, and the things that you say
Make me wanna stay
But the things that you do, and the things that you say
