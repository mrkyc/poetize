We were picture perfect
Flawless on the surface
We were walking on a straight line
We were automatic
You seemed so fanatic
I was confident and wide-eyed

Tough times watched us come undone
You found someone

Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me, when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy?
And tell me, does she make you laugh?
And tell me, does she make you move?
And tell me, does she get you?
Take away your breath?
Just tell me that it can't be true
What I found out about you

It feels like a nightmare
To see your hands in her hair
You seem happy ever after
I'm stuck in denial
I can't fake a smile
You play innocent, it's so damn hard
You might also like
Slow down, I want back what's mine
Can we rewind?

Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me, when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy?
And tell me, does she make you laugh?
And tell me, does she make you move?
And tell me, does she get you?
Take away your breath?
Just tell me that it can't be true
What I found out about you

So much for happy endings
So much for miracles
So much for trusting you
It, it feels so typical
I miss you, I miss you

We were picture perfect
Flawless on the surface
We were walking on a straight line
Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me, when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy?
And tell me, does she make you laugh?
And tell me, does she make you scream?
And tell me it's over, it's only a dream
What I found out about you

(It's over, it's only a dream)
And tell me, does she get you?
Take away your breath?
Just tell me that it can't be true
What I found out about you
(It's over, it's only a dream)
And tell me, does she get you?
Take away your breath?
Just tell me that it can't be true
