Woke up to the sound of my alarm
Half an hour late
Fell out of bed, I put my t-shirt on
It's got an orange stain
I lost my keys, I lost my head
I wish that I just stayed in bed
I need a break, a sweet escape

It's just one of the days
One of those days, you wanna crawl into a cave
I wish it could be tomorrow or even yesterday
Out of my way, 'cause I think I might go insane
It's just one of those days
One of those days

Tripping out the front door
Traffic jam, now my cellphone's dead
I had to say, "I'm sorry" more than once
Forgot lunch with my friends
Missed a stop sign, my Starbucks line
I only got pennies and I need a dime
I saw my ex and met his girlfriend
You might also like
It's just one of the days
One of those days, you wanna crawl into a cave
I wish it could be tomorrow or even yesterday
Out of my way, 'cause I think I might go insane
Hey, hey, it's just one of those days

Wish I could jump ahead in time
Leave this drama far behind
Let me out before I lose my mind
Yeah, I just wanna get away
Find myself a holiday
I swear, I'm going crazy
Back off, I'm about to break
Don't know how much more I can take

It's just one of the days
One of those days, you wanna crawl into a cave
I wish it could be tomorrow or even yesterday
Out of my way, 'cause I think I might go insane

It's just one of the days
One of those days, you wanna crawl into a cave
I wish it could be tomorrow or even yesterday
Out of my way, 'cause I think I might go insane
Hey, hey, it's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
