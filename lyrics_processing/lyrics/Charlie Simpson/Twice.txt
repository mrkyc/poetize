Call me
Completely out the blue
I haven't heard from you since you walked away
Tell me
You made a big mistake
You need me back again

There's not a day that I don't think about you
And I wanna say that we can make it right

But I'm sorry
Yeah you made up your mind when you left me
And it kills me
To know just how badly you're hurting, you're hurting now
It took me so long to recover
Yet it doesn't mean that I don't love you still
But I'm sorry
That I can't make this right
I'm too scared to lose you twice

It broke me
When you said it's the end
I was going out my head for so long
Lonely
So many sleepless nights
Wishing you were by my side
You might also like
There's not a day that I don't think about you
And I wanna say that we can make it right

Well I'm sorry
But you made up your mind when you left me
And it kills me
To know just how badly you're hurting, you're hurting now
It took me so long to recover
Yet it doesn't mean that I don't love you still
But I'm sorry
That I can't make this right
I'm too scared to lose you twice
I'm too scared to lose you twice

I miss everything we had
Lord knows I wanted it back
But I got new future plans
Yeah

Well I'm sorry
But you made up your mind when you left me
And it kills me
To know just how badly you're hurting, you're hurting now
It took me so long to recover
Yet it doesn't mean that I don't love you still
But I'm sorry
That I can't make this right
I'm too scared to lose you twice
I'm too scared to lose you twice
I'm too scared to lose you twice
I'm too scared to lose you twice
