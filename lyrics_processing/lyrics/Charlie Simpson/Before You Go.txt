I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
And our every moment, I start to replace
But now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
And our every moment, I start to replay
And now all I think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
