Chills on my skin, I wanna feel that again
Bodies can talk, no words at all, and we said everything
Yeah, I left tie the hands of the clock
We were just getting started babe, we couldn't stop
Reckless, breathless in case you forgot

Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

Let me remind you, when we first met
Do you remember? 'Cause I will never forget
The way you held my hand, the way you held the door
The way you held me the way no one's ever held me before
When I wake and your face shines above me
No morning breaking like waves when you love me
Pulling me in all over again
You might also like
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

Gods and poets weep their diamonds
We may look down to find us
Tangled and shining and timeless
I give 'em all to you
Like the stars when they dance and align to
Hearts beating and breathing in time to
Every curve, every curve
It's how they designed you
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
Let me remind you
