One more!

Well, I heard Steve Earle had lots of wives
About as many as cats have lives
Met him on his records and we're good friends
He writes a song for everyone
They fall in love and before it's done
He writes an even better one when it ends

Well, I don't have to take your name
And you won't have to take the blame

Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me
I promise I won't take a dime when it comes my time to leave
The others wanted your whole heart, but I just want your sleeve
Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me

Well, I heard he loves each one the same
As much as Ireland loves the rain
Steve, it rains at my house everyday
He met 'em all in every port
'Cause falling in love is a pilgrim sport
And as long as I can be the pirate, I'm okay!
You might also like
You moved to the city, baby, you had to go
But I love apples and I could learn to love the snow

Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me
I promise I won't take a dime when it comes my time to leave
The others wanted your whole heart, but I just want your sleeve
Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me
Come on!


I could walk around in your favorite shoes
Come on, just one line, what do you got to lose?
And I don't bruise

Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me
I promise I won't take a dime when it comes my time to leave
The others wanted your whole heart, but I just want your sleeve

And a shirt that goes with it 'cause it smells like you
And you know I like to sleep in that
And a vacation house at the beach
And a really small wedding, only about three hundred people
Did I tell y'all I have kids?
You're gonna love 'em
They're gonna need to go to college
Do you like reggae?
I love reggae
On Tuesday nights, I like to go to trivia
So that's your night to go out with the boys and then you can...
Is this thing on?
Steve Earle, Steve Earle, please write a song for me
I do!

Yeah! Fun! Cool!
Should we come listen then?
