When the weight of the world bears down so strong
You leave footprints on the street
And there's too many miles to face
Without a few more hours sleep
The storm clouds overhead won't shed
Any rain to quench your thirst
I wanna be the one you reach for first

When your faith is stretched so thin
That you can see right through your soul
And you can't find a nickel to buy a smile
'Cause your pockets all got holes
You wanna shut the door and hide before
The day can get much worse
I wanna be the one you reach for first

Fall into me
My arms are open wide
And you don't have to say a word
'Cause I already see
That it's hard and you're scared
And you're tired and it hurts
And I wanna be the one you reach for first
You might also like
I wanna be the bottle
You've been drinkin' with your eyes
Or the road you run away on
You've been runnin' all your life
The third row pew that you last knew
As a child in church
I wanna be the one you reach for first

Fall into me
My arms are open wide
And you don't have to say a word
'Cause I already see
That it's hard and you're scared
And you're tired and it hurts
And I wanna be the one you reach for first

(Just before) Before you turn the key
(Just before) Before you fall asleep
Before you drift away to fight those demons
Waiting for you in your dreams
(Just before) Before your arms are stretched wide open
(Just before) 'Fore you're reachin' to the sky
(Just before) Before you're searchin' for direction
And all the answers to your why's
Fall into me
Oh, my arms are stretched open wide
You don't have to say a word because I
Already see
That it's hard and you're scared
And you're tired and I know it hurts
Yes, it's hard and you're scared
And you're tired and it hurts
