Got my hands in my pocket
Got a heart like a rocket
Man, a train couldn't stop it today
I got a smile like the sunshine
Eyes close, keeping time
My feet know the beat and the way

Can't hold this down
We own this town
Done walkin' 'round
From now on...

I'm on a roll, babe
Watch me go, babe
I'm solid gold, babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll
You might also like
Got my headphones thumping
Feel my blood start to pumpin'
And ain't it something when the rhythm's insane
It's like the whole world's dancing
I hold it in my hand
Like a kid that is ready to play

My mirror ball
It shines and spins
Even if it falls, I still win

'Cause it can roll, babe
Watch me go, babe
I'm solid gold, babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll

I'm on a roll babe, I wanna reach out and touch your soul, babe
I'm like a southern Baptist preacher, babe
I got enough of that in me that I can reach you, babe
I'm picking up speed, hit the gas, go fast
'Cause there's nothing more fun to me
I just love it how lucky I am, kiss the dice
Ace of spades, remember the third grade
You on fire, gotta stop, drop...
And roll, babe
Watching me go, babe
I'm solid gold babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll, babe
Watch me go, babe
I'm solid gold, babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll, roll, roll
I'm on a roll
