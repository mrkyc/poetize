My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands you shake and which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury, ready to roll
She knew that I had to go
And hang out, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me the first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
"Girl, don't you lose your heart yet"
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up, but still I held on

'Cause I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on
You might also like
The last time I saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone

But I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone (Hang out, make lots of noise)
I was already gone (And lay out late with a boy)
I was already gone (Make the mistakes that she made)
I was already gone (Life is a runaway train)
I was already gone (His dark eyes dared me with danger)
(My mama mapped out the road that she knows)
I was already gone (And sparks fly like flame to a paper)
(Which hands you shake, which hands you hold)
I was already gone (Fire in his touch)
(In my hand-me-down Mercury)
