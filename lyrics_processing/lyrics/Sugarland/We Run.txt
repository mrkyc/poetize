Snake oil and roses, pockets of dirt
Hands of a fortune teller's son
Young love shaking the earth
Like a heart shot out of a gun
Lips like gravity pull me under
Reckless weather on his breath
Smells like rain, hits like thunder
A storm is coming, I've got nothing left

So we run, yeah yeah yeah, we run
Come undone like a string on a sweater
That you pull but you know better
But doing what you shouldn't's half the fun
So we run

Fire and laughter, fence posts flying
Feel the fever in the air
Can't remember what came before him
And what comes after, I don't care
Hands are trembling, I swore I wouldn't
One more look and I'll give in
Hundred reasons why I shouldn't
But I lost my heart in wanting him to win
You might also like
So we run, yeah yeah yeah, we run
Come undone like a string on a sweater
Old enough and should know better
But doing what you shouldn't's half the fun
So we run

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na

I hear the leather on his voice
It's a calling not a choice
And I can't keep myself from following the sound
Yeah, you may never know how fast that you can go
'Til someone lifts your feet up off the ground

So we run, yeah yeah yeah, we run
Come undone, yeah yeah yeah, undone
So we run, yeah yeah yeah, we run
So we run, yeah yeah yeah, we run (Yeah)
