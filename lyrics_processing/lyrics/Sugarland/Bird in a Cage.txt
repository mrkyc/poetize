It's safe and quiet, all you've ever known
You didn't choose it, but you call it home
You wouldn't have these wings
If you weren't meant to fly
It's where you learn to sing
I'll meet you on the outside

A bird in a cage
Don't know that you were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
It's hard to explain
To a bird in a cage

You dreamed you heard a song
Outside the open door
They told you it was wrong
So you don't dream no more
They tell you to believe
What they believe is right
Will you choose fight or flight?

For a bird in a cage
Don't know that you were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
It's hard to explain
To a bird in a cage
You might also like
Same hands that hold your prayer
Same hands that keep you there
You try to shift the blame
When there's nowhere to put the pain but
Who you are is back behind it
And I believe that you can find it
When the dark feels like it's darker
You've tried easy and I've tried harder to chase

You're not a bird in a cage
You were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
And you were never made
Are we all birds in a cage? (birds in a cage)
Are we all born this way? (are we born this way?)
We try not to think about it
What we would be without it
You were never made (you were never made)
To be a bird in a cage (to be a bird in a cage)
You were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
And you were never made
