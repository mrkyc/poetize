They say this town
The stars stay up all night
Well, I don't know, can't see 'em
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well, it's two thousand miles and one left turn

Dear Mom and Dad, please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well, I don't need much, just enough to get me through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright
See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight
Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well, I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

Black top, blue sky
Big town full of little white lies
Well, everybody's your friend, you can never be sure
They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings
And all sorts of shiny things
But, girl, you'll remember what your knees are for
You might also like
Dear Mom and Dad, please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well, I don't need much, just enough to get me through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright
See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight
Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well, I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

I know that I'm on my way
Well, I can tell every time I play (Every time I play)
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say

Dear Mom and Dad, I'll send money
I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well, it oughta be more than enough to get you through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright
See, I'm stayin' here at the Ritz tonight
What do you know? We made our dreams come true
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
Well, they all add up to nothing compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl, ah yeah
Your baby girl
Dear Mom and Dad, please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Don't need much, just enough to get me through
(Your baby girl)
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright
Playin' here at the bar tonight
