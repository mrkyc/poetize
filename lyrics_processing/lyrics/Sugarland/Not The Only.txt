The counted outs
The ones you don't see coming
Times of the left-behinds
The underneaths
The heart that's tired but still keeps running
Yeah man it's been a year
Sometimes I wish I could disappear
Had a door slammed and my heart broken
But somehow the window's still open
Silent voices I've never heard
All waiting to say the words
Held up and kept inside
But we don't have to hide
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
These are the days of the hard fight
The dark night
And the light I use against it
And they tell me no
Still go for broke
And keep swinging for the fences
Kids keep getting a little bit older
And the news outside keeps getting colder
So heavy I can't put it down
So I keep on carrying it around

I learned to smile and pretend
Outside nobody knows
There's a fire deep down below
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
We are the underdogs
The counted outs
The ones you don't see coming
The left-behinds
The underneaths
The hearts that beat
We wanna wake up in the world
We know we fell asleep in
We wanna live and give it all
To a love we can believe in
And there's gotta be more like me
Hey, there's gotta be more like me
Tell me I am not the only
