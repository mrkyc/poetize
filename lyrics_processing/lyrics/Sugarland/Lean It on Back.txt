And we're wondering what comes next
We ain't getting any younger but we still got the hunger
And it's scaring us both to death
How 'bout we do it the way we did when we were just kids?
And we didn't know what we had
It's going by fast, gotta slow down just to get up
Need a little, little more like that

Lean it on back
Watch the sun go down
Watch it come back around
Lean it on back
Take the long way home
You can't get it back when it's gone
Like a head buzzing when you feel the beat drop
Yeah, let it hit you right in the sweet spot
Pushing too hard, let out too fast
And you wanna make it last
Lean it on back

(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back, yeah) lean it on
(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back, yeah)
You might also like
Like a pocket seat of a black Camaro
And a spot out by the lake
Where we turned up, we burned up
And stayed up way too late
In your grandad's old recliner
Sit and pour yourself another reminder
Of the times before 'cause anymore
And they don't make 'em like that

Lean it on back
Watch the sun go down
Watch it come back around
Lean it on back
Take the long way home
You can't get it back when it's gone
Like a head buzzing when you feel the beat drop
Yeah, let it hit you right in the sweet spot
Pushing too hard, let out too fast
And you wanna make it last
Lean it on back

(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back) lean it on
(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back, yeah)
Remember it's precious when it's all gone
Every breath, it happens just once

So lean it on back
Watch the sun go down
Watch it come back around
Take the long way home
You can't get it back when it's gone
Like a head buzzing when you feel the beat drop
Yeah, let it hit you right in the sweet spot
Pushing too hard, let out too fast
And you wanna make it last
Lean it on back
Watch the sun go down
Watch it come back around
Lean it on back
Take the long way home
You can't get it back when it's gone
Like a head buzzing when you feel the beat drop
Yeah, let it hit you right in the sweet spot
Pushing too hard, let out too fast
And you wanna make it last

(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back) lean it on
(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
(Lean it on back, yeah)
(Lean it on back, lean it on back) it's going by fast
(Lean it on back, yeah) 
(Lean it on back, lean it on back)
