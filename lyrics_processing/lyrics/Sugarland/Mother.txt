She'll take you in, feed your friends
Her open arms are welcoming
She'll rub your back all night when you're cryin'
She'll listen to you tell your story
Hold your fear and all your worries
Help you find the truth when they're all lyin'
Even when it's hopeless, she keeps tryin'

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothin' she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother

She fixes all the broken things
When you're in love, she's got a ring
To give to you, she hopes you'll give away
She don't care who you give it to
Where they're from, if they pray like you
As long as they are good to you, that's enough
First thing she taught you was love is love

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothin' she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother
You might also like
When you fail her, when you're afraid
And cryin' in the careless mess you've made
She'll make you clean it up yourself and offer you a little help
And dry your weary eyes when you let her
But she'll look at you and know you can do better

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone
And the secrets in your heart she's always known

She's a beacon, a harbour
A lighthouse, her armour
A promise and a blanket when it's cold
You'll understand it more when you get older
You've got each other
That's your mother
You've got each other
