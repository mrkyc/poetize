Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carryin' this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down

Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah

All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came?
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (Here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
You might also like
What comes next?
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine
Brighter than all we left behind

In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff (Three... two... one)

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came?
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (Here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same

Ooh-ooh, watch it spinnin'
Ooh-ooh, jump right in and
Ooh-ooh, let's begin
And we can see, don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free
I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came?
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (Here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

I feel alive (Here we are), and can we try
To leave it better than how it came?
Don't be afraid to change
