Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
Said, say you ain't gotta
Worry 'bout yo man
Baby girl, just hop up in the Benz
Come on over to my place

The other lane got me stressed out
Pulling yo weed out
You in my line every time a nigga' eave eye
I'mma put some in your purse
Tell me what you're worth
All this shit you never did, we gon' do it first
I want your smile, your heart is good for eva
I'mma put karat, girl, bling for eva
I'm gettin' money, so it's on me
That nigga broke, you should go with me
My spot clean, so take off ya shoes
He got the keys, got it on you
I seem to realize in yo face
I'm tryna make my plate your plate

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
Said, say you ain't gotta
Worry 'bout yo man
Baby girl, just hop up in the Benz
Come on over to my place
You might also like
Ain't no pressure on this money
I provide for ya
Why you layin' with that nigga?
He can't do for you
I can see you really hatin' on it
Cause that's really, put yo hands on it
You too pretty for that bullshit
I wanna get you out that bullshit
Tryna get ya out to my place
And tryna fuck you on the first date
We get caught up, we spend the night
I'mma be patient 'til you feel it's right
Ain't try to say I am a perfect nigga
Just know I'm better than that last nigga

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
Said, say you ain't gotta
Worry 'bout yo man
Baby girl, just hop up in the Benz
