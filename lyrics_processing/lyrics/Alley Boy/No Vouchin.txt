Gutta
For now, nigga

How niggas hatin' the same time that they vouchin'?
Loyal to a nigga, same one talkin' 'bout you
But I don't need vouchers, from now a nigga vouchin'
These niggas lame for the fame and this rap shit
Had to grind it up, hit the street, get my own shit
I don't need vouchers, from now a nigga vouchin'

Where I'm from, niggas slangin' poles for it
Some lame shit niggas gettin' exposed for it
Niggas ain't really real, niggas changin' over for it
But I'm havin' blessings over blessings, I'm overboard
A long way from fools slangin', kickin' doors for it
Rabbit food, dummy bale, sellin' dummy bricks for it
Mines used to make the news, now a nigga makin' Forbes
Now I blow a couple racks at the mall when I'm bored
Niggas they steady changed, 'member times went to war for y'all
If they vouchin', niggas doin' you a ho, nigga, I don't switch up
Keep my family real close, nigga, opps get spent
Pop your top for doin' the most, niggas knowin' what's up

These niggas lame for the fame and this rap shit
Had to grind it up, hit the street, get my own shit
I don't need vouchers, from now a nigga vouchin'

I had to run me up a check, hittin' licks, we known for it
You know I'm comin' out them trenches, I ain't rockin' Tom Ford
Now a nigga lit, I'm buyin' shit I couldn't afford
I tote a four-five, I ain't goin' back and forth
I told my dawg stay on point 'cause we ain't goin' out bad
Had to cut them hoes off, now I'm lit, I know they mad
Should've stayed down, I could've had you in your bag
You gon' take a lot of losses when you livin' life fast
I ain't never had shit, I got it now, but I don't brag
Smoke a blunt and reminisce, hit the highway, do the dash
Ma Dukes say get a job, I'm tryna get a bigger bag
Fuck a nine to five, I'm tryna run it up fast

How niggas hatin' the same time that they vouchin'?
