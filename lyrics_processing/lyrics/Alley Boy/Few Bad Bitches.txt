Man, I got a few bad bitches
Who would rock for me
Who would die for me
Man, I got a few bad bitches
Who would rock for me
(Who say they down for me)
Who would die for me
(Who would do me)
Who got me
Man, I got a few bad bitches

That fruit real
That good real
That crew bad
But the young thang
She too cute
She protection
Big girls need love too
ABS bad
My phone lance
He off the chain
I fought bad
Baby girl, when a black nigga
Went outta town
Lot of money
With a big dick
This where it's at
Strawberry critique
But not ass fat
So them looters bad
And them burgers bad
I drop racks
 can't do
Nigga, I ain't switchin'
Too bad bitches say they gon'
Ride with me
See how bitch lie
She got a lot of bread on thanksgivin'
Cut yo' roof, listen
I got your thang with me

Play me, boy, take lil' back
Too much kush, this shit stank
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
My bitch foreign like a bitch tank
Big money, they can't stand me
It's a hundred band
Blew it all, just me and Dandy
We throw them racks
And them foreign hoes, they going frantic
See, the pipes's tight, them bolt niggas
They start paddling
Got big fine, got light skin
Got red balls
From the tight body to the red tanga
She got on
It's the real eight, it's the real mob
It's my city
I see too many bitches
Can't do nothin' with it
Man, I got a few bad bitches
Who would rock for me
Who would die for me

Who would die for me
