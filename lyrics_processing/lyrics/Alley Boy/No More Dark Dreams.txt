Oh, no more dark dreams
Oh, no more dark dreams

Money the answer it take care of all else
I just want me enough to take care of my fam
My daddy dying of cancer my brother got AIDs
My granddaddy blind he in his last days
I pray everyday the lord help me with my faith
I'm buying pistols I got issues I wanna be safe
I'm from Ridgecrest where them niggas demon possessed
I'm stressed right now cause my life is a mess
My niece pregnant but she don't fuck with her baby daddy
She says having a baby is what make her happy
I got drug dealer issues, I'm looking for the pack
Cause freedom done ran away and left me astray

Oh thunder, no more dark dreams
No more dark dreams
Oh thunder, no more dark dreams
No more dark dreams

Waking up in a cold sweat
Nothin' but gun shots, in my projects
I wanna ride a drop-top Vette
But I spent my last couple dollars on some damn flex
So I ride the bus instead
Wanna bust a nigga head
Tryna get all the bread
And the feds want me dead
They tappin' my phones
Callin' my homes
Harassin' my bitches
Talkin' to snitches
I can dig them ditches and leave all you niggas dead
All these dark dreams I can't goto sleep
I have nightmares instead
You might also like

Nightmares, having dreams, red beams
Niggas scheme on top
You play with me and get topped, my nigga
Full force, applying pressure on these fuck niggas
I know they plottin' in their heart to kill a young nigga
Word law, God son
The Nigganati on em, hundred round drum
Play with me and get split
Niggas robbin' for their rent fare
Niggas murderin' while their face bare
No gloves
Fuck these niggas, it's no love
Nightmares and .38 snubs
Whole lotta bloods, whole lotta crips
Whole lotta GD's, BD's with long clips
