Separate from the fake shit, I ain't really with the fake shit
Dumb nigga, nigga face it, these niggas can't erase it
Still throwin' up the 8's, steppin' hard with the apes
Half of these pussy ass niggas, they fake
And most of 'em in the way
And I still rock my same gang, might strip some' any day
Might flip some' any day
Nigga you can die any day

Black mask 'til you see my face
