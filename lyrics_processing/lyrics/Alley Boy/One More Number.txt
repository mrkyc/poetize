Niggas on some ninety-nine
I been crossed by family, I couldn't see the signs
I got demons 'round me, I been livin' blind
But the truth, it's gon' come out, nigga, in due time
Got niggas wanna murder me like Pac and them
Hopin' they can catch me, put some shots in him
No stoppin' at red lights, we gon' stomp through them
As long as my bread right, they gon' come for him
And I can't take ninety-nine, I need a hundred
Ridin' with that stick, I'm blind, I'm shootin' a hundred
Hopin' my team'll ride, I damn near fumbled
800, that's 'til I die, that's on my mama, that's on my mama

Will it be one of my killers that'll bury me?
Talkin' to spirits, I'm tryna get these demons off me
Look back in the mirror, I'm pointin' a finger, you done lost it
I took three showers, couldn't seem to get this blood off me
Ninety-nine problems, a hundred shots until they off me
