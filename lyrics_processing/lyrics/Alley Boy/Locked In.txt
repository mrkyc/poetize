Yeah
Alley God, nigga
Saw it comin', murder shit, murder man, yeah

I ain't the type of nigga be talkin' and playin', nigga
I got youngins movin', they pull up and sprayin' niggas
Five hundred thou', we gon' take it, ain't playin', nigga
Twenty bricks and fifty P's, we might cut off his hand, nigga
Alpo, switch on this nigga, want me a Lambo
Dog food, nigga get the play then I'm smellin' apple
Velcro, most of this shit we get through the mail, though
I'm plugged in, even got bitches work at the airport
Sell dope, nigga can't call me, less than an elbow
Bought a trap line for the snotters, I broke the scale, though
The whole eight sneaky, finessing, that's what it is, though
Niggas cutthroat, how they pled, that's what it is, though

Them niggas locked in (Yo, we got this shit)
You know we locked in (Locked in, word way invented this shit)
Niggas' trap locked down (You know what the fuck we on, nigga, 800 shit)
My niggas locked in (Block, my nigga, 800)
This trap locked down (Yeah, ooh, yeah)

Ain't no squashin' shit, we gon' leave the beef way up
Bitch, ain't no time to meet 'less you workin' or payin' us
This ain't a jigsaw, if you ain't family we takin' his ass off
Lookin' for the bricks of the tan, my nigga sell four
Same niggas you see me clubbin' with, catch me clutchin' with
Same niggas came from the dust with is who I'm bustin' with
Money flyin' out, fuck it, we trappin' that shit up
Set up shop in forty more states, I'm talkin' rational
Nothin' but big shoes, with queens, a dog ho's dream
Off-White, thirteen hundred for these Amiri jeans
Got these niggas playin' catch-up, mob locked in
No more Glocks, we got them fifties on them FN's

Them niggas locked in (Yo, we got this shit)
You know we locked in (Locked in, word way invented this shit)
Niggas' trap locked down (You know what the fuck we on, nigga, 800 shit)
My niggas locked in (Block, my nigga, 800)
This trap locked down (Yeah, ooh, yeah)
