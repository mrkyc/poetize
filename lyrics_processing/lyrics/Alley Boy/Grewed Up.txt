Yeah, dice games all day where we growed up at
Aunties and uncles was the J's where we growed up at
Young niggas wildin' with them K's where we growed up at
I swear this shit just ain't the same where we growed up at
Dice games all day where we growed up at
Aunties and uncles was the J's where we growed up at
Young niggas wildin' with them K's where we growed up at
I swear this shit just ain't the same where we growed up at

Derez De'Shon
I swear nothin' is the same
Everything changed from the hood I used to hang
To the bitch I had a thing for
Did everything I could, and still it ain't enough
All I show love, so tell me where this hate from
I kept it one hundred, I promise I did
Never turn on my homies, I honestly didn't
Then I got crossed by my homie that's closer than kin
I took a loss, go with my heart, I bet I won't again, no
On everything, money bring problems
But the funny thing is money can't solve 'em, no
I be hearin' things like niggas wanna off him
But I'd never think it'd be one of my partners, though

I had to cut off Lil Right, he wasn't loyal to me
Playin' two sides when you tight, who really goin' with me?
Backstreet, this shit infinity, yeah, they goin' with me
Locked in, DTB, them niggas born in it
It ain't no sideways with you, I'm with you right or wrong
Call my phone, I'm with you how long
One you can fall on, shoulder to lean on
Nigga, you ride for me, ride for you 'til you dead and gone, uh
I got prices on my head from old licks
Six figures on the Benz on Forgis
Thirty rounds on the forty extended
Took some losses, bounced back, I'm winnin'

Sellin' crack, I swear a nigga got addicted to it
Auntie snortin' dope, you don't know the feeling, do you?
Keepin' my pistol on my side, DB's and drake when we slidin'
Catch that boy up in the alley, with that K, Derez nasty
I'm from the wild, wild West, we ain't have shit
But a nigga praisin' the preacher
He sellin' dope and fuckin' the deacon
Heroin J gon' straight off the board, he need the needle
Young nigga sittin', waitin' for some life sentence, he need Jesus
And if I say he gon' get him out of that, he start believin'
Been cookin' crack inside my mama house
I'm like fuck a bitch, I don't need a spouse
It's that revenue, dice game tryna come, I'm tryna feed the fam
My right hand got infected with that hand, shit, I don't need a hand
