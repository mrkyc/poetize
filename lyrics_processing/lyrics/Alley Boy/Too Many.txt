Too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many these niggas be snitching, stay out of my business
It's too many, too many these bitches, I don't know which one I should pick
It's too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many these , you should see that I walk with a bank roll
Too many these bitches, I can't link with one of you stank hoes
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many

Too much of this money, too much designer
Must I remind you? Ho, mob, big-timer
Too many xans, too many perks
Too many unis, you know we got work
Too many spots, too many sticks
Too many holes in the wall, clubs banging this time
I'm overturned, styling just like a mobster
So I rocked the latest fashion, plus these 
Giuseppes and shit, I'm feeling brazy
Too many these shoes, too many rollies, baby
Don't get this shit twisted, section 8, we got plenty
To the SK's and FNs, too many

Too many these niggas be snitching, stay out of my business
It's too many, too many these bitches, I don't know which one I should pick
It's too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many these , you should see that I walk with a bank roll
Too many these bitches, I can't link with one of you stank hoes
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many

Too many choppers, too many tools
Too many busters, I don't rock with you fools
Too many niggas be on the d-low
But too many niggas fucking my ho
So I had to let go
Capped a four-four, it be too many hunnits 
Talking bout Troub, I don't give zero fucks
And you probably had time 'cuz you got zero bucks
Serving what they smoking, too many blunts
If you try Trouble, just watch how he stunt
I was on , with lean in my punch
I got too many ounces, don't fuck with you cuz
Too many p, too many packs
Breaking on down, 
Sosa say give 'em bout fifty, here
Take 'em, and serve 'em, and take it and bring it right back (Did you get that, doe?)
Too many diamonds, bitch I be shining
Too many Gucci belts, sluts like Hugh Hefner
Too many stripes, bitch I'm a zebra
These hoes out here , come follow the leader
Too many these niggas be snitching, stay out of my business
It's too many, too many these bitches, I don't know which one I should pick
It's too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many these , you should see that I walk with a bank roll
Too many these bitches, I can't link with one of you stank hoes
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many

Too many youngins, too many sticks
Ready to pull and stomp 'em
100 round go crazy, hoping these pussies gone run
We street , they twisting they finger
Too many shooters, too many anger
Too many pistols, too many scraps in the club
Too many Robins, too many J's
I kill 'em, ain't rocking no True
Quicker than a , too many goons
And none of these pussies gonna shoot
Too many free, too many hungry
Playing with Trouble I'm shooting 100
200 more, me and VL, that is 300
But we ain't 300, I'm taking
I'm taking, I'm taking, I'm taking, I'm taking
I see Versace, I'm whipping out
My youngins gone go in on they pockets
Too many mollies, too many 
Too many snitches, they part of a hobby
Moment of silence, rest in peace fuck nigga
Pull up on niggas, we wilding
Too many these niggas be snitching, stay out of my business
It's too many, too many these bitches, I don't know which one I should pick
It's too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
Too many these , you should see that I walk with a bank roll
Too many these bitches, I can't link with one of you stank hoes
Too many, too many, too many, too many, too many
