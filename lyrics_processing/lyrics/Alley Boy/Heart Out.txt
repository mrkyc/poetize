Duct Tape, what y'all thought?
Big Bank, Alley God, Ola, huh
Duct Tape ain't nothin' but another name for Edgewood
Gutta
That's the spot where you had to grow up with no heart, you know what I mean
You had to take your heart out your chest
I live by street rules, for real
I done took my heart out my chest, really
Mob shit

Ain't no lovin' me, no feelings, I took my heart out
Guess my loyalty wasn't enough, I poured my heart out
Got the feeling I been betrayed, I damn near crashed out
When the smoke clear I'ma be here when we air it out
Ain't no lovin' me, no feelings, I took my heart out
Guess my loyalty wasn't enough, I poured my heart out
Got the feeling I been betrayed, I damn near crashed out
When the smoke clear I'ma be here when we air it out, hah

Ain't no war, we throwin' bombs, man, them niggas poison
Hundred bands on my arms, I came up from robbin'
Really spit it how I get it, had them J's gnarlin'
Edgewood where I'm from, youngins wild with carbons
I got ghost, too much smoke, hope the Lord guard me
They had thoughts of killin' me, now they Alley God me
Broke a sweat, hardly, they wanna bust and broad me
But they don't test around the city, my clique go the hardest
Ain't gotta rap, I got a trap, I'ma be up regardless
All in my lap, skeleton strap, cocaine got 'em fallin'
We came up in apartments, y'all niggas soft, it's showin' me
Food for the show, swarmin', ain't no love or no hawkin'

Tried to show love but it only got my heart broke
Sell you a dream, you'll buy it like it's wet dope
Got no kick it, my leg broke
Y'all snitchin', givin' the feds hope
Where I'm from, too much faith'll have you cursed
He at the funeral, caused the hearse
Instagram picture on his shirt
Popped him like a Perc'
Pray the sins wash away
He ain't cry, he tat his face
'Til dawg blood wash away through the raindrops
Say he was your big homie, we gon' go'n and bring his stain out
No love, hope is mercy, on my soul
Everything glitter ain't gold
Life a gamble, it's on you to roll
Can't get peter rolled
Bag on your head, you walkin' with a Grim Reaper soul
Y'all niggas learned the wrong lesson, why? 'Cause your teacher told
Ain't no lovin' me, no feelings, I took my heart out
Guess my loyalty wasn't enough, I poured my heart out
Got the feeling I been betrayed, I damn near crashed out
When the smoke clear I'ma be here when we air it out
Ain't no lovin' me, no feelings, I took my heart out
Guess my loyalty wasn't enough, I poured my heart out
Got the feeling I been betrayed, I damn near crashed out
