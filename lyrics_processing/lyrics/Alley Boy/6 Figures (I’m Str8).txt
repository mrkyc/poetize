What BG say?
Nigga, five figures
What he say?
Six figure nigga
Shit, nigga, you ballin' if you got five
Believe that, in these street wars, yeah

Nigga, I'm straight
Seven figures up, ain't got no reason to hate
Trappin' thirty G's a day, I got the P's and the yay
Niggas'll fake, they quick to switch, they turn to Kanye
Some simple shit turned gunplay, this only going out one way
Nigga, I'm straight
Seven figures up, ain't got no reason to hate
Trappin' thirty G's a day, I got the P's and the yay
Niggas'll fake, they quick to switch, they turn to Kanye

Man, these niggas ain't mob for real
I'm takin' a stamp, they mob for real
Six figures 'fore I had a deal
Ask them niggas on Chapel Hill
You ain't never rob with Lil Kurt
You wasn't hittin' licks with Lil Pooh
Me and Nate pull him in the back
Then Black blow him out his shoes
Ask them niggas how I'm really steppin'
Seven bodies, that's a lucky seven
AR, automatic weapons
Niggas dyin' internet flexin'
Me and Lil Deck down in Miami
Rich white bitch out the streets
Fifty bands, fuckin' on the beach
In my city poppin' for Meech
Ask a pussy how they gon' check me
Real shooter, pullin' up, blessin'
DK open up chests
I got the whole neighborhood guessin'
Who done chopped him, who done spinned him?
Who done popped him, who done did him?
Get his partner, spin his homie
All them pussy niggas with him

I don't fuck with nobody, I stay in my own lane
Made a profit off of gas and I ain't go to college, man
Smokin' back to back, tryna make it out of poverty
Rumor 'round Alley Boy, somebody talkin' robbin' me
Toss your full car, man, shoot a huncho out that seating
I got shirts for the family and diss songs for the grieving man
Kiss my mama and my old lady in my ear about them bills
That's the only reason I be droppin' bags, but I'll do the hit
I be laughin' at life, I'm from a corner where it's sheist
He made ten in one night, me and AB 'bout that life
And I been grindin' out the gutter, for my sons and my daughter
But I been on the road to crashin' since them pussies killed my brother
Nigga, I'm straight
Seven figures up, ain't got no reason to hate
Trappin' thirty G's a day, I got the P's and the yay
