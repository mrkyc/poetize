Hey lady, don't you remember
You was my lover, you was my friend
Hey sister, I know you remember
You left me alone, now you want back in
Hey mama, don't you hear me
I can be a sucker for your love
Hey girlfriend, understand
It is what it is and it was what it was

And ever since you've been gone
It's been a lot of good things going on
Well, ever since you left that day, yeah
It's been a lot of good things going my way

Now what can I say
The clouds done rolled away
What can I say
Ain't no more rainy days, no, no

I'll tell ya
When you left me, I thought I would never love again
'Cause you had me all confused and twisted up inside
I thought it was something that I did
Oh, honey
You wouldn't wanna know what was going on inside my head
Now everything is fine, you're outta my mind
I'm ready to love myself instead

Just look at all the good things, good things that I made (What more can I say?)
I made without ya and ever since you've been away (What more can I say?)
Been a lot of good things, good things every day (What more can I say?)
