Loving you, is killing me
When I know it should be thrilling me
Loving you, is choking me slowly
When I'm with you I still feel real lonely
Loving you, is busting me
You don't ever put your trust in me
Loving you, should mean that I'm your king
You don't make me feel like anything

Now I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil girl
Now you telling me, I was bad to you
You don't know what your talking 'bout girl
Hear me when I say
You can't just do whatever you want, girl

Loving you, is killing me
When it really should fulfill me
Loving you, is aching me sadly
When I know it should be making me happy
Loving you, is like a twisted game
Where the only thing I win is pain
Loving you, is hurting me
Every word you say can murder me
