We've been to walls we couldn't climb
And we chased the light that made us blind
But I know
We can walk this road one step at a time
No matter how far, no matter how wide
Your hand, I'll hold
And you'll hold mine
No matter how long, no matter how tight
And together we'll weather the storm, it'll be alright

'Cause if you're callin', then I'm all in
Even if I'm fallin'
Savin' you is gonna save my life
And if you're ready, I'll hold you steady
When the load is heavy

And we can make it to the other side, yeah
We can make it to the other side, yeah
We can make it to the other side

We lost our breath in smoke and fire
As we tried to balance on this quiet
But I know
We can find our way if we take time
No matter how long, no matter how tired
And together we'll weather the storm, it'll be alright
You might also like
'Cause if you're callin', then I'm all in
Even if I'm fallin'
Savin' you is gonna save my life
And if you're ready, I'll hold you steady
When the load is heavy

And we can make it to the other side, yeah
We can make it to the other side, yeah
We can make it to the other side
