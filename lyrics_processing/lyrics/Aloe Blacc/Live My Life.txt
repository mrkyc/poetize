I don't wanna die young
Cause I feel my life has just begun
So many many things I wanna do before I'm done
I don't wanna die young
And I don't wanna die alone
I wanna be around my family and my home
I want someone to miss me dearly when I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone

But it's so hard to make it right, get it right
And it's so hard to live my life, live my life

I don't wanna die poor
But all I need is just some shelter and a floor
Seeing places that I've never been before
I don't wanna die poor
I don't wanna die ashamed
I apologise for all that I'm to blame
Paint us together, regret to burn to flames
I don't wanna die ashamed

But it's so hard to get it right, to make it right
And it's so hard to live my life, to live my life, yeah
You might also like
I'm just tryna live my life
I won't always get it right
It's a struggle, it's a fight
But I know my future's bright
And if you look into my heart
You will see it's just like yours
Full of love and hope
And dreams of so much more

But it's so hard to get it right, to make it right
And it's so hard to live my life, to live my life

I don't wanna die in vain
I wanna fight for you through thunder and the rain
Cause I know for me, you'd do the very same
I don't wanna die in vain
And I don't wanna die young
Cause I feel my life has just begun
So many things I wanna do before I'm done
I don't wanna die young

I don't wanna die young
