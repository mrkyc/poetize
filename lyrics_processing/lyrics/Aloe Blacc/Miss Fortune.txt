Met a girl by the name of Miss Fortune
Her daddy was a very rich man
He told me, "Son, proceed with caution"
If you wanna take my little girl's hand

See money that I have might be good for some
And down right danger to another
And little Miss Fortune is sure to become
Unfortunately just like her mother

Hey he said, "Back when I was young and dumb, I had a choice"
Before me and mama Fortune got wed, mmm
Between riding in a bus or driving a new Rolls Royce yeah
And I decided what I wanted was the bread, hey
But the problem with having everything you want, mmm
Is you never really know what you need, hey
Now Miss Fortune is a spoiled little debutante
And it's my fault so I suggest you take my heed

So you met my little girl Miss Fortune
And you know that I'm a very rich man
I told you to precede with caution
If you wanna take my little girl's hand
You might also like

Well I thanked Miss Fortune's father
Said I understand
But you're trying to talk me down
Yes you are
Listen here
You ain't have to bother
Cause I'm a real strong man
I'm sure I can turn your daughter around
See what she needs is someone who can take control
Let the girl know her place and how to play her role
Tell her all the money in the world cannot replace her soul
Hell she needs is stop acting like twelve years old

Well she put the ring on her finger
Everything started to change
And I looked at myself in the mirror
You know I was looking strange
She had me out every day spending money
On all kinds of ridiculous things
See I forget what life was all about
Little Miss Fortune was to blame
So I married this girl Miss Fortune
Whose daddy was a very rich man
And even though he told me take caution
I still took his little girl's hand

See money don't do everybody the same
And it's down right danger to a brother
And little Miss Fortune surely became
Unfortunately just like her mother, hey

You gotta watch out for Miss Fortune
Brothers you must proceed with caution
Don't let lady luck pass you by, no
And might as well give good grace a try

All I wanted was a little dance with lady luck
But she won't give me a chance
What I could use is some good old grace
But she refuses to show her face
