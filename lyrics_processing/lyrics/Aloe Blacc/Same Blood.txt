We've got the same blood
The same blood
Stayed by your side
It's ride or die
We've got the same blood

We're the run toward the fire kind
We're the fearless on the front line
We're the never leave each other
Always laying down to cover
Take a bullet for your brother kind
We're the heroes in the background
We're the brave who never back down
For the glory, for the honor
Tell the story when you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger now

'Cause you and me are both soldiers
Ain't coming back 'till it's over
I'll carry you home on my shoulder

We've got the same blood
And when the rain comes
Walk through the same mud
Stay by your side
It's ride or die
We've got the same blood
Don't matter where you came from
'Cause when the day's gone
We've got the same blood
You might also like
We're the stand and face the music kind
Two warriors with one mind
We're the never tell a secret
Ain't no way we gonna leak it
To the grave we're gonna keep it kind

'Cause you and me are both soldiers
Ain't coming back 'till it's over
I'll carry you home on my shoulder

We've got the same blood
And when the rain comes
Walk through the same mud
Stay by your side
It's ride or die
We've got the same blood
Don't matter where you came from
'Cause when the day's gone
We've got the same blood

We're all part of the same organism
Between our hearts there ain't no division
We all share the tears and grieve
We all share this air we breathe
And when it's our time to leave
It's the same red that we bleed
It's the same red that we bleed
We've got the same blood
And when the rain comes
Walk through the same mud
Stay by your side
It's ride or die
We've got the same blood
Don't matter where you came from
'Cause when the day's gone
