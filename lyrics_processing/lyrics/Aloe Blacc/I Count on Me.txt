If there's one thing that I'm sure about
It's that I got a lot to learn
If there's another thing that I'm sure about
It's that I'm sick of sitting, waitin' my turn
I've been knocked around, pushed to the ground
People try to hold me down
But here's a little thing that I'm sure about
I'm gon' be standin' firm
When I get back up again

I count on me
When everybody's counting me out
I count on me
When the world is full of doubt
Through the storm, through the pain
Through the fire and through the rain
I count on me
And that's the way it's gonna be

When I look around, all that I can see
Is people trying to shift the blame
When I look around, yeah, it's clear to me
Somethin' 'bout me ain't the same
Some people are cold, selling their soul
I don't wanna be that way
Take a look around, take a look at me
I ain't never gonna change
'Cause I know what I believe
You might also like
I count on me
When everybody's counting me out
I count on me
When the world is full of doubt
Through the storm, through the pain
Through the fire and through the rain
I count on me
And that's the way it's gonna be

Now I ain't sayin' I can't rely on no one else
'Cause there are days when I'm tryin' to find a little help
My friends got good intentions and though they mean well
Don't nobody know me, like I know I know myself

I count on me
When everybody's counting me out
I count on me
When the world is full of doubt
Through the storm, through the pain
Through the fire and through the rain
I count on me
And that's the way it's gotta be
I count on me
When there's no one to turn to, nowhere to go
I count on me
When I'm tryin' to find a helping hand, they have me know
I count on me
Through the fire, through the rain, through the snow
I count on me
