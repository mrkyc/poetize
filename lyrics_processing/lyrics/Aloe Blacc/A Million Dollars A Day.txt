I got dreams, y'all (talk about it)
Big old pie in the sky, hopes are high
Crazy dreams, y'all (talk about it)
Bucket list full of ignorance is bliss
And fancy little things, y'all, twinkling in my eye
Hoping that I live to see it all before I die

I heard about the power of intention
Did I forget to mention, I just wanna get paid

A million dollars a day, hey
A million dollars a day, hey
Said I just wanna get paid, 'cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day, I deserve it
A million dollars a day
Hey

I got needs, y'all (talk about it)
I'm in debt to my knees from tuition and fees
From my degrees, y'all (talk about it)
And my skills should pay the bills
But I still got a couple mouths to feed, y'all
And they ask me all the time:
("Daddy, why do we always gotta stand in this line?")

Give me please a million dollars a day, hey
A million dollars a day, hey
Said I just wanna get paid, 'cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day, watch me work it
A million dollars a day
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

In my wildest imagination (imagination)
My whole life is just a vacation (just a vacation)
If I believe in it (If I believe in it), I can achieve it (I can achieve it)
Put it in the air, and wait to receive it
A million dollars a day (Gimmie that money, gimmie that money, gimmie that money, yeah)
A million dollars a day (Show me that money, show me that money, show me that money, yeah)
Said I just wanna get paid (Gimmie that money, gimmie that money, gimmie that money, yeah)
'Cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day (Show me that money, show me that money, show me that money, yeah)
I deserve it
That's one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero
And an extra zero for me
A million dollars a day (Gimmie that money, gimmie that money, gimmie that money, yeah)
