This ain't for the money, this is for the love
This is sweatin' through my shirt before the sun's up
Thought that I was shook, thought that I would stop
And now, I got 'em waitin' for the other shoe to drop
Oh, I'm a flame, burning bold in a world that's so cold

I'm just gettin' started
I been makin' moves before the dawn
Cuttin' through the darkness
Pray nobody say it don't be long
I'll be the first shot heard, then you run for cover
Take my word, ain't no other
Now, I'm just gettin' started
And I can go on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I'ma drink from a winner cup, mixin' hard work with beginner's luck
If I fall first, then lift me up, never call curtains, common courtesy
Curiosity, it killed the kitty, but he got to work for me
Inadvertently, I manifested something great, but it's still to determine the fate
I'ma turn the tables, from the cradle to the grave
Heavyweight leg day, steady pray
Heavy head, wear his crown way down every day
Here now, make a way, clear foul, lane change
Breakin' out the crazy house, or whatever them people was sayin' 'bout me
Hit the leverage, you're not on my level, the engine is revvin'
I'm ready, I'm ready, I swear, you gon' hear about me
You might also like
I'm just gettin' started
I been makin' moves before the dawn
Cuttin' through the darkness
Pray nobody say it don't be long
I'll be the first shot heard, then you run for cover (Run for cover)
Take my word, ain't no other
Now I'm just gettin' started
And I can go on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I can see the future, it ain't no mystery
I'm on the throne, lookin' down, makin' history
While you was smellin' roses, I was puttin' work in

I'm just gettin' started
I been makin' moves before the dawn
Cuttin' through the darkness
Pray nobody say it don't be long
I'll be the first shot heard, then you run for cover
Take my word, ain't no other
Now I'm just gettin' started
