There's a river that rolls on by
This old farm where I'll probably die
I never needed to see much more than what I can see from my front porch
If the rain doesn't come the crops won't grow
I'll just stand in a field and watch the dry wind blow the dirt away
Aw, but I'll be okay

'Cause my mama loves me and my daddy loves me
And I give thanks to the man above me
Nothin' more than I am
I'm just a simple workin' man
And I wake up to a vision of curls
It's that beautiful woman that rocks my world
At the end of the day when I count my blessings up
And I've got enough

I never planned on strickin' it rich
Hell, I still drive an old '86
Chevy Da'ville it gets me around
And I pray every mornin' it don't break down
But the  holds everything of my soul
Someday if it should be told
Just worn out  I wouldn't change
I've got everything I need

'Cause my mama loves me and my daddy loves me
And I give thanks to the man above me
Nothin' more than I am
I'm just a simple workin' man
And I wake up to a vision of curls
It's that beautiful woman that rocks my world
At the end of the day when I count my blessings up
And I've got enough

Yeah, my mama loves me and my daddy loves me
And I give thanks to the man above me
Nothin' more than I am
I'm just a simple workin' man
And I wake up to a vision of curls
It's that beautiful woman that rocks my world
At the end of the day when I count my blessings up
And I've got enough
