Why'd ever break up why'd we ever move on
You might think i'm dumb but I think we got it dead wrong
Seeing you tonight takes me back to a time and place
Waves crash down on 38
I'll never forget it

It's been a hot minute since we were the ones
Getting lost in it drunk on patron
A little sea salt living in the air
And on your lips whispering in my ear
When we did it on the sand
Sweet time slipping, through our hands
Sun chase the moon, moon chase the time
I was yours and you were mine
For a hot minute

Are you here with your friends are you seeing some guy
Girl how have you been looks live you're doing alright
So what would you say if I bought you a shot
Pretend that the clock stopped right were we left off
Just go with it

It's been a hot minute since we were the ones
Getting lost in it drunk on patron
A little sea salt living in the air
And on your lips whispering in my ear
When we did it on the sand
Sweet time slipping, through our hands
Sun chase the moon, moon chase the time
I was yours and you were mine
For a hot minute

Seeing you tonight takes me back to a time and place
Waves crashing down on 38

It's been a hot minute since we were the ones
Getting lost in it drunk on patron
A little sea salt living in the air
And on your lips whispering in my ear
When we did it on the sand
Sweet time slipping, through our hands
Sun chase the moon, moon chase the time
I was yours and you were mine
For a hot minute
