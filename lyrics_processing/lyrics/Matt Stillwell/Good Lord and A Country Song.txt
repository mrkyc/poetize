And that house that I was raised we bowed our heads said Amen
But in my daddy's truck, I grew up on Willie and Waylon
Grandma's broken bible and Grandpa's worn out vinyl
It was stories of heaven and hell, told by outlaws and decipiles
Between the sunday morning hemn and sunday morning coming down

Taught me some real things
About life and heartache
And love  and forgiveness
In church pews and back roads

More times than I know
Or even care to mention
But I'm proud to say
That I feel right at home
Between the good lord and a country song

I sure hope that someday
When I reach them  pearly gates
Theres a juke box in the corner thats gonna play
Don Williams and good ol' boys like
That records spinning then heavens where I'll be
