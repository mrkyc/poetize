Hey

She was the one God made for me
I still don't know why I couldn't see
Everyone else saw, aw, I missed it all
What a shame
I spent my nights spinnin' my wheels
Goin' 'round and 'round tryin' to heal
Scars that won't go away, ahh, what's it gonna take?
Is it over when it breaks?

Her face is painted in my mind
And my mind is wrapped around her words
And her words tell this heart of mine

Reserved, I'll never say she's gone
And I'll never give up, I ain't movin' on
Reserved, she still has a place
Whether she's in my arms or a thousand miles away
But it's out of my hands, my heart will always be hers
Reserved
You might also like
I still remember how she 
Write her name next to mine over and over again
And how she used to laugh, God I miss that
I miss everything
What was I thinkin', why in the hell did I spend her time thinkin' of myself?
She's all that I need and that's easy to see
Down here on my knees

Her face is painted in my mind
And my mind is wrapped around her words
And her words tell this heart of mine

Reserved, I'll never say she's gone
And I'll never give up, I ain't movin' on
Reserved, she still has a place
Whether she's in my arms or a thousand miles away
But it's out of my hands, my heart will always be hers
