In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
"Can we get on out of here?"
It was down some back road
In the backseat up close
Hitched up by the next year
It all started with a cold beer
I was sweet on her she was leery of me
I was all arms, she was "uh uh please, do not touch"
I thought how am I gonna break the ice
With a girl that's so pretty and so nice
It all started with a cold beer
In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
"Can we get on out of here?"
It was down some back road
In the backseat up close
Hitched up by the next year
It all started with a cold beer
Well she's knocked up, starting to show
We're bout to let our families know
We're bit stressed
We were both livin wild and free
Ready as we'll never be, scared to death
Yea I fear a loaded shotgun to my back
When we break the news to the soon to be granddad

Yea we got it comin when this one turns 16
If that apple don't fall far from the tree
