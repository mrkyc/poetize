I can see them 4 wheels
And her waving through the windshield
Well it ain't no big deal
Ain't the first won't be the last
Had a good thing going till
Girl had to get going
Only thing I know is
It ain't nothing but a setback

So I think i'm gonna set back and drink one
Watch the sun set with a cold one
When the moon shines I might smoke one
Sometimes you gotta roll like that
Turn the goodbye to a good time
Get the all hell feeling all right
I'm moving on sippin on
A twelve pack
Setback setback
Let the wind roll off of my back
Setback setback

I feel a little buzz buzzing
Like I ain't missing nothing
If a hangovers coming
It ain't nothing but a setback
You might also like
So I think i'm gonna set back and drink one
Watch the sun set with a cold one
When the moon shines I might smoke one
Sometimes you gotta roll like that
Turn the goodbye to a good time
Get the all hell feeling all right
I'm moving on sippin on
A twelve pack
Setback setback
Let the wind roll off of my back

Well it is what it is gotta get it together
The more I drink the more I feel better
The more I feel better the better I am
I don't even give a damn

So I think i'm gonna set back and drink one
Watch the sun set with a cold one
When the moon shines I might smoke one
Sometimes you gotta roll like that
Turn the goodbye to a good time
Get the all hell feeling all right
I'm moving on sippin on
A twelve pack
Setback setback
Let the wind roll off of my back
