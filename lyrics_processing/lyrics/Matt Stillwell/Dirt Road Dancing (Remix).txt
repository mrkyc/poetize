Kick off your shoes and throw 'em on the floor
Ain't gonna dance no cotton eyed joe
Cot-cot-cotton eyed joe

Take a left at the wheat field just before the frog pond
Follow the tail lights for a country mile
Parked underneath the pine trees, turn the radio up loud
Do a little dirt road dancing for a while

Better roll up your jeans up, gonna wanna a cold beer
Night to meet a sweetheart, maybe start a fire
It's gonna be a long night, everybody's gonna be there
Dirt road dancing, wicked time

Kickin' up dust on the red clay floor
Gettin' down in the great outdoors
The moonlight fall and haul around
Southern nights make the sweetest sound
For a little dirt road dancing

Shadows in the head lights, couples gettin' closer
Somebody's gettin' lucky out behind the hay
Ain't talking about two step, ain't talking about do-si-do
I'm talkin' about dirt road dancing the night away
You might also like
Kickin' up dust on the red clay floor
Gettin' down in the great outdoors
Moonlight fall and haul around
Southern nights make the sweetest sound
For a little dirt road dancing

Well hi you country girl pop up in this truck
Let's take it down a dirt road where we can go find
Someplace that we can park
Drop the tailgate, kissin' in the dark
There ain't no tellin' what we gon' do
Just a whole lotta me lovin' up on you
So don't say no, just take that chance
And me and you go dirt road dancing

Kickin' up dust on the red clay floor
Gettin' down in the great outdoors
Moonlight fall and haul around
Southern nights make the sweetest sound

Kickin' up dust on the red clay floor
Gettin' down in the great outdoors
Moonlight fall and haul around
Southern nights make the sweetest sound
For a little dirt road dancing
Just a little dirt road dancing
Dirt road dancing
