It all started with a cold beer
It all started with a cold beer
In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
Can we get on out of here
It was down some back road
In the backseat up close
Hitched up by the next year
It all started with a cold beer

A bunch of friends just a tailgate sittin'
A little backwoods chillin' and some bonfire pickin'
Seein' a pretty little thing in some tight blue jeans
A little John Deere shirt and it was bustin' at the seam
So I asked her her name and then she asked for mine
She said I know your game I done seen your kind
Man I want a baby bad so I had to recoup
Another hand I got a plan just to change the mood

It all started with a cold beer
In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
Can we get on out of here
It was down some back road
In the backseat up close
Hitched up by the next year
It all started with a cold beer

An old Blue Moon brewsky after nine or ten more
It's like we popped us a Rufi
I missed a stop sign, ran the red light
Few weeks later readin' two pea lies
Me and in-laws waitin' in the hallway
Bubba guts been workin' on me all day
To celebrate my little baby's first year
I snuck down to my truck and had an ice cold beer

Yea we got it comin' when this one turns 16
If that apple don't fall far from the tree

It all started with a cold beer
In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
Can we get on out of here
It was down some back road
In the backseat up close
Hitched up by the next year
It all started with a cold beer

And another cold beer
