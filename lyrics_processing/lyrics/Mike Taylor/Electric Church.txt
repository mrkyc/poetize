If it feels good, sounds good, then it is good, real good
If it looks tight, tastes nice, then it's alright, I want it all night

I'm feeling myself, feeling myself
And nothing's gonna take me away tonight
No you're feeling yourself, feeling yourself
Nobody's gonna tell you a thing tonight
We don't have to talk, you don't have to speak
Communicate through our body language
We don't have to talk, you don't have to speak
Communicate through our body language

Let the rhythm into your heart, yeah
Let the spirit into your soul, yeah
Let this music into your body, yeah
Let this music into your body, yeah
Church

If it feels real and the vibes chill, then it is real, so trill
If it got a little dirt, grit, a little broken, then it's perfect, it's worth it

I'm feeling myself, feeling myself
And nothing's gonna take me away tonight
No you're feeling yourself, feeling yourself
Nobody's gonna tell you a thing tonight
We don't have to talk, you don't have to speak
Communicate through our body language
We don't have to talk, you don't have to speak
Communicate through our body language
