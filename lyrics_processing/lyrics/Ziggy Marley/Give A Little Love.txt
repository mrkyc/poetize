Have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Livin in this crazy world
So caught up in the confusion
Nothin is makin sense
For me and you
Maybe we can find a way
Theres got to be solution
How to make a brighter day
What do we do?
We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Lets do what we can do together
We can really make it better, yeah
Only if we try
Got the words on our minds
Got the troubles on our shoulders
Sometimes it seems so much
What we go through
Maybe if we take the time
Time to understand each other
You can learn to make it right
What do we do?
We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Lets do what we can do together
We can really make it better, yeah
Only if we try, only if we try
If everybody took somebody by the hand
Come and take it by the hand
Then maybe everyone could learn to love
And I'll understand
We can really make it better, yeah
Only if we try
Sing it
We can really make it better, yeah
Only if we try
We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Bring this one a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Lets do what we can do together
