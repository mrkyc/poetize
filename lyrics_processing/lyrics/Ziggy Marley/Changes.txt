Changes, changes, yeah oh
For ordinary people now
Changes, changes, yes
For ordinary people now

There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, won't you tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many, the wants of the few
We can find religion in the freedom we choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
Oh, can't you tell by the look on my face?
And there's one thing that I must convey

Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now, yeah
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now

I just can't help the way that I feel
We all want our dreams to be real
Yet circumstances that I just can't understand
Why does money got to make the man?
Everyone has an ego to feed
And every want is filled with greed
So here's one thing that I've got to say

Changes, changes, yeah, yeah
For ordinary people now
Yeah, changes, changes
For ordinary people now, y'all

Change for the better and not for the worse
Let's stand together and break our curses
We look off in the distance chasing dreams
But the things that I see with my eye's obscene
Let's plant a new tree, make a change
Need it for you and me, brighter days
Will come and you'll see, make the change
Necessary for ordinary people

There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many and the wants of the few
You can find religion in the freedom you choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
And I can tell by the look on your face
And there's one thing that we've got to say

Changes, changes
(Danny man say, brighten up your day and never feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Hear what we say, hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Do you hear what we say? Do you hear what we say?)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Can you hear what we say? Hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day, ain't gonna feel no pain)
