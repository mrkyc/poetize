Look who's dancin' now
Look who's dancin', oh look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now
Well, first the dance floor was like a forbidden land
Where people would never dare to go
But now everyone's doing it, I said it's a dance galore
Look who's dancin', look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now
Look who's dancin', oh look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now
And some are dancin' on their feet
Some are jumping off the floor and look at old Granny "B"
She got the, she caught the
She knows the groove for sure
Look who's dancin', look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now, right around
Look who's dancin', who is dancin'
Look who's dancin' now, get on the floor
Look who's dancin', look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now, around the world
Look who's dancin', oh look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now
And some are dancin' on their feet
Some are jumping off the floor and look at old Tauter him
He got the, he got the, he got the
He got the beat for sure
Look who's dancin', look who's dancin'
Look who's dancin' now
Look who's dancin', check the dancin'
Look who's dancin' now, get on the floor
Do the ska, the rock steady, the ridim and blues
And if you catch them, then you do the della move
It nuh mek nuh sense to sit down when you know you can groove
Any type of dance you do, you neither win or lose
And if your choice is reggae, you don't need nuh dancin' shoes
Suh listen to the message, and you know you won't lose
Look who come, come dancin' pow we dancin' floor again
Some a dem a enemy, some a dem a friend
Some a dem a mother and father, some a dem a children
Some a dem a loafer who a follow the trend
And some a dem a just dey ya as we good brethen

So pray every day and ask for strength and knowledge
That's why we ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff and rugged
