Now this is Daddy U-Roy
Upside the man called Ziggy Marley
What the musical sound saying...

Fly rasta (Fly Rasta)
Fly rasta  (Fly Rasta)
Dreader than dread (Fly rasta)
(Nutty got to hold up you head)
Redder than red  (Fly rasta)
(We work fo' that red)

Take that vow separation onto the Lord
Drink no strong drink, see no dead
And all the days of your vow of separation
No razor shall come upon your head

Fly rasta (Fly Rasta)
Fly rasta  (Fly Rasta)
Rooter than root (Natty ever speak the truth)
My spirit speak the truth
Truther than truth (Almighty Jah-Jah)

Now there's an evil which we've seen under the sun
It is common among men
For what have the fool more than the wise?
Man can't live alone on bread (No way as I would say)
Delight in the laws of Jah-Jah (Nutty dread)
(On to the Most High Jah)
And on Jah meditate day and night (Liveth and reigneth in the hearts of every man I-tinually)
Like the tree planted by water (Nutty dread)
(I say back off with your ism, skism and your folly)
Who's leaves never wither

Fly Rasta (Fly Rasta)
Fly Rasta  (Fly Rasta)
Dreader than dread (Fly rasta)
(Nutty got to hold up you head)
Redder than red  (Fly rasta)
(Give thanks and praise each and every day)

But I say blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
Nor standeth in the way of sinners, like I would say
Take a vow of separation (And all the days of your life)
Let no razor come up on your head
Flash your Natty dread! Fly Natty Dread!
Fly Rasta (Fly Rasta)
Fly Rasta (Fly Rasta)
Now it red (Nutty ever speak the truth yow)
Oh, it redder than red (Nutty don't tell no lie)
Now fly Rasta (Nutty redder than red)
Oh, fly Rasta (Run weh Babylon, tell it to dem)
Root is of the root (Nutty heavier than led)
