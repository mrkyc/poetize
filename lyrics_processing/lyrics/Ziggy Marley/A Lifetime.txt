Oh, a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And a lifetime isn't enough to live
Oh, a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And one lifetime isn't enough to live

I may be different than you, criticized for what I do
I chose to explore the truth, the truth of me
And I won't be afraid, on that day
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah
Took the risk, the chance, just to understand
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you

'Cause a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And a lifetime isn't enough to live
Oh, a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And one lifetime isn't enough to live

Been around so many people, without you I'm always alone
Gazing into space, my existence unknown
I don't want to be here, I wanna be near
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah
Took the risk, the chance, just to understand
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you
