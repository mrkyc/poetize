I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you
When you smile I'll smile along
When you cry my comfort comes
When you walk I'll be beside you
Holding your hands
When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away
When you tell me that you love me
This is what I'm gonna say
I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you
Like the fish loves the sea
Like the honey and the bee
Like a lizard loves to climb up into a tree
Like a bird love to fly way up in the sky
Like a worm loves to go way down low

I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you
Like the grass loves to be green
And the earth loves to be clean
Like the sun loves to shine
And the monkey loves to climb
Hey, it happens naturally
And that's the way it's got to be
And the worm still loves to go way down low
I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you
From the first time that I saw you
I knew that it was true
There'll be a lifelong time to spend
Around the corner around the bends
Up the hills and through the valleys
No matter how things change
This one thing will remain
I'll sing it again and again
I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
I love you
When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away
And when you tell me that you love me
This is what I'm gonna say
I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
