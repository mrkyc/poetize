Hold him Joe, hold him Joe
Hold him Joe, but don't let him go

The donkey want water, hold him Joe
Spring 'round the corner, hold him Joe
Donkey want water, hold him Joe
Everybody want water, hold him Joe

We on a journey, he don't walk straight
And that is because he is so underweight
Donkey of mine, him don't like no weight
I put him on a cart, him never walk straight

Donkey want water, hold him Joe
Spring 'round the corner, hold him Joe
The donkey want water, hold him Joe
Ooma, lacka, lacka, chimba, hold him Joe

Some people say that my donkey's bad
And that's because he's from Trinidad
Donkey of mine, he won't work at all
All him wanna do is break out him stall
