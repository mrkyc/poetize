A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, the smell of dissent is high
I'm standing for the truth, too long it's been denied
The tide of change is rising, let hope be realized
Unchain these wings, let angels fly

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crime against nations, a war is waged
There's a message in the wind, for every race
Peace and love we sow, so let us grow
It's good for the body, it's good for the soul

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

Sold us the kiss of death, denied us the tree of life
This damn hypocrisy, cost so many lives
Corporation greed, can't own this seed
Small farmers will survive by planting weed

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crucified savior, to save your face
Demonizing nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use, what the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree, the herbs of the field

A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
Freedom, freedom, let angels fly
