We are the people, we're not corporations
We are the people, we're not labels for your stock
We are the people, we're not crayons in a box
We are the people, we're not donkeys and elephants

Taking over from machines who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open your heart, now, don't be deceived
Oh, when you see yourself for who you are, you'll be truly free

We are the people, listen to our song
We are the people, together we are strong
We are the people, stronger than one race
We are the people, stronger the one fate

To divide us, to define us, categorize us and neutralize us
Like robots living in a dream doing what they think they must
Scenes in black and white, painted with the brush

So, you think they care, it's a paper town
With paper politicians, oh yes
Hey, you think you're safe in your hiding place
Way up on the cloud

Our voices must be heard
With dignity and might
Oh what a beautiful sight

We are the people, we're not corporations
We are the people, we're not labels for your stock
We are the people, we're not crayons in a box
We are the people, we're not donkeys and elephants

Taking over from machines who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open your heart, now, don't be deceived
Oh, when you see yourself for who you are, you'll be truly free

We are the people, stronger than one race
We are the people, stronger the one fate
