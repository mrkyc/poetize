I found a place where the weekend's long
Don't check no luggage just carry on

Why should you laugh instead of cry
Why should you live instead of die
I'll be your reason
It's okay go on and give me a try
Walk with your head way up above the sky
I'll be your reason yeah
Don't be afraid for what is to come
It's been too long since that bell was rung
Ooh yeah I'll be the reason
Why you should even have a little faith
Why you should grow and cultivate
I'll be your reason yeah

I found a place where the weekend's long (found a place)
Don't check no luggage just carry on (all night long)
Leave the sorrows indoctrinated
Cause now you've been emancipated

Say come on it couldn't be a sin
Maybe your God could see the heart of things
And I'll be your reason
Sometimes you need some time to play
You think you lost but you just found your way
Ooh yeah I'll be your reason
Come on now
