Well, church gather 'round 'cause we got us a problem
There's a lot of inspiration floating around these days
Words that paint a pretty picture, but you won't find them in the scripture
That's because they're all from the book of second opinions, mm-hmm

Well, they'll say follow your heart where it leads you
Just let that little voice inside you show the way
I guess the million-dollar question: Is that your heart or indigestion?
'Cause the heart's been known to lead a fool astray

It ain't hard to get hooked on the book of second opinions
We'd rather live our own truth, don't tell us what to do, just what we wanna hear
But it's high time we turned our interest to God's word instead of Pinterest
And finally close the book of second opinions

We'll say everything happens for a reason
And just to give our foolish ways a clever spin
And I've heard 'em say the Lord won't give you anything you can't handle
But the truth is we can't handle anything without Him

It ain't hard to get hooked on the book of second opinions
We'd rather live our own truth, don't tell us what to do, just what we wanna hear
But it's high time we turned our interest to God's word instead of Pinterest
And finally close the book of second opinions

But You say I don't have to change 'cause it just the way I am
I got all the proof I need right here in my Enneagram
I can tell myself it's always been about me, so give me self-love and positivity
But all the good vibes in the world will never make a dead heart beat

Well, the world might tell you all roads lead to Heaven
Well, to that, there's just one thing I'd like to say
There's one throne and I'm not on it, a solid rock and I stand upon it
And Jesus is the truth, the life, the way

It ain't hard to get hooked on the book of second opinions
We'd rather live our own truth, don't tell us what to do, just what we wanna hear
But it's high time we turned our interest to God's word instead of Pinterest
And finally close the book of second opinions
It's high time we turned our interest to God's word instead of Pinterest
