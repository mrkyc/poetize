I came to You, with my heart in pieces
And found the God, with healing in His hands
I turned to You, put everything behind me
And found the God, who makes all things new
I look to You, drowning in my questions
And found the God, who holds all wisdom
And I trusted You, and stepped out on the ocean
You caught my hand among the waves

'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows
And found the God, who relentlessly pursues
I hid from You, haunted by my failures
And found the God, whose grace still covers me
I fell on You, when I was at my weakest
And found the God, the lifter of my head
And I've worshipped You, and felt You right beside me
You're the reason that I sing

'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

In my worry, God You are my stillness
In my searching, God You are my answers
In my blindness, God You are my vision
In my bondage, God You are my freedom
In my weakness, God You are my power
You're the reason that I sing

'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

In my blindness, God You are my vision
In my bondage, God You are my freedom
