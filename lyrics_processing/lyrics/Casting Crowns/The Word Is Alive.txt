Looking out from his throne
The father of light and of men
Chose to make himself known
And show us the way back to him
Speaking wisdom and truth
Into the hearts of peasants and kings
He began to unveil
The word that would change the course of all things
With eyes wide open, all would see

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through the darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But His truth, it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive

Simple strokes on a page
Eternity's secrets revealed
Carried on from age to age
It speaks truth to us even still
And as the rain falls from heaven
Feeds the earth before it returns
Lord, let your word fall on us
And bring forth the fruit you deserve
With eyes wide open, Let us see

The Bible was inscribed over a period of 2000 years
In times of war and in days of peace
By kings, physicians, tax collectors, farmers
Fishermen, singers and shepherds
The marvel is that a library so perfectly cohesive
Could have been produced by such a diverse crowd
Over a period of time which staggers the imagination
Jesus is its grand subject, our good is designed
And the glory of God is its end

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through the darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But His truth, it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive
(The world and its glories will fade)
The word is alive
(His truth, it will not pass away)
His word is alive
(His word is alive, His word is alive)
Jesus is its grand subject, our good is designed
