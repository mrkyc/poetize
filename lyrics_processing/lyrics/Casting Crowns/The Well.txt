Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind

I have what you need
But you keep on searching
I've done all the work
But you keep on working
When you're running on empty
And you can't find the remedy
Just come to the well
You can spend your whole life
Chasing what's missing
But that empty inside
It just isn't going to listen
When nothing can satisfy
And the world leaves you high and dry
Just come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more
And all who search will find what their souls long for
The world will try, but it can never fill
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

So bring me your heart
No matter how broken
Just come as you are
When your last prayer is spoken
Just rest in my arms a while
You'll feel the change my child
When you come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more
And all who search will find what their souls long for
The world will try, but it can never fill
So leave it all behind, and come to the well
Yeah
Leave it all behind
The world will try, but it can never fill...leave it all behind

And now that you're full
Of love beyond measure
Your joy's gonna flow
Like a stream in the desert
Soon all the world will see that living water is found in me
Because you came to the well
And all who thirst will thirst no more
And all who search will find what their souls long for
The world will try, but it can never fill
So leave it all behind, and come to the well
