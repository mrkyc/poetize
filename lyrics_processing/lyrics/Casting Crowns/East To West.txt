Here I am, Lord, and I'm drowning
In Your sea of forgetfulness
The chains of yesterday surround me
I yearn for peace and rest
I don't want to end up where You found me
And it echoes in my mind
Keeps me awake tonight
I know You've cast my sin as far as
The east is from the west
And I stand before You now as, as though I've never sinned

But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From You leaving me this way

Jesus, can You show me
Just how far the east is from the west?
'Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Come rising up in me again
In the arms of Your mercy I find rest
'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I start the day, the war begins
Endless reminding of my sin
And time and time again
Your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in

Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From You leaving me this way

Jesus, can You show me
Just how far the east is from the west?
'Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Come rising up in me again
In the arms of Your mercy I find rest
'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I know You've washed me white
Turned my darkness into light
I need Your peace to get me through
To get me through this night
I can't live by what I feel
But by the truth Your Word reveals
I'm not holding on to You
But You're holding on to me
You're holding on to me

Jesus, You know just how far the east is from the west
I don't have to see the man I've been
Come rising up in me again
In the arms of Your mercy I find rest
'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other
(Just how far, the east is from the west, just how far)
One scarred hand to the other
(You know just how far, the east is from the west, just how far)
