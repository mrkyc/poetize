Jesus friend of sinners
We have strayed so far away
We cut down people in Your name
But the sword was never ours to swing
Jesus friend of sinners
The truth's become so hard to see
The world is on their way to You
But they're tripping over me
Always looking around but never looking up
I'm so double minded
A plank eyed saint with dirty hands
And a heart divided

Oh, Jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to the world
At the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts
And open doors
Oh Jesus friend of sinners
Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Jesus friend of sinners
The one who's writing in the sand
Make the righteous turn away
And the stones fall from their hands
Help us to remember
We are all the least of these
Let the memory of Your mercy
Bring your people to their knees
Nobody knows what we're for
Only what we're against
When we judge the wounded
What if we put down our signs
Crossed over the lines
And love like You did

Oh, Jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to the world
At the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts
And open doors
Oh Jesus friend of sinners
Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
You love every lost cause
You reach for the outcast
For the leper and the lame
They're the reason that You came
Lord, I was that lost cause
And I was the outcast
But you died for sinners just like me
A grateful leper at Your feet

Because You are good
You are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good
You are good
And Your love endures forever

Oh, Jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to the world
At the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts
And open doors
Oh Jesus friend of sinners
Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
And I was the lost cause
And I was the outcast
Yeah
You died for sinners just like me
