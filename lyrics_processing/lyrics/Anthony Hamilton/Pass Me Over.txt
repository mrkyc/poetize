Another day chance to make another chance
A fragile place running on empty
A smile so faint can barely even break his face
World is on shoulders now
Don't be afraid, he who knows will make a way
His word alone is what has kept me
Born the son, king of eternal peace
Lay your burdens down

If you catch me dreaming
Please don't wake me til I'm done
Just leave me sleeping
Until the morning comes
Just pass me over
Make believe that I'm not there
Just leave me be
Until the Savior comes

Another night makes a way to the morn
Sleeping peace joy come early
A covered child steps away victorious
Salvation holds joy surrounds her
