Tried for so long (Yeah)
To, to hold on (To hold on)
But you won't belong
To anyone, anything, any love at all

I thought we had it all until things started to recede, yeah, yeah, yeah (Well)
Giving me no love at all, not caring enough about my needs (Ooh)
Gave you my heart and all my soul, but not once did I let go, no
And I tried to stick by you
I tried to call to let you know
That I'm here for you and I'll give my all

(Tried) Tried for so long (Yes, I did)
To, to hold on (Tried to let you know, babe, I feel you)
But you won't belong
To anyone, anything, any love at all

You had the best love of your life
But you didn't treat it right
No, you didn't; no, you didn't, girl
Too busy running out all night long
Didn't even have the decency to pick up the telephone
And just call me, and let me know where you were
And that you're alright, so I could sleep at night
Girl, you showed out so
Had the nerve to break up our happy home, girl
All I wanted to do for
(Was let you know all that I wanted)

But you won't belong
To anyone, anything, any love at all

Well, well, well, I stood by your side (Stood by your side)
Sheltered for you (Sheltered for you)
When things went down, I helped pull you through
Faithful and all, trusting and warm
But you took my heart by storm
