My old lady's on the other side of town with her ex-boyfriend
Drinking again, drinking again
So you choose to lose someone who loves you and a real good friend
For a bottle of gin, a bottle of sin

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
Now I'm sitting at the top of the hill
Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone
And I don't know what to feel
Since you've been gone, gone away

I overheard somebody say they saw you crying in a bar last night
With a blackened eye, blackened eye
I know mistakes I made but the time has cmae
For another that will treat you right, treat you right

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
Now I'm sitting at the top of the hill
Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone
And I don't know what to feel
Since you've been gone, gone away
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
Now I'm sitting at the top of the hill
Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone
And I don't know what to feel
Since you've been gone, gone away

Gone away
Used to love me, now you wanna leave me
Right when I told you "I love you"
Don't think you ever believed me when I said
You used to love me now you wanna run away
Right when I told you "I love you"
Don't think you ever believed me when I said
Oh, I love you
Oh, I love you
I love you
You were my baby
You were my love, sugar darling
I know he didn't love you the way I did
Baby, oh yeah, oh, I love you
Don't you know I cared
Don't you know I love you
And I always wanna be there
Oh, and you know I love you, hey
You know I love you, baby
And you know he really didn't care about you
I never would have hit you, baby, no, no
Said I never would have hit you, baby, oh no
Oh no, ooh, ooh, ooh
You know I loved you
And I, I really did care about you, baby
Oh, you know I love you
You know I loved you, baby
How could he hit you, baby, and you still stick around
