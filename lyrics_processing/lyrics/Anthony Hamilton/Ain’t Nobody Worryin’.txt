Ain't nobody worryin'
When the shots fly high and the siren starts to ring
Ain't nobody worryin'
When the kids die young and the mothers are sufferin'
Ain't nobody prayin'
When they kneel down low, all they're doin' is tyin' their shoe strings
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more

The homeless have nowhere to turn
When their stomach starts to burn 'cause they ain't got food to eat
How the children gonna learn
When they gotta take turns 'cause they ain't got books to read
Then our babies turn to crime
Started gettin' high 'cause the job trade's kinda slow
'Cause ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more

When the tears start to fall and you can't see your way
The just will carry on, come on, judgement day
You don't have to moan, help is on the way
'Cause ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more

These are our precious times
Disease is taking lives, Medicaid ran out
Show me a weapon line
There's a mother on her own tryin' to beat the drought
Tell me when will this end
All the sufferin', my faith is runnin' low
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more

When the tears start to fall and you can't see your way
And the just will carry on, come on, judgment day
Don't have to moan no more, help is on the way
Ain't nobody worryin', ah, oh Lord

Ain't nobody worryin'
When the shots fly high and the siren starts to ring
Ain't nobody worryin'
When the kids die young and the mothers are sufferin'
Ain't nobody worryin'
The Black man's doin' time and nobody cares for him
(Nobody carin', nobody carin', yeah)
The government's on the grind and tryin' to fence him in
(Our babies are gettin' high)
While drugs in the school, we need to pray again
(They need prayer, they need prayer, oh oh oh)
When will it end, will it end, will it end, will it end
'Cause ain't nobody worryin'
When the shots fly high and the siren starts to ring
Ain't nobody worryin'
When the kids die young and the mothers are sufferin'
Ain't nobody prayin'
When they kneel down low, all they're doin' is tyin' their shoe strings
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
