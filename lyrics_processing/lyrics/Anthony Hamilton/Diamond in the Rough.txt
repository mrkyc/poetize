Better, baby

Looking at you, I can tell
You've had hard times in your life
Now it's time for me, to make everything right
I wanna shower you, with lovely thangs, help you smile again
I wanna get to know you, make it right, so you can breathe again

You're my diamond in the rough, girl
And I'm here to make it better
You're my diamond in the rough, girl
And we gon' shine in love together

I see the scars from the broken heart
Life's got you down (Life's got you down)
And the bags under your eyes hide the smiles inside
It's tearing you apart (Well)
Girl, you're looking at change, I'm a man who prays
And I'm strong in faith (Strong in faith)
God must've had a plan, placed you in my hand
Let me lead the way
