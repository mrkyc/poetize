Wish I could see through
See deep into you
And know what you're thinkin' now
And if I'm what you're needin'
I need some kind of sign
Let me know 'cause I can't read your mind
Are you in?
Or am I in this on my own?
I need some clue from you
Let me know, babe

Do you feel me? Do you read me?
Tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
I wanna know, are you with me?
Are you listenin'?
Baby, is my message gettin' through?
Do you feel me, baby?
Oh, babe, 'cause I can feel you

You play it so cool
Won't let nothin' show through
Won't show what you're feelin' now, no
And you like to keep keepin' me
Keepin' me here in the dark
And I can't see through into your heart
Let me in, in on this mystery
'Cause I just can't stay in this guessin' game

And don't keep me hangin' on the line, baby
Tell me if you want me
And if you don't, just let me go
Just answer one question
Don't keep me here guessin'
Tell me now

Do you feel me? Do you read me?
Tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
I wanna know, are you with me?
Are you listenin'?
