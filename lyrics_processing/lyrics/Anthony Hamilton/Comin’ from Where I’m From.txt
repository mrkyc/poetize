Sitting here guess I didn't make bail
Got time and a story to tell
Started when I was nine years old
Woke up, my daddy was gone
I started hustling and they couldn't tell me nothing
Fronting in the hood trying to be somebody
My soul was on empty
I was searching for something

Tried to be good
Tried to keep from trouble
Living too fast; Trying to make good on a hustle

Sometimes it gets rough
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Times have got hard, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta walk to work, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from

Wasn't really looking, guess I found it
Five foot three, light brown skin
Coming from the university
Nice style, looking kinda lovely
Didn't know she had much game
Down to ride out, even take the train
Even took her to a poker game
She's top notch from fried chicken to sushi

Tried to be good (I tried)
Tried to treat you like a lady (You like a lady)
Tried to be a friend
Turned out that you were shady

Sometimes it gets lonely
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Things ain't what they seem to be
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get a little angry, yeah, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get the best of me
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from

Well, tried to be good (I tried, tried)
Wanted nothing but to love somebody (Woah)
Didn't wanna die young
Steady hustling trying to feed my family
Too scared to have kids and do like Daddy did
'Cause I'm so scared of failing
Sometimes it gets hard
Coming from where I'm from
Mm-mm-hm-hm
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta moan
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta cry a little bit louder
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain, yeah, oh, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta walk alone, yeah, ahh
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get a little worried, yeah, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get lost, out of touch, oh!
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I think I pray a little bit too much
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I get a little scared
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I get a little scared, yeah
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I wonder if I ain't got a friend
Coming from where I'm from, I'm from
