Listen
Too much pride to back off of it, mmm
I wear it well when no one can see
I'm talking about pain
Gonna take trials to be delivered
Y'all know that happiness ain't for free
I'm heading down the wrong way
Please somebody won't you
Oh please, won't somebody please stop me, yeah

My soul is on fire
And I can't take this fight no way
Got me running, got me running, got me running, got me running, got me running
My soul is on fire
And I can't face another day

Listen
I'm still hurting, 'bout to give up
Done lost sleep, and lost weight, I'm doing bad
Getting hard to keep my chin up
I need somebody to kneel and pray for me, yeah

I'm heading down the wrong way
It's getting hard for me to breathe, yeah
Oh please, won't somebody please stop me
