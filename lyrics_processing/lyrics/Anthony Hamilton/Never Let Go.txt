How can I prepare you for how I wanna love you?
And I know you've been hurt in pain and love
Is all the same in your eyes
So, baby, take a chance to really let me show you
And if you open up I teach you how to love for life
'Cause the lonely never win, yeah

But if I love ya (I'll never let you go)
Boy, can I trust ya? (Just tell me what you want)
To be there when I need ya (Girl, put your heart in mine)
I promise that I'll never let it go
I don't wanna cry no more (No, not a single tear)
'Cause I've been broken (But now that I am here)
Teach me how to love again (Girl, put your heart in mine)
I promise that I'll never let it go

I done seen a lot of things
I heard a lot of men claim
They gon' love me forever
Tell me now, what makes you different?
I gave all I had, all the way down to my last
So, boy, I need you right now to show me
How to trust my heart over my mind, yeah
'Cause the lonely never win
