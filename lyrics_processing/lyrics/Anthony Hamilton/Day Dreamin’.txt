Well, ooh, hey baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
Hey
Baby, baby (Hey baby)

I can just feel, feel it all in my bones
Thinking of your loveliness and when you'll be coming home
Baby girl, I'm willing to do what I gotta do
To be there holding and loving you

I'm day dreaming when I sleep
I'm caught up in a memory
I know love, it plays for keeps
Too good to be true, yeah
Day dreaming when I sleep
I'm caught up in a memory
Of loving

Each and every time the thought of you passed my mind
I don't know what else to do, baby (No, baby)
I think I'm falling, falling, falling (Falling)
Deeper in love, baby
But you just keep coming in my mind
