Said it's alright
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, ooh

We have seen some things in our lives
We've had some long and solemn roads
That's how I know it's alright to cry
Go on and ease the heavy load
Pray hard, walk tall, do right
Find love, hold on for life

Lord, I know that you are there
I feel a burnin' in my bones
Free us from the lion's den
And take us home

Everybody needs love in their life (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everybody needs a little sun to shine
(Everybody needs a little sun in their life)
Go on, let love come inside your life (Woah-woah, woah-woah)
Shine down (Shine down) on me, on me (Mhm)
