Woke up this morning, found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times or more
Silent cries I used to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again (Waiting on you, babe)
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end (And I'll be here)
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life (Yeah)
Come on home to me Charlene

She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child, it's been my dream
I can support her, treat her and spoil her
You know, buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard days she had with the baby?
All she need is for me to love her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again (I'll be waiting)
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end (Said I promise I'll be here)
By your side (Oh no, no)
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life (Hey)
Come on home to me Charlene

Promise I can't live without her (Can't live without her)
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away, oh (And it hurts, hurt me so bad)
I pray, she'll come back one day (She'll come home one day)
In my life, oh (In my life)
Baby I'll be (Baby I'll be)
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again (Sitting here waiting, baby)
I won't leave (I won't leave, no)
Promise I'll be here to the very end (I'll be with you for life)
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life (Say I won't go nowhere, oh)
Come on home to me Charlene (Come on home to me, baby, oh)

Sometimes I cry
Charlene, if you're listening, would you call on me?
'Cause my heart is aching without you
