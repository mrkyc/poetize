I knew just what it had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me
To every dude in sight
Look like you working up an appetite for the night, check it
By then I just sat at the back
Peeping you out, the way you act
Every string attached
Getting out of line and I'm yanking you back in your place
All is well and all is cool
Stay in your place, don't be no fool
We'll get along alright
You look like the type that would try to bite, mmm
Best off being a friend to me
You don't want to offend me
Better play it cool
Don't know what I might do

Cornbread, fish, and collard greens
I got what you need
If you want it ('Cause I'm pimp, girl)
If you want it (I'm a pimp, girl)
Cornbread, fish, and collard greens (Oh)
I got what you need (What you need)
If you want it (I can rock your world)
If you want it (I put the juice in Jheri curl)

Oh, baby girl, I'm on to you (I'm watching you, girl)
Take it slow, change your speed
If it's food for thought that you really need
Better state your claim, get with it
Stay in your lane, stop swerving
Take a seat, sit in the back
I don't appreciate the way you act
You need to fix yourself, hurry up and go fix yourself
Can't kill nothing, won't nothing die
Everything's gonna pass you by
If you don't wisen up (Wisen up)
Stop pressing on luck (Pressing your luck)
