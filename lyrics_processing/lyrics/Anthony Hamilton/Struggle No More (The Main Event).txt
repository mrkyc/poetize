Lately, it's been hard times
I'm talking about the financial ones aside
And they say when it rains it pours
Well, it's running at my door
If it ain't one thang, one thang, it's another
And I'm so glad that we've got each other
I'm so sick and tired of being stressed out
Lord, please help me from this mess I'm in

Lord, lift me over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more
So lift me up over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more

I wanna see the finer things
Like the drop and the watch is reminding me
