It's about finding a new experience
With someone you never thought you'd meet, mmm-mmm-mmm
Who totally turns your life around completely
Helping you get a job, and keeping you off the streets
Church on Sunday morning, eventually I'm saving money
Sending my life in a new direction
Now I'm friends with my old man again
Standing here wearing this wedding band
I can say I know love because of you, say I know love

I know what love's all about
(I know what's love's about, and you showed me, girl)
I know what love's all about (Oh oh oh oh)

I used to think that love was just a weekend thing
The way you make me feel (Sharing a moment of emptiness)
'Cause you see, that wasn't nothing
'Cause the moment she left I forgot about her
Until you came in and you showed me what it really felt to be loved
And kissed, and held, and grateful
And wanted, and nurtured, and guided, and oh, to be understood

I know what love's all about
(You showed me love, now I know, I know, I know)
I know what love's all about
(I know, I know, you showed me, baby, see, I don't have to worry about a thing now
'Cause I know real love)

Mmm, I know I, I can sit here and I can talk about it
'Cause I've experienced it, and I'm feeling it
I'm living it right here right now
I got somebody who loves me for me
I got somebody who loves me for me
I know my love
I know I, sometime I have to realize that it's about compromise
And you can't always have your way, you can't always
Can't always have it your way
'Cause love is about realizing
And love is about redirecting your decisions
Whether to go out all night long or go home to the ones you love
It's about taking care of your family
And taking care of your kids
And holding your wife at night and letting her know that the bills will be paid on time
And that you sit back and you look and you listen to her 'cause it's about love
