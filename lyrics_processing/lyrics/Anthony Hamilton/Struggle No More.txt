Lately It's been hard times
I'm talking about them
Financial ones aside
And they say when it rains it pours
Well it's running at my door
If it ain't one thang (one thang) it's another
And I'm so glad that we got each other
I'm so sick and tired of being stressed out
Lord, please help me from this mess I'm in
Lord, lift me over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more
So lift me up over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more
Every day, every night, I pray
Lord, help me find the way (help me find my way)
To stay strong
And to keep my sanity
So I can provide for myself
And for my family
I'm so glad they believe in me, 'cause the love, it gives me energy
(said the love gives me energy)
And without them, I couldn't make it, no way
So I'ma keep pressing on, on and on
Lord, lift me over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more
So lift me up over the hurt and pain
Deliver me from the rain
See, I don't wanna stress over stress no more
I don't wanna struggle no more
