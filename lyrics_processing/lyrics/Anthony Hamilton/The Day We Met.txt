I can't imagine my life without you, baby
You taught me how to breathe
Going in and out of relationships, I was crazy
Send someone for me

I thought I knew what love could do
You showed me things, real love
Without a doubt now I know all about
You showed me things, real love

Right when I met you, the day that I met you
You turned my world around, we fell in love
Right there from the start, you came and stole my heart
You turned my world around, we fell in love

Now you and me, we got a jump on the future
Girl, we gotta plant a seed
Have us a couple of babies, as many as we can afford
Come on, do it for me, yeah, yeah

I thought I knew what love could do
You showed me things, real love
Now I know all about, real love, there's no doubt
You showed me things, real love
