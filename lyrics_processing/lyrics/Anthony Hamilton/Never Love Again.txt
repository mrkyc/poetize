How could I ever hide what I felt
How could you ever say you never knew
All along it was there on my mind
In my heart, it was the feeling
I was in love
You act as if you never knew my name
How could you pleasure putting me through so much pain
Like a child in the womb I needed you
To give me love
I miss that feeling of being loved

How could I ever love again
How could I start to love again
After you broke me down, it's hard
To trust that feeling, to fall in love again

A man don't usually fall no more then twice
And if he does you'll never know cause he won't say
For the fear of being fooled, taken twice
By the heart, it's in his nature, to be afraid
He starts to wonder if it's really right
To let his past take control of his life
Maybe I'll run into hope
Someone that's right for me, and shall love freely
And fall in love again

You know what they say about a man
It's hard for him to fall in love
(Love)
Once hurt he'll never give in
It's hard for him to trust
(Love)
Bowing down it was hard to cope
When ya love broke down on me
It was hard for me to trust again

How could I ever love again
How could I start to love again
After you broke me down, it's hard
To trust that feeling, to fall in love
How could I ever love again
How could I start to love again
After you broke me down, it's hard
To trust that feeling, to fall in love again

Oooh
Yeah
How can I ever love again
How, can I ever start to love
