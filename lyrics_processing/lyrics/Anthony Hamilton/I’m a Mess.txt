Can't believe
Oh, oh, oh, oh no, no, oh

I'm so torn up now, can't believe I lost you
Lost my best friend, my soul mate, can't believe it's true
We've invested in a set of twins, a small house, and the dog cried out
Knew I was suffering, he was chained to my pain

Me and you were meant to last forever
And empty walls can't hold this house together
We were born to live and die together
And now you're gone and I'm so alone
Baby, come on home

You could have called, you could have wrote, you could tried
(You could have called me, baby)
I rather you slit me cross the throat, so I can die
Instead of leaving, no explanation, as to why
You don't want me no more
You could have called, you could have wrote, you could tried
(You could have called on me, baby)
I rather you slit me cross the throat, so I can die
Instead of leaving, no explanation, as to why
You don't want me no more

I'm a mess right now, I can't eat, can't sleep
Bills are piling high, ain't worked in three weeks
Ain't bathed, can't shave 'cause my heart is so tender
Like living in a blender, I'm shaken and I'm stirred

You and me were meant to last forever
And empty walls can't hold this house together
We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we were meant to lie and die together
Now you're gone, I'm so alone
Baby come on home

You could have called, you could have wrote, you could have tried
(We could have tried)
I rather you slit me cross the throat, so I can die
(I would rather die right now)
Instead of leaving, no explanation, as to why
You don't want me no more
You could have called, you could have wrote, you could have tried
I rather you slit me cross the throat, so I can die
(I wish you never left me)
Instead of leaving, no explanation, as to why
(And I don't know why)
You don't want me no more
(You don't want me no more, no more)
