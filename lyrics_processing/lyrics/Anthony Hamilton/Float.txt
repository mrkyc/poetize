Hey baby, oh, oh

Could it be your nice silky tone
Oh, that makes me want you, girl
Distant nights and love on the phone as I touch myself
How I want you more
The mood evokes, incense smoke and I'm burning up in temperature
Ready to explode, yeah
Come take a toke, let's float, baby, on high, higher ground, oh, oh, oh

Baby, come, float with me
(See, baby, come and float with me)
Let me take you to a place on higher, honey
Baby, come, float with me
(Float with me)
Face to face, build a body of fire, honey

Could it be your sweet, sweet moan, mmm
While I'm inside your world, your world
A sudden glance that you give from across the room
Come and take control, yeah
Open up my favorite bottle, let the wind blow
Create an atmosphere, stay right here
Listen to the rain, your handprints on the window pane
And it's burning me up with the desire, oh
