Hey (Hey, hey, hey, alright)

We don't have to worry 'bout no money
To have us a real good time
And we don't have to leave in the morning
The whole day, just you and I (That's right)
And it don't have to get any better
It's perfect you're in my life
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool
We don't have to worry 'bout no groceries
We can fill up on love alone
If we ain't got enough for a movie
We can just sit at home (And chill)
Have a little role play, baby
Whatever turns you on
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool

Quit your worrying, baby, oh, oh, oh
Quit your worrying, girl
(You don't have to worry no more, baby)
Quit your crying, lady
(Go 'head and dry your eyes)
We can conquer the world

Mmm, pack a little love for the evening
Let me hold you tight (Oh, oh)
Don't be worried about my problems, believe me
Everything's gon' be alright (Gon' be alright)
We can shoot for the moon, watch some cartoons
Whatever makes you smile
If you're cool (You're cool), then I'm cool (Yeah), then we're cool
If you're cool (Oh), then I'm cool (Oh, oh), then we're cool
