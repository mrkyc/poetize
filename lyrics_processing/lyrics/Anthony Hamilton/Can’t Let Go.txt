No matter what the people say
I can't, I can't let go
I can't let go, oh, no, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Why must they try to tear down our house
When they know it's made from love
And they could never stand in our way
We made a vow to love through it all
We are one
And no one has the right to tear my love down

No matter what the people say, I'm gonna love you anyway
You are my life, I can't let go
Even if we fuss or fight, try 'til we get it right (Get it right)
You are my life, I can't let go
Even if we disagree, you can put it all on me
You are my life, I can't let go (No)
I can't, I can't (I can't let you go, no)

How dare they say
That a love like ours won't last?
God made no mistakes
When He sheltered me with your heart
There's no safer place than to be in love
And here I will stand
And there ain't never
Ain't gonna never ever leave you alone
