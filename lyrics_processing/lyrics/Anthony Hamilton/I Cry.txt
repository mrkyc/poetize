I'm so tired of all the love wounds
That you left, girl, when you went away
Sitting here fighting a battle
That was over when I had to relocate
You see I, ain't much for letting go
No baby, I gotta hold on
'Cause trials, tribulations, and relationships
Have all made me strong

(Oh girl, I cry)
These tears that I shed are the trail to bring you home
(Oh girl, I cry)
Mama told me that a man's own tears can make him strong
(Oh girl, I cry)
I'll sit around here and wait for you to come home
(I'll cry for you) I'll cry
(I'll cry for you) I'll cry

And I'll be damned if I lose you
Until time brings you home again
