Now we've been through too much together
And that separates us from the rest
Now we're approaching up on stormy weather
Let's see what our love is made of
I hate you were crying last night
Said I should've been by your side, yeah
So girl, please, don't you leave me
And girl, don't you say goodbye

Now, we've been through too much together
And we're approaching stormy weather
But girl, you're my first love, oh, oh
And no matter what the people say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Girl, you're my first love
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Boy, I swear I think you're sacred
And I'm so thankful that you live, yeah
If I could take back all of the sorrow
Then I'd, I'd replace it with kids, yeah
You're the air that I breathe, oh
The perfect one for me
And baby I, I refuse to let you go
And I refuse to let you leave
