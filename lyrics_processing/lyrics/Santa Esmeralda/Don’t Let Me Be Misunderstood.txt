Baby! Do you understand me now?
Sometimes, I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem to be bad

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord! Please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I've got my share
That's one thing I never meant to do
'Cause I love you

Baby! Don't you know I'm just human
And I've got thoughts like any other man?
And sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord! Please don't let me be misunderstood

Come on, baby!
You're so sweet
My sweet Esmeralda, babe!
Help me! Help me! I love you!
Oh, don't play with me, baby!
Come on! Come to me!
Esmeralda
Oh, baby! Oh, please!
Oh, I need you, baby!
My sweet Esmeralda

Baby, sometimes, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord! Please don't let me be misunderstood
