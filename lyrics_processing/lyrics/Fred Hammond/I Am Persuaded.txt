With my grandmother
Early on one Sunday morning
She said she didn't feel too well
I suggested she stay home
She said, "No, to church I'm going"
She said, "Son, this body's tired
And the end is near, it's true
God has been too good to me
And I'm going through"
She said...
I am persuaded from day to day
To the end I'm going
Going to the end, come what may, hey
I am determined to keep the faith
I won't be leaving, do you understand?
I said, yeah
She said, "I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm persuaded", hey
Ever since that day
I've come to love this Christian way
Love it like no other
(Yeah, whoa...)
I've come to realize
I must press on for myself
If I intend to go much further
You might also likeI must stand throughout adversity
And make sure I don't look around
Hey, hey, that's why I depend on You
And You are there for me
And in You my trust is found
Help me say
I am persuaded from day to day
To the end I'm going
Going to the end, come what may, hey
I am determined to keep the faith
I won't be leaving
Choir, won't you help me say
I am persuaded from day to day
(I am persuaded)
Your life is my life
I'll follow every step of the way
I am determined to keep the faith
(I am determined)
I won't be leaving
Why don't you just let me play, hey
Through hard trials
And through troubled times
I have learned to trust in You
That's why my heart is fixed
And I've made up my mind
And I'm going through, through
I am persuaded from day to day
(I am persuaded)
To the end I'm going
Going to the end, come what may, hey
I am determined to keep the faith
(I am determined)
I won't be leaving
If you agree and say with me, hey
I, ay-I
I, ay-I
(I am persuaded)
I, ay-I
I, ay-I
Yeah!
(Persuaded)
Neither death or life
Or any other thing
Is gonna separate me, yeah
(Persuaded)
Hey, yeah, I'm encouraged
(Encouraged)
To hang on in there
Through the good and bad times
(Encouraged)
Good God Almighty, hey, hey...
(Determined)
I'm determined to walk with Jesus
Just another day
(Determined)
I am persuaded

I'm persuaded
I'm encouraged
And I'm determined

To walk with Jesus
Talk with Him just another day
(Determined)
