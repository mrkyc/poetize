1 Chronicles chapter 16 verses 8-12
"Give thanks unto the Lord
Call upon his name
Make known his deeds among the people
Sing unto him
Sing songs unto him
Talk ye of all his wondrous works
Glory ye in his holy name
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord
Seek the Lord in his strength
Seek his face continually
Remember his marvelous works that he hath done
His wonders and the judgments of his mouth
Thus the word of the Lord"
