I've lost some joy/ I've lost sometime/Now it feels like i will lose my mind
Journeyed long and lost my way/And now it feels like I've lost is all i say
Channel 1
Searching here and over there for what i've lost/ Where is it, I don't know
I will find a way
Chorus 1
I will find a way to lift up my hands(lift up my hands)/ And i will find a way
To worship You Lord(Find a way, I will find a way)/ And though my heart is low
I'll find a way to give You praise/ I'll find a way to love You more
Verse 2
I've lost so much/ down through the years/It seems that all i find here lately/
Is a face so full of tears/ I search each dark/ and empty space/
The peace i used to know/ Somehow i have misplaced
Channel 2
Searching here and over there for what i've lost/ I don't have them anymore
Chorus 1
I will find a way to lift up my hands(lift up my hands)/ And i will find a way
To worship You Lord(Find a way, I will find a way)/ And though my heart is low
I'll find a way to give You praise/ I'll find a way to love You more

One thing I've not lost is will to move ahead/ and I've kept a faith that
Trust in You Lord/ And i find way down within myself a love for You Lord
That overflows/ But i know i can love You more/ With every loss and though it all
Chorus 2
I will find a way to lift up my hands(lift up my hands)/ And i will find a way
To worship You Lord(Find a way, I will find a way)
And though my life is broken i'll find a way to give You praise
I'll find a way to love You more

I'll find a way/ I know i will, i know i will, ooh, ooh/
And though my life is broken i'll find a way to give You praise/
