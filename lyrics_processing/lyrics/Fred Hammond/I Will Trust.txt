That I could do it on my own
But all that I found at the end of that road is
That concept for me was all wrong
But I found a Savior who turned me around
And He placed His love on me
And I will trust in Him 'til my last heartbeat
Some put their trust in earthly possessions
But in the end it won't bring them through
I will not lean to my own understanding
But with my whole heart here's what I'll do
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (Lord I will)
Lord I'll trust in You
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (for I know)
He will see me through
Don't put your trust in things that will perish
And ultimately fade away
And even with family and friends all around
You can find yourself alone and dismayed
Cause with their best intentions
They're only human
Believe me when I say
Trust in the Lord
He is faithful and true
Some put their trust in earthly possessions
But in the end it won't bring them through
I will not lean to my own understanding
But with my whole heart here's what I'll do
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (Lord I will)
Lord I'll trust in You
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (for I know)
He will see me through
The name of The Lord is a mighty strong tower
Righteous run in and they're saved
I will trust You (trust in You)
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (Lord I will)
Lord I'll trust in You
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (for I know)
He will see me through
I will trust (trust in the name of The Lord)
In the name (trust in the name of The Lord)
Of The Lord (Lord I will)
Lord I'll trust in You
I will trust (the name of The Lord is a mighty)
In the name (a strong tower, a strong tower)
Of The Lord (the righteous run in and they are)
He will see me through (saved, saved)
