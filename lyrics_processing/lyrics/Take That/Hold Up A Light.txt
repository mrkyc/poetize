You can dance if you like
You can sing every line of every song
No, you don't have to steal the show
It was your show all along
As the orchestra plays
The people take the seats
There's no room left in this house
It's only you and me
And if life is your stage
I'll be watching

Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me, oh
I'll be watching
Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me
Hold up a light for me, oh
And I'll be watching you

Everything that you do
As we start rehearsing every scene
The words to everything
We realize that the crowd is listening
And then the tears fall down on your face
At exactly the right place
As the people start to stand up in the aisle
You can hear the sound of violins
On every street tonight
You can see all lovers dancing 'round
I'll be watching

All things you see

Hold up a light for me, hold up a light
Hold up a light for me, hold up a light

Hold up a light for me, hold up a light
A light for me
