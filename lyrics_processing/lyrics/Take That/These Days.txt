Oh I can see the future
Coming to you
Cry away the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in days I've wasted
Been around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hard and cold and
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the battles we have won
For the day we reach the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope for the best
And won't you rest on my bones
And you're calling me now
I was here all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching you

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the night has gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
What a day to belong to a face in the crowd to the beat of your heart
And I'm already in
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all in your hands
Oh, what you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it all
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over
Tonight we're gonna live for
We're gonna live for these days
Tonight, tonight, we'll remember
