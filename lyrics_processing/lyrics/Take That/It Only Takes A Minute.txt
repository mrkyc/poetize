It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
What's an hour of the day
We'd throw at least one away
And walk the streets for half the year
Tryin' to find a new career
Now if you get a flu attack
For thirty days you're on your back
Doing not a single dance
Baby give me half a chance
It only takes a minute girl (Only take a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (To fall in love)
It only takes a minute girl (It only take a minute girl)
To fall in love, fall in lovee
Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life reading signs
Waiting for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you
Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
So baby can't you make me just a little time
'Cause you never know what's on my mind
