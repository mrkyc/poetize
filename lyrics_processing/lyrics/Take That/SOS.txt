Save our souls we're splitting atoms
Go tell Eve and go tell Adam
Liberate your sons and daughters
Some are gods and some are monsters

We'll get a five minute warning for divine intervention
With the satellites falling, prepare for ascension
Under mind control
We'll be practising our politics
Defending all our policies
Preparing for apocalypse

Don't let the hungry serpent see you no
She'll let you fall asleep then eat you whole
It's like a bullet to the head

It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Like a bullet in the head, it's an SOS

When the levee breaks
And Manhattan sinks
There won't be water fit to drink
When the winter's warm
And the summer's cold
The poison stops you looking old

You'll get a five second warning for divine intervention
And the satellites are falling, prepare for ascension
As the earth looks on
The odds or probability
Of losing all capacity
To function it's hereditary

No antibiotic can save us now
We are the virus that we talk about
It's like a bullet through the head

It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Like a bullet in the head, it's an SOS
It's an SOS it's an SOS
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Like a bullet in the head, it's an SOS

(Without criticism
No administration and no country can succeed
And no republic can survive)
Like a bullet in my head
Like a bullet in my head
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
Like a bullet in the head, it's an SOS
It's an SOS it's an SOS
Oh yes, oh yes, it's an SOS
It's an SOS, it's an SOS
