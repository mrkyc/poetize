Making my way through old photographs
Of the night when you first stood by my side
Old friends with smiles
Some are here, some are gone
Good memories of our senior high

Looking back
We're the only couple still together
Even then
I knew this love would be forever
I knew

'Cause there's nobody else in this world
That could love you
Anymore than I do
Always here for you
Nobody else in this world
Could love you more
Nobody could love you
Anymore than I do
I'm still here for you
Oh, I'm still here for you

Our lives have all changed
We've come a long long way
Our faces show the lines of two young sons
And in their houses there will be
Pictures like the ones of you and me
Hope they can look back and smile
Just like we have done

Never once
Have I ever felt the need for another
(Never felt the need, never felt the need for another)
We were strong
And survived this storm in time to discover
To discover one another

'Cause there's nobody else in this world
That could love you
Anymore than I do
Always here for you
Nobody else in this world
Could love you more
Nobody could love you
Anymore than I do
I'm still here for you
And all of the smiles we have won
Just from looking back
And reliving all those good times
And when we've been through all the pages
We'll just start again
We'll just start again

Nobody else in this world
Could love you
Anymore than I do
Always here for you
Nobody else in this world
Could love you more
(no, no oh oh)
Nobody could love you
(nobody, baby, nobody)
Anymore than I do
'Cause girl I'm here for you
Nobody else in this world
Could love you
Anymore than I do
Always here for you
Nobody else in this world
Could love you more
Nobody could love you
Anymore than I do
I'm still here for you, oh
Always here for you
(Nobody else)
Oh yeah
(Nobody else)
Nobody, nobody but you
(Nobody else)
Nobody, nobody but you
(Nobody else)
Nobody, nobody, baby, no
(Nobody else)
Nobody
(oh oh oh, nobody else)
Nobody, nobody
(Nobody else)
No no nobody else, nobody but you
(Nobody else)
