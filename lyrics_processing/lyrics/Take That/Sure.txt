Sure, so sure
Sure, so sure
Feel it moving, feel it moving
Need you so much
Yeah, yeah
Sure, so sure
That it's sweet love I found

I'm sitting here writing for my lover
Last time we met I wasn't to sure
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call
I need more, much more than before
I need positive reactions whenever I'm down

I'm sure so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure
So baby come on inside
Need you so much
More and more each time we touch
Sure, so sure, so sure
That it's sweet love I found

It isn't a game so don't play hard to get
(Tired of running after you)
There's no connections holding us down (down)
Isn't it a shame that it never happened
Though still here we are the second time round
It's gotta be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life

Sure, so sure
It's heaven knocking on my door
Sure, so sure
So baby come on inside
Need you so much
More and more each time we touch

That it's sweet love I found

Holding, squeezing, touching, teasing
Wanting, wishing, waiting, thinking
Of you love, yeah yeah
Blinding, grooving, feel it, move it

It's gotta be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible
It's gotta be right for life
Sure, so sure
