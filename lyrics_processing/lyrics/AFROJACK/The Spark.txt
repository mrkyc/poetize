A little bit of misfit banter
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine coming out the mind of this midnight rambler

I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever think if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright....

Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

They say if you look around for something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down but Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright....

Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight


Hope I feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the end much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well, well maybe tonight
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
