I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why 'cause there are too many things

And now we're standin' on the edge
Lookin' like, "Here we go again"
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend


Oh, lil' ma-mama, I can feel your fire
You're poisonous, lady, let me take you higher
And I don't care if this a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight

And now we're standin' on the edge
Lookin' like, "Here we go again"
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend


I came to party hopin' that you would fall in love
Don't mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loves a molly and the DJ, he's gettin' drunk
From tryin' to get next to you

And now we're standin' on the edge
Lookin' like, "Here we go again"
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

As your friend (I love you, baby, I love you)
As your friend (I love you, baby, I love you)
As your friend (I love you, baby, I love you)
I woke up as your friend (Love you, love you)
(I love you, baby, I love you)
As your friend (I love you, baby, I love you)
As your friend (I love you, baby, I love you)
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy

And now we're standin' on the edge
Lookin' like, "Here we go again"
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

I'ma fuck that pussy
I'ma fuck that pussy
