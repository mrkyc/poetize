Oh yes
Might just blow a whole check
Oh yes
Run up like I owe debt
Oh yes
She woke up in my old sweats
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
Oh yes
Might just blow a whole check
Oh yes
Run up like I owe debt
Oh yes
She woke up in my old sweats
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
Wake up every morning, thank God for another day
I roll it up, light it up, hit the blunt and take the pain away

No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow

Told her come get high in my location
Throw it back and put that shit in rotation
Tryin' knock me down just like it's probation
Beatin' no cases
Cracking cold cases
Talkin' like a freak, I know you ain't one
I know what you came for
You know where I came from
Money talkin' but they ain't saying nothing
Ballin' like they the one
Million on my day one

No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow

O.T
I bought a Double R (key)
I bought a new chain (gold)
I bought a new house (right)
I bought a new ring (right)
Got me a check, a check, a check
I'm feelin' so cool man (cool)
All of these rappers wish they're me
But they need school man
I love a white girl
She drives me so crazy
Smokin' on all this weed
It got me so lazy
Always knew that I'd be a star
Just like a Mercedes
All of these whips in my front yard
But I'm like, "Fuck slavery"
Livin' my life today
Hatin' on me, better pray
Known for sellin' the yay
Day after day after day
Caught me a case, beat the charge
Now I'm back in the street
Jury lit, now I'm froze
You're like a package of me
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, like there's no tomorrow
We gettin' lit just like there's no tomorrow
