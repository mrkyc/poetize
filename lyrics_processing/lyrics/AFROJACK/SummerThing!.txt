La, la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la

I don't wanna write this love song
I, I'm fighting this urge
But you make me say ooh, damn
Cause I, I can't find the words
I don't wanna write this love song
Just wanna dance all night 'til it hurts
But you make me say ooh, damn
Cause I, I can't find the words

Ooh, You stole my heart, we had a summer fling
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
But you made me fall in the winter, bloom in the spring
From June to December, it was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
That it was just a summer thing

This, this ain't no love song
It's just a little ditty, babe
I just wanna go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, damn
Cause you're so, you're so pretty, baby
This, this ain't no love song
Just wanna watch you dance sexy, baby
I just wanna go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, damn
That's if ya, if ya let me, babe
