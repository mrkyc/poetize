Late nights, everyday's a motherfuckin' party
Too stoned, don't know what I did last night
Hangin' with my niggas gettin' drunk
Smokin' weed and doin' what we want
We live our lives and ain't no one gon' bring us down
Staying out, sleeping when we can cause we don't stop
Going hard, wake up in the morning do it all again
Roll up the Marley, let's get it started, life of a party
Let's live for today, we might not be here tomorrow

And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough
Cause we just want more, more
We just want more, more

Every time I hear the music
I go crazy
Floating there you take me away
Higher than we've ever been before

Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds

Every time I hit the club, I take my money, I spend it up
Standing on the couch, just showing love
Don't give a damn, don't give a fuck
Floating and take me away
High up in the clouds, never coming down
Somewhere out in space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down
Another hundred grand, soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep
Mary Jane and them paper planes
Pouring shots, you better take this drink

And they say I'm too wild
They say I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough (Y'all already know what it is, man)
Cause we just want more, more (So let's get enough)
We just want more, more (We're tryina break the mirror)

They say I'm too wild
They say I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough
Cause we just want more, more
