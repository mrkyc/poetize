Uhh oh yea
Well well well well well well well
Uhh oh baby
Listen to me
Oh huh
Just got laid off from work today
I can't go home
What am I gonna say
Guess I'll go to the local bar toss up a few
Tell the bartender what I'm going thru
He said if you got a good woman
She gon catch you when you fall
So instead of giving me an earful
Here's a quarter you need to call her
So here I am baby
If tonight I cry (oh baby)
I need you to be strong
Will you be my shoulder (oh baby)
Girl you are my backbone (my backbone)
And I'm falling apart
