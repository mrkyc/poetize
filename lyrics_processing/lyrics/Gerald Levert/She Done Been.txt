You brotha's
Ya'll forget you got a mama
Got a lady that stick with you through thick and thin
But you dog her
And you ain't been through half the shit she been
You step in the church
Every morning, six A.M., up from work
Daddy always kept it real
Taught you how a man s'pose to feel
Not afraid to cook and clean
Ain't even into the party scene
But no matter what you do
Every man that you meet
Want his cake and eat it too
1 - She been lied to, cheated on
The victim of every sad song
Her mother and her father
Definition of the perfect daughter
But she can't find a man
Who done been half the things
She done been

Raise your hand

You like the thought of makin love
Occassional kisses and a few hugs
Want a family, raise some kids
Just like your mamma and your daddy did yeah
But every guy you start to dig
Comes with baggage and no gig, yeah
(Got no kind of a job)
Got a baby mama, and alot of bills
You foot the bill, but he come and go at will
Repeat 1
Said, give your baby a standing ovation
Got her own college education
Raise her babies all alone
Always in a house but never at a home
Repeat 1
24 hours in labor (she done been)
She been abused by her man (she done been)
Out there on the welfare (she done been)
Ya'll don't seem to understand (she done been)

Scrapping up dollars to get the baby lunch (she done been)
Left at the alter by her sucker man (she done been)

You don't seem to understand (she done been)
Called bitches and hoes for no reason (she done been)
Getting reeked on by the man she was pleasing (she done been)
