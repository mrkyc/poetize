Girl, I've been waitin' on this day
Bet you thought you'd never hear me say
You've been creepin' around all over town
Been layin' it down, been messin' around
What goes around always comes around
Baby girl, thought we was down
Girl, I hope you change your freaky ways
'Cause I really want to stay
Tell me is it fair since I've been there
And that I should share your underwear
Do you think he really cares?
All this time (time) I've been sleepin' with you
You've been sleepin' with me
And you've been strokin' him and lovin' him
And kissin' him and huggin' him.  (Oh wow.)
Yeah
You've been creepin' with him
He's been sexin' your friend
And I got you thinkin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
Thinkin' 'bout it, just thinkin' 'bout it
You might also likeGirl, I think that I should let you know
That I'm gonna have to up and go
If you keep givin' it up and cuttin' up
And act too fast and givin' up the ass
I love you, but I had enough
Do it again, it's gonna be your last
I can forgive, but I won't forget the things you did
You'll soon regret ever dissin' me
'Cause this could be the end of we
Can't you see, girl, you're hurtin' me
(All this time) All this time (I've been sleepin' with you,)

And I got you thinkin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
Thinkin' bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
For the life of me, I just can't conceive
Why I just can't leave while you do this to me, baby
I feel like a fool, but what can I do?
Your love's got me weak, babe
Why must I endure your constant greed
Your endless need to be so damn freaky?
Now I'll understand, 'cause it was just me
I guess payback's a mother, baby
Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why
Tell me why, why are you so freaky?
Tell me why are you so freaky.  Oh
