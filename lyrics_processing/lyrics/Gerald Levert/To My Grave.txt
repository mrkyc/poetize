How I'm gone explain this one
What am I doing in this house
What am I doing in this bed
What are you doing laying next to me
Running your fingers all through my hair
What am I doing with no clothes on
At six a.m. in the morning
They bouta sing the Tom Joyner song
Oh, Oh, Oh, I'm in trouble
I'm taking this one to my grave
So if I tell you
I might have to have hurt you
I don't care what nobody say
If you a player, you can send me a prayer
I'm taking this one to my grave
(Somebody must've slipped something in my drink)
So if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
Don't care what nobody say
Said, if you're a true player, you can send me prayer
What I'm gone tell my woman
I've used the cell phone too much
This the third time she caught me creeping
You would've thought that a brother had enough
(I ain't got enough)
I usually tell but, I'm
You might also likeI'm gone take this one to my grave
So if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
I don't care what nobody say
Say if you're a true player
All you can do is send me a prayer
I'm taking this one to my grave
And if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
I don't care what nobody say
I love that woman and I'm not gonna lose her
(If you're a true player, you can send me a prayer)
She gone be standing at the door
With them rollers in her hair
And that's a sight to see
It's enough to make ya scared
Something must be wrong with me
Cause the loving's good at home
It must be in my genes
Cause poppa was a rolling stone
And granddaddy
But they used to say, son
I'm taking this one to my grave
(And if I)
So if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
I don't care what nobody say
(I'm gone have to cut you now)
If you're a true player
You can send me a prayer
I'm gonna take this one to my grave
Cause I love my woman
(So if I tell you)
I love that woman
(I might have to hurt you)
And I can't tell nobody
I can't tell nobody
If you're a true player
You can send me a prayer
So if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
I don't care, I don't care
If you're a true player, you can send me a prayer
To the last baby, To the last time I'm gonna
So if I tell you
(I'm gonna)
I might have to hurt you
And if I tell you
And if I tell you and it seems
Like you're gonna say something
You better not say nothing cause
I'm sensitive about my woman
So if I tell you
I might have to hurt you
I swear to God I love my woman
Said she make that hot water cornbread
And collard greens that make you wanna scream
And I'll cut you if you tell her now
