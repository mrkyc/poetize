Can I love you baby
Said I feel it, feel me
Oh, I've been practicing for you baby
I want hang it on the wall
Oh Baby
Oh, I wanna love you
Love you like a work of art
Using all the colors
That bring joy to your heart
And with each stroke, baby

Till my masterpiece
Comes together baby
Like the Joan of Arc
And the Mona Lisa
I want to hang it on the wall
Where only you can see it
Cause when you tell a friend
She'll tell a friend
They'll tell a friend
And everyone will be feigning
For my stroke of genius

Up and down

Feel my stroke of genius
Back and forth
Up and down
Better than you dreamed it
When you
Feel my stroke of genius
I'm gonna take my time
Make every stroke out baby
(I'll be stroking baby)
Every move that I do
I wanna make you shout
A dibble of this
A dabble of that
You're gonna want it so bad
Any stroke gets spent with time
And you know I long to satisfy

Hang it on the wall
