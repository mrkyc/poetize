And the way that you workin' your thang
How can I be down girl, I want you now
You drive me insane
(See I gotta know, I need the dough, talk alot ain't sayin' nothin'
I can't go, no, no, no, no, no)
1 - 	I been workin' my game, babe
	Spending my change, baby
	Ain't nothin' change, baby
	Ya still actin' the same, baby
	You see I thought I could go, baby
	You keep tellin' me no, baby
	Said it's breaking my heart, baby
	It's breakin' my heart, baby
Tell me what to do
Just to get with you for a little while
Just a little while
Satisfaction guarenteed
If you get with me
Girl I'll make you smile, oh
(I know you know what I like and
Feel ya tryin' to get inside but it's too tight
Something you can't buy)

The name "Shaqueen"
I slide on the scene
With ice and games for cats fiening to slide in between
My steez far from easy
It's harder than you get
Seein' me in ya head naked in the bed
On some freaky triple X shit
Words exit through one ear and out the next
Cuz I ain't with that sex shit
And I barely know you
Money can't get me to give it like hoes do
That's how I keep it tight
So get it right
You can't buy my love
No matter the cost
And the more you try to
It's just the phatter I floss
Just because you give me a rise
Don't mean I'm a ride
Or because you take me out
It's gonna help me decide
And I ain't tryin' to play you
Or get you for yours
But I just know you can't wait
To get in my drawers
But if the time is right
And your mind is right
I might change
But until then, I'mma keep dissin' your game
