Just thinking about you, baby
And how that skirt was hugging
Your body last night
And oh girl, you were smelling
Like strawberries and whipped cream
And I was the fellas envy
Believe me, last night
I wanna thank your momma
For raising a girl like you babe
I wanna thank your momma for raising you
And I wanna thank your daddy
For hooking up with your momma
And doing the things they were doing
When they made you
Didn't we
Break the rules last night
Didn't we
Cut a fool last night
Didn't we
Make some moves last night
Tell me, didn't we
Didn't we
Shut 'em down last night
Didn't we
Paint the town last night
Didn't we
Do the damn thing last night
Tell me, didn't we
Didn't we

Let's do it again
Step, step, off the floor
Step, step here we go
Step, step, step
I can't wait till this evening
Just to see you baby
You do something to me
This can't be lust
Cause baby when we're dancing
It's just like romancing
And the whole room is watching
All eyes on us
I wanna thank your momma
For raising a girl like you baby
I wanna thank your momma for raising you
And big props to your daddy
I wanna thank your daddy
For hooking up with your momma
And doing what they were doing when they made you
Didn't we
Break the rules last night
Didn't we
Cut a fool last night
Didn't we
Make some moves last night
Tell me, didn't we
Didn't we
Shut 'em down last night
Didn't we
Paint the town last night
Didn't we
Do that damn thing last night
Tell me , didn't we
Didn't we
Rub a dub, dub  
You and me in the club
Leftin' and rightin'
Stepping to the a.m
Back, forth
I'll spin you around
Dip it, then shuffle, baby
Take it to the ground
I'll grab your hips and you'll grab mine
Do a little pumping baby, then a little grind
Stare each other down
With that look of lust
