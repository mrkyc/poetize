Please, don't make me beg, no

If you looked in the dictionary under the word "wrong"
You'd see me crying, crying
If you looked for someone with a broken heart
Standing all alone, there I'd be dying

Girl, asking for forgiveness, please
You just wanna see me on my knees
Baby, you know I'm too cool for that
But I tell my soul to get you back

Girl, I'll do it if I have to
'Cause I'm sorry that I hurt you, baby
Can we instead?
Baby, please don't make me beg, no, no, no
(Don't make me beg)

Girl, I'd give up everything that didn't have to do with me and you
Girl, I would change
'Cause tonight I wanted you to see
It won't be easy getting rid of me
Girl, I'm staying
Girl, I'm staying, I'm staying
You might also like
So we could just start anew (Start anew)
You've been rude to me, I'll be better to you
See, girl, I ain't too proud to beg
I'd rather talk it out instead

I'll do it if I have to
'Cause I'm sorry that I hurt you, baby
(Sorry I hurt you)
Can we talk instead? (Let's talk instead)
Baby, please don't make me beg
Girl, I'll do it if I have to
'Cause I'm sorry that I hurt you, baby
(Sorry I hurt you)
Can we talk instead? (Let's talk instead)
Please, don't make me beg

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me beg
No, no, baby
Don't, don't
Don't you make me get down on my knees
And beg you, but I'd do it, baby, if I have to
Girl, I know that you love me (That you love me)
I know that you need me (You need me)
I know that you really don't wanna hear me
I guess tears don't mean a thing anymore, no
I guess you said that he's tried that bit before
I can't even sleep, girl, I'm losing my head
Instead of fighting, come and talk to me
Please don't make me beg
Please, please (Don't make me beg)
Please
