Your love don't make no sense to me
You get with me and you set me free
Baby, your love don't make no sense, no sense
Your love don't make no sense to me
You get with me and you set me free
Baby, your love don't make no sense, no sense
Girl I want to stay with you
Lay with you the whole night through
Girl, I lose my self control
When we roll the way that we do
And now you're sayin' I can stay and
We can play whenever I call
Baby, don't be teasing me
Best believe that I want it all
I can't belive that
1 - 	I can come and get it when I want it like this
	It's at my finger tips
	You're love's so good don't make no sense, no sense
	I can come and get it when I want it like this

You might also likeI mean it in a good way
When pepole say your love is unreal
Ain't never had nobody
To make me feel the way you make me feel
I paged you 911 so I could see the sun
From your window pane
You may not understand
Wanna be your superman
And you be my Lois Lane, yeah
Right now I can't believe that
Repeat 1
I'll be there 'bout twelve
So just prepare yourself
For this good love
I know you'll turn me out
Gonna make me scream and shout
'Till I can't get enough, no
Girl I'm a 'fein and you're stuff I need
To bring me down, down, down
I don't know what I'll do
If I can't even have you
Around, no, no, no
I can't believe that
Repeat 1

Ain't no reason for the games that you play
That's all that I really said
The touch, the clutch, that's fillin' your head
Easing up out them underwear
I'm really playing
I don't make no sense for me to be
Investing all this time
If you gonna add to this list
Of all things folks
Trying to stress my mind
I'm 'bout my grind
You know that and we gonna let that be that
I hit your corner in about ten minutes
Just hit me right back
Hope to have a successful ending or is you just pretending
Girl, it don't make no sense
Girl I can come in get it when I want it
Then let that be the reason that a Thug come by
Choosy lover, undercover hustler

Flippin' and turning and getting buck wild
Popping that thang as I watch you smile now
