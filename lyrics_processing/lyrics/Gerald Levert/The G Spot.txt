Well, here we are, just me and you
Just you, just us, and the bedroom

Here's a robe; take off them clothes, mmm
Take my hand
The water's running, baby, in the bubble bath
Candles everywhere, relax and unwind
I'ma wash your back while you take a sip of this red wine

Welcome to my lair (Lair, lair, lair)
This is where we play, girl (It's on, baby)
Promise you we won't stop (No, no)
'Til you know your G-spot
(This ain't nothing but love for you, baby)
Welcome to my lair (Lair, lair, lair) (My lair)
This is where we play, girl (This is where we play, baby)
Promise you we won't stop (It's my playground)
'Til you know your G-spot (We'll be getting down)

Rub your shoulders, kiss your neck
Roll my tongue down your back
Pick you up, ooh, you're all wet
Lay your sexy body on the bed
Now close your eyes
'Cause this is where our lips collide, baby
Are you ready yet?
Baby, can I slip inside?
Welcome to my lair, baby

Oh baby, oh, you feel so good, so wet
Ah, can you feel me?
