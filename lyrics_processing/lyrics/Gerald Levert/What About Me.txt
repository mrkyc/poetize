They say a man can be the coldest, coldest thing on earth
But nothing hurts like a woman
With dreams that don't involve you, ha

What happened to all my dreams
You just trade them in for material things
Just because your friends said you deserve your own
How could you let them break up our happy home?
Bags are packed and you're on your way
This has gotta be the saddest day
Can I change your mind?
Girl, I'm hurting inside
Can I change your mind?
Don't think I'll survive without you, baby
Yeah

What about how I feel?
What about me?
What about all our plans?
I guess you don't give a damn
What about me? Baby, baby, baby
What about me?
You might also like
You say you still love me but you gotta go
If this is what love is I don't want no more
I'm begging you to change your mind
Or do you get a thrill out of a grown man crying?
I never thought I'd see the day
When you up and go away

What about how I feel?
What about me?
What about all our plans?
I guess you don't give a damn
What about me? Baby, baby, mmm
(I guess you forgot about me, baby)
What about me? (Oh)

(What about me?)
We laid up in the bed, remember the things we said, ha
(What about me?)
We'd be together until we're dead, ha
You let your friends get to your head
It's never too late to turn things around, yeah
You said love was true and you'd always be down
What about how I feel?
What about me?
What about all our plans?
I guess you don't give a damn
(Guess you don't give a damn)
What about me?
What about me?
What about me?
(Had your own dreams)
What about me?
(Had your own plans, and right now you don't give a damn
You give a damn about)
What about me?
(Me, me, me)
What about me?
(Me, me, me)
What about me?
What about how I feel? (Girl)
What about me? (I love you, baby)
What about all our plans?
(The plans we had together, girl)
I guess you don't give a damn
(You don't give a damn)
What about me?
(Me, me, me, me, oh baby, baby)
What about me?
(Said you're moving on)
What about me?
(Said you're moving on)
What about me?
(Me, me, me, mmm, mmm)
