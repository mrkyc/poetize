Hello, this is Eddie Levert
I want to thank you all for loving and supporting my son throughout his career
He had just finished this album when we went to South Africa
And he was extremely proud and anxious for everyone to hear his newest collection
It is with his wish and mine that I proudly present the one you all nicknamed "The Teddy Bear"
My son, Gerald Levert, and his new album "In My Songs"

I don't mind making you happy
I don't mind making your day
Feels so good to give
But I never, never seem to get my way
I'm tired of waking up with nobody laying next to me (Next to me)
I'm tired of being alone and everybody else is lovey dovey (Lovey dovey)
I'm so tired of all y'all being happy but me
If I could only find a lover to sing about
Oh, oh, when I sing my songs
Oh, oh when I sing my songs
Oh, oh yeah

See, I know what I want
Something real, something I can feel
And I know it don't come easy
I wanna be with somebody who can share my ups and downs (Ups and downs)
And when they're feeling bad I can be the one to make her smile (Make her smile)
Make her realize that I'm the special guy I sing about

(If I could only find the love I sing about)
If I could find a love to sing about when I
See, every night on my knees, I pray, send her to me
(Please send her to me, send her to me)
See, I ain't been perfect
In fact I've been dead wrong
But it's time for me to live off the love that I sing about
In my songs (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
See, listen, I wanna walk down the aisle to my song (Ooh ooh)
I want the first dance to be my song (Ooh ooh)
And I wanna, and I wanna make, wanna make love to my song, to my song, yeah
I wanna have babies to my song (Ooh ooh)
I wanna cry, cry, cry, cry when I'm singing my song
I wanna say damn it's too good, it's too good to be my song
I wanna break-up to make-up (Break-up to make-up) to my song
Oh, I wanna spend quality time, quality time like my song
Twist it years and years to my song (Just like my song)
Waiting for the time when we can say hmm this is a song yeah
Sing it together, sing it together
If I could only find
(If I could only find the love I sing about) I sing about
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
I've been looking and looking, searching here and there
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
See, this is what I've been doing
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
One week, it's good; two weeks is great
Three weeks is turbulent; four weeks, we just crash and burn
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
Then it's all over
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
So I gotta find, find a lover to sing about
(If I could only find the love I sing about)
