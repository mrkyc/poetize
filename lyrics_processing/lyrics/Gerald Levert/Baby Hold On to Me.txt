Oh oh, ooh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Ooh ooh ooh

All your friends are tellin' you
You should have a fancy car and diamond rings
But girl, you know all good things come in time
Girl, you know I'll do just about anything (Anything)
To see a smile (See a smile) upon your face (On your face)
So don't let your friends go messin' with your mind (No, no)

And girl, you know
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you
And baby, don't
Don't ever doubt my love 'cause it's true

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me
Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
(Hold me with all your might)
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me
(Baby, hold on)

Oh, girl, wasn't I there when he made you cry?
And who was there to comfort you
When he said, "Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye," baby?
Girl, I give you my time, here is my money
(All of my time, all of my money, all of my heart)
And you'll be so sorry, baby
If we were to ever part, part

And girl, you know
That I would never hurt you
Oh, girl, you know
That I won't ever desert you

Baby, hold on to me
(Hold on to me, baby)
See I'm a special kind

See, late at night
When you need someone to hold you tight
You're gonna look for me
You're gonna look for me
So you better, you better

A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Hold on
Hold on, think about it before you let me walk out the door, baby
How can you live without me, baby?
'Cause I can't see myself livin' without you
Baby, hold on to me

And your friends keep tellin' you

All about what they don't know
Baby, hold on to me

See I'm a special kind
(That I'll never hurt you, baby)
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
