No, no. no not from the music
But just from looking at you
I want you
Girl you look like a million bucks
Any closer girl, I might bust
Ain't the Belvedere talking baby
It's your body making me crazy
I can't wait to get you alone
Cause girl, you got my love on swole
Dance all night
Girl work up a sweat
Cause tonight, you ain't gone forget
When we get home
I won't leave you alone, no
I'm gonna wear it out, babe
Wear it out, baby
Wear it out girl
Wear it out
See it's going down
Won't stop till you shout, baby
I'm gonna wear it out babe
Wear it out girl
Wear it out

How many licks
Till I get
To the middle, baby
To your creamy filling, baby
On bottom, on the top
Working my thang, till you drop
Say stop, had enough

Turn over, you're sleeping baby
When we get home
I won't leave you alone
Till I wear it out baby
Wear it out baby
Gonna tear it out baby
Wear it out
Said its going down
I won't stop till you shout
Wear it out baby
Wear it out baby

Said it's going on and on
I'm gonna wear it out baby
Wear it out baby
Oh baby

Come on and
Don't play with it
You gone get it, get it
It's yours
Break the bed
And the ceiling
Let's have no limit
And I'm gonna take it
Keep your body shaking
It was just a break
Your house is shaking
When we get home
Down, down. down, down
Down, down, down, down, baby
I'm gonna wear it out baby
Wear it out baby
I promise you this evening
Wear it out baby
Oh baby your gonna be
Pleading for me to stop
It's going down
Down, down
Down, down down
I'm gonna wear it out baby
Wear it out baby
Wear it out
Till I can't do no more
Till your tired
And your bed is wet
Loosing your mind
You turn over to sleep, baby
I'm gonna wear it out girl
You can't call your friends
Tell them what I did
Cause you're gonna be tired baby
I'm gonna wear it out baby
And I'm gone still be watching t.v
To wake up in the morning girl
You said you want me to wear it out baby
Wear it out baby
Wear it out
Wear it our baby
