Look what we did, look what we did
(Turned it into something)
We took all our tiny fingers and we put them together
(Turned it into something)
And we made up something so good, so sweet
Everybody, everybody wants it, everybody wants it
We took nothing, nothing
(We took nothing)
Nothing, nothing, ah baby baby
Ah, nothing, nothing
Said we took nothing, me and you
You and me, you and me, baby
