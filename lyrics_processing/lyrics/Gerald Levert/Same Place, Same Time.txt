I don't wanna be alone
Yo, I'll be there
Same place, same time
(We're keeping it a secret)
I don't wanna be alone, baby
No, no, no, no more, no more
Ooh baby, oh baby
I don't wanna be alone, ooh
I can't stand being without you (Anymore, no)
(Ooh baby)

As we lay face to face
Sharing love in a temporary place
(Just for the moment)
I got a girl (That I love)
You got a man (I think you love him, too)
If they found out, I'm sure they wouldn't understand
(No way, no way)

See, I can't keep myself from wanting you
(Can't keep my hands off you)
You see I wanna lay with you, I wanna play with you
I wanna stay with you, baby, baby, baby
You might also like
Don't ask me how, I can't say why (I can't say why)
Why we're here, you and I
(How could something so wrong be so right?)
At the same place at the same time
(Feels like Me and Mrs. Jones)
Don't stop now, don't let it end
('Cause me and you got a thing going on)
Girl, we must do it again (So strong)
In the same way, at the same time

I want my cake, eat it, too (Eat it all up)
Making love to her
I wish I'm making love to you (Ain't that a shame)
So here we are (Again), we know it's wrong
Each moment without you, baby, is too damn long, ah baby

There's no time to be wasting, baby
(No time to be wasting)
So let's slip away (Slip away, slip away)
To our favorite place, baby

Don't ask me how, I can't say why
(Come go with me)
Why we're here, you and I
At the same place at the same time
(I don't know why I feel like I do about you)
Don't stop now, don't let it end
(But I got a thing for you, baby)
Girl, we must do it again
(I got a thug thing for you, baby)
In the same way, at the same time
(Ooh baby, baby)
Make sure you got your pumps on
When you come, baby, come along
I swear I'm gonna keep it hot
Come on give me all you got
It's our secret
Keeping it a secret, nobody has to know
The things that we do or the places we go
(The places we go, come on)
You know what time of evening
You know just where we meet
(You know where we meet)
It ain't nobody's business
We're keeping it discreet
(Nobody has to know)

Don't stop now, don't let it end
(Don't tell your friends, I won't tell my friends)
Girl, we must do it again
In the same way, at the same time
(I gotta have your love)
Don't ask me how, I can't say why
(I don't know what comes over me)
Why we're here, you and I
(But I gotta have you constantly)
At the same place at the same time
(Regularly, to keep me on my feet, baby, come on, baby)
Don't stop now, don't let it end
(Don't stop now)
Girl, we must do it again
(Don't tell your girlfriends)
In the same way, at the same time
(That we gotta do it over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over again, baby)
Don't ask me how, I can't say why
(As we lay)
Why we're here, you and I
At the same place at the same time
(In the same place, same time)
Don't stop now, don't let it end
Girl, we must do it again
