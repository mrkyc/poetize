Never asked you for much just have a open mind
For a year or so we been going strong
I'll stop at nothing girl just to turn you on
Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it girl
See I'll do anything just to make you scream
Tell me how low and girl I would go
Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it girl
Chorus
It's your turn to do unto me as I do unto you
You got to show and prove that you like my groove
I don't wanna be the only freak around
Chorus
Buy you what you need to get into me
Strawberries whip cream I'll get you some honey
I would do that baby I would do that girl
Watch a video turn on the radio
What's it gonna take to start this freaky show
Are you 'bout it baby are you 'bout it girl
Chorus
You might also likeIf you're my girl and I'm your man
You got to understand that I got needs baby
And I ain't gonna tell a sound girl no no no
No no nobody baby
So let your hair down it's time to play
Turn on the music a little bit of Marvin Gaye
Let's get it on baby let's get it on girl
If you don't I gotta go I gotta go baby
Said you get one, two, three strikes and you're out
Gotta let you go baby gotta let you go baby
Gotta let you go baby gotta let you go baby
Baby please don't let me down
You get one, two, three strikes and you're out
Repea four times
Do unto me as I do unto you
You got to show and prove that you like my groove
I don't want to be the only freak around
