You know, life is funny
When you look at it, everybody wants love
And everybody's afraid of love
I'm a firm believer that
If you get anything out of life
You've gotta put up with the stress and strife, yeah
Tell you

You almost pushed our love a little bit too far
We forgot to remember how blessed we are, yeah
And that girl over there, telling you what she sees
You don't have to worry, she ain't gonna get next to me, uh-uh, no
You told me to think it over, ha
And I thought it over and over and over
Over and over and over
You see, 'cause

That's the way I feel about you
That's the way I feel about you
That's the way I feel about you, baby
Oh, that's the way I feel about you
(That's the way I feel about you ... Mary)
You might also like
I know you've been hurt
So have many of us too
That's a sacrifice life is gonna put you though
(Sing, sing)
Trust in me (Mhm) like I trust in you
Sometimes I look at you, baby
And wonder if God sent you here
Don't take

Don't take my love as a sign of weakness
(Sign of a weakness)
Check into the situation, dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper (Deeper, yeah)
Told me to think it over (Did you think it over?)
And I thought it over and over (Mhm)
And over and over again (Mhm)
Oh, oh

That's the way I feel about you
Oh, that's the way I feel about you (I feel about you)
That's the way I feel about you (I feel about you, oh)

Please, please, please answer to love
If it ever come knocking at your door
'Cause what's out there knocking, baby
The world don't get enough of, no, no

So many have many of us too
That's a sacrifice that life is gonna put you through
Don't take my love as a sign of a weakness
Check into the situation, dig a little deeper, deeper
