But I had to let you know that this bullshit got to stop
You're my woman now and you're full grown
Got a baby in my hand and your mama on the phone
Hit me with the boo-boo all on my ear
Talkin' 'bout the business over here
You better check 'cause you know that I fear
She don't know me that well, I don't care
Just us, just you and me

All your friends and your family
I ain't gonna let them worry me

And girl it reach a point about four five time
Tryin' to tell me I'll take care of this baby boy of mine
Talk about did you feed him? Yeah, he should take a nap
Better step to your girlfriend before the trick he slap
Hit me with the boo-boo all on my ear
Talkin' 'bout the business over here
You better check 'cause you know that I fear
She don't me that well, I don't care
