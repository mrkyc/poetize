Before you came around I asked myself
What is this thing called love?
There were clouds, the rain kept pouring down
Then you brought the sun, yes, you did
Showed me all the differences
Between a woman and a girl
Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

(I don't need to take a toke)
'Cause I'm on a natural high
(Everybody's blowing smoke)
But girl you never lie, no
(Friends say that we in a pinch)
They're just hating their lives
(I know they want what I got)
It comes once in a lifetime, yeah

You're the reason why I sing
All of life's finer things
Like rainbows and shining stars
Baby, you are
You're the reason why I sing
All of life's finer things
(All of life's finer things, yeah)
Like diamond rings and fancy cars
Baby, you are
You might also like
I was a bad seed
And you nourished me, encouraged me
'Til I grew tall as a tree, as a tree
You had patience to search
Find and bring out all the best in me, yes, you did
You see things I couldn't see
My mental potential
Girl, you showed me, yeah
Now it's a reality
And I promise, for you, I'm gonna be all that I can be

(I don't need to take a toke)
'Cause I'm on a natural high
(Everybody's blowing smoke)
But girl, but girl, you never, never, never, never lie, no
(Friends say that we in a pinch)
Ooh, but they're just hating their lives
(I know they want what I got)
It comes once in a lifetime, baby, baby

You're the reason why I sing
(Reason why I sing)
All of life's finer things
(All of life's finer things)
Like rainbows and shining stars
Hey, baby, you are, yeah
You're the reason why I sing
(The reason why I sing)
All of life's finer things
(All of life's finer things)
Like diamond rings and fancy cars
Baby, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are
(Baby, you are) I mean it, I mean it babe
(Baby you are) Said you're number one in my book
(Baby, you are) And forever you got me hooked
Baby you are, you are, you are
(Baby, you are) Take it back, y'all, come on
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo (Woo-hoo) Hoo (Woo-hoo) Hoo
You're my shining star
Said baby, baby, you are, you are, you are
Woo-hoo-woo (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
You're everything I need
Baby, just stay here with me, you are

You're the reason why I sing

All of life's finer things
