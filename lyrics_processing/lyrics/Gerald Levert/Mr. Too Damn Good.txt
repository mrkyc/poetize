Oh oh, yeah, mhm

Guess you never know a good thing
When it's right in your face
You've been abused for so long
Love gets tainted and all seems the same, mhm
I guess it's unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well, time ain't no object and money ain't a thing
When you have someone to ease your pain

Wanna be the smile on your face
Be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed, yeah
And baby, I'll be your fool
