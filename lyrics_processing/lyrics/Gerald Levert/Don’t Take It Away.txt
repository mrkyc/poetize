For so long I've wanted to say
You've changed the way I look at love
And I pray you'll stay here by my side
'Cause you see, if you leave, forget existence
I would rather die, you ask why
'Cause when I'm with you I can fly
Baby, I can touch the sky

Don't take it away, no
Take your love away from me
(Don't take your love away from me)
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep
You'll be taking my sunshine, rainbows
You don't wanna do that, girl
It'd be like taking away a baby's
Ice cream, sprinkles
And I know you're not that kind of girl

You never said that you had plans to leave me
But I thought I'd tell you while
I had the chance and a love this strong
For so many ways, 'til it's too late
To express the happiness
Don't know what to do
After the love is gone
They can't even carry on, no, no, no
You might also like
Don't take it away, no
Take your love away from me
(Don't take your love away from me)
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep
You'll be taking my sunshine, rainbows
You don't wanna do that, girl
(You don't wanna do that, baby)
It'd be like taking away a baby's
Ice cream, sprinkles
And I know you're not that kind of girl

See, with you I'm complete
Girl, you are so sweet
Nothing can compare to you being there
You see, girl, you know that I'll respect you
I never would neglect my responsibility to love you
So don't take it from me, no
No, no, no, no
Don't take it away
Don't take it away

Don't take it away, no
Take your love away from me
(Don't take your love away from me, no baby, no, no)
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep
You'll be taking my sunshine, rainbows
You don't wanna do that, girl
(You don't wanna do that, girl)
It'd be like taking away a baby's
Ice cream, sprinkles
And I know you're not that kind of girl
Don't take it away, no
(Don't take your love, don't take your love away)
Take your love away from me
(Don't take your love away from me, your love away)
Don't take it away, no
(Don't take your love, don't take your love away)
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep
(Don't take your love away from me, your love away from me)
