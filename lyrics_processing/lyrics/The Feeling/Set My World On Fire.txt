I say I'll leave you but I won't
We all wanna be free but not alone
So off you go just like before
I hear you slam the taxi door
I hope you find what you're looking for
I know I'm doing wrong
Yes, I know I'm doing wrong
But I can feel you in my heart
Every time we part
(Set my world on fire)
I love you more every day
You can run, you can run but don't stay long
(I love you more every day)
(Set my world on fire)
And I don't care, I don't care what you say
(I love you more, I love you more every day)
And still that smell you always wear
Just hangs like silence in the air
Holds court when you're not even there
Nobody has to understand
We hold our hearts within our hands
Sometimes it's more than we can stand

You can run, you can run but don't stay long

What more can I say?
