But I dont believe you
Everybody needs everyone, well
Everybody needs someone
All the things that you borrowed
Left you scared of tomorrow
How you ever gonna pay back?
You'll have a heart attack
But every little thing that you gave away
Every little kiss up until today
Youre gonna get it back somehow
I thought you wanna know by now
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
And even when youre gone
(Won't go away)
Your memory will linger on
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Love will make you strong
(Won't go away)
But dont forget to pass it on
If youve ever been lonely
Then youll know that Im only
One person from happiness
One person away from happiness
And it may never happen
'Cos I'm never in fashion
And it feels like I'm getting old
I feel I'm getting old
But every little thing that I gave away
Every little smile up until today
Im gonna get it back somehow
Im gonna get it back right now
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
And even when youre gone
(Won't go away)
Your memory will linger on
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Love will make you strong
(Won't go away)
But dont forget to pass it on, yeah
(Won't go away, won't go away)
Now youve left a trace
In hearts and time and space
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Even when youre gone
(Won't go away)
Your memory will linger on
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Love will make you strong
(Won't go away)
But dont forget to pass it on
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Even when youre dead and gone
(Won't go away)
Your memory will linger on
(Won't go away)
It never goes away
(Won't go away)
It never ever goes away
(Won't go away)
Love will make you strong
(Won't go away)
But dont forget to pass it on
(Won't go away)
Dont forget to pass it on
(Won't go away)
Dont forget to pass it on
(Won't go away)
Dont forget to pass it on
(Won't go away)
