He said: "I'm not an asshole"
Something of course only an asshole would say
And I said: "I'm not stupid"
Something only someone stupid would say
The game is on but I can't see the board
And are there any rules here anymore?

I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I just do

He's not afraid of drowning
He said a sinking ship's his spiritual home
"Well, shut up and start talking" I said
"You're saying things that I don't need to know"
Tell me, are you gonna be my friend?
'Cause I don't need another one of them

I wish I didn't feel the way I do

So throw me in the swim
Wash away the warmth
Make me cool, as in
Make me nonchalant

Maybe you'll forget me
Or maybe you'll see what a fool you've been
The thing that most upsets me
Is the truth is probably halfway in between
The game's still on, but noone's keeping score
And I don't wanna play it anymore

I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I just do

So throw me in the swim
Clean away the worms
I sing a little hint
As you wash me in the fount, yeah
Throw me in the swim
Scrub away the sorrow
Today I didn't win
I hope I win tomorrow
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do
I wish I didn't feel the way I do

Who is that funny man?
It's your crazy uncle Dan
He wrote a song for you
It's just a line or two
The way you walk on the planet, Edee
That's all that matters, you'll see

Now you've learned to walk, Edee
And then you learned to talk, Edee
And then you'll sing along, Edee
If you like the song, Edee

And soon we'll go to the zoo
Maybe the circus too
We'll build some memories worth having
You have a world to see

And when you walk on the planet, Edee
You leave some smiles where you've been

Just remember me, Edee
When I'm 93, Edee
Remember daddy too, Edee
He was 62, Edee

The way you walk on the planet, Edee
That's all that matters, you'll see
