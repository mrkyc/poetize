You're alone and that's your thing, that's your thing
And if you don't hear your voice
You're alone and that's your choice, baby that's your choice
If I put my name upon it, maybe no one else will want it
Maybe I can keep it to myself
(She said) You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
Leave me out of it
Don't fool yourself cause now you're free, you're free
Leave me out of it
There's a thousand things that you can be, without me
If you put your name upon it, maybe no one else will want it
Maybe you can keep it to yourself
(She said) You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is but you need some
A crack in your heart that can't be undone
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is but you need some
A crack in your heart that can't be undone
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
You don't know what love is but you need some
A crack in your heart that can't be undone
You don't know what love is till you've had mine
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
Na na na na na na
Coming through your door, soon I'll have you calling out for more
Na na na na na na
Leave me out of it
