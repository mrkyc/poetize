Give me the words and ill say them like I mean it
Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And god knows
You got me sewn
Nah nah nah etc
Danny boy, don't be afraid, to shake that ass, and misbehave
Danny boy, I now you got time, but what are you waiting for
Anyway the dust may just blow away, if you wait for a windy day
But you may find the chance has past you by;
I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend
So give me the song and ill sing it like I mean it
So give me the words and ill say them like I mean it
Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And god knows
You've got me sewn
Nah nah nah etc
Danny boy, don't be a fool
Take upon to break the rule
Danny boy your lookin so low
You lookin like the dead grown old
Anyway the blues just may wash away, if you wait for a rainy day
But you may find, the chance had past you by
I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend
So give me the song and ill sing it like I mean it
Give me the words and ill say them like I mean it
Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
You've got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Yeah, yeah, yeah
