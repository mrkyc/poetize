Warming up the chill as it moves the trees
Tell me will you come for a stroll with me
All you ever do is say no
If I took a line from your favourite song
Wrote it in the sky with the stars that shone
I could never get you to sing along
All you'd ever do is say no
Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh
I dream about a world only we can know
Dream about a car and a dog in tow
Dream about the places that we can go
But all you ever do is say no
I must be a fool cause I play this game
Shakin' off the dust and I try again
Tell me what I did to deserve these blows
All you ever do is say no
Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh
I know what you do, I know what you do
You string me along, it keeps you amused
Say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh
When I say one thing and you say another
When I say love, you run for cover
When I say one thing and you say another
When I say love, you run for cover
I know what you do, I know what you do
You string me along, it keeps you amused
Say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh
You give me nothing baby
I say one thing, you say another baby
I say love and you run for cover baby
I say one thing, you say another baby
I say love and you run for cover baby
I say one thing, you say another baby
I say love and you're breaking my heart baby, breaking my heart baby
Breaking my heart baby, breaking my heart baby
Say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh, say no. Ooh oh
I know what you do, I know what you do
You string me along, it keeps you amused
