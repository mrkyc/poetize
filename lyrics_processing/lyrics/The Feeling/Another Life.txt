Let me tell you 'bout the old days
Let me tell you everything I know
Oh, let me be a bore babe
Let me tell you stories
And I'll tell them from the heart now
So that every little story told
Oh, is a little work of art now
But if you're just sittin' there
Tryin' to catch the eye of someone to come save you
Just tell me you don't care
But I'm hoping that you care
Cause I'm looking for another life and it could be you
Oh, I'm looking for another love and it could be with you
Oh, I'm looking for another hope to live by
Looking for another reason to try
Looking for another life and it could be you
And it could be you
You can worry 'bout the future
You can worry 'bout the outcome
And the monster underneath my bed
Oh, everybody's got one
Coming out to get me
And it's coming out to get me
Just as poisonous as fear and doubt
Oh, I wish you could protect me
Cause over that hill is God knows whatever
We can tackle it together and then we'll be safe
Don't you want to be safe?
Oh, I'm looking for another life and it could be you
Oh, I'm looking for another love and it could be with you
Oh, I'm looking for another hope to live by
Looking for another reason to try
Looking for another life and it could be you
And it could be you
And over that hill is something much better
Than what we've ever known
It's a story we can tell, another story we can tell
Well I'm looking for another life and it could be you
Oh, I'm looking for another love and it could be you
Oh, I'm looking for another hope and it could be you
I'm looking for another reason I think it's you
Looking for another hope to live by
Looking for another reason to try
Looking for another love and it could be you
