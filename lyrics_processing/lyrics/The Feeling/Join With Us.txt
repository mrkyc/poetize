Coffee's cold, what a state
They've dragged you down
Fate's got you scraped
Worked to death
Can't you turn them words around?
Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose, my dear?
Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose, oh, oh?
The world is in your hands
The world is in your hands
The world belongs to those of us
Who still believe we can
And it matters what you do
Though they all look down on you
'Cos it's better that you've come from nothing
Than nothing comes from you

Count your pennies
Count your pounds
There's no way out
What will you do
When all love gives up on you?
Can't turn around
Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose, oh, oh?
