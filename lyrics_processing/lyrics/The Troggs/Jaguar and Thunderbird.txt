Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road, t'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford
Jaguar setting on ninety nine tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line
Not a half-a-mile from Ludenville, there had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill
It said : '35 miles, and stay in line' - but the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign
(Slow down, little Jaguar, keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford)
Ludenville was a real small town, had a hundred and two and nine acres of ground
Some stool pigeon but the sheriff wise told him : 'Park down in Ludenville and catch 'em guys'
Sheriff laid low, half hid in the weeds parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road said : 'Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford'
(Slow down, little Jaguar, keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford)
Sheriff doubled clutched, sink and put it in third, took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine if he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that line
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat but if he aimed to get 'em he'd have to do more than that
Crest of the hill, is about a mile behind there wasn't but two mor miles to the county line
(Slow down, little Jaguar, keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford)
Old Sheriff was countin' on the downward grade with the tall wind pushin', he had it made
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed and waved : 'Goodbye, Jaguar' - and pulled in the lead
Jaguar said 'You ain't won the race ye' - and pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind when the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line
