Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah
'Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath, he said
"You got get up, you got get up, you got get down, girl"
You know you drive me crazy, baby
You've got me turnin' to another man
Called you on the phone, no one's home
Baby, why you leave me all alone?
And if it wasn't for the music, I don't know what I'd do, yeah

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

You know I hopped into my car, didn't get very far, no
Before I had you on my mind, why be so unkind?
You've got your women all around, all around this town
But I was trapped in love with you and I didn't know what to do
But when I turned on my radio, I found out all I needed to know

Hey, listen up to your local DJ
You better hear what he's got to say
There's not a problem that I can't fix
''Cause I can do it in the mix
And if your man gives you trouble, just move out on a double
And you don't let it trouble your brain
'Cause away goes trouble down the drain
Said away goes trouble down the drain
Well, alright
Dub time

Last... night... a... D..J... saved... my... life...
There's not a problem that I can't fix
'Cause I can do it in the mix
'Cause I can do it in the mix
In the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix
In the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix
