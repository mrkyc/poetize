What's playing at the Roxy?
I'll tell you what's playing at the Roxy
A picture about a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi girl
That he sacrifices everything and moves all the way to Biloxi
That's what's playing at the Roxy

What's in, what's in the daily news?
I'll tell you what's in the daily news
Story, story about a guy who bought his wife a small ruby
With what otherwise would have been his union dues
That's what's in the daily news

What's happening all over?
I'll tell you what's happening all over
Guy sitting home by a television set
Who once used to be something of a rover

That's what's happening all over
Love is the thing that has licked 'em
And it looks like Nathan's another victim

When you see a guy reach for stars in the sky
You can bet that he's doing it for some doll
When you spot a John waiting out in the rain
Chances are he's insane as only a John can be for a Jane

When you meet a gent paying all kinds of rent
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal

Call it sad, call it funny
But it's better than even money
That the guy's only doing it for some doll

When you see a Joe saving half of his dough
You can bet there'll be mink in it for some doll

When a bum buys wine like a bum can't afford
It's a cinch that the bum
Is under the thumb of some little broad

When you meet a mug lately out of the jug
And he's still lifting platinum folderol
Call it hell, call it heaven
It's a probable twelve to seven
That the guy's only doing it for some doll, some doll, some doll.
The guy's only doing it for some doll.

Call it hell, call it heaven
It's a probable twelve to seven
That the guy's only doing it for some doll, some doll, some doll.
The guy's only doing it for some doll.
