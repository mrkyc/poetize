Lord, Mary took to running with a travelin' man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case, so broken hearted
She said, momma, I got to go, I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out of town, I'm tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches
It's just an ordinary story about the way things goes
'Round and around nobody knows
But the highway goes on forever
That old highway rolls on forever

Lord she never would've done it if she hadn't got drunk
If she hadn't started running with a traveling man
If she hadn't started taking those crazy chances
She said daughter, let me tell you about the traveling kind
Everywhere he's going such a very short time
He'll be long gone before you know it
He'll be long gone before you know it

She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight

This is down in the swampland where anything goes
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close
It's the real thing down in Louisiana
Now did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
Now the stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It ain't no time for lengthy speeches
There ain't no time for lengthy speeches

She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
She said never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight

It's just an ordinary story about the way things go
'Round and around nobody knows
But the highway goes on forever
