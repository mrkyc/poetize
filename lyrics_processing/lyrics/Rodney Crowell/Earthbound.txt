Tie my dreams up in a sack and lay my head down on the track and die die die
My life's been so sweet I just can't stand it
I must admit I've made out like a bandit
Last night's conversation with a real good friend of mine drinkin' wine wine wine
Said fifty years of livin' and your worst mistake's forgivin' just a time, time, time
One man's lust for life brings world reknown
And the next guy can't get two feet off the ground... he's earthbound
Earthbound... hear the wind throught the tops of the trees
Earthboound... summer sun nearly ninety degrees
Earthbound... big ol' moon sinking down... think I might stick around
I'm earthbound
I knew love once way back when she had almond eyes and olive skin
And long black hair
She was Irish Spanish mix breed I was southeast Texas hayseed
We were almost there
Her Daddy did not like my kind around
And true love took the next train out of town... earthbound
Earthbound... where there's fathers and daughters in pain
Earthbound... mama's boy walking home in the rain
Earthbound... like a ship run aground think I might stick around
I'm earthbound

Someday I'll be leavin' but I just can't help believing that it's not today, hey
Every golden moment I have found
I've done my best to run right in the ground... earthbound
Earthbound... see the sky big and beautiful blue
Earthbound... fallen angels come callin' to you
Earthbound... keepin' close to the ground, think I might stick around
Earthbound... Tom Waits, Aretha Franklin, Mary Karr
Earthbound... Walter Kronkite, Seamus Heaney, Ringo Starr
Earthbound... The Dalai Lahma and Charlie Brown make me wanna stick around
