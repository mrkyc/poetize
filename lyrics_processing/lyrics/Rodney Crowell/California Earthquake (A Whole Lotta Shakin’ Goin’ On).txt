There was a California earthquake in the year of '83
It shook the living daylights out of the Owens County Seat
There weren't a building still left standing when the dust had cleared away
Just a rumble in the distance all the way to San Andrea

Sherman Buck was driving his old mule on into town
When the big 'un came and shook so hard that it knocked him to the ground
Lord, there opened up a hole so big that he knew his time was up
Lord, it swallowed up that poor old mule and it just missed Sherman Buck

California earthquake you just don't know what you've done
We might fall off in the ocean, Lord you'll never make us run
You're a partner of the devil, Lord we ain't afraid of him
We'll build ourselves another town so you can tear it down again


Then came the quake of '99 that levelled Mission Creek
The earth was like an ocean churning waves of twenty feet
Lord it sounded like a thousand trains were screaming underground
Clean across to San Joachim they heard that mournful sound
You might also like
California earthquake you just don't know what you've done
We might fall off in the ocean, Lord you'll never make us run
You're a partner of the devil, Lord we ain't afraid of him
We'll build ourselves another town so you can tear it down again

Then there came one day a holocaust, Lord and it rocked the Frisco Bay
Miles of walls came a-tumblin' down, just like Jericho on that day
Might near everything the earthquake missed, a holy fire consumed
Just left 'em holding smoke and ashes, what's a dream that can't be ruined

California earthquake you just don't know what you've done
We might fall off in the ocean, Lord you'll never make us run
You're a partner of the devil, Lord we ain't afraid of him
