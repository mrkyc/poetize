Brought up on the Bayou
Bustin' at the seams
She moves me
She says I move her too
Once we get it started
Ain't nothing we won't do
Baby when she roll me
Fever on the Bayou
When she gets a hold me
Much oh, me oh, my oh
Louisiana moon glow
Way up in the sky oh
I love to see her comin'
Hate to see her go
Creole belle, dancing in the rain
I love to hear her laughter
I love to hear her sing
I've got money, I've got lots of time
She makes me feel so horny
When she spends my dime
Baby when she roll me
Fever on the Bayou
When she gets a hold me
Much oh, me oh, my oh
Louisiana moon glow
Way up in the sky oh
I love to see her comin'
Hate to see her go

On the pontchartrain
And ever since she hit it
Things just ain't the same
Elle est mon cher, ma files d'amant
Je ne parle franglais, je suis son bon vivant
Reville au tois avec l'amour
I round the kitchen table
And on the cabin floor
Baby when she roll me
Fever on the Bayou
When she gets a hold me
Much oh, me oh, my oh
Louisiana moon glow
Way up in the sky oh
I love to see her comin'
Hate to see her go
Baby when she roll me
Fever on the Bayou
When she get a hold me
Much oh, me oh, my oh
Louisiana moon glow
Way up in the sky oh
I love to see her comin'
I hate to see her go
Baby when she roll me
(Fever on the Bayou)
When she gets a hold me
(Much oh, me oh, my oh)
Louisiana moon glow
(Way up in the sky oh)
I love to see her comin'
