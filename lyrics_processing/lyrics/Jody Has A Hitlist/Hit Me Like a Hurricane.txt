But I can't stand her when I'm not
She wanted to meet up to talk things over
She told me when and where, but I forgot
I'm always messing up, that's self confessed
I'm a liability at best
And whenever I'm around her, I can't stop slipping up
But that's how it goes
It's the way it's always been
Just one of those nights
When all the wrong things seem alright to me
She hit me like a hurricane and I can barely breathe
She came walking up to me
That look can only mean one thing
I swore I never would go back again
But when she says "Jump!", I say "How high?"
There's no time to stop and question why we're here again
I'm gone, I'm hooked, she's trouble
When things start to get unclear
It always seems like a good idea
And I'm just kind of annoyed that
I can't seem to avoid it
I'm always messing up, that's self confessed
I'm a liability at best
And whenever I'm around her, I can't stop slipping up
But that's how it goes
It's the way it's always been
Just one of those nights
When all the wrong things seem alright to me
She hit me like a hurricane and I can barely breathe
She came walking up to me
That look can only mean one thing
I swore I never would go back again
But when she says "Jump!", I say "How high?"
There's no time to stop and question why we're here again
I'm gone, I'm hooked, she's trouble
Empty bottles lead to empty words
Every promise made is insincere and slurred
(I see right through her, but she gets me everytime)
(I see right through her, but she gets me everytime)
Empty bottles lead to empty words
Every promise made is insincere and slurred
(I see right through her, but she gets me everytime)
(I see right through her, but she gets me everytime)
And every night should be a lesson learned
I play with fire but never seem to get burned
(I see right through her, but she gets me everytime)
