Dearly depressed and broken hearted
I'd like to let you know that boys cry too
Don't let them tell you how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you

Are you free or are you in sorrow?
Are you free or are you being borrowed?

How do you feel?
What's your condition?
You are alive but are you living?
Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen
Are you complete or is something missing?
So tell me
Do your hands shake?
Does your heart break?
When the earth quakes
Whatever it is
Whatever it isn't
Make sure that it's real
Oh, now, how do you feel?

To all the dearly depressed and broken hearted
The in-betweens and all the torn ones too
You're not alone in how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you

Being borrowed

How do you feel?
What's your condition?
You are alive but are you living?
Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen
Are you complete or is something missing?
So tell me
Do your hands shake?
Does your heart break?
When the earth quakes
Whatever it is
Whatever it isn't
Make sure that it's real
Oh, now, how do you feel?

How do you feel?
Do your hands shake?

So tell me
Do your hands shake?

When the earth quakes

Make sure that it's real, real, real
Now, how do you feel?
