Blame, blame, blame

Adderall and television, play it like a politician
You can't stop the twitching in your eye, right?
Artificial altruism, looking for a fuss to give and
All you want is just another couple hundred likes

It's easier if I'm to blame
Yeah, it's easier if I'm to blame
It's easier if I'm to blame

It's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything
For every single memory in your brain
We both got stories, but they're not the same
So make believe, eventually you can forget my name
But it's easier if I'm the one you blame

We both got stories, but they're not the same

Alcohol and ammunition, melancholic disposition
Add it to the story in your mind, right?
Know-it-alls, they never listen, God forbid a poor decision
Now I know why I still regret you
Aerosol and tunnel vision, prerecorded mannerisms
Couldn't stop the twitching in my eye
I disregard the pessimism, disappoint the algorithm
All we want is just another couple hundred likes

It's easier if I'm to blame
Yeah, it's easier to numb the pain
It's easier if I'm to blame

It's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything
For every single memory in your brain
We both got stories, but they're not the same
So make believe, eventually you can forget my name
But it's easier if I'm the one you blame

(If I could take it all back, I wouldn't take it all back now)
We both got stories, but they're not the same
(If I could take it all back, I wouldn't take it all back now)
Blame, blame, blame

Try to save some face, I can't say I blame you now
(Adderall and television, play it like a politician)
Bless your selfish ways, only you can save you now
(Alcohol and ammunition)
I won't hold it against you
Won't hold it against you
(It's easier to blame)
I won't hold it against you
Won't hold it against you
'Cause it's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything
For every single memory in your brain
We both got stories, but they're not the same
So make believe eventually you can forget my name
But it's easier if I'm the one you blame

Blame it all on me (Oh-woah-oh)
Blame, blame, blame
If I could take it all back
I wouldn't take it all back now (Oh-woah-oh)
