In the backseat of the taxi
When you told me we were only
Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
And in the backseat when you asked me
"Is the sadness everlasting?"
I pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"Love, I think it is"

And it creeps on in
To the corners of yourself
Yeah, it creeps on in
Until it hurts like hell

And you know I never knew how much I was getting into
No, I never knew how much I was getting into

In the backseat of the taxi
When you told me we were only
Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
And in the backseat when you asked me
"Is the sadness everlasting?"
I pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"Love, I think it is"
