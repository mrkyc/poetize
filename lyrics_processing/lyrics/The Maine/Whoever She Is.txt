I thought I had my girl but she ran away
My car got stolen and I'm gonna be late
For work this week, make that the fourth day straight
But I'm fine with it
(You don't have to worry)
I thought I had it all but I gave it away
I quit that old job now I'm doing okay
Those material things they can't get in my way
Cause I'm over it

But whatever she may be
She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One thing's for sure, you don't have to worry

And this is the part where you find out who you are
And these are your friends, those who've been there from the start
So to hell with the bad news
Dirt on your new shoes
It rained all of May 'til the month of June

But whatever she may be
She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One thing's for sure, you don't have to worry

And every day in every way oh she will look the same
And every care you used to have just seems to float away
And every day in every way oh she will look the same
And every care you used to have just seems to float away
To hell with your new shit
And whether or not you think you fit in

But whatever she may be
She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One thing's for sure, you don't have to worry

She could be rainy days, minimum wage
A book that ends with no last page
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
