Sophisticated mood swings
Manipulated day dreams

We've got champagne taste
But not enough money for the real thing
We've got flames in our veins
And just enough money for the weekend

Last night I did things my mother told me not to
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs

Debilitated feelings sprawled across the bed
She's spinning perfect blue buildings
While I'm counting crows inside my head

We've got champagne taste
But not enough money for the real thing
We've got flames in our veins
And just enough money for the weekend

Last night I did things my mother told me not to
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs

Let the waves of strange fall down
Let them crash and drift around

Last night I did things my mother told me not to step
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs ( you love, love)
Felt just like love and drugs
Felt just like love and drugs
