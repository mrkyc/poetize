Feel the moment all around you
And the quiet that surrounds you
The time you have is sacred
Don't wait around and waste it
They can't take that away from you
Everything is temporary
Even the sorrow that you carry
So tell me are you okay?
You say you are okay
I'm okay now I'm with you

'Cause you don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
So when fate cries, you listen
And flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be

It was summer when you told me
That you loved me by the oak creek
My ears had never heard that
Tongue forgot the words and
Feet forgot the Earth, it's true

'Cause you don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
So when fate cries, you listen
And flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be

You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
Yeah, and karma is calling over and over
You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
So when fate cries, you listen
And flowers on the grave of the child that I used to be
