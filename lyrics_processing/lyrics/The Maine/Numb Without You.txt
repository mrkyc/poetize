Let's get this straight, you are
A panic in the bloodstream
Yet you bring me peace, you are
A stutter in the heart
That beats inside of me

You are my last, you are my first
You kill me for the better
(You) You are the rising tide
You're every fuckin' thing inside me now

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you
You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you
I am so numb without you

Let's get this straight, you are
A fever in the cold
Yet I'm not shivering, you are
A shudder in the voice
That screams inside of me

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you
I won't leave, no, I won't surrender

You are my glitter and my gloom

Without you, without you
I'm numb without you
Without you, without you
I'm numb without you
Without you, without you
