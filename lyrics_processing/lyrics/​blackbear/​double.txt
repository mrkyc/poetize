Uh

Sign it over, I could give you double, baby
Bend it over, I'm gon' hit it double, baby
Spend it all, I'ma make it back double
What's he doing for you? Nothing
Nothing but trouble, baby
Burning rubber
I got a brand new foreign
I don't drive it that much, I'm touring
Every time that I shoot, I'm scoring, baby
What's he mean to you?
What's he really mean to you?
I don't give a fuck, girl
Come and swoop you up, baby (Yeah)

I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait? Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up? (Yeah)

I know you don't wanna be that girl that's fucking "what's his face?"
"Or what's that shit I think I saw him in?"
He ain't gonna rock with ya, talk with ya all the time like I do
I could give you anything that you like, babe
You might also like
Seeing double, I been drinking double, baby
Seeing colors, feel like I'm hallucinating
Doing numbers, every show is sold out
Labels still calling, I started balling
We turn 'em all the fuck down
Turn on the hot tub, skinny dipping, bubbles, baby
Set the mood right, I ain't really clubbing lately
Know you wrapped up in the wrong relationship
You read each other's texts and shit
I'd rather read your body language

I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
(It's never coming, ooh, it's never coming, girl)
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait?
Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up?
I could change your whole damn life in a day
Why would you wait on a train that's never coming, girl?
(On a train that's never coming, girl)
I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait?
Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up? (Yeah)
I know you don't wanna be that girl that's fucking "what's his face?"
"Or what's that shit I think I saw him in?"
He ain't gonna rock with ya, talk with ya all the time like I do
I could give you anything that you like, babe

I could give you double, baby
Why would you wait? Why would you wait on a man that's never growing up?
I could give you double, baby
