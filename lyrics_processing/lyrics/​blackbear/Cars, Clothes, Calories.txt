She only wants the dress inside the magazine
She thinks that ever after she'll be livin' happily
And this sudden curiosity you have for me
Showed me somethin' 'bout your personality
Ooh, and these cars and clothes and calories
To her, it's just an everyday reality
So what is you want, girl?
What is it you want out of me?

'Cause maybe it's the SoCo
Maybe it's the Hennessy
Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories (Yeah)
All these, cars and clothes and calories, yeah

She only wants to fuck my ego
We all know everything there is to know about a gold digger
As the pile of money gets bigger, all the girls get richer (Hey)
Sip, sippin' on Conjure like Luda'
Have her feeling sweet like sugar, lick it off your body
Dip it low, I'll give you what you want
You can be my Christina Milian from 2004
I hope that was okay, yeah?
I ain't playin', I'm for real
Uh, yuh
I wanna make a request, I wanna feel blessed
I wanna get you out of that dress
It's all about the way that you move
To make a man wanna spend it on you
Work hard, play hard, that's what you do
And baby love, Miss Independent
Could do it on her own, but she feels like a princess
That's alright, 'cause she takes the crown
Yeah, when she, uh
You might also like
'Cause maybe it's the SoCo
Maybe it's the Hennessy
Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories
