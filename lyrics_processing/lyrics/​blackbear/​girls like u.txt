Give me your forever, or at least just for a while
Give me never-ending, or at least give me a mile
Give me happiness, or at least give me a smile
Give me forever for a while, give me forever for a while
Quit actin' like a baby, or at least less like a child
Give me serenity, or at least just peace of mind
Give me closure, or at least a phone call
Give me forever for a while, give me forever for a while, ayy

Swear to God I'm a sinner in a church, burnin' up for you
Swear to God she's a blessing and a curse, shoulda learned from you
Swear to God I'm a sinner in a church, burnin' up in flames
Swear to God, shoulda learned, shoulda learned
To never, never, never

Fuck with, fuck with

Fuck with, fuck with
