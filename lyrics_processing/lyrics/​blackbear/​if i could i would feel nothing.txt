Yeah
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, yeah
Hey

If I could I would feel nothing, that's the truth and I don't care
Mix prescriptions with prescriptions, it's not right but life's not fair
Ridin' next to me in droptop, wearin' croptop, that's bad, bitch
All designer when we go out just so people know we rich
Underneath it all, the truth is that I really feel like shit
I'm so sick of being tired, I'm so tired of being sick
I ain't never killed nobody, I ain't never sold a brick
Got some OGs that once told me keep my nose clean but I sniff

'Cause if I could I would feel nothing
That's the truth and I don't care, baby
That's the truth and I don't care
Mix the Henny with these pills
The world is cold and life's not fair, baby
The world is cold and life's not fair

So let's just fuck, no strings attached
Let's just fuck and after that, I'ma take you home
And you won't call me on the phone
It's all good, I wanted that
It's all good, I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached, girl
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Yeah

February, weather's scary, I need notes on how to live
Call my mama, always drama, she need money for them kids
Another tour, another war, I sold my soul, I hit a lick
If I die and go to hell, I swear to God, I'm gon' be pissed
I've been prayin', I'm just sayin', keep my hands clean off that sin
I've been prayin' layin' in a bed I fucked a hundred in
I've been prayin' they won't find me laying somewhere in a ditch
Got some best friends that I lost 'cause shit I did when I was lit

'Cause if I could I would feel nothing
That's the truth and I don't care, baby
That's the truth and I don't care
Mixed prescriptions, bad decisions
World is cold and life's not fair, baby
World is cold and life's not fair

I'm gon' make you fall for me
You'll never get a call from me
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached, girl
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached
