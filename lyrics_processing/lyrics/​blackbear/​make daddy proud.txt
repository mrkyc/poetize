What is it with you?
You never sleep alone, girl, you won't listen to me
Won't listen to your home girls
You don't need a man
You say that shit but I see right through, right through
What is it with you?
Constantly fighting me and lying to me, tryin' me
One of these days I'll be gone
What is it with you?
You haven't been the same since you got a new man, changed your hair

Started spending all of his money
Tell me how'd you get so codependent, girl
All of his money (All of his money)
Justify your independence, girl
Tell me how do you cope with it?
How do you sleep with yourself at night?
How do you cope with it?
How do you sleep with yourself at night?

Proud of you, proud of you
Go 'head girl, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money
Proud of you, proud of you
Go shawty, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money, yeah

Tell me what is it with you
Everything disposable
You don't listen to Deadroses
It's Trapsoul and Views now
You never come and see me no more
You never hit me back
Scared to make your daddy mad, that's for sure
You never came to the crib to get your Jimmy Choo's

Started spending of all his money
Tell me how'd you get so codependent, girl
All of his money (All of his money)
Justify your independence, girl
Tell me how do you cope with it?
How do you sleep with yourself at night?
How do you cope with it?
How do you sleep with yourself at night?

Proud of you, proud of you
Go 'head girl, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money
Proud of you, proud of you
Go shawty, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money
Proud of you, proud of you
Go 'head girl, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money
Proud of you, proud of you
Go shawty, make daddy proud of you
Spending his money
