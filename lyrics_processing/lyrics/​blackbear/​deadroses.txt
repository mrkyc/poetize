I'm not okay
With the distance that's been growin'
Girl, I'm not okay
I love you, never show it
And I'm not afraid
Of the future, what it's holdin'
Girl, I'm not afraid
Let me shut my eyes, I'm zonin'

Turn the radio down and lay you down too
I could be the one for you
Turn the radio down and lay you down too
I could be the one for you

I know we're not in love
Love is vivid
No we're not in love
You fall right in it for a week, a month, or maybe just a minute or a lifetime
What's the difference?
Big bang or collision, love is blind

We had a vision though
Now we dead roses
We had a vision though
Now we dead roses

MAN: Now, why did she send them? These broken down, wilted, beat up, rotten-looking flowers
