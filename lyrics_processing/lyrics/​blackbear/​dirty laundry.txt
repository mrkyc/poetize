My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry
And I think that she knows, I'm out of control
With all of this money, they all want something from me
It's starting to show, I'm out of control

Man, I can't see shit in the spotlight
She found receipts from the last night
In the back of my jeans, keep it real, right?
I just wanna fuckin' feel right
Work long all day 'til the nighttime
She wants to know what's the deal like
I think that she knows, can't keep sealed tight
I'm doin' all these things that you won't like
Girls with cocaine on they backsides, I know
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, let's go

My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry
And I think that she knows, I'm out of control
With all of this money, they all want something from me
It's starting to show, I'm out of control

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, I know
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
My girl don't want me, nah
Oh, I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more
Oh, I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more
Oh yeah, yeah
(I can't hide it no more) Oh
I can't hide it no more
