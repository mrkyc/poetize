Yeah
Waaaaaaa
Uh-huh

She say that she a wanderlust, but she ain't seen the world
So much to do at 21, you feel invincible
So hard to find someone to trust, she still her daddy's girl
She wanna be an actress and a singer like Selena
And she a movie buff, but she ain't seen Breakfast at Tiffany's
Or Breakfast Club, that shit's before her time
So hard to keep a conversation, when your mind's on vacation
You got pretty green eyes, I can see them dollar signs, girl
Oh yeah
I heard that you addicted to them Xans now, girl
Go 'head with your sleepy ass
Go 'head, go 'head

Shawty, give me a reason, you know that I'm leavin'
Give me one reason, you know that I'm leavin'
I know how to please you, Hennessy in the freezer
It's all at your leisure, baby, I...

But she ain't never seen the world, though
But she ain't never seen the, never seen the world, though
She wanna be my girl, though
She a wanderlust, wanderlust
She ain't never seen the world though
She a wanderlust, wanderlust
She wanna be my girl, though

Yeah, she say that she a wanderlust, that's what her bio say
She shake it for the Instagram, and the Twitter page
On YouTube she's a make-up artist, Hollywood apartment
She's a bartender and a part-time model
All her friends are verified, wow, man, that's so cool, wow
Girl, can we hang out?
Let's take a thousand pictures like a hypebeast now
People sayin' that we're goals
That's all I ever wanted, fuck the haters, fuck the trolls
Oh yeah, I heard that you're a wanderlust, girl where'd you go?
Go 'head with your travelin' ass
Go 'head 'round the world now

Give me a reason, you know that I'm leavin'
Give me one reason, you know that I'm leavin', babe
I know how to please you, Hennessy in the freezer
It's all at your leisure, baby, I...

She a wanderlust, wanderlust
She ain't never seen the world, though
She a wanderlust, wanderlust
She wanna be my girl, though

She ain't never seen the world, though

She wanna be my girl, though
Ohhhhh-ohhhhh yeah, oh-oh-oh
