Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

I spent another night alone again
Woke up in the coldest, coldest bed
I ran into God at the liquor store
She asked me what I'm always running for

I gotta get out, I gotta get with it
I got too much doubt and I don't know my limits

But I could deny and I could just lie
But I'm forthcoming to you
I'm telling the truth, I cheated on you
And it didn't feel good, promised I'd change
But you see right through (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking flights to see these other girls
I swear I'm gonna change (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking drugs and feeling bad
I swear to God, I'm gonna change

I've been so depressed, can't leave my couch
It's all good, it's not like you're checking up on me
You ripped out the best part of my heart and let it bleed
It's all my fucking fault; I can't blame anyone but me
You might also like
And I gotta get out, I gotta get with it
I got too much doubt and I don't know my limits

But I could deny and I could just lie
But I'm forthcoming to you
I'm telling the truth, I cheated on you
And it didn't feel good, promised I'd change
But you see right through (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking flights to see these other girls
I swear I'm gonna change (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking drugs and feeling bad
I swear to God, I'm gonna change
I'm sick of taking flights to see these other girls
I swear I'm gonna change (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking drugs and feeling bad
I swear to God, I'm gonna change

I spent another night alone again
Woke up in the coldest, coldest bed
I ran into God at the liquor store
