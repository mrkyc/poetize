Uh

I give 'em love and they run away
Fly to Paris, don't wanna stay
All she wanted was caviar
All I got was her time of day
Wanna take you out, wanna show you off
Wanna buy you things, wanna get you off
Oh girl, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna put your name in outer space
When we on a plane to another place
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

And now I got a taste of my own medicine
All this shit that I do to women
It may be crazy, we all suckers for somethin'
We all suckers for somethin', yeah
And now I got a taste of my own medicine
All this shit that I do to women
It may be crazy, we all suckers for somethin'
We all suckers for somethin', oh
And if you feel the way I feel, you might fuck up and send a text
But put your phone down, baby, give that shit a rest
Oh God, you don't need that
We all suckers for somethin', best believe that
You might also like
And I wanna tell you every night and day
The feelings come, the feelings stay
But you came around, I wrote you off
And I'm slippin' up and I'm playin' games
She wanna interrupt, wanna cut me off
Wanna make me feel like hella small
Oh God, that shit ain't cute
She wanna stay out late, party in the Hills
Rub it in my face, made me feel my feels
Alright, I guess I got it bad

And now I got a taste of my own medicine
All this shit that I do to women
It may be crazy, we all suckers for somethin'
We all suckers for somethin', yeah
And now I got a taste of my own medicine
All this shit that I do to women
It may be crazy, we all suckers for somethin'
We all suckers for somethin', oh
And if you feel the way I feel, you might fuck up and send a text
But put your phone down, baby, give that shit a rest
Oh God, you don't need that
