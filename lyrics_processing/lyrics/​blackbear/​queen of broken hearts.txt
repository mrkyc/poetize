I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

Yeah, you need to chill, girl, don't play me
I'm too far gone, you can't save me
And I don't care, fucking hate me
I popped a pill and I'm fading
Take anything, make it about me
It's a heavy crown, it might drown me
I know it sucks bein' around me
So does life, don't at me, don't doubt me

I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

I'm the queen of broken hearts
Left you with a thousand scars

Block my posts and my story
I'm sorry, I can be annoying
I go ghost without warning
Popped a pill, now I'm snoring
Material girl, you can't afford me
This conversation got boring
You're so 2000 before me
You're in the past, you're yesterday morning

Tell me, tell me I'm the worst
Make you cry and make you hurt
I'm the queen, bow down to me
I will leave you out to bleed
