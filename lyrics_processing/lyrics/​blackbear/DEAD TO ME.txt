La-da-da-da-da, yeah, uh

Dead to me
Even if you're still alive
It's a mess to me, so rest in peace
You're dead to me
Left me here with nothing, took the best of me
Left my destiny

Six feet under the ground, you turned it around on me
And left me with the cold pillow on your side
No phone call, didn't write
Wrong place, wrong time, let it die
Told my friends wouldn't let it get to me
Now it's pressin' on me
When I open my phone
Go to camera roll, scroll, scroll, scroll

Somebody that I used to know is dead to me
Think less of me, you're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you
I'm through with you
You're dead to me, and I'm dead to you
You might also like
You're dead to me, and I'm still alive
Now we're enemies, let me rest in peace
You're dead to me
Got me sick to my stomach, you got the best of me
Let your text turn green

I'm six feet under the ground, you turned it around on me
Had me thinking that I never really tried
If you told me that you loved me, then you lied
Wrong place, wrong guy, let it die
Told my friends wouldn't let it get to me
Now I see you in my dreams
And the pills won't work
You hate me I'm the worst
It hurt, hurt, hurt

Somebody that I used to love is dead to me
Think less of me, you're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you
I'm through with you, you're dead to me
And I'm dead to you
You're dead to me, think less of me
You're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you
I'm through with you, you're dead to me
And I'm dead to you
You're dead to me
I'm dead to you, you're dead to me, I'm dead to you (Dead)
You're dead to me, and I'm still alive
