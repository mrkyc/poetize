Oh, oh, ayy

I would know exactly how you felt but we don't talk now
Used to hold you naked in my arms, I know you're gone now
Everything was right and now it's wrong now
It's how I'm feeling, on God now, yeah
Post another snap, you thinkin' you a big star now
Look at who I follow just to stalk now, quit playing 'round
You a Klondike, you'd do anything for a bar now
Seen you 'round the world, you make the distance seem far now

Oh, oh, oh-oh, I'll leave you alone
Make me wanna go, oh, oh-oh
Make me wanna leave my hometown

Away from Hollywood girls in the valley
I know that all them tweets you posting is about me
I gotta go, oh, oh-oh
I'll stay out of Cali for a while (Cali for a while)
Yeah, I'll stay out of Cali for you now
I'll stay out of Cali for a while
You might also like
Every shorty think they too cool for you, but you get used to it
That's just how it is in California (in California)
Swear they love it when you act like you don't want 'em
They all plotting on the check and they know who got up next
If it ain't 'bout money then they can't do nothing for ya (Can't do nothing for ya)
They gonna take what they can give regardless
She just want herself a little rich nigga with a little hood in him
Someone that she know won't ever put up with the bullshit
Someone she can get drunk and get high and be no good with
Someone who see through her without looking

No, I ain't got no time for these hoes
And I might lose my mind if I don't go
Get some piece of mind

Away from Hollywood girls in the valley
I know that all them tweets you posting is about me
I gotta go, oh, oh-oh
I'll stay out of Cali for a while, yeah
I'll stay out of Cali for you now (Oh)
I'll stay out of Cali for a while
