Are we gonna blaze this weed (yes, we are)
We gonna take these shots (close down the bar)
Tonight I'm with my friends, and this is never gonna end
Are we gonna meet some hunnies (that's the plan)
We're gonna rock their bodies (all night long)
Everybody's feeling good, and the night has just begun

Beach babes in bikinis in the sand
Taking off their tops to get their tan
I don't need sunshine 'cause I'm always on vacation
Skateboards through the Boardwalk liquor store
6 pack in the backpack, out the door
Now I'm just short of public intoxication

Got caught with open container
Please don't lock me up, 'cause I got plans to get fucked up

Are we gonna blaze this weed (yes, we are)
We gonna take these shots (close down the bar)
Tonight I'm with my friends, and this is never gonna end
Are we gonna meet some hunnies (that's the plan)
We're gonna rock their bodies (all night long)
Everybody's feeling good, and the night has just begun
You might also like
Waist-deep in the pool, shotgunnin' beers
Feels like everybody in the town is here
Still fall Skanking on my favorite reggae station
Party people gettin' down on a Friday
Making memories that they can share one day
We all need a little break from Monday
No expectations

It's just a simple no-brainer, oh
You should take a moment and do something for yourself

Are we gonna blaze this weed (yes, we are)
We gonna take these shots (close down the bar)
Tonight I'm with my friends, and this is never gonna end
Are we gonna meet some hunnies (that's the plan)
We're gonna rock their bodies (all night long)
Everybody's feeling good, and the night has just begun

Say yes, not no, never maybe
'Cause if you toll that  sometimes, you might go crazy
You can leave it on the floor, where it can't bother you no more
It's knocking at your door, oh yeah
It's just a simple no-brainer, oh
You should take a moment and do something for yourself

Are we gonna blaze this weed (yes, we are)
We gonna take these shots (close down the bar)
Tonight I'm with my friends, and this is never gonna end
Are we gonna meet some hunnies (that's the plan)
We're gonna rock their bodies (all night long)
