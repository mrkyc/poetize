Woah, I was so nervous
Tell me now how I felt about her, under the surface
Yeah, I was a mess, writing love letters, now I never
I just had to confess
But she turned me down, so I went back underground
Now she's hearing all my songs on the radio, calling me up
Too bad honey, I got someone who believes

She wants love, but I won't give her none
I opened up my heart to another someone
She wants love and now she's begging me to stay
She had her chance before, but I'm the one that got away
Don't come around here, god damn you made it clear
You won't be here for a long time, and I'm sorry baby
I'm over my crush on you (over my crush on you)

Back in the day, wished we were lovers
I couldn't help but feel that we were perfect for each other
You let me in your room, everything was in color
But then you never let me under the covers

Now you're blowing up my phone, 'cause you heard I'm all that
Remember when I couldn't get a call back
My girl is looking at you like you need to fall back
I'm sorry, I ain't no fool, oh
You might also like
She wants love, but I won't give her none
I opened up my heart to another someone
She wants love and now she's begging me to stay
She had her chance before, but I'm the one that got away
Don't come around here, god damn you made it clear
You won't be here for a long time, and I'm sorry baby
I'm over my crush on you (over my crush on you)

You give the essence to the echelon, higher than the rest of 'em
Tried to make it clear, yes I swear
That's the best upon
Clutched to my chest, you pull me closely
Your tears are fucking up my shit just like a nose bleed
Yeah, that's it, I'm off it, it's awful
Last nail in the coffin, lock it
All your care about  it, like a brothel, your  is watching
Every day you be running away
Came for the game, now you don't wanna play
Not insane, but I feel that way every time that you lay in bed, it's great

She wants love, but I won't give her none
I opened up my heart to another someone
She wants love and now she's begging me to stay
She had her chance before, but I'm the one that got away
Don't come around here, god damn you made it clear
You won't be here for a long time, and I'm sorry baby
