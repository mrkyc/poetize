Well, I could drink about you all my life
Layin' around is how I'm spending my nights, oh
Stalking pictures of you when your out with your crew
Someday soon I hope I might get it right, oh

We had a good thing, you made my heart sing
But I'm a fool 'cause I was only a tool
Eyes burn like fire, 'cause your a liar
You said you loved me but you love to destroy

These days I'll never know if I've ever stopped fallin'

Well, I could drink about you all my life
Layin' around is how I'm spending my nights, oh
Stalking pictures of you when your out with your crew
Someday soon I hope I might get it right, oh

Derail this love train, you make me insane
With candy-coated thoughts of you on my brain
I'm such a loser, I can't see through her
Drowning in booze 'cause I just can't stand the pain
You might also like
These days I'll never know if I've ever stopped fallin'

Well, I could drink about you all my life
Layin' around is how I'm spending my nights, oh
Stalking pictures of you when your out with your crew
Someday soon I hope I might get it right, oh

Why, oh why
Why you gotta do me like that, I was high, so high
You were the girl of my dreams, now all I do is get wasted

These days I'll never know if I've ever stopped fallin'

Well, I could drink about you all my life (all of my life)
Layin' around is how I'm spending my nights, oh (spending my nights)
Stalking pictures of you when your out with your crew
Someday soon I hope I might get it right, oh (might get it right)
I could drink about you all my life (all of my life)
Layin' around is how I'm spending my nights, oh
Stalking pictures of you when your out with your crew (out with your crew)
