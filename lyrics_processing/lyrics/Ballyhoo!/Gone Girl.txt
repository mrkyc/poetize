And you were dressed like a rock star
Droppin' all your best lines on me
We were makin' some noise
You fell in love with my voice
You said that you would do anything
We started shootin' some whiskey
And that's when you kissed me
Said you wanna be with me
We exited quickly
I never saw this comin'
I'm fallin' for you
And now you're nowhere to be found
You gotta let me know, oh-oh-oh-oh
If you're really the one for me
Baby, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanted to be your fantasy
Darlin', woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is how I feel when you'er next to me
Baby, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're such a beautiful mystery
So now you're a stranger
Maybe you'er a player
Or maybe I'm just paranoid
It's been a couple of months
And I don't see you
Feels like we're stuck in a void

You're gone for the weekend
I wonder if you think about me
I think I'm really gettin' out of control
You gotta let me know, oh-oh-oh-oh
If you're really the one for me
Baby, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanted to be your fantasy
Darlin', woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is how I feel when you'er next to me
Baby, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're such a beautiful mystery
I'm askin' all my friends and they think I'm dumb
So many other girls but I just saw one
Now I met someone new and she always comes through
When she whispers she wants to be mine
You gotta let me know, oh-oh-oh-oh
If you're really the one for me
Baby, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanted to be your fantasy
Darlin', woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is how I feel when you'er next to me
Baby, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're such a beautiful mystery
You gotta let me know, oh-oh-oh-oh
If you're really the one for me
Baby, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanted to be your fantasy
Darlin', woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is how I feel when you'er next to me
Baby, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
