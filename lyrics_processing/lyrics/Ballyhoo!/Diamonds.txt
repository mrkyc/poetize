Looking in the wrong direction
To get what I missing
I had a vision of perfection
We all know how it goes you can't be greedy when it comes to love
Gotta take the good with the bad she's the best you ever had
There's no question if she's good enough
You really get me started
You know you have the softest touch
I want you all the time
She's just an ordinary girl
She's all I ever wanted
I saw forever in her eyes
She's just an ordinary girl
I thought I'd never find her
She was a diamond in disguise
I've been to every major city cross the country in a van
And wonder if there's such a woman for a nice romantic man
A hopeless romantic on the verge of something great
What does it take to make a friendship last with so much give and take
She's got to know that I'm in love with her and everything she is
It's like... be somewhere the warming of her kiss
... shot an arrow through her heart
I got someone who understands my passion right from the start
You really get me started
You know you have the softest touch
I want you all the time
She's just an ordinary girl
She's all I ever wanted
I saw forever in her eyes
She's just an ordinary girl
I thought I'd never find her
She was a diamond in disguise
The way that the fire burns like nothing I felt before
It's funny how things have turned I just evened out the score
You really get me started
You know you have the softest touch
I want you all the time
She's just an ordinary girl
She's all I ever wanted
I saw forever in her eyes
She's just an ordinary girl
I thought I'd never find her
