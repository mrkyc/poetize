Punch out the walls of insecurity
Make up and stand and say that I'll be fine
I spread these kinds of rumors all the time
My barricade is like a prison fence
The way I'm feeling when I smile
They really make no sense
Lights in my room just like a starry night
And that's the way that it goes
That's just the way that it goes
When there's nobody around you
No one will profound you
Just leave me alone
Don't leave me by myself
I see no friends
Only strangers
That don't know my danger
I drink my coffee from a paper cup
It doesn't keep my hands warm enough
Making some plans so I had something to break
Look in a line so I had something to fake
There's no protection when the demons come
I hear them screaming pound on my eardrums
This house is haunted now but nobody knows
That's just the way that it goes
That's just the way that it goes
When there's nobody around you
No one will profound you
Just leave me alone
Don't leave me by myself
I see no friends
Only strangers
That don't know my danger (Oh, Ohh)
Tell me this is a dream
Give me the weightlessness I need
I'm floating around this room now
Escaping the memory stampede
I think I can see my mother
Living without her has made me weak
I'm fighting a losing battle
I am a game of hide and seek
When there's nobody around you
No one will profound you
Just leave me alone
Don't leave me by myself
I see no friends
Only strangers
That don't know my danger
When there's nobody around you
No one will profound you
Just leave me alone
Don't leave me by myself
I see no friends
Only strangers
That don't know my danger (Ohh, Woah ohh)
