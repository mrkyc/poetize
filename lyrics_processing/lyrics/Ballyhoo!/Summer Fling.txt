I just want to take you to the beach
Makin' love 'til the sun goes down
No worries, we'll be so far out of reach
In the night, so let's get loud

She sat with her friends at the bar
She was wearing that dress
They ordered shots of Patron
I must say I was impressed
I caught her eye like a stone
She called me over to pray
The perfect time to sneak off
She was the moth to my flame

I'll make you feel like a woman, and I'll be your man
Let me please you the way I know I can

I just want to take you to the beach
Makin' love 'til the sun goes down
No worries, we'll be so far out of reach
In the night, so let's get loud
When you're feelin' me inside, under the starlight
It'll take you all the way, this is a summer fling

We took a walk to the store
Throwing out flirtatious verses
It was not long before
We were embraced in a kiss
Pressed against a coconut tree
That's when she hiked up her dress
I put my mouth on her neck
And she raised her knee to her chest

I'll make you feel like a woman, and I'll be your man
Let me please you the way I know I can

I just want to take you to the beach
Makin' love 'til the sun goes down
No worries, we'll be so far out of reach
In the night, so let's get loud
When you're feelin' me inside, under the starlight
It'll take you all the way, this is a summer fling

I'll make you feel like a woman, and I'll be your man
Let me please you the way I know I can
I just want to take you to the beach
Makin' love 'til the sun goes down
No worries, we'll be so far out of reach
In the night, so let's get loud
When you're feelin' me inside, under the starlight
It'll take you all the way, this is a summer fling
When you're feelin' me inside, under the starlight
