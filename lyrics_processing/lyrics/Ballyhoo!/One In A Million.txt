Oh no, look what I have done, just wanted a little fun
Now she thinks I'm in in love, but she's one in a million
I told you what this was, you said you understood
Now you think I'm in love, but you're one in a million

You should know better than to try and make me stay
And I should know better than to let you think that way
Ain't no holding me down, no I got some things to see
We might be holding hands now, but you gotta let me be

Maybe I shoulda said more, but you had me on the floor half naked
I said all that I needed to score, sometimes you gotta fake it

Oh no, look what I have done, just wanted a little fun
Now she thinks I'm in in love, but she's one in a million
I told you what this was, you said you understood
Now you think I'm in love, but you're one in a million

The life that I'm living is not working with your plan
I thought it was a given, but I guess I gotta say it again
Ain't no holding me down, but you can have me while I'm here
Then I gotta dip out, I just wanna make that clear
You might also like
Shoulda told you it was one or the other when you had me on the floor half naked
You might be looking for a long term lover but that's just the chance I'm taking

Oh no, look what I have done, just wanted a little fun
Now she thinks I'm in in love, but she's one in a million
I told you what this was, you said you understood
Now you think I'm in love, but you're one in a million

All of a sudden I've been missing your smile
And I'm thinking 'bout our conversations (they've been)
Making me wonder when I'll see you again
Is this a big mistake I'm making

Oh no, look what I have done, thought I was having fun
Now I think I'm in in love, 'cause she's one in a million
I told you what this was, I thought I understood
Now I think I'm in love, 'cause you're one in a million
Oh no, look what I have done, thought I was having fun
Now I think I'm in in love, 'cause you're one in a million
I told you what this was, I said I understood
