Everywhere I go, it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same
No shame in your game, no

So, back in school, tried to kill 'em with sweetness
Pretty girls were a permanent weakness
I found out I would never defeat them
Destroying towns, breathing fire, they eat men
I'd do whatever just to get on her good side
Make her believe that I was surely the right guy
She's always telling me that she hates her boyfriend
But deep down I know she really enjoys it

Oh, there's so many fish in the sea
But they don't make it easy on me
And so that's why I take my time to call her mine

'Cause everywhere I go, it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same
No shame in your game, no
'Cause everywhere I go, it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same
No shame in your game, no
You might also like
She's got me stuffed down deep in her pocket
She pulls me out when she wants me to rock it
Won't let me kiss her when she's wearing her lip gloss
She ain't complaining when I'm knocking her hips off
When I don't pay her no mind she gets upset
It's hard to tell if we are really in love yet
I thought by now I'd be ahead of the love curve
I guess I've got a lot to learn

Oh, there's so many fish in the sea
But they don't make it easy on me
And so that's why I take my time to call her mine

'Cause everywhere I go, it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same
No shame in your game, no
'Cause everywhere I go, it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same
No shame in your game, no

Oh, can we just go back, you always get so mad
Baby I don't wanna fight, just wanna do you right
But there's no pleasing you, no matter what I do
But I'll be trying for the rest of my life, 'cause I know that
Everywhere I go (everywhere I go) it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same (all the same)
No shame in your game, no (she don't care no)
'Cause everywhere I go (everywhere I go) it don't matter 'cause I know
You girls are all the same (the same)
