And so we made our way back home
We heard a house party was brewing
Its friday so lets get drunk ya (yip ya)
We got a call from out boy Danny Mac
He said he had set up shop on down the river shack
Were so many friends we hadnt seen in years
It's Friday so lets get it
It was so abrupt how I fell in love
With the thought of forgetting the day
Cause it's a full moon (whoa oh oh)
Tell sobriety that she's
She's about to meet her doom
Under this full moon(whoa oh oh)
Kegs are glistening and I
Fear my heart just skipped a beat (whoa oh oh)
Cause this alcohol looks beautiful tonight
The pier was packed with Harford County devil kids
The boom box was pumping Wu-Tang on the playlist
Taking shots and taking names
And everybodys on, they're on to it
You might also likeThen around midnight you know it got out of hand
Just like old fashion ragers do
Someone will pick a fight ya
Drama queen will cry and
Someone will spill your beer
Neighbors call the cops
The music stops
And they dont want to see us again
Cause it's a full moon (whoa oh oh)
Tell sobriety that she's
She's about to meet her doom
Under this full moon (whoa oh oh)
Kegs are glistening and I
Fear my heart just skipped a beat (whoa oh oh)
Cause this alcohol looks beautiful tonight
It was so abrupt how I fell in love
With the thought of forgetting the day
Cause it's a full moon (whoa oh oh)
Tell sobriety that she's
She's about to meet her doom
Under this full moon (whoa oh oh)
Kegs are glistening and I
Fear my heart just skipped a beat (whoa oh oh)
Cause this alcohol looks beautiful tonight
OH YA
Cause it's a full moon (whoa oh oh)
Tell sobriety that she's
She's about to meet her doom
Under this full moon (whoa oh oh)
Kegs are glistening and I
Fear my heart just skipped a beat (whoa oh oh)
