I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we'll make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Baby we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove
You've got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
I remember we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone
You might also likeSee my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say a body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did, that's what I did
I remember we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of this trailer
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
Got no plans, we ain't going nowhere
We just take a fast car and keep on driving, oh
I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
(You got a fast car, speed so fast, felt like I was drunk)
But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
(You got a fast car, speed so fast, felt like I was drunk)
You can leave tonight or live and die this way
(You got a fast car, speed so fast, felt like I was drunk)
