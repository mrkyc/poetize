Hey Webb, uh, they're still on my page talking boatloads of shit
Hahahahaha, so I told them

M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business (Look, look)

Mirror, mirror on the wall (Hello?)
Why these hoes stay on my balls? (Why?)
Acting big when they so small
Got it all, I recorded at the Taj Mahal (Ow)
Tryna keep up with us, catch a hernia (Ouch)
Step into the circle, we gon' murder you (Yeah)
We can't diss you back, we never heard of ya
And me and Chris Webb too cold, hypothermia (Let's go)
It's I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D
E-N-T, do you know what that mean? (Do you know?)
Quarter million streams while I water my dreams
Mean hustling this at your TV screen
First I'm skinny (Right?), now I'm thick (Okay)
Are you pregnant? When you due, sis? (Ahh)
That's crazy 'cause they way on my dick
You better check your menstrual quick, piss on a stick
I'm positive when they gossip, I'm a lot of it
Bitches really ain't that cognitive, they should bottle it
Save it for a rainy day
I hope talking shit about me take your pain away (I hope it do)
And I know I ain't perfect (Nah)
But I wouldn't give a penny to you thots 'cause you thots ain't worth it (Worth shit)
Despite the bullshit, I'ma find a way through (Right)
Lil' bitch, mind the business that pays you
You might also like
This my vibe, this my tribe
This my way, this my ride
You wanna see me fall but I'm still gon' rise
If you don't like me, get a motherfucking life

M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)

Mind your motherfucking business

I got a life to live, so bitch, mind your biz
Don't you have your own shit, a fucking wife and kids?
Job and hobbies, fuck, anything to do?
Read a book, learn to cook, fucking drink some booze
Or take a pill, shit, just relax and chill
We all got enough bullshit, taxes, bills
And other real-life stuff, go and grab the wheel
And drive your own damn car, if you're crashing still
Then the problem lies within you, it's not me
Maybe try therapy or some LSD
And stay outta my biz, fucking let me be
Shit, you're more nosy than Adrien Brody
Rumors all fruitless, they don't bare none
Talkin' shit like a gossiping bitch, you Karens
Talk a big game but never shooting a fair one
Got me seeing red like Justina getting her hair done
Y'all hating, cold-blood on some gecko shit
Good thing is people are dumb and forget so quick
The modern-day memory span's like a pet goldfish
Forget to retie the noose if your neck don't fit
So even if they cancel you, really it's whatever
Come back a month later and they can't even remember
I could pull out my dick on national TV
And you'd be over it by next week
This my vibe, this my tribe
This my way, this my ride
You wanna see me fall but I'm still gon' rise
If you don't like me, get a motherfucking life

M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business

Why you wasting your time bein' worried 'bout mine?
You need to find something to do (Find something to do)
I'm grand prix in your mind, we could never be aligned
I would never worry 'bout you (Never worry)
Another day comes and another day goes
But you still gon' be a troll (Yeah)
You need to find your own peace when you losing no sleep
Baby, it's out of control
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business
M-Y-O-B, mind your motherfucking biz (Biz)
Mind your motherfucking business

So basically if you don't like us
Fuck off, hahahahahaha
