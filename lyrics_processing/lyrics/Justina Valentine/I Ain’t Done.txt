Said I couldn't win, so I made my haters nauseous
Tryna find my friends so I'm movin' with caution
Lookin' for a way out this place that I was lost in
Went out on a limb and I came out with some wins
And I ain't done (Yuh)

So much more to get (Get)
I just cashed a check but I ain't in the millions yet
I just had to pull up on 'em quick so I could flex (Flex)
Plottin' all my moves to see which one I would do next, ayy
Maybe a role in a movie
Maybe an album that's groovy
Make 'em say, "That was a doozy"
Mess with a couple of groupies (Ooh)
Havin' 'em roll up my doobies
While I lay 'round in some rubies
It was all just a dream and I made it come true
Biggie said it in "Juicy"

Said I couldn't win, so I made my haters nauseous
Tryna find my friends so I'm movin' with caution
Lookin' for a way out this place that I was lost in
Went out on a limb and I came out with some wins
And I ain't done

Now tell me what you see
Don't be beggin', boy, you know the pussy ain't free
You wanna gimme rings like my name was KD
But I be switchin' teams, cross 'em up like Kyrie, yeah
They chose to stomp on my greatness (Yeah)
I move away from the fakeness (Yeah)
Jersey, the state that I'm raised in (Yeah)
That mean I'm done bein' patient
I'm takin' what's mine, there's no waitin'
I'm goin' straight for the throne
I don't need an army to back me
I went and got mine on my own, yeah

Said I couldn't win, so I made my haters nauseous
Tryna find my friends so I'm movin' with caution
Lookin' for a way out this place that I was lost in
Went out on a limb and I came out with some wins
And I ain't done

And I ain't done
And I ain't done
Went out on a limb and I came out with some wins
