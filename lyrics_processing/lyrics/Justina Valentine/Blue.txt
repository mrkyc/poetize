Oh blue, why don't you take me away?
To a mysterious place, where all my worries just fade
Oh blue, you are my only escape
From all the trouble I face, you make the world seem okay
Aw, yeah, yeah

Think you down, crush you up
Raw as fuck, fill me up
I've been feeling empty
You're so tempting, I feel glamorous
When you're in me, this urgency is urging me
Emergency, if I can't get my hands on you
When you leave I'm damning you
Lights are dim, then fade to black
I start snipping, run it back
I need you like my favorite track
I'm so addicted, face the facts
Intervention, sentiment
I'm Red Hot like cinnamon
Take you away, I find you again
This true love here is heaven sent

Oh blue, why don't you take me away?
To a mysterious place, where all my worries just fade
Oh blue, you are my only escape
From all the trouble I face, you make the world seem okay

It's been six months, what the fuck?
Need more of you to turn up
You used to feel so potent
Up my doses, simultaneous
Search for more, sought you out
Stacked you up, I went all out
You are my religion, I wake up for you, don't clean me out
Sorry if I raise my voice
But you see, I have no choice
I can feel you fading, and when that happens I lose my (?)
Please say you'll stay with me
I need someone to play with me
And pray with me, this vacancy is eating me, repeatedly

Oh blue, why don't you take me away?
To a mysterious place, where all my worries just fade
Oh blue, you are my only escape
From all the trouble I face, you make the world seem okay
Blue, blue, I need to vow to you
To make me feel brand new
And then I fade away
Blue, blue, you always need to come through
And catch me when I tumble
You are my sweet escape
(Woah) Blue, why don't you take me away?
To a mysterious place, where all my worries just fade
Oh blue, you are my only escape
From all the trouble I face, you make the world seem okay

You know I love you blue
It's all the little things you do
You know I'll never trade you, Blue
I take you, and I take you down, I love you
And yes, I need you Blue
You're all I dream of Blue
