Aye, aye, aye, I'm hammered
Aye, aye, aye, aye

I woke up in the morning like "Where's my pants?"
Set my (?), bring an ambulance
I need a ride home, lost my chance
So, I found an (?), and a pair of Vans
Then I, then I do the walk of shame
Try'na keep my eyes behind the frames
Got a lot of missed calls, got a lot of new numbers
But, I didn't write no names
It's incredible fun that we had, I hope I ain't make no one mad
My headache is throbbin' so bad, the end of the night I just faded to black
My makeup is smeared on my face
My hair is a fucking disgrace
I hope I don't run into no one I know before I make it back to my place
[Hook:}
Turn up, get turnt up
Show up, and I show out
Keg of beer in my backseat
Throw a half a party at your house
Cannonball, in the pool
Keg stand in the living room
(?), get faded
Take a brand new dude, to your brother's room
I'm hammered, I'm hammered
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
Take a brand new dude, to your brother's room
I'm hammered, I'm hammered
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
I said I'm hammered
You might also like
I turn up, to turn up, to do it again
Call up the homies, invite up your friends
My bitches bad, they don't gotta retain
All different colors, and all different 10's
Tell all these lames to stop wasting my time
Forget all the rules, I stay close (?)
Getting it in, I ain't worried 'bout time
I'm hammered again by the end of the night
Faded, sauce, twisted, wash
(?), (?), Mazoltuv
Smash, (?), plastered, blitz
Surrounded by some crazy shit
(?), chrome, pussy, drone
Violated, every sip
(?) to the (?), that he (?), now I'm 86

I'm hammered, I'm hammered
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
I said "I'm hammered, I'm hammered"
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
I said I turn up, get turnt up
Show up, and I show out
Keg of beer in my backseat
Throw a half a party at your house
Cannonball, in the pool
Threw a keg stand in the living room
(?), get faded
Take a brand new dude, to your brother's room
I'm hammered, I'm hammered
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
I said "I'm hammered, I'm hammered"
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
I'm staggering, and I'm stammering 'til out comes the sun
