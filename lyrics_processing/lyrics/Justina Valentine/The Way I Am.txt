Yeah
So now when they talk about the dopest female rappers, they are going to mention me
I write all my own motherfuckin' shit
And matter fact, I don't even need to write 'cause my freestyle's that fuckin' hot
Feminem

Now let me break it down and spit some facts
You have no idea what I did to get where I'm at
I been to hell and back and I'on mean to throw a pity party
But anybody could see I slayed a lot of my haters
Yeah, I got plenty bodies (haaa)
When everyone was talkin', they was scared I'd be so important that it would overshadow anything
 could ever attempt to do in three life times (hehe)
They never saw it comin', what I had in my pipeline (ah)
It was so hard to get to these doors and twist the knob
By the way, what's your face, yo how's your office job? (hehe)
I hope every time you staple a paper or sit in a meetin'
This song'll have you meanin' how you almost
Defeated this spirit that's as bright as mine that's so hard to find (hard to find)
I used the rocks they threw at me, blew up like Columbine
Labels adjust, so confused like what does she do?
Does she rap, or sing rhythm and blues?
No money behind her, they was scared to sign her
Can't get that vagina or slide in behind her
If she ain't go out and go get that 
'Cause she's a real artist, she won't be a mascot
And who is this white girl that say that she freestyle?
That can't be a freestyle, I never heard a freestyle
That's fire like that, I mean she can rap
But nah, we won't notice or say she's the dopest
But I am, that's focused (who's focused)
With tears in my eyes and no one to my side, I embarked
On the ride that I knew one day could come true
'Cause when you that nice, they can't stifle your life
Forever, whatever, it took me some time to get with this
So  in the business or money to buy 
But fuck it, I did it, I lived it
I built it, I took the old me and I killed it
And rose from the ashes, I came from debris
I'm a Phoenix on the rise, there's no bitterness in me
And now I got zero fucks to give about how I live
About how to be, ironically
I remember the time
Not a single fuckin' soul believed it was mine
Let me say it again, not a single percent
In that cut like a knife but fuck it, that's life

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I don't know
Know, know, know
I don't know, I don't know
