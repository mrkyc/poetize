Shit, Justina
Aw, you picked one of my favorite tracks
Uh
Let's go
You know we gotta do this dirty
Uh-huh
It's Mysonne!

I had to rumble, I was Simba in the jungle (Uh-huh)
Fight for ya life for these hyenas that take it from you (That's right!)
Daddy told me (What?), speak up, you never mumble (Never)
Niggas know I'm a beast, I just keep it humble (Haha)
The streets'll numb you, kids takin' painkillers (damn)
It's insane, the pain turned 'em to trained killers (Ahh)
They can't hear us (Nah), everybody screamin' at 'em
Chains is gleamin', Satan is sendin' demons at 'em
Gave her ya semen but you ain't seem 'em since she had 'em (Tshh)
You a phantom and now you hustle, he want a phantom (Get in)
How you a man? (Hah)
You don't know your son from madame
So you ain't tell him that the feds was gon' come and grab 'em (Damn)
Son of a madame, papa was a rolling stone
He left me alone, I wanted to be a Corleone
Hole in the chrome, 'til I finally found my crown
Now I'm known as the realest nigga this side of town
Pound for pound, the lyrics is like gospel (Gospel)
I make soldiers so the take over is hostile (That's right)
I showed 'em how to make lemons in the lemonade
Real niggas never die, so I'm a motherfuckin' renegade!

Since up in the Christian, I always talk to God and he listens
The evil people tryna break me down my very existence
And make me feel like I'm a blemish, and perfect and flawed
They got me walkin' the plank, every one drawin' they swords
Said I'm the queen of the half hazardous craft in my wordplay
No writers, no gimmicks, I guess that puts me in first place
They mad with a hurt face, haters why bother?
You meet me in the flesh and act like it's Hakuna Matata

Said I'm a renegade
Self made, throwin' grenades
Trying to blow up the place, now tell me no to my face
And I slay, and I gave, for the may
Through the pain in this game, left a stain
It'll never be the same

It's Feminem on the track, I had to switch up my lane
"But you're just stan!"
Y'all didn't put respect on my name
And that goes for all three of y'all
I mean the press, the fans, the labels, Emmy
Is depressed to Stan?
You see, they got me on the edge, I know they dyin' to push me
It's a dog-eat-dog world, and they gave me a pussy
I had to scratch to the top, climb my way out the cage
So when I'm pissin' off the buildin', I rain on your parade
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to talk about anything, anything
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
I'm a renegade
