Black card, you give me your black card
No limit, what I charge, I get what I want
There is no discussion, it's just the way I fuck you
He knows at what I'm workin', he said that I deserve it
Get it, then I spend it, then I get it
Yeah, I get it all the way
He spoils me like royalty
He said that I don't make him feel his age

He's my sugar daddy, riding in his Caddy
I love my sugar daddy, he always makes me happy
Hey daddy, shower with me cash, cash, cash
Shower me with cash, cash, cash

Love in the jacuzzi
Get it, then I spend it, then I get it
Yeah, I get it all the way

He call me sugar, and I know he got a sweet tooth
We in the dressing room, all my outfit see through
Empty his pockets and I'm swimming in the Benjamins
I'm friends with all of them, Jacksons and the Franklins
He 'bout as (?) as (?), so when I see him it's on
I get it, I spend it, until the money's all gone
They wonder and wonder what type of shit that we on
We living and sippin', we breaking night 'til it's morn'

Calling up your line 'til you bail me out, (?) double
