I love you better in a different time, baby
Introduce you to a better vibe, baby
I don't care they saying that I'm crazy
I'll be yours and then you'll be mine, baby
Verse 1 :
Sitting here by the front door
Wishing that you could understand
I been waiting to meet up
Even though that I know you ain't mine
No, I can't sit here and call you my man
Oh, no, no, no no no
Hook :
Who's gonna touch
You the way I do
And make love to you?
Nobody
Who's gonna ride
For you the way I do
Always slide for you?
Nobody
Chorus :
I love you better in a different time, baby
Introduce you to a better vibe, baby
I don't care they saying that I'm crazy
I'll be yours and then you'll be mine, baby
Love you better in a different time, baby
Introduce you to a better vibe, baby
I don't care they saying that I'm crazy
I'll be yours and then you'll be mine

Look
I told him, "Listen (listen), what's the difference?
Me and these bitches?
Baby, it's no competition (nah)
'Cause I'll love you better than an RnB veteran (right)
Love'll be the medicine, following my regiment
A gangsta and a gentlemen, don't care about your skeletons (nah)
All of that's irrelevant, we getting to the benjamins (benjamins)
You been A1 since day one, we make up to break up
I wish a bitter hoe would try and say something
You held me down through all of my flaws
Then I got the call, shorty said the baby was yours?! Damn
Got me twisted, I thought you was my lifeline
I guess I'll see you next lifetime"
Chorus :
I love you better in a different time, baby
Introduce you to a better vibe, baby
I don't care they saying that I'm crazy
I'll be yours and then you'll be mine, baby
Love you better in a different time, baby
Introduce you to a better vibe, baby
I don't care they saying that I'm crazy
I'll be yours and then you'll be mine
