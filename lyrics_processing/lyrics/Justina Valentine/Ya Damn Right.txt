Yeah, ya damn right
Ya damn right
Yeah

I'm self-made, ya damn right
I stayed the same, ya damn right
This is my lane, ya damn right
You said I'm dead wrong, ya damn right
I'm self-made, ya damn right
I stayed the same, ya damn right
This is my lane, ya damn right (Yeah)
You said I'm dead wrong, ya damn right (Yeah, yeah, yeah, look)

I'm just a redhead fire-spitter straight outta Jers
I bet I never get the props I feel I truly deserve
There'll be a funeral first, killed shit on numerous turfs
I'm Moonwalkin' past bitches like the future reversed
And I ain't never shy away from what they said I can't do
If you put me down on my way up, now I'm better than you
I'm the best rapper of the top, I'm talking gentlemen too
If you're looking for a caterpillar, it's an empty cocoon
I get money, fuck what all these bitches are talking
My Cash App starts singing from the second I walk in
I fuck with real bitches who fuck with real bitches until my deal switches
My grind is my meal ticket, so deal with it
So, who gon tell me what? I don't give a single fuck
They didn't help me when I was down, you can't come around ever since I been up
If I'm acting squirrelly I'm just here to get a fucking nut
No, I don't wanna bust, I'm talking bout them fucking bucks

This is my lane, ya damn right
You said I'm dead wrong, ya damn right (Yo)

If they don't gimme my shit, I'ma take it
Everybody screaming how they real, but like them fake shit
Everyone starting to look the same and, yo, I hate it
I'm about to go off on my Twitter, Kanye shit, ahh, ahh
Maybe if I'm acting like a maniac
Then they'll hear my track and say this girl's a fucking brainiac
Pull a stupid stunt, views up to a hundred million
Then they'll hear what's up and say this cunt's so fucking brilliant
Brilliant, resilient, let 'em meet my ass with no Brazilian
I feel myself so much, you see I don't need no assistance
Fake a orgasm, sugar daddy, I don't need him
Hope he leave his shit to me and not his snotty children
Every shot that I missed, it was the wrong vibe
Now they calling my name watching courtside
Every blessing that I got it was on time
Now all they said is red, period, I'm on mine
I'm self-made, ya damn right
I stayed the same, ya damn right
This is my lane, ya damn right
You said I'm dead wrong, ya damn right
I'm self-made, ya damn right
I stayed the same, ya damn right
This is my lane, ya damn right
