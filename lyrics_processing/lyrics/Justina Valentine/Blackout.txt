I'm looking in the rearview try'na find my way home
I think I passed the exit but I don't really know
The rain is crashing down and I don't know where I'm going
All the roads are closing, I can't keep my eyes open

I fell asleep at the wheel again
I put your heart in danger, took for granted, your love
I fell asleep at the wheel again
I always promise things that I'm not capable of
(I fell asleep at the wheel again)

I'm speeding through the day and night, and giving you time
You said you need attention, lot of things on my mind
And maybe I'm just selfish, wasn't trying to see
You always said I go too fast, now no one (?)
I'm slamming on the breaks before I crash

I fell asleep at the wheel again
I put your heart in danger, took for granted, your love
I fell asleep at the wheel again
I always promise things that I'm not capable of
I fell asleep at the wheel again
I put your heart in danger, took for granted, your love
I fell asleep at the wheel again
I always promise things that I'm not capable of

I fell asleep at the wheel again
