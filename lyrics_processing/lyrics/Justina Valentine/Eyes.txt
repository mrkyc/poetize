Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah

The gettin' money type, yeah, I know just what I like
Always on your grind and your hustle matches mine
I fucked him on the first date, he's from outta state
I love that accent and we ain't had no time to waste
In the motel room, you told me it was written
The bedbugs left, but my love for you didn't
And time flies when you have fun
I fucked up a few times, but the truth is we had some
Of them little flings where I messed up
And I switched up and ain't act right
I can't erase all our history
We both livin' that fast life
And shit happens, it goes down
I learned my lesson, I know now
If I could, I'd take it all back
You classic, baby, you all that
 something I'm not
I realize what I got
For you I'll let everything drop, hm
So baby, won't you come my way?
I'll do whatever 'til you say that you'll stay
The bad things I did, I'ma make 'em okay
And then every day'll be Valentine's Day

When you walked through that door
You left me needin' more
I guess you evened the score
Three, two, one

I need you, I need you, I do
No, I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm stuck to your side like some glue
You see , yeah
And I need you, I need you, I do
No, I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm stuck to your side just like glue
You see  (Look)

I know, boy I been trippin'
But I need you to listen
You say you'd rather leave
I put it all on me, yeah
'Cause for you, for you
Do anything for you
Oh, you, oh, you
You know I adore you
And if you come home
It'll be okay
When you walked through that door
You left me needin' more
I guess you evened the score
Three, two, one

I need you, I need you, I do
No, I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm stuck to your side like some glue
You see 
And I need you, I need you, I do
No, I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm stuck to your side just like glue
