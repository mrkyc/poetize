Yeah, Justina, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Yeah, you'll see

White bitch, tattoos
(?) with some killer shoes
No filter, so rude, that's my Jersey attitude
Hanging out the window, middle finger, fuck you
You can tell your whole crew, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
With my bad bitch army, with some (?), when we crash your party
Sippin' got me hella bent, bitches is irrelevant
Let me take this time to vent, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
(Ain't no, ain't no, ain't nobody fuckin' with me)

Yeah, me; yeah, me
Yeah, me; yeah
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Yeah, me; yeah, me
Yeah, me; yeah
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me

No sleep, all week
Hustling on the creek
No deal, fuck a deal
Ain't no other bitch is real
Car broke, no wheels
(?) broke my windshield
You might think your on my heels
But, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got three jobs grindin', and my fashion blog climbin'
They ain't fuckin' with my rhyming
Singing, playing instruments, bitches couldn't (?)
Half the shit I'm doing, I'm moving cause this just out of your league
My vision is winning, so fuck your opinion, you lack my ambition
Follow me, follow me down
No plan, I stick out from the crowd
I am living my life out loud
And ain't nobody fuckin' with me
(Ain't no, ain't no, ain't nobody fuckin' with me)

White bitch, tattoos

No filter, so rude, that's my Jersey attitude
White bitch, tattoos
(?) with some killer shoes
No filter, so rude, who you think you talking to?

Yeah, me; yeah, me
Yeah, me; yeah
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Yeah, me; yeah, me
