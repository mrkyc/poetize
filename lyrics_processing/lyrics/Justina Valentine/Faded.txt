Break up like we had a fight, yeah
Roll up, someone pass the light yeah
Hold up don't bring the bullshit, we only blow good shit when we pull shit
Yeah
Just pull a little bit, if you ain't used to it, sippin a little bit
Kiss it
Inhale, get lifted
Red cups, all of us twisted
Everybody up in here bakin
Booties comin out when they shakin
Of key with song but they sangin (singin)
Tell my baby come over, get crazy

We turn up every night
No sleep until sunlight
Oh

All that I want, is to get faded, oh woah
All that I want, is to get faded, forget tomorrow boy
All that I want, is to get faded, oh woah

Road trip, Los Angelos
Don't fit, we'll rent the bus

Red hair with the thong and my groove on
Good day, imma get my ice cube on
