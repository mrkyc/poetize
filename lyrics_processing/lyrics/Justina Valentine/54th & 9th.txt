It was something like a tragedy, a personal catastrophe
You went and took the last of me
What was left of me, (?)
Sentiments gone down the drain
Memories a blur, fade away
Should of (?) down another (?)

Cause I lost my heart on 54th and 9th
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh why, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Cause I lost my heart on 54th and 9th

Why'd I have to travel down the road?
The cross street took my soul
The corner took all my light
Every day is night, I just fade to white
Move around with no urgency
'Cause I'm stuck there for eternity
And my chest keeps burning me

Cause I lost my heart on 54th and 9th (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Oh, tell me why, why, why)
(Why) Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Cause I lost) Cause I lost my heart on 54th and 9th

I left it on the corner, yeah
I left it on the corner, yeah
I'm certain that he took it there
I had it back at Journal Square
Before I crossed the water to the city
Got myself dressed up all pretty
Instagram pics, and all likes, 11:50
I hope it wasn't nothing that I did or nothing bad I said
I shouldn't of worn that dress, look I don't know
But, oh I'm such a mess
Imagine living with no blood runnin' through your veins
I mean cold and dark, disremains
I run the lanes, without a name, (?)

Why, why, why?
Did you have to say goodbye?
Can I replace the time?
Every day, cause I lost my heart
Why did you have to take up time?
Every day, cause I lost my heart on 54th and 9th
