We're getting all the way, all the way
All the way, all the way, way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way, way
My mind's open, my cups full
I'm in town, so come through
Your day been so stressful
We turning up, what you up to?

Rolling 'round with a backpack
Living life on a fast track
Tell your folks you'll be right home
Check your bus, and catch contact
Haven't seen your bed all week, you out there living life
You getting turnt for free, better get your money right
Chopping a hooky and go for a ride
(?)
We rollin', we holdin', we smokin', we tokin'
We running and ripping and sippin' all night
I'm faded and faded and breaking up (?)
This shit (?)
Now the neighbors complaining
What the fuck is you sayin'?

(Yeah, I walk up in the __ like this)
Don't stress, it's a no stress zone (zone)
I feel blessed to be on my own, grown
So, you might see me with a bottle in my hand, and a joint in my hand 'round the low
A couple hoes at the party and they fans (hey)
They really waiting for me to take off their pants (okay)
They know I've been balling, Kevin Durant (what?)
They want the rapper and I think they got a chance
Ha, get it? Got it (got it)
I swear to God that I'm tired of being modest
I'm pouring champagne on a bitch if she ever with the clique and decide to act snobbish (bitch)
Being honest, I don't want problems
I got a lot of big motherfuckers in my (?)
Take a chick to the bathroom, pass 'em to my other nigga
Man we gon' run 'em like an (?)
Yo, she want the weiner, Dotson
I need to stop it, I'm way too drunk
Throwing dumb punchlines when I'm fucked up
Shitting on niggas, 2 Girls 1 Cup
Throwing a party and all the bitches filling up
They looking at a nigga try'na reel me in
And I 'dun hit the blunt 5 times, now I'm higher than a voice on helium
We're getting all the way, all the way

Let your body go, we'll catch you
It's a sweet escape
Let the wave just pull you under, we're going all the way
