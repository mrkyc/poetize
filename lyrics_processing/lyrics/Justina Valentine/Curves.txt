Rolling up in your Ferrari
A lot of girls wanna go for a ride
But I just ain't impressed, I'm sorry
It ain't the car, it's the way you drive
Skipping down Melrose in my beat up Chucks
Ripped up jeans, not giving a 
Our pocket's on E, so I window shop
When you're built like this a little looks like a lot
I don't worry about no material things
I stay fly, no fairy wings
I don't wanna come down from this cloud I'm on
I'mma sing out loud 'til the loud is gone
Mama told me I should find a guy...
Who's cleaned up nice with a suit and tie
But I like boys who misbehave
Jailhouse tats and dungarees

Rolling up in your Ferrari
A lot of girls wanna go for a ride
But I just ain't impressed, I'm sorry
It ain't the car, it's the way you drive
Can you handle these curves? (curves)
Make your heart race the whole time
Can you handle these curves? (curves)
It ain't the car, it's the way you drive

He pulled up to the curb, rolled the window down
Asked me where I'm heading, and I said downtown
He opened up the door, I said yeah, alright
If you sit shotgun, watch me drive
I be whipping through the street
When I'm flipping on the beat
Every bad little mama wanna get up on my team
When they see me drive by in the whole ride
(?) with the Maserat, I be burning rubbers in the (?)
Mama told me I should find a guy
Who works real hard, at a 9 to 5
But I like boys who break the rules
Drive real loud and sing the blues, hey
