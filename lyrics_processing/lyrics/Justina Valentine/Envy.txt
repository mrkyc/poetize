When the rhythm hits you, let your spirit soar
(Higher and higher and higher and higher)
Go and leave your inhibitions at the door
(Get higher and higher and higher and higher)

You're the center of attention they all envy
You're the apple of my eye, boy, don't you tempt me

We are who they envy
'Cause we're not scared to love
We know what we want
What we want
We are who they envy
Come get lost with me
We could run away
Somewhere far away
We are who they envy, who they envy
Envy, envy
Envy, who they envy
Envy, envy

Come on, baby, let me feel all of your heat
(That fire, that fire, that fire, that fire)
I love it when the DJ plays my favorite beat
(That fire, that fire, that fire, that fire)
