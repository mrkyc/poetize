That's that control (control)
I got money, I got power, and they on me
That's that control (control)
And they could never, ever go and take it from me
That's that control

That's that control, that's that shit (that's that shit)
Can't change me, no I will not switch (will not switch)
Love me or hate me, but I'm still that bitch (that bitch)
Had me by the balls then I flipped that switch
You held me down when they doubted, you saw the vision was clouded

You want the money and power, maybe we better without it
I got you plenty of commas but you held onto your problems
I shoulda known, I shoulda known
Through the highs and the lows
I survived on my own
No compromising my soul
I stayed down and that's control

Tried to tell me what to do but nobody own me
Na, na-na-na, na, na
They wanna see me down but I'ma keep going
Na, na-na-na, na, na

That's that control (control)

That's that control (control)
And they could never, ever go and take it from me

That's that control, y'all gotta know
I did this shit on my own with a vision
And it got me sitting all up on the throne
They tried to get me to go sell my soul, I won't
'Cause happiness come with the freedom really
If I couldn't be me, then honestly, that'd kill me
I know the flow is filthy but still be on IG silly
On the lives, let my business thrive really, ain't no ceilings for me
Yeah, and I'm revealing the truth
And savings lives from the rhymes that I spill in the booth
I wake up every day, I'm whipping to the gym in a coupe, with no roof
I drive by, so you know that I shoot
I'm talking threes, that's with ease, I'm doing the things I love
With the gift that I was given presented from up above
Help my family through the struggle, I know that the times get tough
I'm the real me, and I ain't gotta bluff, homie, that's that control

Tried to tell me what to do but nobody own me
Na, na-na-na, na, na
They wanna see me down but I'ma keep going
Na, na-na-na, na, na
That's that control (control)
I got money, I got power, and they on me
That's that control, yeah (control)
And they could never, ever go and take it from me
That's that control (control)
I got money, I got power, and they on me
That's that control (control)
And they could never, ever go and take it from me
