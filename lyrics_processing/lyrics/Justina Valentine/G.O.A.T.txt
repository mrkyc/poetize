Baby, you are the greatest (You are the greatest)
Of all fuckin' time

I'm takin' all this time to show ya
Let's break it down, don't want no other
Just gimme this chance before I fold up
If anyone that can knock 'em over
'Cause I really hate to not see you back for a day (A day)
Eternity wouldn't be enough, no way
Gimme what I want, gimme what I want right now
I need you now like always (I need you)
I just need you to say

All this love, all this love one way
Love me down, love me down, don't play
Greatest now, greatest now, I say
Take me down all the way
Take me now

Baby, you are the greatest
(You are the greatest, you are, you are)
Of all fuckin' time
(You are the greatest of all fuckin' time)
'Cause all the things you do every single night
Got me goin' crazy, out my fuckin' mind
Whether wrong or right, I waited my whole life
I gotta tell ya, babe, you're the greatest of all-time
You might also like
The picture's perfect when you're in it
You want my all? Then I'ma give it
But every time you leave I'm finished
I give in, without you I'm not livin'
I came into your city for the weekend
You tryna run around and drown all in my deep end
Pullin' me in until I lose all my control
You are my king so please don't let me go

Baby, you are the greatest
(You are the greatest, you are, you are)
Of all fuckin' time
(You are the greatest of all fuckin' time)
'Cause all the things you do every single night (Every single night)
Got me goin' crazy, out my fuckin' mind (Out my fuckin' mind)
Whether wrong or right, I waited my whole life
I gotta tell ya, babe, you're the greatest of all-time

Greatest, you are the greatest
Baby, I'm lovin' you crazy
Greatest, they can't fuck with you, baby
I just wanna be where you are, yeah
Baby, you are the greatest
(You are the greatest, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
Of all fuckin' time
(You are the greatest of all fuckin' time)
'Cause all the things you do every single night (Every single night)
Got me goin' crazy, out my fuckin' mind (Out my fuckin' mind)
Whether wrong or right, I waited my whole life
I gotta tell ya, babe, you're the greatest of all-time

Greatest
Greatest of all-time
