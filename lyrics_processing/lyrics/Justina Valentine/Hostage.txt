You got me in my feelings, I don't know what's what
Thinkin' 'bout you lately got me all fucked up
Lookin' for another you is pointless
Tryna find another me? It don't exist
Look, I'm not done with you yet
Let's ride this out 'til nothing's left
I might be crazy, you might be, too
But if I gotta choose, it's always you

Ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do (Do, do, do, whoa)
So I'ma hold you hostage, baby, don't you move
Ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do (Do, do, do, whoa)
So I'ma hold you hostage, baby, don't you move

My body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, baby
Ain't nobody gonna love me like you love me, baby
Gonna love me like you love me, baby

Why we always fightin' when we just make up?
You know that I need you, but we still break up
Feelin' like I really need to get away
There's a thin line between the love and hate
I know I said for you to call
But when you're gone I'm dyin' slow
I might be crazy, you might be, too
But I'd rather be crazy here with you
You might also like
Ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do (Do, do, do, whoa)
So I'ma hold you hostage, baby, don't you move (Move)
Ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do (Do, do, do, whoa)
So I'ma hold you hostage, baby, don't you move (Don't move, baby, don't move)

My body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, baby
Ain't nobody gonna love me like you love me, baby
Gonna love me like you love me, baby
My body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, baby
Ain't nobody gonna love me like you love me, baby
