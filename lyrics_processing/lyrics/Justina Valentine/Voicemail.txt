Yeah, yeah, tell 'em

Voicemail, voicemail, bitch, yeah, check yo' line
Where you at? Just give me a time
Voicemail, voicemail, bitch, yeah, check yo' line
Don't take too long, I might change my mind
'Cause I've been waiting up all night, boy, I was waiting on you
And I've been up drinkin' Merlot and waitin' on you to come through
Sippin'-sippin' way to much, I'm in my feelings for you
But if you do not hit my line I might forget about you

He call my phone like, "Hey, what's up?" (What's good?)
At 3AM I know just what he want (I know what he want)
He keep on buzzing me just like a fiend (Like a fiend)
I ride him 'til I put his ass to sleep
You on the telephone telling me, "Come on"
Now your wait is on, fuck me like I'm the truth (Truth)
Don't you tell a soul, you'll mess up the flow (Flow)
But before I go, fuck me like I'm the truth

Voicemail, voicemail (Brrt-brrt), pick up my phone (Hello?)
By the time you get this I'm already gone
And I tell myself that you'll be just fine
But if you're not, you can hit me up anytime

So I don't ever miss your call (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
