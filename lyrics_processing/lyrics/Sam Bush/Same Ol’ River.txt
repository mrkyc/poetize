I wish that I cold be an Indian
On a painted pony so fast
No one could ever catch me
I get caught up in my past
I'd ride across many rivers
Use many moons to tell the times
Then I'd tell all the young warriors
Many moons ago this was mine, all mine

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a pirate
I'd sail the ocean blue
Way before the big liners
Started sailing them too
I'd bury most of my treasures
So I would leave a big hole
And the only real sense of pleasure that I'd get
Is I'd sail free of my soul
You might also like
Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a slave
It doesn't matter what kind
I'd sing a song for fallen angels
Try and be free in my mind
Then when no one wasn't lookin'
Well I'd drop my harvest plow
I'd find my own contemporaries
And wipe the shame from their brow

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run
I wish that I could be an outlaw
Runnin' from the law sometimes
No vigilante against the seasons
But I can't help but read why
I'd always keep my revolver
Steady and fast at my side and
I'd rob a train bound for glory
'Cause I thought I needed a ride

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run
