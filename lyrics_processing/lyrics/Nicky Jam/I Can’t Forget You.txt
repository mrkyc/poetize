I know we're no longer together
And you moved on with another
Not a day goes by that I don't miss your face
You can be warm under the covers
We make love and like no other
I regret not doing more than make you stay

So if the world is getting heavy
And you feel the need to call me
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here
If I had the chance to bring you back to me
I would do it in a heartbeat
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left
You're the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If, baby, you're the air I breathe
('Cause, baby, you're the air I breathe)

Oye, mami
We can't help without feeling you owe me
Holding the pillow but pretending is your body
It's like I'm drowning underwater with my insights
This the kind of pain that makes a man cry
Holding it and keeping it cool
So I be steady on my rack, I keep my mind over you
But it ain't working
I'm missing you like a drug
It's like I can't get back the air of my lungs
That's why I'm telling

Lady, no matter how far
Wherever you are
I'm waiting for you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go
Lady, no matter how far
Wherever you are
I'm waiting for you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left
You're the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If, baby, you're the air I breathe
('Cause, baby, you're the air I breathe)
So if the world is getting heavy
And you feel the need to call me
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here
If I had a chance to bring you back to me
I would do it in a heartbeat
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left
You're left you the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If, baby, you're the air I breathe
