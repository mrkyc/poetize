Your friends keep telling me
I bear a striking resemblance to someone you used to know
But baby, it's me
So why the hell you keep on calling me Flo?
And I would hope that you would have the decency to
Let me go in case of an emergency

But you keep reassuring me
Telling me to just quit tripping on it
And maybe it's me
I guess that I should probably get a grip on it
But it's hard to do every time I see that tattoo
Over your heart, it ain't right, I can't even look at you

Why you doing what you're doing?
You should be doing what you want
Who the fuck you think you're fooling?
She's the one, the one you want

Florence, if you hear this, won't you
Come and take your girlfriend back?
She's been calling out your name
Every time we're in the sack
She's been a mess since you've been apart
So Flo, if you had half a heart
Florence, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Flo?
Florence, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Flo?

We've been going for a while
But lately she's been somewhere else
She don't even smile
And I think it's a cry for help
And I would pray that you would have the common courtesy
To take her away, it ain't right, she don't belong to me

Why you doing what you're doing?
You could be doing who you want
You're the only one you're fooling
She's the one, the one you want

Florence, if you hear this, won't you
Come and pick your girlfriend up?
She been talking in her sleep
And I think that I've had enough
She's been a wreck since you've been away
So Flo, if you have something to say
Florence, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Flo?
Florence, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Flo?
Florence, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Flo?
Florence, can you hear me?
