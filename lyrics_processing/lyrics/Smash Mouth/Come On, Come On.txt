Walking out of the door, I'm on my way
Can you tell me just where I'm goin'?
Occupational skills, would you give me a clue
What to do 'cause my mind's in motion?

Just trying to relax, I find myself on the couch
With big plans but there's always tomorrow
Is something wrong with me
Or the way that I'm thinkin'?

Come on, come on, and tell me why you're starin'
Come on, come on, it must be what I'm wearin'
Come on, come on, and tell me
Why's it takin' so long for you to recognize and stop

Another day in the sun I'm havin' fun
Feel the heat sneakin' up on me
I take a look in the sky, a plane goes by
Is that the reason that I can't breathe?

I take a look and I wonder why
Why these birds don't fly
It's hard for me to see and I believe
Oh my, oh my

Come on, come on, and tell me why you're starin'
Come on, come on, it must be what I'm wearin'
Come on, come on, and tell me
Why's it takin' so long for you to recognize and stop


I took a trip to the bar, does my money go far?
Can you show me just how to spend it?
Movin' around I like the sound
I find myself looking pretty stupid

If I had to guess, she's a he in a dress
I better slow my drinkin' down
If I don't get it together tonight
They're gonna run me out of town

Come on, come on, and tell me why you're starin'
Come on, come on, it must be what I'm wearin'
Come on, come on, and tell me
Why's it takin' so long for you to recognize and stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Come on, come on, and tell me why you're staring
