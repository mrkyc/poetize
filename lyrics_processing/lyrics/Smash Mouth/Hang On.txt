Things are getting weird, things are getting tough
Nothing's making sense but you keep on looking up
They tell you to be true, you're trying every day
You keep it on the real, still you gotta find a way
To make your mama happy, to make your papa proud
You gotta turn it up but all you hear is "tone it down"

So gather round, I'm here to say
You'll never make everybody's day
But while you're around, you might as well
Catch the tiger by its tail

And hang on, hang on, hang on, everybody
Just get on, get on, get on, get started
And go on, go on, go on
Everybody just hold on

Sometimes I wanna cry and throw the towel in
They try to beat me down but I'll take it on the chin
And everywhere I go the people are the same
They just wanna know that everything will be okay
When things are getting rough, you'll turn it back around
You gotta turn it up when they tell you "tone it down"

Everybody just hold on
