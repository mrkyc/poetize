I don't know why I'm with you
The only right thing I do is get along with you
And days go bye-bye for you
But they fly by for me, it's true

I talked to you late last night
You said it wasn't all right but it would be alright
And when you sleep by yourself
You're not alone I'm with you, ooh wee ooh

But you weren't listening
When I told you everything
That you need, I ain't got
You should be gone by now but you're not

I'll play guitar all night long
And I know hundreds of songs and I'll just play them all
And even when I get home
Somehow you're still alone, it's true

I don't know why you're with me
The only reason I see is some sort of fetish thing
Some people like to be pleased
And some like to be teased, which are you?

I tried to warn you
But you said, just play dead
As long as we stay true

But you weren't listening
When I told you everything
That you need, I ain't got
You should be gone by now but you're not

You're not

Did your head not receive the shape of everything
That you are and I am?
I should be happy as your man
You know I am

I play guitar all night long
And I know hundreds of songs and I'll just play them all
And when you sleep by yourself
You're not alone, I'm with you as long as we stay true
But you weren't listening
When I told you everything
That you need I ain't got
You should be gone by now but you're not

But you're not
But you're not
But you're not
But you're not
