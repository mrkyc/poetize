Tell me why we're all gluttons for pain
The girl is totally insane
She doesn't know the meaning of tame
Still I can't put out the flame

Hey hey, I wanna play
On the team that you despise

Every day a new disguise
Every night a Halloween
She says, "Keep the motor running, man"
Like I was some machine

You can talk, talk, but I'm keeping her stock
I wouldn't even change a thing

Why fight, you've got me roped and tied
I hit your baited line, I'm so diggin' your scene
I said, you're playin' with my head
I could split instead, I'm so diggin' your scene
See Smash Mouth LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like
On you like a hungry tick
Like a junkie knows he oughta kick
But I don't want to be dope sick
So I scramble for a fix

Voodoo, and sorcery too
I can't shake your freaky spell

Why fight, you've got me roped and tied
I hit your baited line, I'm so diggin' your scene
I said, you're playin' with my head
I could split instead, I'm so diggin' your scene

Can anybody tell me why we're Springer bound?
Why we feel so up when we're kept down
On a short leash behind a barbed wire fence
With no chance of parole on a life sentence

I'm so digging your scene

My friends tell me I should run
They say they think she's got a gun
But that just only turns me on
Right on, right on, right on
Hey hey, I wanna play
For the team that you despise

Why fight, you've got me roped and tied
I hit your baited line, I'm so diggin' your scene
I said, you're playin' with my head
I could split instead, I'm so diggin' your scene

Don't change, I love that you're deranged
You've got me trapped and caged, I'm so diggin' your scene
I said! You're playin' with my head
