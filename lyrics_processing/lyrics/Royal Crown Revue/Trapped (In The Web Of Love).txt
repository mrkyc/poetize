Who held the poison dart
I was game and you took aim
And struck me to the heart
Trapped in a web of love
Trapped in a web of love
Trapped in, trapped in
I'm trapped in a web of love
Love's a big witch doctor
Who stirred a brew for me
I took sips from your sweet lips
And now I can't get free
Trapped in a web of love
Trapped in a web of love
Trapped in, trapped in
I'm trapped in a web of love
Like a bird in a cage
Flapping it's wings in rage
I can't fly away
You've clipped my wings I've gots to stay
Love's a great big monster
With oh so many charms
It wrapped itself around my heart
With sixty million arms
