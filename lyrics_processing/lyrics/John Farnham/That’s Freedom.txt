Or what you think a love ought to be
I want something that's open and strong
As the country this road's moving on
From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom
It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring
I don't know why it takes so long
To remember
What the world's doin' wrong
Never wanted to shove my plan or another
Who can't understand
You might also likeAll I want is a fast lane
To where the road across this plain
Won't take you
I want something you understand
To make us stand proud
As nothing else can
That's freedom
It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring
It's a measure of trust
When love is alive
It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about
This opening up and letting out
Let freedom ring
From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom
It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live
And after the rain
Rekindle the spark
Let freedom ring
It's a measure of trust
When love is alive
It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about
This opening up and letting out
