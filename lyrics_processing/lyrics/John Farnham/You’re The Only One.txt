It started long ago
That you were mine
But as the story goes
You walked into my life
And tore me apart
At the seams
Then in a flash
You changed your mind again
And with a kiss
You took away my pain
I'm playing with fire
It's burning right through
To my soul
I've learnt my lesson
And you'd think I'd know
I'm going down
What a great way to go
Every mornin every evening
There ain't no time I ain't thinking 'bout
The way you smile
You're the one that drives me wild
You might also likeI was a fool
To think that you would stay
And in a breath you took
Your love away
What else can I do
But cry me
A river of tears
Now all my sunny days
Have turned to grey
Nothin' but stormy clouds
Have come my way
Oh, but deep down inside
I'm praying for lightning
To strike
Just when I think
I'm out of the rain
You want me back
And here I go again
Every mornin every evening
There ain't no time I ain't thinking 'bout
The way you smile
You're the one that drives me wild
When I'm waking
Or while I'm sleeping
There ain't no time I ain't dreaming 'bout
You by my side
Every time I look into your eyes
It's plain for me to see
You're the only one for me
Just when I think
I'm out of the rain
You call me up and
You try to explain
Just say I'm crazy
Like the fool that I am
You want me back
And here I go again
Every mornin every evening
There ain't no time I ain't thinking 'bout
The way you smile
You're the one that drives me wild
When I'm waking
Or while I'm sleeping
There ain't no time I ain't dreaming 'bout
You by my side
