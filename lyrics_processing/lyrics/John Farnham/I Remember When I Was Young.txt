I used to wonder about the Earth and how it moved around the Sun so Snappy

Sometimes I think about it It happens every day
I should think of the Present cause the Present Now

Growin older Meant you get to fly a saber Jet and fight a few wars
So id just sit there all day and let my mind decay somethin awful
Sometimes I think about it It happens every day
I should think of the Present cause the Present Now
Well I remember when I was Young I had a secret love who never knew it

And the day we had to part I had a broken heart but couldn't let on
So I spent my Holidays just thinkin of the ways I must be goin Wrong
Sometimes I think about it It happens every day
I should think of the Present cause the Present Now

Sometimes I think about it It happens every day
I should think of the Present cause the Present Now
Well I remember when I was Young Well I remember when I was Young I Surely do
