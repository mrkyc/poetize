Ahhh ah-ahhh-ah
Ahhh ah-ahhh-ah

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls. girls, girls

Yellow, red, black or white
Add a little bit of moonlight
For this intercontinental romance
Shy girl, sexy girl (whistle)
They all like that fancy world
Champagne, a gentle song and a slow dance

Who makes it fun to spend your money
Who calls you honey
Most every day

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
You might also like
Well, they made 'em up in HolIywood
Put them into the movies
Those lovely photographic splendours
In and out of magazines
Miss World and beauty queens
Falling in love with the real big spenders

But although their world may be frantic
They're still romantic, in their own way

So hop on
The world is swinging
Don't sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty
Girls, girls, girls
Step on
The world keeps swinging
Put on the dazzling charm
Get up and find those pretty girls

But don't rush, keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental
For that certain moment

Moonlit oceans
Girls full of emotions
Stepping on that slow boat to China
And next door, in Japan
They know how to please a man
Dropping in for tea with my geisha

They've got that old-fashioned feeling
When it comes to pleasing
They know their way

So hop on
The world is swinging
Don't sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty
Girls, girls, girls
Step on
The world keeps swinging
Put on the dazzling charm
Get up and find those pretty girls
But don't rush, keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental
For that certain moment, when you pull back the curtain

So hop on
The world is swinging
Don't sit and twiddle your thumbs
Get up and meet those pretty girls

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
