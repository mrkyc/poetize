I'm like that boom box outside of your window
I'm that Delorean blowing past 88
And where we're going girl
Won't be needing roads 'cause..
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
This ain't no 50 first dates

I'm talking 'bout starting out as friends
I'm talking 'bout real and not pretend
I'm talking 'bout roles of a life time
You and I can even write the end
Yeah...

Here comes that movie scene
The one you think is so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake pouring rain
I ain't no Superman
But I can change your world
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Here comes forever girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Here comes forever
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Here comes forever girl

This ain't no remake of a Romeo story
Ain't no werewolf trying to steal you away
I'll be your a-list be the man on the moon 'cause
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Me and you outta space

I'm talking 'bout starting out as friends
I'm talking 'bout real and not pretend
I'm talking 'bout roles of a life time
You and I can even write the end
Yeah...

Here comes that movie scene
The one you think is so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake pouring rain
I ain't no Superman
But I can change your world
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

Play our roles forever
