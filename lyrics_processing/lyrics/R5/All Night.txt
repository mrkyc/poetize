We're staying all night
Got blue jean baby playing in my mind
She gets me so high
Giving me faith, I gotta testify (Uh)
And the way that she walks, I can't hide it
If I said I don't like it, I'm lying
Hold tight, yeah
A little bit of love will change your life

She said I'm outta my head
I'm going out of my mind
And when I'm out on the edge, will you save me, save me?
Can we live for the moment?
Can we live for tonight?
Can we forget what was broken and say, say, say we'll be

Alright
'Cause even if we change, we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay, we'll never fade away
All night

And now it's midnight
And I can feel your electricity, hmm
Give me that skin tight
Good girls ain't ever making history, nope
And we'll dance in the streets 'til the morning
Never sleep when the city is calling
Hold tight
A little bit of love will change your life (Change your life)

All night

We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
And we got nothing but time
(We'll be alright)
To make the most of this life
(We'll be alright)
Take all the wrongs and the rights
(We'll be alright)
Forget them all and just say, say, say
Oh, won't you say it now?
We'll be alright
Alright
'Cause even if we change, we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay, we'll never fade away
Alright
'Cause even if we change, we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay, we'll never fade away
All night
