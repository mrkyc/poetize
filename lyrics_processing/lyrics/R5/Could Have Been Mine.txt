Mine (Mine), mine (Mine), mine (Mine), mine (Mine)

After all these years of trying
You think I have a clue
But all that I've been looking for is you, yeah
And I always have the words to say
But with you I can hardly speak
I missed my chance and you're moving on
To someone else, not me

And now my memories are haunting me
If I'd said what I felt inside

You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been
Could've been
Could've been
Should've been mine

Mine (Mine), mine (Mine)
You might also like
And I know that I'm not perfect
'Cause I can never read your mind
You can never call me Superman
I just wish I could turn back time, woah
And you see me hurt and
And you just watch me burn
If my life was a movie
Then I would get the girl

Now my memories are hauntin' me
If I had said what I felt inside

You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been mine (Eh, eh)
You could've been
Could've been
Could've been
Should've been mine

(Could've been, eh, eh)
(Could've been mine)
You should've been mine
(Could've been, eh, eh)
(Should've been mine)
You should've been mine
(Could've been, eh, eh)
(Could've been mine)
You should've been
You could've been
Could've been mine
And I'm trying to move on from the long gone
But you keep coming back, coming back
It just keeps playing back like a rerun
I can't get you out of my head
Uuh-uuuh
If I had said what I felt inside

You would've been mine (Eh, eh)
You would've been mine (Eh, eh)
You would've been mine (Eh, eh)
You would've been
You could've been
Should've been mine (He, he, mine)
Mine (Should've been mine), mine (You could've been mine)
You could've been
You could've been
Could've been mine
