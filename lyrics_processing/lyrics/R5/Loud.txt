Looking for the one tonight
But I can't see you
'Cause I'm blinded by all the lights, oh-oh
And I can't ever get it right
I need a breakthrough
Why are you so hard to find? Oh-oh

I've been searching every city
Never givin' up
'Til I find my angel
Diamond in the rough
Looking for a signal
Baby, turn it up tonight

Come on, get loud, loud, let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on, get loud 'til they shut us down
Come on, get loud, loud, let it out
Show me everything that you got
Come on, get loud, loud, I need you now
Baby, let me hear it loud
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You might also like
Looking for the light to shine
Start a fire
And girl, I'll be the first in line, oh-oh
And, baby, when the stars align
We can't get no higher
You just give me a sign

Come on, get loud, loud, let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on, get loud 'til they shut us down
Come on, get loud, loud, let it out
Show me everything that you got
Come on, get loud, loud, I need you now
Baby, let me hear it loud
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
