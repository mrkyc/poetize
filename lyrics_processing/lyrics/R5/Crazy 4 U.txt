I played it safe
I kept my foot up on the brake
I never really took a chance in life
And didn't live for today
Oh girl, and then I met you
Opened my eyes to something new
You know you set me free like no one else
And got me actin' a fool

Don't you know changed my life
Girl cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin'
And its going insane
You got me jumping outta aeroplanes, whoa
And that's why...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U
You might also like
Midnight dipping in the pool
Or sneaking out up on the roof
You're unpredictable and girl that's what
That's what I love about you

Don't you know changed my life
Girl cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin'
And its going insane
You got me jumping outta aeroplanes, whoa
And that's why...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U

No I didn't lose my mind when I fell for you (without a parachute)
And I'm gonna love you girl like you never knew (whoa)
Don't you know changed my life
Girl cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin'
And its going insane
You got me jumping outta aeroplanes, whoa
And that's why...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie...
I'm crazy its true
Crazy 4 U
