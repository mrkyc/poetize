Heart's beating faster
Might need some surgery
Natural disaster
You're taking over me
And I s-s-stutter, vision bl-blurry
There ain't no other
That brings me to my knees

And it gets so hot whenever we're alone
But I can't say I'm in love
No, I won't

I don't know what love is
But I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle
Yeah, it's perfectness
And I could say yes
Tell you "me too"
You say it first
It's easy for you
Even though I know that it's true
I can't say I'm in love
(Woah-uh-uh-uh-oh-oh woah!)
(Woah!)
Even though I know that it's true
(Woah oh ooh oh!)
I can't say I'm in love
You might also like
P-Paranoia
It's runnin' through my veins
I got to know ya
That was the end for me
And I know I've got you holding on
To words that I can't say
And everything you feel for me
Just know I feel the same

I don't know what love is
But I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle
Yeah, it's perfectness
And I could say yes
Tell you "me too"
You say it first
It's easy for you
Even though I know that it's true
I can't say I'm in love
(Woah-uh-uh-uh-oh-oh woah!)
(Woah!)
Even though I know that it's true
(Woah oh ooh oh!)
I can't say I'm in love
(Woah-uh-uh-uh-oh-oh woah!)
(Woah!)
Even though I know that it's true
(Woah oh ooh oh!)
I can't say I'm in love
Open up my heart
Open up my mind
Everything is changed
To color from black and white
Everything I see
Is a new reality
Baby, is this love?
(Yeah)
(Is this love?)
(Is this love?)
Yeah, this is love

I know what love is
And I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle
Yeah, it's perfectness
I could say yes
Tell you "me too"
I say it first
Only for you
I could say yes
Tell you "me too"
I say it first
Only for you
I'm starting to realize that it's true
(Woah oh ooh oh)
I say it first only for you
(Woah oh ooh oh)
There's only one thing left to do
(Say it!)
Baby, I love you
(Woah-uh-uh-uh-oh-oh woah!)
(Woah-uh-uh-uh-oh-oh woah!)
Baby, I'm in love with you!
(Woah oh ooh oh)
