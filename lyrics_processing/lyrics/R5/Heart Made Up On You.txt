Got my heart made up on you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

You said what you said
When words are knives, it's hard not to forget
But something in my head wouldn't reset
Can't give up on us yet, no, woah
Whoah, your love was so real
It pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I'd let you go but something's taking the wheel
Yeah, it's taking the wheel, oh, woah

My mind says, "No, you're not good for me
You're no good," but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give, got my heart made up on you

Ooh-ooh-oh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Got my heart made up on you
You might also like
I should be making a break
Up all night thinking I'm planning my escape
But this insomnia ain't going away
And now I'm back at your place, oh, no

My mind says, "No, you're not good for me
You're no good," but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give, got my heart made up on you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Got my heart made up on you

Look what you did, what you did, what you're doing to me
You got me searching for the words, like a silent movie
I can't breathe, I can't see, you're so out of control
But baby, honestly, my hands are up, I'm letting go
Got my heart made up on you

My mind says, "No, you're not good for me
You're no good," but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give, got my heart made up on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(My mind says no)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Got my heart made up on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Up on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-oh
