Loving you ain't easy, nothing ever is
But I will keep on fighting for a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love

This is a track for the guys with
One lady in their life
You wanna pull out your hair sometimes
But she's still your girl
A love that lasts, it's like a unicorn
Holding on, a lost art form
Sometimes you wanna throw in the towel
But she's still your girl

Loving you ain't easy, nothing ever is
But I will keep on fighting for a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it any other way
Even when times get tough, I don't want no easy love

Second verse goes to the females
Rolling their eyes when we fail
Make you wanna go and shop retail
But he's still your man
Are we crass? Undeniable
Dirtbags, we're professional
Sometimes you wanna throw in the towel
But he's still your man
You might also like
Loving you ain't easy, nothing ever is
But I will keep on fighting for a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it any other way
Even when times get tough, I don't want no easy love

I don't believe in nothing lasts forever
And every time you're feeling down
I know we're gonna work it out
And I know we can't live without each other
Oh, oh
But nothing worth having comes easy
And baby, you got me singing

Loving you ain't easy, nothing ever is
But I will keep on fighting for a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it any other way
Even when times get tough, I don't want no easy love

Loving you ain't easy, nothing ever is
But I will keep on fighting for a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it any other way
