Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid love

I never cared 'bout my stupid hair
Before you came into my life, babe
I would have never seen that my eyes were green
'Till I laid them right on you, babe

Won't you come and stay a while?
Electrified, you blow my mind
In every single way (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid, love
I'm losing all control, oh, oh
Whatever it takes, baby
It's crazy, stupid, love
A feeling through your bones, oh, oh
We got that crazy, stupid, love

People say that chicks will make you do
A crazy thing or two
But I don't care what people say
Cause you, ha, you
You might also like
Make me feel like I can fly
Electrified, you blow my mind
In every single way (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid, love
I'm losing all control, oh, oh
Whatever it takes, baby
It's crazy, stupid, love
A feeling through your bones, oh, oh
We got that crazy, stupid, love
We got that crazy, stupid, love

I've seen the way you've been shining lately
Put your hands all up on me, baby
Feel the way that you're movin' makes me say, "Woah-oh-oh-oh"
I've seen the way you've been shining lately
Put your hands all up on me, baby
Feel the way that you're movin' makes me say, "Woah-oh-oh-oh"
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid, love
I'm losing all control, oh, oh
Whatever it takes, baby
It's crazy, stupid, love
A feeling through your bones, oh, oh
We got that crazy, stupid, love (Wherever we go)
We got that crazy, stupid, love (Wherever we go)
We got that crazy, stupid, love (Wherever we go)
We got that crazy, stupid, love (Wherever we go)
Crazy, stupid, love (Yeah; oh, oh)
