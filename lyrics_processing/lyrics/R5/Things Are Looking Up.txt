You were a business, I was a startup
You were like high speed, I was on dial up
I needed caffeine, you were a Starbucks,  Starbucks
(A double shot)
You were a record, I was a remix
You were the sunshine, I was a raincheck
You needed time, but you were my Rolex
(My Rolex)

I couldn't get it right
Until you opened up my eyes
You turned my whole world upside down

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up, even when I'm down
Had about enough, looking at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
You might also like
You were a diamond, I was a coal mine
You were a freeway, I was a stop sign
I was a paycheck, you're like a gold mine
A gold mine
(Money honey)

I couldn't get it right
Until you opened up my eyes
You turned my whole world upside down

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up, even when I'm down
Had about enough, looking at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up

I've been up and I've been down
Girl, you make my world go 'round
There's nothing like the high I found
Things are looking up, things are looking up
I've been up and I've been down
Girl, you make my world go 'round
There's nothing like the high I found
Things are looking up, things are looking up
Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up, even when I'm down
Had about enough, looking at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking, things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up, even when I'm down
Had about enough, looking at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
