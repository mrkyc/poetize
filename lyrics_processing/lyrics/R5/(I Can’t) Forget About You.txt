Oh no, here we go
Hear your voice on the radio
Like every single song is about you, uh
Every sec that we spent
Like cement stuck up in my head
Got me so distracted and confused

Baby, I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losin' track of time
I'm so messed up, yeah
I'm so messed up!

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?
Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you
Ooh ooh oh (forget about you)
You might also like
Think that it's comin' back
Something about the time we had
Wish that we would've been recordin'
So right, super tight
Can't recall a thing last night
But woke up with a smile in the morning

Baby, I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losin' track of time
I'm so messed up, yeah
I'm so messed up!

I can't remember what I did tonight (did tonight)
Or even yesterday
Like, dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name? (excuse me what's my name)
Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you
Ooh oh oh forget about you
Forget about you
I just can't forget about you
(Yeah, you, you, you)
Forget about you
(Oh, I just can't forget about you)
Which way is up? Which way is down?
Can't stop this room from spinning 'round
I'm floating high, high off the ground
Caught in my head, can't get you out

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name? (oh oh ohhhh)

Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you
(Ooh ooh oh) ooh forget about you
I just can't forget about you (ooh oh ooh)
Forget about you

Oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoah, oh
