Drop top, sitting next to Cee-Lo
Pacific coast highway
This happens every day
And our song keeps playing on the radio
Like 20 times a day
Man this is so crazy

Keep seeing pretty ladies walking round' in high heels in LA
What can I say?
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are looking fine today
It's getting hot, you see

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls, like the way they move
All the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls
Valley girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
You might also like(Cali girls)
Valley girls when they take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night
I like them Cali girls
Valley girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

All kinds of model girls laying out at Venice Beach
The ones in magazines, they're hanging out with me
(They're hanging out with me)
And Katy Perry wasn't lying when she told ya (uh-huh)
You know them Cali girls, they really rock my world, oh

Short skirts, so hot, lookin' right in every way
What can I say?
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are looking fine you say
"It's like this everyday!"

When you got Cali girls
Valley girls, like the way they move
All the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls
Valley girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
(Cali girls)
Valley girls, let me take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night
I like them Cali girls
Valley girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

I can't get those Cali girls out of my head
I can't get those Cali girls out of my head
I like them Cali Girls

Cali girls
Valley girls, like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls

Not too hard to see

Valley girls let me take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night

Valley girls, When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
Cali girls
Valley girls, like the way they move
All the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls
I like them Cali girls
Valley girls, when they look at me
Not too hard to see
