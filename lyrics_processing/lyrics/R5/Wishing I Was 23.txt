Maybe she's just too old for me
Living in a teenage fantasy
Baby there's so much we could be
She's got me wishing
Wishing I was 23

Yeah, she's crazy but I don't care
She's sexy and she's a millionaire
The way she gets me is so unfair
Not youre typical rich girl
She's smoking hot, if you know what I mean
Tight jeans and she loves her photography
And everything that's in between
She's been around the world

And I know
She's graduated
And I'm not
Quite educated
I'm young, you know
Age is overrated

Maybe she's just to old for me
Living in a teenage fantasy
Baby there's so much we could be
Every time I'm with her
Calling me a dreamer
Maybe she's just out of my reach
Maybe her boyfriend's a marine
Even though I'm nameless (Hey!)
She's famous (Hey!)
She's got me wishing
Wishing I was 23

Wishing I was 23
Woah-oh
I've got her wishing
Uh-yeah

I think about her everyday
Going insane thinking about what to say
What am I doing anyway?
Am I even on her radar?

And I know
She's graduated
And I'm not
Quite educated
I'm young, you know
Age is overrated

Maybe she's just to old for me

She's got me wishing
Wishing I was 23
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Wishing I was 23
Woah-oh
She's got me wishing
Wishing I was 23

And if I was older
She would let me take her
To watch the stars at night
We can dance, we can kiss
Underneath moonlight
And if it got colder
She would let me hold her
Wrapped up in fairytales (Ooh)
Got to wake up from this dream
Oh, yeah

Maybe she's just to old for me
Maybe her boyfriend's a marine
Even though I'm nameless
She's famous
She's got me wishing
Maybe she's just out of my reach
Maybe her boyfriend's a marine

She's got me wishing
Wishing I was 23

Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Wishing I was 23
Woah-oh

I've got her wishing
Wishing she was 17
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Wishing I was 23
Woah-oh-oh, yeah
