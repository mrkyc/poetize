Ring the alarm, it's getting dark
Can't see my shadow
This broken town is breaking me down
I grab my things and go, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Climb up on top out of this box to feel the daylight
Unlock the doors, there's something more
And all that I don't know, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I got nine lives here in this wasteland, don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground
Don't need nobody to save me
Give up, you know I'm never slowing down
Free fall, I wanna feel it all
I got nine lives, not gonna waste it, don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

Don't need a map, keep me on track
I'll find my own road
Don't got a dime, but I got time to wait for tomorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna get lost in the city of lights
Jump off the edge of the world tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't need nobody to save me
Give up, you know I'm never slowing down
Free fall, I wanna feel it all
I got nine lives, not gonna waste it, don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

I'm never gonna hit the brakes
I, I keep running 'till the better days
You know I'm never slowing down
I, I, I'll drive this car into the ground

Ring the alarm, it's getting dark
Can't see my shadow

I grab my things and go

I got nine lives, not gonna waste it
