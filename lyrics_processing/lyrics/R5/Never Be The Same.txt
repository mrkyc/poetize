You don't need no money, money
Start a fire just get rowdy, rowdy
C'mon now baby, d-d-don't ignore it
Natural like bees and honey
Don't keep me waiting for it

You're trying for more, but dancing in the friend zone
Baby, I'm bored
This game is so Nintendo
Kick in the door, break in through the window
It's time to go

You're the one, the one I want
So shut your mouth, and turn it on
Don't complicate it, goin' native
(Right now at this moment things will never be the same, yeah)
I need something, something more
So whatcha, whatcha waiting for?
This conversation's overrated
(Right now at this moment things will never be the same, yeah)

You only get one life so live it, live it
You know I want it now so give it, give it
We all regret the didn'ts, not the did's
And I can't wait another minute
Get wild a little bit
You might also like
You're trying for more, but dancing in the friend zone
Baby, I'm bored
This game is so Nintendo
Kick in the door, break in through the window
It's time to go

You're the one, the one I want

Don't complicate it, goin' native
Right now at this moment things will never be the same, yeah
I need something, something more

Let's burn this bridge (What, what?)
Let's burn this bridge (What, what?)
Let's burn this bridge (What, what?)
Tonight is it
Regret the didn'ts and not the did's
Let's make fire, pass the kerosene
I'll get mine, before they bury me
Have your cake, eat assuredly
Let's go hard, and make it barely
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Kick in the door (I want a little more)
We gonna do it like we never did before
You're the one, the one I want
So shut your mouth, and turn it on
Don't complicate it, goin' native
(Right now at this moment things will never be the same, yeah)
I need something, something more
So whatcha, whatcha waiting for?
