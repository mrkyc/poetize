Outside of the party, where it's getting too loud
It feels like we're the only ones alone in the crowd
Chat college and politics in time that we spend
You look back, and you say you think you lost all your friends

And I'm hoping that it's all my fault
Yeah, I'm hoping that it's all my fault

Hey, let's not be alone tonight
Hey, let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
No, it don't, no, it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)

Not wrong if you come on strong, 'cause life is too short (yeah)
I like how we get along like snow and New York (yeah)
All good if you change your mind, you know where I stand (yeah)
Look back, and I say to you, "I lost all my friends"

And I know you know it's all your fault
Yeah, I know you know it's all your fault

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (yeah)
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la (yeah)
And we might never feel the same
I'm just glad that you came
Am I right or is it all in my head?
