I was blown away
Busy disappearing 'til I saw your face
In the stratosphere
And now I can't escape
The force field that we're in got me lightyears away
So out of space
Without a trace

Baby, we're gone, baby, we're gone
Come on

Ain't no way we're going home
Let's stay on the run forever
Let's go nowhere that we know
Get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
What you wanna do?
Baby, we can do better
Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go

Burning air
You lit a fire, feel like millionaires
Blacktop to tires, let's get outta here
And you make it brighter when we can't see the road
Where does this go?
God only knows
You might also like
Oh, baby, we're gone, baby, we're gone
Come on

Ain't no way we're going home
Let's stay on the run forever
Let's go nowhere that we know
Get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
What you wanna do?
Baby, we can do better
Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go

I'm a light, you're the bomb
We're together!
I'm the pop, you're the rocks
We're together!
I'm the write, you're the song
We're together, yeah
Together, yeah
Lightyears away
So outta space
Without a trace
Baby, we're gone, baby, we're gone
Come on

We can do what you wanna do
What you wanna do?
Baby, we can do better
Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go

Ain't no way we're going home
Let's stay on the run forever
Let's go nowhere that we know
Get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
What you wanna do?
Baby, we can do better
Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go

Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
