It's hard to speak
Mumbling my poetry
But talk is cheap, uh
Your body's saying other things
No need to fear
'Cause the crew is here
If tonight you're free (Tonight you're free girl)
Oh come and get a groove with me

Flowing like no other
Can I get another?
Must be nice to look like that, yeah
Who gave you my number?
They deserve a pay bump
Who taught you to move like that?

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me 'cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

(Yeah) Woo (Hey, hey)
Hey (Hey)
You might also like
A killer queen, yeah
Never really as she seems
A superfreak (A superfreak)
She's stalling with her magazines
Well, I'm right here
And I volunteer
If tonight you're free (Tonight)
Oh come and get a groove with me (Ooh)

Hey, I know you're trouble
Pouring me a double
Damn, it's nice to feel like that
You're my biggest wonder
I think I could love ya
Must be nice to live like that

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me 'cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

(Yeah) Woo (Hey, hey)
Hey (Hey)
Ooh, baby
My head aches, my heart aches, I'm awake, I'm alive
My head aches, my heart aches, I'm awake, I'm alive

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

(Yeah) Woo (Hey, hey)
Hey (Hey)

Hurts good to want ya
