Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, I know

Hair down, so you hide
A drug for my eyes
I've been needin' some, you been needin' some
Maybe a little too much
Slow down, in your time
No, you don't need to rush
I've been drinkin' some, you been drinkin' some
Maybe a little too much

'Cause all my days seemed like they were getting so lonely lately
I couldn't take it much longer baby, no baby, mmm
So tell me lady, do you feel like I do?
Are you craving someone to hold you?
And as the sun comes up and sets the stars

Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, yeah I know

Face found, Calvin Klein
Her bank don't need love
I've been dreamin' some, have you been dreamin' some?
Maybe a little too much
Flown down to an isle
The rum is dyed blue
We've been drinkin' some, you been a drinkin' some
Maybe a little too much

The things you're saying, keeping me high, my apothecary
Give me your stories to go baby, no baby, mmm
So, tell me babe, you feelin' the love that I'm feeling lately?
Nowhere I'd rather be
As the sun comes up and sets the stars

Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, yeah I know
'Cause all my days seemed like they were getting so lonely lately
I couldn't take it much longer baby, no baby, mmm

Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darlin'
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give you somethin'
