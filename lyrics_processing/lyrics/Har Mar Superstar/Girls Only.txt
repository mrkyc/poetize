The former friends will never end
You can feel the beat
When the sisters meet
Me and the girls rock you out of your seat
It's what we feel 'cause we keep it real
Keep an open ear, communication clear
'Cause whats a world without your girl
Like an empty shell without the pearl
I got cute little cuticles
That is indisputable
May not be perfect
But I know that I'm beautiful
Senorita chica girls, loud and free
All I need to succeed is inside of me
Girls only tonight, we have to believe
That we got it right, all your boys can leave
We love the way you stare at us in your dreams
If you're with us ladies, let us hear you scream
Alright (alright), tonight (tonight)
Me and the girls gonna take you on a ladies' night
Alright (alright), boys out of sight (out of sight)
Me and the girls gonna take you on a ladies' night

Not getting fazed by the things they say
They call it fun, dance in the sun
Got a unique talent to get this thing done
Got messed up doubts, gotta work it out
The impression clean, a personality, it's a gorgeous day
Got no complaints because the girlfriends are on the way
I got cute little cuticles
They are manicurable
May not be perfect
But I know that I'm beautiful
Senorita chica girls loud and free
All I need to succeed is inside of me
Girls only tonight, we have to believe
That we got it right, all your boys can leave
We love the way you stare at us in your dreams
If you're with us ladies, let us hear you scream

Me and the girls gonna take you on a ladies' night
Come on, ladies, clap with me
Everybody say yeah (yeah)
Uh huh, yeah, right, ladies' night, uh
Now let's end it with a pillow fight
I got cute little cuticles
That is indisputable
May not be perfect
But I know that I'm beautiful
