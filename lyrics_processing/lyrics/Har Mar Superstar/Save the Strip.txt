Fresh faced these city lights
(Lights)
Stars all chase
Ain't got nothing but suitcase
Country boy peeping L.A
Following down the first alley
Her love was free
But her time was gonna cost
(Money, my baby)
She said, "I won't let you go that easy
See my man
(Staring)
Down the street"
Lady, this seems so
Seedy
(You can have a taste)
The devil in my mind is greedy
Too trusting
I know these streets are mean
Come join my team
Guess I could float you $20 if you're clean
You might also likeI was sent to take the strip
Back from the grave you
Motherfuckers dropped it
Keeping up the nasty shit
(Scare them straight)
By the crew in it
I was sent to save the strip
Up from the trash that
Swallowed it
Crack it open and take a sip
And let the sluts know who's running it
All the things I've seen, local and overseas
(Metamorphosis)
Transformed me to a super freak
No, the change worked clean came week to week
Permeated my machine like a slow-drip leak
(Well, I'm a superhero)
Watch me hypnotize
Pendulum for your eyes between my thighs
(Back at the lab)
You could watch that rise
When the sunset gonna hit my stride
Never let a lady straight take my dough
If you think you're mad now
(Well, I'm a super ho)
Well, I'm a cum rag girl, keep your shit at home
Empty out my glands come back for more
You gotta kill a new dude
(Puppy botox face)
Don't look to the past, it's been erased
(We ain't having that now)
Not even a trace
You found the place to filate
And I pick up the pace
Are you looking for a thrill candy?
I can taste
(River)
Dripping from your panties
We all getting so Randy
One more night
Twisted by a little brandy
My, to tease to save the party
They come in threes
My priorities are me and me and me
Gather up in style at the hotel
Mini bar
(Empty)
It's no motel no tell
Come on baby, ride
Coattails
(We'll get it free)
We're the kings of every castle
Too trusting
I know these streets are mean
Come join my team
Guess I could float you $20 if you're clean
I was sent to take the strip
Back from the grave you
Motherfuckers dropped it
Keeping up the nasty shit
(Scare them straight)
By the crew in it
I was sent to save the strip
Up from the trash that
Swallowed it
Crack it open and take a sip
And let the sluts know who's running it
I was sent to take the strip
Back from the grave you
Motherfuckers dropped it
Keeping up the nasty shit
(Scare them straight)
By the crew in it
I was sent to save the strip
Up from the trash that
Swallowed it
Crack it open and take a sip
