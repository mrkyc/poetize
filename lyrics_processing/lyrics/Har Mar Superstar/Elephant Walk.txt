Come a tumbelin' to the floor?
We're all in the mood for some movement
But our ankles are getting sore
Though we can't hold back
We must break loose
And keep the people rockin all night long
Lift it up please
Raise your knees, because the elephant walk is on
Crane your neck and lower your head
And keep it swingin' from left to right (Get on the floor)
Turn out your feet 45 degrees
And bend your knees till it's feelin' light
Har Mar
It's hard for me to identify normality or reality
In a world that is so full of surreal-ism is there a prism my vision is dependant on to decide whether what i see is fantasy or fact let me tell you I wonder
I saw a man on the other side of the dance floor gettin' down, He moved from left to right like I never seen before as his head hung towards the ground
I said, what you call that dance young man some kinda glide?
He said, no
It's more like a walk
It's the elephant walk, go ahead and try
Crane your neck and lower your head
And keep it swingin' from left to right
Turn out your feet 45 degrees
And bend your knees till it's feelin' light

Permenant fixtures twist your knot
Raise those knees 90 degrees
Impressions left and metcha needs
For Clark and Har Mar angels sing
Turn to fiends and cream your jeans
We like that movement
Keep it groovin' work 'em side to side
You wonder why we rock so fly
It's all just part of life
We bring the meanings that keep ringing
Deep inside your mind
Saturate your party place
With licks that hit like kind
We are the best so lose that dress
It's Har Mar Clarkin' time
