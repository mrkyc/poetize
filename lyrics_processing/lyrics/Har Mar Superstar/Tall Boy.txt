There's no place to go
So, shed your clothes
Let's stop, drop & roll
I need a tall boy to crack it open with me
Don't be shaking (phssst)
C'mon man, I'm thirsty
Where's my tall boy, to satisfy my needs?
I feel like drinking, so come on, get inside of me
Me and my girlz gonna roll now
I know ya wanna check us out
Beats in the back seat blow, aw
Turn the whole scene down
Still talking shit about Monday
The weekend is over now
Not meeting no one halfway
Amateurs, get the hell out!
I don't see no ashtray
So I'm gonna use the ground
Ladies, last call for hairspray!
Back door is open now
You might also likeWe'll get the parties jumping
Everything is flowing for free
Gonna grab a piece of something
Take it home with me
I need a tall boy
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce:
I need a tall boy to get me outta the house -
Having one right now, cold shiny can)
Come on man, I'm thirsty, where's my tall boy?
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce:
I need a tall boy to have a rolling around -
And another now, cold shiny can)
Come on get inside of me
(Take me take me take me)
Don't think I'm falling in love now
This is nothing but pure lust
Gonna use you up and get out
Like the cans I crush
Your pu-puppy eyes are broken
I'm not trying to be mean
Queen of the party's spoken:
Jump on the floor with me!
I can feel the fire door empty
DJ is killing my groove
Just got the text you sent me:
Time to make a move
Maybe not go back to my house
Straight up to the V.I.P.,
All the pretty people lying on the couch -
Till we get on the scene
I need a tall boy
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce:
I need a tall boy to get me outta the house -
Having one right now, cold shiny can)
Come on man, I'm thirsty, where's my tall boy?
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce:
I need a tall boy to have a rolling around -
And another right now, cold shiny can)
Come on get inside of me
I-I'm..on..f-fire baby
There's no place to go
I'm on fire baby
We'll s-stop, d-drop and r-roll
(I need a tall boy)
F-fire baby, there's no place to go -
So sh-sh-shed your clothes
We'll stop, drop and roll
I need a tall boy
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce)
To crack it open with me
(I need a tall boy to get me outta the house)
Help me shake it!
(having one right now, cold shiny can)
C'mon man, I'm thirsty
Where's my tall boy
(Baby, pound for pound, baby, ounce for ounce)
To satisfy my needs?
(I need a tall boy to get me outta the house)
Feel like drinking

C'mon man, I'm thirsty
