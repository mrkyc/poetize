I rode one day to the cowtown of San Angelo
A hot sun was glowing, a hot breeze was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss
She sent a message a long time ago
Secora had promised to meet me in San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl
I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few minutes more and she'll be at my side
At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Secora, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet
But something is wrong with our plans and I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street
Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see
You might also likeBack of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Secora, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street
"Up on your horse", she is crying
"Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for you"
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone
For a bullet is well on its way and it finds my Secora
She cries as she falls in my arms
Over and over her soft lips did say
"Now we're together, I won't let them take you away"
One little sigh, her little lips tremble
Then it was over, Secora had drifted away
Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I rise to meet him, my one thought it beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die
I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to die
Their bullets are coming my way, how they hurt when they hit me
The pain makes me fall to the ground
Gone is my strength, just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life
If I must die, let me find Secora
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left
Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the pain
Life is no more but we're together
