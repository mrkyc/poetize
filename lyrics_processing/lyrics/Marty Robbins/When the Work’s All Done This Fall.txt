Discussing plans at ease
Said one, "I'll tell you something, boys
If you will listen, please"
"I am an old cow puncher
And here I'm dressed in rags
I used to be a tough one
And go on great big jags"
"Once I had a home, boys
And a good one you all know
Though I haven't seen it since
Long long years ago"
"I'm going back to Dixie
Once more to see'em all
Yes, I am going home, boys
When the work's all done this fall"
"Now when I left my home, boys
My Mother for me cried
She begged me not to go, boys
For me she would have died"
"My mother's heart is breaking
I've broken it that's all
But with God's help I'll see her
When the work's all done this fall"
You might also like"When the roundup days are over
And the shipping all is done
I'm going right straight home, boys
Before my money's gone"
"I have changed my way, boys
No more will I fall
Yes, I am going home, boys
When the work's all done this fall"
That very night the cowboy went out
To stand his guard
The night was dark and cloudy
And storming very hard
The cattle, they got frightened
And rushed in wild stampede
The cowboy tried to turn them
While riding at full speed
While riding in the darkness alone
He did shout
He did his best to head them
And turn the herd about
His saddle horse did stumble
And on him he did fall
He'll not see his mother
When the work's all done this fall
"Boys, send my Mother my wages
The wages I have earned
"'Cause I am afraid, boys
My last steer I have turned"
I'm going to a new range
I hear my Master's call
Yes, I am going home, boys
When the work's all done this fall"
"Fred, you take my saddle
Jim, you take my bed
Johnny, take my pistol
After I am dead"
"Think about me kindly
As you look upon them all
I'll not see my mother
When the work's all done this fall"
Charlie was buried at sunrise
No tombstone at his head
Nothing but a thin board
And this is what it said
"Poor Charlie died at daybreak
He died from a fall
He'll not see his mother
