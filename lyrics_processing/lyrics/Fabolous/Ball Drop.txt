Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990
We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989
The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'em
Oh, can you ever hear 'em
They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990; goodbye to the 80's
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Happy new year!

Woah, woah, woah

When that hate don't work they start telling lies (Woah, woah, woah)
