Run by a flag in the front yard
See a kid on a bike throwin' papers in a drive
And a man stackin' hay in a red barn
There's a father and a son with a BB gun
Shootin' bottles off a trashcan lid
And a mat on the floor by a dog on the porch
Says, y'all come on in
That's where we live, that's where we love
That's where we pray and raise our babies
Where we fry that chicken, talk in the kitchen
'Bout what's been happenin' lately
Where we get baptized, where we throw the rice
While the world goes round again
That's where we live
We walk through the house, see our mama's old couch
We got when we were 'bout fifteen
Red ribbon on the mirror from the 4-H fair
When we took second place with our Holstein
Where the honeysuckle grows on an old fence row
That runs up over the ridge
Where we sing Amazing Grace, pass the plate
And give all we can give

That's where we pray and raise our babies
Where we fry that chicken, talk in the kitchen
'Bout what's been happenin' lately
Where we get baptized, where we throw the rice
While the world goes round again
That's where we live
That's where we live
It's so much a part of you, you don't have to go back
Everyone you know will always know that
That's where we live, where we're gonna die
That's where we live
That's where we live, that's where we love
That's where we pray and raise our babies
Where we fry that chicken, jaw in the kitchen
'Bout what's been happenin' lately
It's where we get baptized, where we throw the rice
While the world goes round again
That's where we live
Yeah, that's where we live
That's where we live
