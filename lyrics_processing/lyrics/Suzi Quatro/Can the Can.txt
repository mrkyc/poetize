And we all know you are lying
And your boyfriend's name is eagle
And he lives up in the sky (High, high)
Watch out the tiger don't go claw the eagle's eye
But let the eagle take the tiger by surprise
(Scratch out her eyes)
So make a stand for your man, honey
Try to can the can
Put your man in the can, honey
Get him while you can
Can the can
Can the can
If you can
Well can the can
Well your sister's got the feline touch
She touches up your mind
And your eagle lover likes his little bit of evil
Loving all the time
Don't let the cat get into the eagle's nest at night
Because the eagle could say 'yes' without a fight
(Scratch out her eyes)
So make a stand for your man, honey
Try to can the can
Put your man in the can, honey
Get him while you can
Can the can
Can the can
If you can
Well can the can
