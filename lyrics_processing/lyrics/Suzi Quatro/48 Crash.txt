And the face of a little boy blue
And when you stand you're so grand
There's a case just for looking at you
You're so young
You could have been the devil's son
You're so young
But like a hang up I'll be sad
When you're old and you're gone
Watch Out!
You know the 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash
(48 Crash, 48 Crash)
And the 48 Crash is a silk sash bash
(48 Crash, 48 Crash)
48 Crash, 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash
A lightning flash
And it's a silk sash bash
A silk sash bash
That's the 48 Crash
You've got the kind of a mind
Of a juvenile Romeo
And you're so blind you could find
That your motor ain't ready to go

You're a hot shot son of a gun
You're so young
But like a teenage tearaway
Soon, you'll be torn and you'll run
Watch Out!
You know the 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash
(48 Crash, 48 Crash)
And the 48 Crash is a silk sash bash
(48 Crash, 48 Crash)
48 Crash, 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash
A lightning flash
And it's a silk sash bash
A silk sash bash
That's the 48 Crash
