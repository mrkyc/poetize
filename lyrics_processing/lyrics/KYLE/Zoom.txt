And I zoom
Yep, yep
Yep, yep yep
Yep, yep yep
Yep, yep yep

And I zoom right on past my problems
Henny in my hand, I ain't got no time to solve 'em
Listen, please approach your early 20s with some caution
GPS my way back to myself, I thought I lost it

Got a hunnid miles 'fore I crack another smile, oh
I ain't in denial, I know this is just a trial though
Everything is fine, I know it's 'gon take some time though
Yeah, yeah
Nigga, I'll be good like I said I would (Woo)

I get by, yeah
With my baby by my side, oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
You and I (Ooh)
Bumpin' "Cranes in the Sky," oh my, my (My, my)

Pour up a drink and give me some more
Ain't in a rush, I'm livin' it slow
One day, we all, we all, we all go
One day, we all, we all, we all go
Pour up a drink and give me some more
Ain't in a rush, I'm livin' it slow
One day, we all, we all, we all go
One day, we all, we all, we all go

They ain't hittin' my phone, no bleep bleep
I'm up all night, no sleep, sleep
But lose my stride, no way, way
Hitting behind the back shots like DP (Swish)
Money shot, I mean, money, money got
See a lot of awesome places, but happiness, it did not
I don't get fooled by the fakes
I won't get killed by these cops
I know I'm gon' be myself, I know that's somethin' that I've got
I know that I get a lot of hate from niggas I am not
I am so far from a flop and yet so close to the top

And I zoom right on past my problems
Henny in my hand, I ain't got no time to solve 'em
Listen, please approach your early 20s with some caution
GPS my way back to myself, I thought I lost it
