Ain't no personal thing

Uh, what's up?
Aw, damn it, baby, you bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard you got a boyfriend
That's cool, girl, where is he at?
Ooh, he fucked up, you lucked up
You done ran into the motherfuckin' man
Gonna make you my bae for a day
He should be happy I'm givin' you back
'Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone fuck with my akachan
Tell 'em they'll get fuckin' Jackie Chan'd
Honestly, I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda shitty as your man
Let's go back to only bein' friends
Sorry, girl, I hope you understand, it's just

I don't wanna fall in love (Nope; no, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right; woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (So good, so good; baby)
I'll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh; woo, woo)

That wasn't the plan (Woo, woo)
And I knew a girl just like you once (No, no; you once)
We ended up hatin' each other (Hatin' each other)
'Cause we couldn't let it end (No, no; no, no, no)
That can't happen again, no (Woo, woo)

Someone put 'em up, ding-ding-ding
Pulling at my heart strings, zing-zing-zing
When I'm tryna let go
Like, it's hard enough to leave you alone
With the phone goin' ring-ring-ring
Please let me go 'cause I don't wanna fall in love
'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn't even let me know (Word?)
Nigga, she ain't even leave me notes
Part of the reason I'm easily hurt
Part of the reason I'm leavin' you first
Pardon that part of me, give my apologies
I know that workin' on it never works
And I'm sorry it's you, but, hey, what should I do?
Be happy with lies or be sad with the truth?
Don't be ashamed, you see, love is a game and I still wanna play
I'm just too scared to lose and I know you are too
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
(But it's, it's good, you know?)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
(I mean, we're young, we don't need to be all tied down)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
(You know, honestly, fuck this shit, um)
I'll fight you 'til the end (Woo, woo)
(Yo, let's just boogie, a'ight? Yeah)
I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)

I don't wanna fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife (Woo, woo)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
