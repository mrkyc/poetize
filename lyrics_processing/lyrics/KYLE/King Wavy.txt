Ayy, cut that down right quick
Ayy attention, attention please
I gotta a message from King Wavy himself
These stank booty niggas copy cat
Hate perpetrate are now underwater
Coming to the ocean, they ain't gonna take our shit
This is our wave, niggas got me hot bro

Hey Kyle how you doing? Oh yo, I'm good
Yeah doing fine, you know, checking Vine
And wishing bitch niggas would, you know
Same old same, same old flame
Hella change but nothing changed
You a nothing nigga with a nothing squad
And a nothing song that got nothing plays
Californi-motherfucking-ayy I've been up for days
Tryna make sure all my niggas paid every beat gets slayed
Sixteens sweeter than a rich girl birthday
Give your bitch a pool but she still act thirsty
Super-duper-destroyed niggas in the worst way
Mayweather verses, no one wanna verse me

Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Californi-motherfucking-ayy I've been up for days
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Yeah I'm king
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Right? King wavy
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Tryna make sure all my niggas paid

Doggie do, the fuck you think you're gonna do to me?
Besides nothing bruh?
You must be smoking on something weird
That's got you feeling all extra tough
You a stunt man and I'm stunting bruh
So who the fuck gets paid more? I do
All the lil niggas from the hood wanna fight you
And if I was a bitch I would act just like you
Go in, go in, nigga I go
How to come weak, huh nigga I don't know
Fire spittin' kid spittin' fire I roast
Quarterback hands lil nigga I throw (Pow pow)
This here sound like a real nigga theme song
Keep it flowing like I left the bathroom sink on
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga I keep going
Bay to LA anybody get Deebo'ed

Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Californi-motherfucking-ayy I've been up for days
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Yeah I'm king
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Right? King wavy
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Tryna make sure all my niggas paid
Hello, I'm back it's Gerald (Hello)
Come through in all black apparel (That's him!)
Come through in that black Camaro
Cause you know I'm getting that dinero
Just copped the loft with a crazy view
Flex on em like, "look what you made me do"
Try stunt on me I stunt on you
I ash my fucking blunt on you
Bay area bruh I rep for the coast
Cali's on fire I ain't even tryna boast
Hoes on the side like it's jelly on toast
If she gets too close then I hit her with the dos
Peace ho, got me pissed off
Edward Scissorhands I cut a bitch off
Headed to the top tell a bop get lost
'Cause I'm blowing up out of here, ready, lift off (Yee)

Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Californi-motherfucking-ayy I've been up for days
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Yeah I'm king
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
Right? King wavy
Wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy
