Oooooo
Lotta something
Swerve off like before
Run down like before
Swerve
Run like, run like

I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin'
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thuggin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of huggin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin'
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thuggin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of huggin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'

Uh, finding baes on @FoundBAE
I swear I spend way to much time on that damn page
Tell me why, tell me why you don't like me as much as my pictures, girl
Now that isn't the same, now that don't feel the same
Too much body for the phone, tryna to fit it all in frame
Let's have a hundred thousand kids
And try to give 'em all a name
And we can take 'em all to school
In a hundred limousines
And make a hundred thousand more and we can do it all again

I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin'
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time

I knew, I knew, I knew that we would be hard to be
Did you, did you, did you, did you know it's hard for me, yeah?
I know you miss me too but whenever you're not with me
Honestly I'm missing part of me (part of me)
Hey! It's the same thing, (cool) you knew me since back in the day, hey (cool)
You made me ride around when the flame came
Had to play the game, now I know that the game's lame
So tonight I just wanna go and like every one of your pictures
I got a hundred thousand girls, treat 'em all like my sisters
