Don't come to LA, nobody fucking with me
I go broke, rob fools for their jewelry
Stick your hand up like you guilty
Doing things that my mama said I shouldn't be
So don't come to LA, nobody fucking with me
I go broke, rob fools for their jewelry
Stick your hand up like you guilty
Doing things that my mama said I shouldn't be

'Cause y'all niggas fucking up the rep
Y'all playing with the set, it's really war around here
Shit, I'm even having problems in the set
But I'm really from the set, and y'all don't come around here
So when y'all niggas hop off your jet
You better tuck what's on your neck and get the fuck from 'round here

You wasn't banging out of town, it's too late to holla now

First off, this a no-fly zone
If you ain't laying with the chrome, better take your ass home
Like it's the first of the month, cash the checks and come on
Yeah, you better check in if you niggas want room
Look, one call on my phone
My Tiny Locs pull up, put that thing on your dome
Your money, chain and Rollie, sixty seconds, it's gone
Man, I'd rather tax a nigga, fuck a feature for songs (Give it up, buddy)
Run up on 'em like, "Nigga, what it C like?" (Give it up, buddy)
My niggas on go like sixty green lights
Just *static* got jacked tryna eat right
When my niggas off drugs, they don't think right
It's a recession, man, the hood fucked up
If a nigga ain't tripping, got the heat in the club
You walk around like you can't get touched
But JFK was the president and still got his head bust
