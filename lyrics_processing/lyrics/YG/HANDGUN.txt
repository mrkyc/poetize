I just bought me a handgun and that shit came with the drum
Do a nigga foul like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Uh-oh)
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
Eat it up then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Uh, uh, baddies, lumps
Uh, uh, Mr. Klumps

I was 13 with fake bling
When Killa Cam was on the corner with the pink mink
My little man was on the corner with the clink-clink
Gold bank, roll 8, gold links

Alert! Bomb first
Trained to go, fuck hesitation
Ten steps ahead, not just of enemy, but of all men
Set an example by demonstration, not conversation
Fear of God, but with God keep a faithful relation
Do the unthinkable
Pop up on that ass out the blue like peek-a-boo
All a man gots is his dick and his word
So whatever that man says, he gots to do
And if that pussy is yours, protect it by all means
Keep them real niggas, some top lawyers, financial advisors and them get-the-job-done riders on your team
And now you're ready for the world, yadadamean?
