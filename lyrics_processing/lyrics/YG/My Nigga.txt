(Mustard on the beat, ho)

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah

First thing's first, I love all my niggas
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, lemme call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all mine, nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think
I said, "That's a nigga, back up," they in a bucket lapped up
I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch, no, that ain't my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch, no, that ain't my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah, that's my nigga
Know him since I was eight, yeah, that's my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick, passed with my nigga (My nigga)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas
