Raised the rich
Called to get after that paper, No chasing a bitch
It was all a facade
I saw my uncle get money from women like it was a job
I was intrigued, left an impression on me
My brother was doing the same
He looked me dead in the face and said
"Ally you best to be thankful I'm giving you game."
I was in awe
Skip to when I'm an adult
Now I'm using these rappers like Hoes
They quote me for a feature
I looks at them laughing
Like nigga go add on some 0's
What you expect, I'm tryna eat 'for I'm dead
You tryna feed of my cred
You tryna hustle, but hustle somebody else nigga
Don't talk to me less its about bread
I don't give a fuck about a nigga now really
Learned about loss in the crescent park, Philly
Saw my little cousin lay dead in the alley that we fled
How the fuck you going to talk on my city
Silly ass rap nigga can't match my skill
I ain't kissing ass to attract no deal
I deliver venom through venomous appendages
Painting pictures with lyrics to illustrate my ills
Nigga don't know about me
Niggas don't know about Lock
Niggas don't know what its like
When you sacrifice half your life
For a dream other people try to tell you will never pay off
Never take off
Never feed you
Try to explain and they never believe you
Now I'm overseas getting money, doing shows
And it shows in your face you niggas see through
Yeah

I'm lyrically on a new level
I reveal in my independence
I begin a sentence with something so vintage
That it is cemented as being intended
As being my new opes
They chasing after hoes but its hopeless
I be with the broads but i never lose focus
I developed and validated and calibrated
Your success to be breached like a pussy when its open what if i told you that a nigga told me that i could never blow up unless i get a deal when shit really happened i was laughing in their face when they said i should do it to get mass appeal i was sick of being fed bullshit so i on my own , On my own split the bill give a fuck about a label put the contract on the table piss on then treat them all to a meal f-fuck what you stressing used to be heaven but now its depressing i see my music as using my talent for something that's bigger than what you're assessing niggas wanna talk now that's a blessing came along way from playing ball in the crescent came along way from graduated from Berkeley I ain't quitting till i hit Nicole and Bria Murphy fuck i just said it so you know i want it all not a Not a diss to Eddie but mother fucker I'm raw nigga I'm ready i ain't waiting for a call I've been waiting too long I've been humble to a fault i see it clear there is nothing to read though this is my year you niggas should regroup now I'm in you city doing shows and it shows in your face you niggas are see though Ah
