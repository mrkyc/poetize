Never been shit, never had shit, never thought I'd get this far
I remember when I would dream this, scared I would miss this part
I remember when I was sleepless, yeah I would wish this hard
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it, I embrace it, God
Fuck it, I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me (on God)
Fuck it, I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it, I embrace it, God

Never had a chance or a nice view of a life skewed or an ice cube shot in hell
Never had a plan, I would write through whatever hardships or garbage I could smell
Fell, but I never was derailed, was deemed well
I could only tread in the well so long (so long)
Scratch marks on the inside implies strength
And the concrete all in my palms
There was a distance because I was different
So I would just mimic what's cool
That false pretender will present an issue in his shoes
And that was enough to miss school
Felt too restricted, a fish in that pool, I swear
Any condition to ever through I beared
Tried to abandon the randomness
Pants were pissed, buckshot sprinkled the stairs
Fair skin, but I got a dark soul
Walking through the far snow, nobody would even notice the boy
Fast-forward, now they're hauling ass toward
Tryna get a grasp for anything I do
My voice became a beacon for anyone seeking to get out the deep-end, but still I grew
Pollinated in the concrete, underneath your feet, but still somehow got through
Richmond, California, Crescent Park
Let's embark, let's dive deep in the sewer
Underneath the skin come and meet the sin
They shape the landscape we escaped then maneuvered
Come and brake the bow, bow but don't hype me
Every death had an effect on my psyche
Every breath met with a test unless you wanna accept the missteps that just comes slightly
Pipe to the bitch that you love and covet
You can play polite or make light and shrug it
I was offered a deal worth quarter of a mill
I told them that I'd rather build, thought nothing of it (nah)
You can take the chance, take the advance
But understand my nigga that is just a loan
I would not accept the terms of interest
To invest in anything I can not own
I was thrown to the wolves to the wolves' surprise
I was hungry as him, no watered eyes
I was left in the den unable to make friends
So I walked through the hood in a wolf disguise
I followed my passion and followed with actions
I knew they were vital decided to write a new chapter
And go out do something that none of you niggas could rival
I...

I study the competition and look at the composition
They commonly accommodate with the comedy they be pitching
I solemnly, take admission to properly make revision
Niggas showing they ass like sodomy, rape in prison
They pissin' in the wind now
Metaphors get ignored, put the pen down
Is what they sellin' me, tellin' me to pretend now
The ingest was in jest an interest because we trend now
Money's the new God, pussy is currency
Attention is worth more than honesty currently
Encourage these niggas to test me is suicide
Assume a side or sue a side, you survived
You can die now, I care less, I'm careless
I kill rappers regardless who wears vests
Niggas will smile in your face while stabbing your back
Till they poke through to your bare chest
I wear less money and invest, I impress
Where intellect and talent intersect
Understand the balance, I been a threat
Still upset, waiting for niggas to interject like
Never been shit, never had shit, never thought I'd get this far
I remember when I would dream this, scared I would miss this part
I remember when I was sleepless, yeah I would wish this hard
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it, I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me (on God)
Niggas- fuck it, I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it, I embrace it, God
