America is slowly dying, of a self-inflicted wound from a weapon that we're supplying
The past seeds of hatred that race in our bloodstream, we can't agree to disagree on the most basic of things
What's a man? What's a woman? What's the shape of the Earth?
When does human life begin? At conception or during birth?
Meanwhile, the projects is more violent, and the Democratic party stay silent
Thats poverty pimpin'
Thats when politics are poverty driven
And they pander to poor communities to get moral impunity
Capitalism is a black man's hell
But Marxism comes from Europe as well
It's not African
So pick a side to collect from
We run away from one slave master into the arm's of the next one
And every 2 to 4 years they pump fear
And we auction off our vote in exchange for some false hope, listen
It's that blatant, enslave us through taxation
Send money to Ukraine, and you payin at the gas station
'Cause this administration had plans for the inflation
Natural gas is the actual task, check the pipeline
Now they wanna fight crime, we tools in the plot
They wasn't talkin gun reform back when BooBoo got shot
Drug addiction was not a disease when NuNu had rocks
Now they change and readjust words 'cause meth is in the suburbs
In the 90's, Biden locked up our people for coke
Now he's using taxpayer dollars to buy pipes so niggas can smoke
You don't see the contradiction?
Or you too busy double tap dancin to pay attention
This is legislative lynchin', economic Jim Crowe
They feed us violence and spirits to keep us spiritually poor
Is this conspiracy? No! Far beyond the music
That crime bill defines still how juveniles are prosecuted
We prostitute ourselves for the wealthy, its not healthy
Fly across country for protest, just to get a selfie
Meanwhile the news outlets exploited
And traditional black values get voided
It happens considerably
Attack the fam, crack the validity
Keep the fathers unemployed, destroy black masculinity
Keep the mothers out the house, let the boys run willingly
Then let the streets raise em and haze em to be brazen
It's basically by design we reside in public housing
Throw us a couple crumbs and we succumb to those surroundings
Perpetuated by educators and pastors
Stockholm syndrome, we fell in love with our own captors
Mass shooters get captured and taken into custody
If black assailants make detainment truly its a luxury
Enough to see that there's a power imbalance
Cowards acceptin malice and challenge it ever was valid
Adjust your palette, they say nothin is insurmountable
Cuz everybody sensitive and nobodies accountable
Everybody senses it 'cause nobody's infallible
Never let it disparage ya
