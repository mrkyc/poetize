Fuck anybody that ever doubted me
And fuck any smiles I had to sift through
The only thing worse than a nigga who won't acknowledge your worth is a person that just pretends to
I can see the cracks with the barest lens
I prefer the facts if you care to give
Your partition's a parody that's imperative
You only give help when you control the narrative
I don't see the people you pit against as a threat to me
I don't think you should even mention 'em in a breath with me
I don't see the purpose of working hard for a goal
Mimicking other souls when most of these niggas sketchin' me
This is plain, if this is claim, there is in vain, his disdain, is sustained when I got a whiff of fame
It undermines us, so whether you biased or ready to divest, we got a problem
Pick apart the artist you try to put on a pedestal
Play 'em for a second I tell 'em lower the decibel
Dissolute lucrative marketing schemes marking the dreams, of young dudes who eat it up like a revenue
That never comes, I'm never stunned, never underestimate my level of tolerance when it's said and done
I'm done checking for those that never reciprocate
Don't expect help from a nigga that you intimidate

Look at all the shit that I been through
Look at all the hoops that I swim through
Look at all the shit that these fuck niggas say but I pay it no mind, I commend you
I'ma fuck around get a million
I'ma fuck around get a million!
I'ma fuck around and keep goin'
I don't fuck around, keep goin'

What kind of definition of definite is deafening
What kind of lesson can ever lessen when it's threatening
What kind of person would take another man's burden and weigh it against his own to atone for what is festering
Underneath the skin but never contusions
A deep bruise that's brewing beneath what you sense
A laceration of agitation is actually based on the fact you have to come back and look at my blueprint
I am not dependent on no one here I'm self driven
I continue growing regardless if any help's given
I been under pressure a regular type of texture
Rough waves, so nobody else here can sail with 'em
Expel cynics, diminish your first handouts
Questioned by attack then double back for a hand out
You ran out at the first trace of adversity, and rather amerce and bleed, worship these niggas, pathetic
Pick apart the product they try to peddle as politics
They ain't satisfied 'til you pacify and polished it
They don't see the vision until it comes to fruition
And bites 'em on the ass and at last have to acknowledge it
I gotta spit what I feel is necessary
From the depths of my soul to the souls that step and carry
A man's baggage and burden, I'm like a tactical surgeon, an impractical version of mercenary

Look at all the shit that I been through
Look at all the hoops that I swim through
Look at all the shit that these fuck niggas say but I pay it no mind, I commend you
I'ma fuck around get a million
I'ma fuck around get a million!
I'ma fuck around and keep goin'
