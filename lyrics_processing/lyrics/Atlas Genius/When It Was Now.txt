We don't speak the same words
I'm lost, lost in the pages of
A cold read of this verse
It's something we don't know the meaning of
They go, go do what they want
I know, oh, she's not in love
Start low, lower, feel it come
Oh yeah, we know what we want

And it is what it was
Until you let it go
And it was what it is
Yeah, you gotta let it go

Almost too much to be enough
I'll make it out somehow
I know you're watching
Oh, don't you miss it
When it was now?

Drumbeat in your heart
You can't speak
Can't even stop to explain
Oh yeah, we play the wrong game
You might also likeThey go, go do what they want
I know, oh, she's not in love
Start low, lower, feel it come
Oh yeah, we know what we want

And it is what it was
Until you let it go
And it was what it is
Yeah, you gotta let it go
 
Almost too much to be enough
I'll make it out somehow
I know you're watching
Oh, don't you miss it
When it was now?
Almost too much to be enough
I'll make it out somehow
I know you're watching
Oh, don't you miss it
When it was now?

Snow capped heart don't melt, no
Don't be fooled by what we say
Sittin' like they know but they don't
Snow capped heart don't melt, no
Don't be fooled by what we say
Sittin' like they know but they don't
 
Almost too much to be enough
I'll make it out somehow
I know you're watching
Oh, don't you miss it
When it was now?
Almost too much to be enough
I'll make it out somehow
I know you're watching
Oh, don't you miss it
