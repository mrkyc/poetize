We're related
Through a drunken speak
I was faded
Couldn't find my feet
As the lights came on
There was nowhere else to go
You were to good for solay
We were on our way
So was the day
As the cab pull up
There was nowhere else to go

Worlds apart
(I fell right into you)
But we didn't know
(And the sun was on its way)
I didn't know
(So I said that you can stay)

All these girls are not the same
All these girls are not the same as you
You might also like
So quick
But we took it slow
Had to face it
That we didn't know
You sing the words
And I'll pay you what I got
You're a wonder
I'm no patience
You're just waiting
Why would they let it go?

Worlds apart
(I fell right into you)
But we didn't know
(And the sun was on its way)
I didn't know
(So I said that you can stay)

All these girls are not the same
All these girls are not the same as you

On the town, I'll go
On the phone slow
I wanna stop with love
I wanna say I'm sorry
All these girls are not the same as you
(All these girls are not the same as you)
All these girls are not the same as you
(All these girls are not the same as you)
All these girls are not the same
(Are not the same)

Worlds apart
(I fell right into you)
But we didn't know
(And the sun was on its way)
I didn't know
(So I said that you can stay)

All these girls are not the same
All these girls are not the same as you
All these girls are not the same
