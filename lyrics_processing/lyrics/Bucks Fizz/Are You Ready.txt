Letting your body down
Take a chance on a moment's pleasure
Putting yourself around
If you know that there ain't a reason
Can't you tell me why?
You'd better believe it
'Cos you're gonna need it
You're doing alright if you try
Are you ready?
Well tell me are you ready?
Are you ready for the feelings
That you're getting tonight
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you ready? (Are you ready, ready tonight?)
Well tell me are you ready?
(Are you ready, ready tonight?)
Well are you ready for the feelings
That I'm getting tonight
Take a step in a new direction
Do it now don't delay
Make a break for the right connection
Break it off right away
Make a move to the easy answer
Playing it safe tonight
Forget all the waiting, anticipating
Together we'll be making it right
