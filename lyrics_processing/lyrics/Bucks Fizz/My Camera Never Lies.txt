Ah, click, click
I've been checking you up, I've been tracking you down
Funny all the things that I've found
Was it any surprise, didn't you realise?
I must apologise
(It doesn't matter any more) To you
('Cause everything you tell me is boring)
(It doesn't matter what I say) To you
'Cause you've got that look in your eyes
The camera never lies
My camera never lies
So I put you in the picture and cut it down to size (My camera, oh, oh)
My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
There's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore
Try to cover the trail, try to head for the line
Wonder why you're wasting your time
With another disguise
'Cause there's no compromise when the negative is dry
You might also like(It doesn't matter what I do) For you
('Cause every time you take me I'm sleeping) You're never gonna shake me now
(It doesn't matter how I try) For you
(I can see by the look in your eyes)
(The camera never lies)
My camera never lies
So I'll put you in the picture and cut it down to size (My camera, oh, oh)
My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
There's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore
(Ah click click, ah click click)
My camera, my camera, my camera never lies
Lies oho, oho
My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying for
My camera never lies
So I put you in the picture and cut it down to size (My camera, oh, oh)
My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying, nothing worth lying
Nothing worth lying for
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
