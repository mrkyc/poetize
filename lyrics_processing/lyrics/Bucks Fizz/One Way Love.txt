You were done one on your day
You knew every line to lay
With your high speed get away
It'll never be the same again
It was easy when your only thought was you
You were just a beginner with beginner's luck
You never thought you'd lose to one way love
Your one way love
Has got you walking a street of desire
This one way love
Has got you caught on the edge of the fire
This one way, this one way, this one way
This one way love
(One way, one way)
No escape
No escape your hearts in chains
It's too late for jumping trains
With your bridges all in flames
It'll never be the same again
It was easy when you took love just to you
Well you looked like a winner
But times have changed
'Cos even winners lose to one way love
You might also likeYour one way love
Has got you walking a street of desire
This one way love
Has got you caught on the edge of the fire
This one way, this one way, this one way
This one way love
(One way love, one way love)
It'll never be the same again
It was easy when your only thought was you
You were just a beginner with beginner's luck
You never thought you'd lose to one way love
Your one way love
Has got you walking a street of desire
This one way love
Has got you caught on the edge of the fire
Your one way love
Has got you walking a street of desire
This one way love
Has got you caught on the edge of the fire
This one way, this one way, this one way
This one way love
This one way, this one way, this one way
