You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

You gotta turn it on and then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the times arrived
For making your mind up

Don't let your indecision take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

And then you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

And try to look as if you don't care less but if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up
You might also like
Don't let your indecision, take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
