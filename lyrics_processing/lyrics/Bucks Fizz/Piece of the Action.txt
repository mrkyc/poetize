I feel so lonely when I'm left alone
And I know you're having fun with all the other boys in town
Why am I the only one?
I'm a first class loser that you don't wanna have around

I keep calling in the dead of night
Until you say you're gonna try treating me right

Well I know it sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just wanna piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action (to get a piece of the action)
To get a piece of the action (just wanna piece of the action)
To get a piece of the action
Piece of the action
Piece of the action

Little by little I'm beginning to learn
You're a many man woman and it's heavy on my mind
Any time you wanted love
You just snapped your fingers
And it's not very hard to find
You might also like
I don't wanna tie you down
But it'll feel so good with you around

Well I know it sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just wanna piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action (to get a piece of the action)
To get a piece of the action (just wanna piece of the action)
To get a piece of the action
Piece of the action
Piece of the action

I don't wanna be the life of the party
I just wanna little excitement -- lay it down

Well I know it sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just wanna piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
