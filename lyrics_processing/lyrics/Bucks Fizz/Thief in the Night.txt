A teardrop slowly slips, to touch your face
The shadow of night approaches too fast
It comes too soon to last
Until he leaves you alone
You hear the warmth of voice upon the wind
You slowly step toward the feel of him
A smile like ice to melt your heart
You need the strength to stop yourself
From falling apart
Then you'll hear a cry, a cry, a cry in the night
That's when the stranger comes to steal your heart
Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
He'll gently slip away
Then you'll hear a cry, a cry, a cry in the night
That's when the stranger comes to steal your heart
Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
He'll gently slip away
He takes you in his arms and gives you life
But as he leaves this darkness, it cuts like a knife
The rays of dawn approach too fast
To stop him from seeing
Your body and soul just falling apart

That's when the stranger comes to steal your heart
Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
He'll gently slip away
Then you'll hear a cry, a cry, a cry in the night
That's when the stranger comes to steal your heart
Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
He'll gently slip away
Then you'll hear a cry
(He's coming like a thief in the night)
Then you'll hear a cry
(This dream is just a thief in the night)
Then you'll hear a cry
(He's coming like a thief in the night)
Then you'll hear a cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Then you'll hear a cry, a cry, a cry in the night
That's when the stranger comes to steal your heart
Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
He'll gently slip away
Then you'll hear a cry, a cry, a cry in the night

Just like a thief, a thief, a thief in the night
