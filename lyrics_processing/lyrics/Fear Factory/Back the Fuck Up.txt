From the wasteland, cold steel under my waistband
Hazardous times, enemy lines
Drawn in the middle of the streets
The concrete's stained with blood, I still got to eat
When I hit street I made the man understand
I fought with flesh and I bled like a man
I rode that edge of darkness, my friend
Stood up to the enemy so life could begin

You know you got to
Back the fuck up
You know you got to
Back the fuck up

You know you got to
Back the fuck up, back up off of me
You know you got to
Back the fuck up, back up off of me
Back up off of me
Off of me
Off of me
Back up, back up
You might also like
Traces of ignorance, offense of hatred
The faces change in the same old places
Dark nights and lost souls collide to cross those
The line between a death and dream
I never wanted to lead your leash
To pull around a ton of grief
I'll come back with a fist of lead
To educate your mind with a blow to your head

You know you got to
Back the fuck up
You know you got to
Back the fuck up

You know you got to
Back the fuck up, back up off of me
You know you got to
Back the fuck up, back up off of me
Back up off of me
Off of me
Off of me
