My chains are paper thin and they're welded with ink
Sealed inside a legal trap, so tight blood don't leak
A contract with a devil for a life of disdain
See me in the limelight, an indentured slave
I blame myself

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me

God, help me pour this gas on me
God, help me pour this gas on me
God, help me pour this gas on me
God, help me pour this gas on me

Choke another product for the mass to consume
The flocks of mindless sheep that have been coporately groomed
Ignorance through apathy, like drones in the hive
A slave on the prayer wheel in conformed disguise
I blame myself

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me

I sold my soul (I sold my soul, I sold my soul)
I sold my soul (I sold my soul, I sold my soul)
I sold my soul
I sold my soul
I sold my soul

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me
On me
