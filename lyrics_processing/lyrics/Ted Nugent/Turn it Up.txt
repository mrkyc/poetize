What you got cookin'
I need it on a Saturday night
Gonna have a ball
At the rock n' roll hall
That sound is just what I like
So turn it up, turn it up, make it louder than hell
Turn it up, turn it up, make it ring like a bell
I know what I like
I got to turn it up tonight
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder
Oh my god, I like it loud
The stage is like a wall of sound
More power by the hour
Is what I need
To help me blow the walls down
So, Turn it up, turn it up, make it louder than hell
Turn it up, turn it up, make it ring like a bell
I know what I like
I got to turn it up tonight
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, louder, louder, louder, yeah
