To what I got to say
There's hope for tomorrow
Ooh, we're workin' on today
Well, it happened long ago
In the new magic land
The Indian and the buffalo
They existed hand in hand
The Indian needed food
He needed skins for a roof
But he only took what they needed, baby
Millions of buffalo were the proof
Yeah, it's all right
But then came the white man
With his thick and empty head
He couldn't see past the billfold
He wanted all the buffalo dead
It was sad...It was sad
Oh yeah
Yes, indeed
Oh, yes

In the new magic land
See, the Indian and the buffalo

But then came the white dogs
With their thick and empty heads
They couldn't see past the billfold
They wanted all the buffalo dead
Everything was so sad
When I looked above the canyon wall
Some strong eyes did I see
I think it's somebody comin' around
To save my ass, baby
I think- I think he's comin' around
To save you and me
Boys
I said above the canyon wall
Strong eyes did glow
It was the leader of the land, baby
Oh my God
The great white buffalo!
Look out!!!! Look out!!!!!!!
Well, he got the battered herd
He led 'em 'cross the land
With the great white buffalo
They gonna make a final stand
The great white buffalo
Comin' around to make a final stand
Well, look out here he comes
The great white buffalo, baby
The great white buffalo
Look out, here he comes
He's doin' all right
Makin' everything all right
