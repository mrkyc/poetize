Sparks might fly, in no time
It's a delayed reaction of the third kind
Woah, I'm so ready for this
Shrink-wrapped songs
I couldn't face the music
Cause dark matters bonded us way beyond our 'best by' date

You know we've had it good, we've had it bad
So no hard feelings
We've done all we could and all we can
I'm done pretending
Let's quit while we're still friends

Making up stories, they grew to be too tall
My fortress to forget couldn't take any more
You nearly watched me ruin everything, everything
What's the number one rule of don't-do's?
Well, you knew it all too well
You were supposed to be looking out for me
Have you any idea how difficult it's been?

You know we've had it good, we've had it bad
So no hard feelings
We've done all we could and all we can
Let's save ourselves a sorry ending
You might also like
You know we've had it good, we've had it bad
But this is as far as we can stretch
Let's stop pretending (Stop pretending!)
And quit while we're still friends

Well, I was so young, misguided, maybe
But still this hangs over my every pen to paper
And this all started with a song (Started with a song, started with a song)
Woah, let this be our last one

Drop... Drop
Good, good
Bad, bad
Good (good), good (good)
And bad (bad), bad (bad)

We've had it good, we've had it bad
This is as far as we can stretch
Stop pretending!
And quit while we're still friends

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well, wish you well, wish you well
I wish you well, I wish you well
I won't tell if you won't tell
I won't hold it against you if you bow out gracefully
Can we just not drag this out, please?

I wish you well, I wish you well
I won't tell if you won't tell
I won't hold it against you if you bow out gracefully
Can we just not drag this out?

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
