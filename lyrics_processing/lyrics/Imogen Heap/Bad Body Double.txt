She pops into the bathroom, just after a shower
And she plays with my make-up and creams
Keeps trying to look like me
Goes through the motions, posing this way and that
Holding it in, if it makes you feel better, then knock yourself out

I say "Hi, there" to my bad body double
Mmm mmm, this is my bad body double trouble
Oh no, my bad body double
Mmm mmm, I've got bad body double trouble, oh

She's trouble, she's trouble, she's trouble alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I manage to lose her or shake her
At a bar, in the gym for five minutes
It feels so good to be back on my own self again
Can get quite confusing
We look quite similar, except she's got some greys and
A little extra weight on the sides
Dimply thighs, I hear that stuff's a bitch to get rid of
You might also like
(No, no, not now)
We're having quite an intimate personal moment
(Not now)
Could you maybe come at a slightly less awful time?
(Not now)
As you can see I've got someone quite nice here with me
Can't we just be left alone?
I guess that's a no then, seeing as you're still here
Seeing as you're still here
Here

It's not me, no, it's my bad body double
Mmm mmm, I've got bad body double trouble
Oh no, my bad body double
Mmm mmm, I've got bad body double trouble
Bad body double
Mmm mmm, I've got bad body double trouble
Oh dear, my bad body double
Mmm mmm, my bad-bad body double trouble

She's trouble, she's trouble, she's trouble alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's trouble, she's trouble, she's trouble alright
Yeah, yeah, right there
Can't shake her, can't shake her, can't shake her, can't shake her
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go, go, oh
Can't shake her, can't shake her, can't shake her, can't shake her
Everywhere I go everywhere I go, go, oh

Say "Hi, there"
(Bad body double)
To my bad, bad, bad, bad body double
(Bad body double)
She's trouble, mmm, woah
I can't shake her
(Bad body double)
I hate her, I hate her
I'm a hater, I'm a hater, I'm a hater
She's everywhere I go

I'm gonna get rid of you once and for all
Gonna roll you out on a Pilates rubber ball
Sweat and step up the pace and the gradient
Starting tomorrow
