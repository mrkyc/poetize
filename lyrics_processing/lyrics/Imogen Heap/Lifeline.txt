Freeze frame on me
Mmm, can you read it on my face?
Data mining from old memories
Sunflowers and a smile catching
Mmm, welcoming a heartbeat to the family
Light Thai lanterns, wish bound in the night

Who? What? When?
All in one stir of a teaspoon
I'm shaken and gasping for air

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity
Hold tight, cause all is against me
Every cell in my body, brace

And keep breathing
Keep breathing

Gracious future
Mmm, won't you lend a hand to pull me through?
Cause me and you've got some things we need to see to
Let's get to work! Let's get to work!
Adventures in the multiverse
Effervescent candlelit closeness
Plus, I feel like I've just got the hang of this living thing
You might also like
Who? What? When?
All in one stir of a teaspoon
I'm shaken and gasping for air, air, air, air

I will, on one day
And sometime, in some place
I've still got some go in me yet

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity
Hold tight, cause all is against me
Every cell in my body, brace
In my body brace

Rise high, cling to the laughters
For that moment of broken tragedy
Bright-eyed, the world is against me
Every cell in my body, brace

And keep breathing
Check breathing
I'm still breathing
My bones stay strong
My days still long
My heart has many heartbeats
And home is where love is

Lifeline, before and after
The moment that makes me
In an instant of great white gravity
Hold tight - all is against me
Hold tight, cause all is against me
Well I've still my eye on tomorrow
Every cell in my body, brace

Rise high, cling to the laughters
The moment that makes me, I'm in it deep
For that moment of broken tragedy
Bright-eyed, the world is against me
Yeah, every cell in my body, brace
Every cell in my body, brace

And keep breathing
And keep breathing
And keep breathing
And keep breathing
And keep breathing
