This is an obsession, a kind of aggression with himself
It's the way he'll always be
He loves to rebel, to go against his ten commandments
For him, that's just being free

And he always will get his thrills
The only way he knows how
Well it might make you frown
But he loves, being that dove
Roaming where he cares to go
To a state of mind which no-one knows

Over there stands my angry angel
And he's shaking his head, in disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's frowning like hell, but I'm not feeling guilty


And over and over again, more and more for the pain
To release himself, from this shell
Time after time, you may glare at him for the way he looks
Like something drawn up from hell
You might also like
But that's just his cover from what is under it
All his imagination
His passion for a creation
Which he has discovered
Uncovered a world of amazing sensations
His own little nation

Over there stands my angry angel
And he's shaking his head, in disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's frowning like hell, but I'm not feeling guilty

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

Over there stands my angry angel
And he's shaking his head, in disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's frowning like hell, but I'm not feeling guilty
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's shaking his head, in disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's frowning like hell, but I'm not feeling guilty
I'm not feeling guilty, I'm not feeling guilty
I'm not feeling guilty, 'cause I don't care
I'm not feeling guilty, I'm not feeling guilty
