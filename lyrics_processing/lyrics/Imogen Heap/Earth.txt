Baby, behave, we'll make it work
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Are you with me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Are you with me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Are you with me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work

You're not golden and I'm getting tired
Act like you own the place when really, you've only just arrived
I caught first glimmers in hides and skins
Look who's all grown up, black swanning about the solar winds

You're gonna lose it all and find yourself on your knees
So get a grip and you might flow reverse the great slow bleed
I've tried patience, but you always want a war
This house won't tolerate any more

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now
You might also like
The cold shoulder, folded arms, the looking up
You've never listened and carry on careless regardless
This is not a fire drill and if we hold any hope
It's harmonic connection, in stereo symbiosis

These Legoland empires choking out mine
Now you're everywhere, everywhere multiplying around me, child
A strain on my heart
This rock can't tolerate any more

Stop this right away
(Are you with me? Are you with me?)
Put that down and clean this mess up
(Are you with me? Are you with me?)
End of conversation
(Do you love me? Do you love me?)
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Baby)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Baby)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Baby)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Baby)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Do you love me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Do you love me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work
(Do you love me?)
Baby, behave, we'll make it work

Get only what you give back
Get only what you give back
Get only what you give back
Get only what you give back
Get only what you give back, back

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Get only what you give back
(You're not golden and I'm getting tired, act like you own the place when really you've only just arrived)
(Think you're special and smarter than you are, I'm conscious I like you)
Get only what you give back
(Now you're everywhere, everywhere multiplying around me)
Get only what you give back
(A strain on my heart, this rock can't tolerate any more)
Get only what you give back
