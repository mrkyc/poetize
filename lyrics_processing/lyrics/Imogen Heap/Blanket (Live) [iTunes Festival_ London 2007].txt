"So this song, I wrote- actually, this song came out before even the album came out. And I didn't technically write it all myself, this one. This one was written with Mintos from Urban Species and this was a song that I really, really loved and I actually wrote it with the most terrible hangover, and actually Maisie has a lot to answer for that. She's in the audience. For some reason I got terribly drunk and that's very unlike me. I'm very professional, you see. And I just had the worst hangover and I just- I mean I did wanna be there because (a) Mintos is really sexy and (b) cause it's Urban Species and I liked Urban Species. So I was feeling really kind of groggy and Mintos was like- he kinda had this plan of what he wanted me to do and I just wasn't having any of it 'cause it meant extra work for me, so I just went 'No, sorry, I've got this idea' and this is what i ended up- this is what I sang and this is what it ended up being. It's called 'Blanket' and I really like it. And, in the middle, I'll be doing, kind of, Mintos' rap, so excuse me for that. It kinda... I do my best."

Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
The dull, the dark shades on my day
I live inside this place

Locked up inside my metal cage
Always tense and filled with rage
Above the concrete fields below
With you I wanna go, wanna go, wanna go

I see only what I wanna see, woah
I'll be only who I wanna be
My blanket covers me, yeah

As a youth man I was body poppin' breakin' on the lino
Traded in my lino for a pad and a biro
Used to stand in line just so as I could sign my giro
But now my ends meet in the best way that I know
(Hat, snare, kick) and the beats that go boom
See the music I consume to escape the doom and gloom
The beats and melodies keep realities at bay
But what happens when the records done and starts to fade away
You might also like
Alone within myself again
I try to veil away my pain
The dirty grey surrounding me 'round
And now I hear no sound

I see only what I wanna see, woah
I'll be only who I wanna be
My blanket covers me, covers me
Covers me, covers me, covers me, yeah

I see only what I wanna see, woah
I'll be only who I wanna be
My blanket covers me


You are my living world
You are my living world
You are, you are, you are my
My only living world

I see only what I wanna see, woah
I'll be only who I wanna be
My blanket covers me, covers me
Covers me, covers me, covers me, yeah
I see only what I wanna see, woah
I'll be only who I wanna be
My blanket covers me
