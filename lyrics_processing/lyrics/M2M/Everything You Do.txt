And ever since you called my name
You've been everything that I've seen
And now I'm caught up in this game
My mind is spinning 'round and 'round
There's something special I have found
Every time I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby, can't you see
That everything you do (everything that you do)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you say (everything that you say)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ah, ah
They're trying to build a fence
By saying that this won't last
They tell me I don't have a chance
That everything moves too fast
But every time I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby, can't you see
That everything you do (everything that you do)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you say (everything that you say)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Everything you do (everything that you do)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you say (everything that you say)
Makes me want to go ooh, ooh, ah, ah
