It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Since you called
I've been so crazy, I've just about taken our picture
Off the wall
It's been three months, over hundred days, since you
Held my hand
And I miss you in a thousand ways
Will I ever see you again?

How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone, it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams, you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

It seems like everywhere everyone's in love
So, where are you?
And I remember you couldn't get enough
You felt it too
How dare you?
You might also like
How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone, it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams, you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Three months and a hundred days
It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
And I miss you in a thousand ways

How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone, it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams, you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
My everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Ooh, ooh
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
