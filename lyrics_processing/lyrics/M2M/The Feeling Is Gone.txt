It's not like I wanna destroy his reputation
We are still together
But we are not moving on
When we first met it was the perfect combination
Now when I look at him it fills me with frustration
What is a girl to do when she is not having fun

How can I tell him I have to try
There is no easy way of saying goodbye (no no)
How do I break it (How do I break it)
It's just no good
My heart is telling me that I really should (My heart is telling me that I really should)
I must be subtle (I must be subtle)
I must be strong
The feeling is gone
I think we're going in the opposite direction
No longer think that we are making a connection
I am so unhappy
I'd rather be alone
In the beginning it was one special occasion
Now when I talk to him his mind is on vacation
And it's too late for me, already on my own
You might also likeCHORUS
I want it over all said and done
How can I tell him that he isn't the one
The feeling for you is gone
How can I tell him I have to try
There is no easy way of saying goodbye (no no)
How do I break it (How do I break it)
It's just no good
My heart is telling me that I really should (My heart is telling me that I really should)
I must be subtle (I must be subtle)
I must be strong (I must be strong)
The feeling is gone (I'm telling you the feeling is gone)
I want it over (I want it over)
All said and done (All said and done)
How can I tell him that he isn't the one (How can I tell him that he isn't the one)
I must be subtle (I must be subtle)
I must be strong (I must be strong)
