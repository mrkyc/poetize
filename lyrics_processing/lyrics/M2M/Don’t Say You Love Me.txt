Got introduced to you by a friend
You were cute and all that, baby, you set the trend
Yes, you did, oh
The next thing I know, we're down at the cinema
We're sitting there and you start kissing me
What's that about?

You're moving too fast, I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet, baby I can't pretend
No, I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual, love will find a way (Love will find a way)

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there, baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time
You might also like
Here's how I play, here's where you stand
Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
Take it slow, you keep pushing me
You're pushing me away (Pushing me away)

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Give me some time)
Don't go there, baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me, baby
Baby, don't say you love me, baby (You don't even know me)
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Give me some time)
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Won't you give me some time?)
Don't go there, baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry (Heart's in a hurry)
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time (Baby, don't)
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me (Baby)
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Won't you give me some time?)
Don't go there, baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there, baby
