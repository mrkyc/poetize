(Yeahh)
Sitting on the bus
Looking through the window
And I close my eyes
See the shade of your smiling face. Your smiling face
When you're walking through the door. Smiling Face
Like I've never seen before
(Standing in the rain)
Standing in the rain, it's nearly washed our day away
Then I think of you. I know the sight of your smiling face, your smiling face
And it's always here with me (smiling face) well I wonder could it be
And I still know that I'm never gonna find you
But I do believe that you're standing right behind...
Will I ever get the answer to my question
Life will go on, on
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do)

Staring at the ceiling
Then I close my eyes again
The only thing that's clear to me
Is your smiling face
Maybe I should wake again, your smiling face
Maybe I should let it end
And I still know that I'm never gonna find you
But I do believe that you're standing right behind...
Will I ever get the answer to my question
Life will go on, on
I still know that I'm never gonna find you
But I do believe that you're standing right behind...
Will I ever get the answer to my question
Life will go on, on
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do, do do do)
(do do do do)
The only thing that's clear to me...
Your smiling face
(Never, Never, Never)
(Never, Never, Never)
Gonna Find you. (gonna find you)
I'm never gonna find you. Oh yeah
