Mirror, mirror, lie to me
Show me what I wanna see (Uh-huh)
Mirror, mirror, lie to me (Yeah)

Why don't I like the girl I see?
The one who's standing right in front of me
Why don't I think before I speak? (I speak)
I should have listened to that voice inside me

I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
To say the kind of things I said last night

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back to me

Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see (To me)
Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see

Why did I let you walk away?
When all I had to do was say "I'm sorry"
I let my pride get in the way (In the way)
In the heat of the moment, I was to blame

I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
Now in the cold light of the day, I realize

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back to me

If only wishes could be dreams
And all my dreams could come true
There would be two of us standing here in front of you
If you could show me that someone that I used to be
Bring back my baby, my baby to me (My baby to me)

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall (Oh, oh)
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back to me (My baby back)
Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall (Baby, baby)
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all? (I'm the biggest fool of all)
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me (Lie to me)
And bring my baby back (Bring my baby back<)
Bring my baby back (Baby back, baby back) to me

Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see
Mirror, Mirror lie to me (To me)
Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see
