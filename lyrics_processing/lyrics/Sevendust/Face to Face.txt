You can't stop fuckin' with my head
Stop fucking with my head!

Don't tell me now with a smile on your face
That you're lost, down, and out
When there was nothing left in me
(You can't stop fuckin' with my head
Stop fucking with my head!)
My silence you break
The smile that you fake (You fake!)

There's not one thing
That you can say to make it right
Unless you say, "I'm leavin'"
And if you're not, then please tell me why
Please tell me why you can't...

Save face
Say it to my face!

Can I take all the filth in your head
All the words that you said (That you said)
And throw it away? (Throw it out!
You can't stop fuckin' with my head
Stop fucking with my head!)
My silence you break
(The smile that you take away)

That shit you're talkin'
Don't mean nothing to me anymore
Limp dick, you fuckstick
Let's settle the score
Run and hide
You know I'll find you anywhere
Motherfucker, two-faced prick
With hell to pay
What's real is real
It's time to step up to the plate again
Swing, batter-batter
Swing, batter-batter, swing...
What's real is real
It's time to step up to the plate again
Swing, batter-batter...
Fucked me for the last time!
Just take a swing...
C'mon, you should've taken that swing...
Just take your swing...
