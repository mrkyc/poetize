So much pain to ease my simple mind
No hope, I've been crucified
And no one seems to care

(Don't you feel like a bitch?)
(Don't promise shit you'll never be)
(Don't you feel like a bitch?)
(Don't promise shit you'll never be)

The first time I knew you lied
I ended up crucified
My hate you wear, for your cross I bear
It's for me, I swear

Suck a dick
Suck a dick
Suck a dick
Suck a dick
Suck a dick
Suck a...
What's with you?
You leech off my desire
A faceless name
So untrue, you're wasting away
