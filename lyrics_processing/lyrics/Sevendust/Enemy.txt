Step up to me
Step up to me
You wanna be a big-time player
It's not to be
Look at all the snide ass
Actin' like a wiseass
I'll fuck up your face
(And you'll never look back!)

So, when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
And no one at all is around
So, tell me, how does it feel
To be the enemy?

Step up to me

Look at your face
Look at your name
It's funny you're a loser
With only yourself to blame
(Cut your fucking hair now
Scared of all the stare-downs)
You wanna be like me 'cause I'm real
So, you steal on your way to fame
Never gonna be
Never gonna see
Your name in the lights
You can always dream
What 'cha could've been
Clean up my shit
You look like a dick
Step to unemployment
(Step)

So, when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
And no one at all is around
So, tell me, how does it feel
To be the enemy?
You're the enemy!
