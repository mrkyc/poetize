Fools often sometimes forget
Who really knows what's the truth?
Often dignified
How funny changing the tide
Feels like you already knew

(Connect) You would never
(Sick Man) Running circles
Feels like you already knew

Save you
I would never
Deny you
Even though your hate for me is strong

(See) I'm not what you
(Think) I'm the one who'll
(Be) What you never
Thought would be nothin' and now
(See) I'm not what you
(Think) I'm the one who'll
(Be) What you never
Thought would be nothin' and now

Always you lived in a dream
How would it feel if you could
See past the lies?
Oblivious to all of my cries
No hope when I knew you could

I would never
Deny you
Even though your hate for me is strong
