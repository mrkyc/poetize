Die, you piece of shit!
Die, you piece of shit!
Die, you piece of shit!

Tell me something 'cause I don't know
If that look's for me
Change your face and show me
How is it that you can sleep?

(Show me that face!)
Bring it up to me!
(Show me that face!)
Means nothing to me!

Why don't you tell me what you see in me?
(A motherfucker without a life
That's always gettin' somethin')
What you see in me
(I got a life, you get a life
And show me somethin')
What you see in me
(A motherfucker without a life
That's always gettin' somethin')
What you see in me
(I got a life, you get a life
And show me somethin')
