I can go way back in my mind
This music thing was a joke
I didn't do my time
They couldn't finally bring me up
Now I do it real tough and I'm rough
Come on, I'm the terminator for all
Hurry up, y'all! Its time to go to war
I love to hate 'em
This is my story, yo

I'm a terminator determined (to end your life!)
I'm a terminator determined (to end your life!)
I'm a terminato!
I'm a terminator determined (to end your life!)
I'm a terminator determined (to end your life!)
I'm a terminator

Can I ever have good luck?
Seems in life, nothing
Yeah, everything is so fucked up
I gotta keep going on
I will survive, I'm strong
Long time coming
Somebody catch my train
It's too late, it's driving me insane
Everybody's going somewhere else
This is my story, yo
Peace
Peace
