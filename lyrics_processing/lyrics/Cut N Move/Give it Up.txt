You're like a lively rhythm
Like a rhythm alive
Like a trouble maker working from 9 to 5
Like an attorney, you're working to earn
After the court has been adjourned
I've got a lot to learn
I'm manic, static
Music addict, but still I'm at it
If only you'd discover the school time fanatic
Give it up, give, give, give it up
If only we're together we can reach the top

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants your love
I just like to make you mine, oh mine
Mine

Can you give it, can you give it
Give it up, come on baby
I need your love
Give it up some of your love
Come on and play the game of love
Everybody is in need
Give it up
Come on baby, I need your love
Can I touch, can I love you
Come on baby, baby I love you
