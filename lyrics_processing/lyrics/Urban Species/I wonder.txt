Do I wanna settle down have myself some kids and a wife
I take the dog on walks and have a house with a drive
Then I wonder to myself can I handle that vibe
And then sometimes I wonder if we'll ever be free
Then I wonder if we are but maybe we can't see
I wonder about the youth that's running round with no
Direction
And I wonder how to channel making use of that aggression
Yes I wonder what the worlds coming to
And I wonder what it's like ta have no home to go to
You got no roof over your head maybe a park bench as ya bed
And if I wasn't rappin'then I wonder what I'd do instead
Ya see I could be alone or in a crowded place
I get all introspective my mind starts to race
From one place to another strung together like beads
But no you can't stop the process once you've planted those
Seeds
Now I'm...
Wondering and I'm pondering and I'm thinking
Got me tripping out of my mind
And sometimes I wonder who I am and where I'm going
Is there anything to know if so am I worthy of knowing
I might wonder how and when my life is gonna end
Then I wonder to if I'm gonna come back again
And if I do would I have learnt from the mistakes I've made
Or will I have to carry on till all my debts have been paid
I wonder if there's really such a thing as UFOs
And if they exist I wonder if they're friends or foes
And if they're foes I wonder if they'll ever invade
Can they do a better job than the mess we've made
Like most of us I wonder what's the reason that I'm here
Are dreams a recollection of a whole different sphere
Now I could be alone or in a crowded place place
I get all introspective and my mind starts to race
From one place to another strung together like beads
Ya can't stop the process once you've planted those seeds
Now I'm
You might also likeWondering and pondering and I'm thinking
Got me tripping out of my mind
Now sometimes I wonder if the radio will play this
If they do will it be on the A- or B-playlist
I wonder if I got what it takes
For me ta rock the microphone over beats and breaks
But those anxieties are gone when I hear the competition
Those kids and saying nothing that make me wanna listen
I wonder was it in vain our leaders died
I wonder why some people ain't never satisfied
'Cos no matter what youi got is like you always want more
I wonder, I wonder what's behind the green door
I wonder who shot J.F.K., I wonder what if my mum's OK
You know what I think I'll call her today
I wonder 'bout problems of the world at large
I wonder if peace is just a big mirage
You think it's there but it's gone when you try to touch
