Where the water runs slow and wide, there's a big ol' rock out in the middle
And I took my hammer and chisel, and worked all night so you could see
Just how much you mean to me, I carved your name right next to mine
And it'll be there till the end of time, and my love will last at least that long
It's written in stone how I feel for you, it's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
There's a place on the edge of town, when I was a kid I found
Two names on a stone together, lying side by side forever
And it was then and there I knew, if I ever thought a love was true
I'd surely want to write it down, on something that would be around
When all the spoken words have come and gone
It's written in stone how I feel for you, it's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
And when this life has come and gone, our love will still be
Written in stone how I feel for you, written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
