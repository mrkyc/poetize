I blame myself
'Cause I thought there was something wrong with me
I thought it would be easy
Just holding on
And now I see
There's no one close to me
Yeah, that's not how it's supposed to me
I made them run

Watch me as I handmake my own stone wall
There's a reason I won't ever let you in

Why they never mean what they say?
Told me they'd come back here someday
Like my love was not enough for them to stay
Never any luck when I try
Everyone's so good at goodbyes
And it's all I've ever known to walk away
So yeah, I'm gonna leave you
And learn how to stand
But then I'm gonna come back
A better man

I taught myself no one could love me
And it wouldn't be easy
This road I'm on
And now I'm gone
My head's hanging low again
But God, I could use a friend
I didn't trust no one

You better calm down, yeah, Mr. Wrecking Ball
There's a reason I won't ever let you in

Why they never mean what they say?
Told me they'd come back here someday
Like my love was not enough for them to stay
Never any luck when I try
Everyone's so good at goodbyes
And it's all I've ever known to walk away
So yeah, I'm gonna leave you
And learn how to stand
But then I'm gonna come back
A better man

I've never gone this far before
There's somethin' that I'm looking for
I didn't ask for your help
While I continue to find myself
I could've told you
The road makes fools of us all
Why they never mean what they say?
Told me they'd come back here someday
Like my love was not enough for them to stay
Never any luck when I try
Everyone's so good at goodbyes
And it's all I've ever known to walk away
Why they never mean what they say?
Told me they'd come back here someday
Like my love was not enough for them to stay
Never any luck when I try
Everyone's so good at goodbyes
And it's all I've ever known to walk away
So yeah, I'm gonna leave you
And learn how to stand
Then I'm gonna come back
