I'll smile if I want to
I'm not afraid, gonna flaunt it too
What a glow when you're living true
Yeah
I'm living for the right now
I had a few friends show me how
I take a deep breath and blow it out
Let it go

But listen, I
I can't wait to see what's around the corner
I can't wait to soar
Baby, I lie awake and I watch you sleeping, thinking
It's the little things that make a home

Like dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say
That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again

Something we can build for years
The young and old
I'll be there to wipe your tears
We all get to see who we grow up to be
And anchor when in doubt, an ocean when in drought
We aim for it all, we lift up these walls
To make this house our home

Dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say
That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
Dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say
That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
