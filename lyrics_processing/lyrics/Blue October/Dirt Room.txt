I'm like a ghost, I'll be living in a dirt room
Waiting for the day to be closer
To the window when you're home
I'll be standing by your back door
Reaching for the knife in my coat
I'm going to put it to your throat
You sweaty piggy, you're a bad man
What a fucking sad way to go
Your mother raised you as a joke
I should have wiped away her burden
Use the curtain in the kitchen to choke you

You think you own me?
You should have known me
You took the future and the food off my family's plate
You think you'll use me
I'm stronger than you
You take my money, but it's useless
When you see what I do to you
(Look what I'll do to you)

Oh God, then you awoke
You started screaming through the duct tape
Don't ever think I'm letting you go
I'm busy digging you a hole
Now you'll be living in a dirt room
Breathing through the straw of your own
(Come on)
I really think that this is fun for the money
I'll make it comfy for the time wasted making you rich
I want to cover you in ants, bees, and honey
Then take a picture for the cover of our album!

You think you own me?
You should have known me
You took the future and the food off my family's plate
You think you'll use me
I'm stronger than you
You take my money, but it's useless
When you see what I do to you
You think you own me?
You should have known me
You took the future, the food off my family's plate
You think you'll use me
But I'm stronger than you
You take my money, but it's useless
When you see what I do to you

And now I see you, oh
'Cause your back's against the wall
And finally, you're mine
You're mine

You think you own me?
You should have known me
You took the future and the food off my family's plate
You think you'll use me
I'm stronger than you
You take my money, but it's useless
When you see what I do to you
I really think that this is fun for the money
We'll make you comfy for the time wasted making you rich
I want to cover you in ants, bees, and honey
