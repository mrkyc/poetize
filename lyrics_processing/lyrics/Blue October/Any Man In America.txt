I only note the truth is spoken
Best when brutally, so honestly
I'll let you know you set the standards lyrically for me
One single middle finger, say raise it up
My speech will always be free
Like Martin Luther King, you had meaning to me
Single-handedly saving music, starving industry
A hip-hop legend with skin like invisible ink
Black, even though he was whiter than me
He was the first to be colorless, speaking for all of us
Then you let us into your family
Mother, father, brother, sister, wife, daughter
Damn, right in front of me
That's when I miss my daughter desperately
Your Mockingbird puts dents in me
While touring press and reliving my song Hate Me
I was losing custody, I never even saw that shit
How she played me and planned and sought it fit
To turn that trick and financially, she would benefit
My first and probably only Billboard hit
Was gonna pay for my two year old's college
I should have hid that shit, so she couldn't spend that shit
It took twenty years of working just to earn that shit
Now word for word, I've listened, heard, and I'm done
Done

Like you don't know
You act like you believe it
That you're in control
It's just your legal system though
They don't think about you
No, they don't care about you
Now every man in America, take back your control
Like you don't know
You act like you believe it
That you're in control
It's just your legal system though
They don't think about it
No, they don't care about it
Now every man in America, take back your control
So I kept my business quiet, just like my lawyer said
And I tried to focus all my anger in my work instead
I was succeeding at self-reliant, but inside, my soul is dead
I had to be the sole provider, but not allowed to be the dad
Literally, they took her from me; legally they did! They did!
But I'm not a fucking book, so fuck your book
In Lincoln, I said
"Fuck the judge, fuck that county, fuck your family too
Yeah, fuck everybody that took my baby girl, Blue"
And I'm way too strong, I work my ass off all day long
And I'm gone for months at a time
And you keep sitting there and lying
Bitching "Come back home"
I hate you, hate you, God
And then you came back home
And filed for another fucking divorce
I'm sick of crying, I'm sick of you instead
I'm not sick, or stuck in my head
Any other man in American can get screwed just like me

You won't understand, probably never will
Listen slowly, I'll let you know the deal
Lying ass, play the judge with your crying ass
You had your nose wide open when you saw the cash
Grimy bitch, growing tired of you trying shit
Women run the courts, men provide the chips
Well, eat up, bitch, until you had enough, bitch
But take my kids; you can kiss both my nuts, bitch
Telling lies 'cause daddy's always on the road
But you the one fucking like a groupie at a show
Money-hungry, so you try to take my youngest from me
You a dummy, honey, I'll chase you across the country
Bring the drama to your mama and your mama's mama
'Cause we all know you chasing after commas
Couple checks, few houses, and Gucci blouses
You changing dicks like you changing outfits
Constitution nowaday's got the daddies losing
Lot of fathers getting fucked like prostitution
