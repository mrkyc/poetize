If I can't crawl inside of you
I'm laughing with a broken face
I stumble across my self-esteem
But to picture the pleasure is making me want my space
Understand that God wrapped you like a bow
But in my head, there's some shelves that need cleaning
From basement to ceiling, control
If what you're seeing is an open book
That's great 'cause I'm an open book
But I'm real shy
Now there's a part of me seeking
And desperately needing to open up
That's strange 'cause I'm an open book, a confused boy

I'm an automatic steeple for depressed and lonely people
My heart, while in its cage
Give and not receive a thing
But the only funny thing:
I don't know how to give myself advice

And I've got this post-traumatic thing
This tattoo of a ring around my wedding finger
And that's where I want to state this claim
That I've got to learn to live and dream
Before I go and get myself in love, in love
Before, before, before I go and get myself in love

There's Zoloft, Welbutrin
There's Paxil that's proven, no side effects
But the rest left unnamed
'Cause they worked like a charm on me
But when your savings is drying
You can't stop from crying
You've got to suck it up
You're not her buttercup
You're not her favorite book

I'm an automatic steeple for depressed and lonely people
My heart, while in its cage
Give and not receive a thing
But the only funny thing:
I don't know how to give myself advice

And I've got this post traumatic thing
This tattoo of a ring around my wedding finger
And that's where I want to state this claim
That I've got to learn to live and dream
Before I go and get myself in love, in love
