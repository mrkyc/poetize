I tried and tried
I tried so many things that wouldn't take
Like stop the leak, prevent the flood, some say
But nothing helped at all
And you're not listening to what I say
You waste the time for memories made
Communication has not made its way to your agenda for today
Or any other day
'Cause this is the last time I'm gonna say it

If you come around here, you know
We're gonna have some problems, though
'Cause yeah, we're over
Get over it, though
I've seen that look before
Leave that shit at your door
'Cause yeah, we're over
Get over it, though

Now I'm shouting out
You gotta hear me
Can you end this now?
I'm tired of waiting
You don't get the point
And you don't get control
And we both have a chance
If you just let go

You can't have me tonight, tomorrow night, the next day
For anyone or anything
And anyway, I'm not asking you to stay
You're not my fucking problem, one you just throw away
Let's burn this house we built up down and simply walk away

If you come around here, you know
We're gonna have some problems, though
'Cause yeah, we're over
Get over it, though
I've seen that look before
Leave that shit at your door
'Cause yeah, we're over
Yes, we are over

I'm gonna win this conversation
Look who's got the microphone
I can't believe you're stuck on always trying to fuck me up
Yeah, I think you ruined us all
Yeah, I truly believe you fucking ruined us all

If you come around here, you know
We're gonna have some problems, though
'Cause yeah, we're over
Get over it, though
I've seen that look before
Leave that shit at your door
'Cause yeah, we're over
