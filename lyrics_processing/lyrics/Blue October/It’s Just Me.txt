I think I left it in your arms
I forget the reasons I got scared
But remember that I cared, quite a lot
You see, but lately I've been on my own
Yeah one, but one by choice
You see, that's a first for me
There's only me, yeah, there's only me
And now I realize for once, it's just me
It's just me
It's just me, and I'll find a way to make it
There's no one left to stop me
Here I go, can we take it from the top?
So why so long?
So sad, I wanna be strong
Don't try to take this from me
I'm already spent living half my life undone
So why so long?
So sad, I wanna be strong
Don't try to take this from me
I've already spent my life living half undone

I've been finding out that I have what this world calls friends
I've tried to push them all away
They push me back and wanna stay
And that's one good thing I have
I'm gonna feel a peace in me
I'm gonna feel at home
I'm gonna make this cloud above me disappear, be gone
I wanna feel a punch inside, my heartbeat on the floor
I don't wanna hurt no more
Yeah, it's just me
It's just me, and I'll find a way to make it
There's no one left to stop me
Here I go, can we take it from the top?
So why so long?
So sad, I wanna be strong
Don't try to take her from me
I've already spent my life living half undone
So why so long?
So sad, I wanna be strong
Don't try to take her from me
I've already spent my life living half undone
It's me, the one who won before
I used to smile, but don't no more
