We talked
Together sharpening a knife
Like killing partners for a life
Hey, we can hide the bodies on the ride home
Now here we are
We're licking skin to wipe us clean
Strike a match, pour gasoline
Ditch the scene and watch this city burn
Asleep, my lap will be a pillow steering wheel turn

I'll be reaching for the stars with you, honey
Who cares if no one else believes?
So I set fire to everyone around
But I told you, I told you we'd do it
So ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Yeah, we won

We drive
To leave the past and clear the mind
To watch the sunset set its time
I swear, you'll find I'm your ride home
Now close your eyes
It's getting dark and the highway's clear
No sign of life from front to rear
It's just you, my dear, on the ride home
We're going home
