All my life
Been running from a pain in me
A feeling I don't understand
Holding me down
So rain on me, underwater
All I am, getting harder
A heavy weight, I carry around

Today
I don't have to fall apart
I don't have to be afraid
I don't have to let the damage consume me
My shadows see through me, 'cause

Fear in itself, will reel you in and spit you out
Over and over again
Believe in yourself, and you will walk, oh-ohh
Now fear in itself, will use you up and break you down
Like you were never enough
Yeah, I used to fall, now I get back up

I'm up here
I'm looking at the way down there
I'm staring through the I don't care
And it's staring back at me, yeah
The beauty is
I'm learning how to face my beast
Starting now to find some peace
And set myself free, yeah
