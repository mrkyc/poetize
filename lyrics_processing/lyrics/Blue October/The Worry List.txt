A could've been
Don't be concerned, that's just the power of a breaking heart...
How good am I hiding it?
Look, I've got some bad intentions; guilty as fucking charged
Still standing stable, more than able, 'cause I know who you are
I know the birthdays, anniversaries, all the first days I missed
I regret them all, but, but now I know this;
I know that God exists,I held her in my arms
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
I'm really fine, and Mar, there's nothing we haven't talked about
So take me off your worry list, I said "throw it away"
Yeah, this is what my life is about
I might've been gone, but I never walked out
I've taken a thousand red eyes to change your point of view
Of what kind of man would take the trust you break
And still follow through
'Cause I'm standing right here and you may not show up
Our same gate 14 where honestly, I'm just sick of calling your bluff
And it's just embarrassing that I nearly threw up
While I'm trying hard to change the things I always screw up
And at the top of my list, this visitation is no relationship
But I've got to make the best of it, 'cause I know;

I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
Well, it's time to stand up on my own for her
'Cause I'm packing it up, and I'm coming today
I couldn't wait to finally pick my family up
Everything is quiet and covered in snow
There's something wrong here, nobody's at home
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Now, I'm back in the driver's seat, heading back home
Yeah, back to Texas on my own
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
It's time to stand up on my own for her
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what my story's about
I might have been gone, but I never walked out
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what your story's about
My pretty little girl, can you figure it out?
If it helps to know, so there is no doubt
Just listen to the stories, not everything is glorious
Some hurt, some love, some shout
I fought the world and I lost that bout
And you are what my album's about
