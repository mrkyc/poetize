Close my eyes, feel you sigh
A desperate aching wonder
Will you ever, ever let me off my knees?
Wide awake, like a dream
As simple as a secret
Being told, told to everyone but me

Will I bleed out?
I gave it all, but you can't stop taking from me
And way down, I know
You know where to cut me with your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long 'til this heart stops beating
So don't let me bleed out here alone
Hear my plea, you won't hear my plea

Sudden rain coming down
It all comes back to me
Waking up, falling down
Another day come undone
I keep trying to heal your pain
In return, you cut me over and over
One more time and I will

Bleed out
I gave it all, but you can't stop taking from me
And way down, I know
You know where to cut me with your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long'til my heart stops beating
So don't let me, don't leave me bleeding alone

I finally feel like I'm supposed to be, yeah, oh
Don't you take this moment away from me
But before you kill me, won't you
Won't you look back in my eyes and watch me

Bleed out?
I gave it all, but you can't stop taking from me
And way down, I know
You know where to cut me with your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long 'til my heart stops beating
So don't leave me, don't let me bleed out here alone
Hear my plea

Bleed out
I gave it all, but you can't stop taking from me
And way down, I know
You know where to cut me with your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long 'til this heart stops beating
