Take a pen and write my name on a friend
Who never cared to let me in
Then take a fast ravine that for
Three years swimming straight upstream and the wind
The wind will drag me down in the end
You live inside my wall and I
I reach back, hit you harder than God falls
Christ, Amen, Amen, Amen
You're such a line to break and I'm
I'm so scared to make another mistake in the end
But I just want to be happy again
Until it all falls down
And where does that leave me?
With things, things, I've got so many things to say
With a broken heart and a straight face
I'm saying, "Brother, help me"
It's just a natural phase that I
I go through and then it's taken away
And then bam, bam, I'm fixed
(Fixed, fixed, fixed..)
And I'm in another place to be, where I
I can't sleep without the thought of me being
So, so damn sick (I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick)

Until it all falls down
And where does that leave me?
With things, things, I've got so many things to say
With a broken heart and a straight face
And he says "Reach for the girl
Reach for the girl and hold her close
Believe you can shine when you're silver
And I promise you gold, I promise you gold
And whenever you're dark inside
Don't let go, no, don't let go
Remember there's rain and there's candy
And Christmasy winter snow
And remember I love you the same
And I'll strangle your pain"
And he tells me to sing, and I sing
And I sing for my brother who keeps me sane
And tells me everything will be okay
I'm so alone
God, I'm so alone
I'm so alone
