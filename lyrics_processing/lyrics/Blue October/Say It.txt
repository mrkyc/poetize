It's all about esteem, it's all about dreams
It's all about making the best out of everything
You'll know when you're fine, 'cause you'll talk like a mime
You'll fall on your face, you get back up, and you're doing fine
"A considerate clown, a preachy preaching machine"
Is one of the sweetest things you would say about me
But I don't have the time for your distorted esteem
Why are you toying with my mind?

I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride

You think you're smarter than me, well, everyone knows
You will never be smarter than me, that's how it goes
I gained forty pounds because of you
Was there an "S" on my chest?
Well I confess, you were too much stress
I'd have a heart attack at best
So now I breathe it out, I breathe it out
And I spit it on the crowd
'Cause they lift me up, they lift me up
They lift me up when I'm feeling down
What am I spitting out, spitting out?
Something we never talk about
It's called my mind

I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride

Well, I'm sick of standing in your line
So now you'll have to take it
Take this to heart: I will never let you fuck me over
Stop talking down to me
Your war is old, your game is over
So here's my coldest shoulder

I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride, my pride

Something we don't talk about
