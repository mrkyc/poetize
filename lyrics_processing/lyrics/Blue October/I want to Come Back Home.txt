You don't know the things I've done
The sky that I sleep under
You don't know what I've become
Well, I think of you as comfort
I tell my head that's who you are
So take another little picture
Could you love me?
Could you love me?
All in all I'm not the same
And I try to tell you everything
All of the things I've done
But you never come back home
All in all I'm not the same
And I'm scared to tell you everything
All of the things I've done
Would you let me come back home?
I wanna come back home
I wanna come back
I wanna come back home
Oh I need to tell you thank you
'Cause I think that you're the one
You don't see what goes on in me
Or all the damage that I've done

I tell my head I'll have your soul
So take another little picture
Could you love me?
Could you love me?
All in all I'm not the same

Love me, and hold me, and hug me, take me back
Love me, and hold me, and hug me, take me back
Love me, forgive me, and hug me, take me back

Love me, forgive me, and hold me
I want to come back
I want to come back home
Where you go I'll follow
Could you love me?
