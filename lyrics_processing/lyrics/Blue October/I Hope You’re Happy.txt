There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And now I'm standing here, looking at you
I wonder what the hell you're gonna do
With those Dr. Pepper eyes and your bubble gum hair
Yeah, I'm standing right here
I remember how I held you so right
I remember that Saturday night
Do you?
There will be days when you're falling down
There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
