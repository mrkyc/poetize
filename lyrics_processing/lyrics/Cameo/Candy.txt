Yeah, hm
It's like candy
I can feel it when you walk
Even when you talk it takes over me
You're so dandy
I wanna know, can you feel it too
Just like I do? (Just like I do, hoo)

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you
There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you (Oh)

This stuff is starting now (This stuff is starting now)
This stuff is starting now (Oh)
This stuff is starting now (Hoo)

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Yes, I do
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy)
I attempt to look my best for you
Indeed, I do (Just for you)
You might also like
'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
(For the things that you do)
It's like candy (Candy), oh
You sure are sweet, sweet (Sweet)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
You're taking my appetite, but it's all right

It's like candy (Candy)
(Ooh, vanilla, oh, chocolate)
Look real nice (Real nice), wrapped up tight
You're so dandy (Dandy)
(Would you mind if I had a little bit more of your time?)
Giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like (Oh)

It's like candy (Candy)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
What you do (What you do)

You're like a brand new feeling (Feeling)
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day
You're so dandy (Dandy)
And wrapped up tight
So good, so good (Yeah)
Strawberry (Strawberry), raspberry (Raspberry)
All those good things
Violets and gumdrops
That's what you're saying to me, me (Me, oh)
Sweet candy, candy
It's like candy (Candy)
Sure seems like good candy to me (Good candy to me), oh, baby (Oh)
You're so dandy
Just keep doing what you do, baby (Oh, yeah)
(Doing to me, yeah, doing to me)
Oh, babe, babe
(I like) It's like candy (candy)
You're so dandy (dandy), oh
Dandy, oh, dandy
