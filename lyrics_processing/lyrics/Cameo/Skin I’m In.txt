Sometimes confused by the double standards of society
And maybe I'm wrong about the way I feel
But then will somebody tell me what is really real
Now I respect myself
I respect you too, but in the end it's got to be
Do unto me as I do to you
Now I try to tell you it's time
Separate our wants from our desire
Separate the truth from the lie
To live like people so inspired
Peaceful world just out to see
Basic respect, humanity
And it one time seemed to be. We can live together peacefully
If we have truth we can survive
And for that our forefathers have died
It should be immoral or a sin
If it is according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in
Tell me how many times, how many times can i
Adjust my attitude to reach & touch the sky
Basic love is the creed by which I live
But then sometimes I wonder just how much a man can give
Gross injustices surround me from the highest levels of power
And you say these are the people I depend on for my survival
Is it for real or am I seeing shadows in the dark
I'll let you tell me, can u tell me brother
Tell me now

Basic respect humanity
I'm just trying to be realistic without becoming pessimistic
If we have hope we can survive
A damn good reason to stay alive
Is it immoral or a sin
It seems to be according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in
Peaceful world just out to see
Basic respect humanity
I'm just trying to be for real in a world with less appeal
I'm so frustrated and flustered at what has been reduced to justice
It is immoral or a sin
If it is according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in
