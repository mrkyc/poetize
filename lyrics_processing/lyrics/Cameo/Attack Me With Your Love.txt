Hey...
When you walk, when you pass me by
There's reasons that come immediately to mind
One is I'd like to have you, two is I love your face
The third one is irrelevant 'cause there's no time or place
Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby (Attack me with your love)
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby (And I'll do all the things you want me to)
Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby
I think you need to know the deal about just how I really feel
'Cause intentionally I'm for real and I'm sure I'll make you feel
That I'm a mean man and I'm a go-getter (Ow)
Hey, baby, baby
Late at night when the evening comes
I sit down to check my options, there are none
First thing I think about is your lovely smile
And the things that drive me wild (Uh)

Got a little lady drivin' me crazy
What am I gonna do if I can't have you
Attack me with your love

Bushwhack me with your love, baby (And I'll do all the things you want me to)
Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby (Oh)
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby
Hey, pretty lady (Lady)
There's no defense against your love
I wanna show you how I feel
Hey, baby (Oh), baby
The night is young, here take this glass
We'll toast to happiness and a love that'll ever last
Of all the loves I've had before
No one can compare, to me you're so much more (Uh)
Baby, just let me do (Hey) what I wanna do to you
I know I'll have you, woo-ooh
If you can let me know what I wanna do to you
Then I'll wait for you (I'll wait for you), I'll wait for you
Attack

Entice, baby
Come slap me
