Find my way
I must leave you, try to find my way
I can't take it, not another day
Please don't stop me
Let me go and find my way
You've got me so uptight
You keep saying that I'm wrong when I'm right
And you do it just for spite
I think you're out to break my poor heart
I'm gonna stop you before you start
And those games you play
They're so silly, little game to play
If you care at all
Then please just, just stay away
I won't give myself to you, not one more day
About to make that break (Make that break)
Yeah, you put me through changes that I just can't take (Just can't take)
'Cause I've got too much at stake
You say you love me, that's no guarantee
When we're together, a storm hits the sea
Lightning strikes a tree
Please let me go free
Hey, hey, hey
