Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance

I walked a thousand miles
Met a lot of people
All races and all kinds
Love, love has no color, I know
Well, if you see a color, is it black, green, red or brown?

Oh, yeah
Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Love will have you
If you give love a chance

Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
You might also like
You tried to tell me I'm a fool
Feeling the way I do
But for me there's no other way
Consider love as flower
That grows more every hour
Every minute of every day

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Oh, no, take the step to accept (Take the step)
Just give your love a chance
Give your love a chance
Give your love a chance (Give your love a chance)
Come on (Come on, now)
Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Love will have ya
If you give love a chance
Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Take the step to accept (Take the step)
Just give your love a chance (Just give your love a chance)
Love has no color
Love has no color
I want you to tell me, tell me
