Money, money, money, money

I'm here to make some waves
Hoping to convince you before you have a thing to say
Be it a car or expensive caviar
They go to your creditors 'cause they know who you are
Don't leave your home without American Express
Never trust your friends without a very thorough credit check
Some people will pay you with one eye on the clock
Others will have to pay through their friendly neighborhood loan shark

Fast, fierce and funny
The way people can play with your money

Now, I tried to romance you and I tried real hard
Everything was going good until they took my credit card
Now, I'm not a flaky kind of guy, you see
I've got plenty of money, but unfortunately, not with me
Now you're my kind of girl and you like nice things
I can tell by the clothes you wear and the size of the diamond on your ring
As long as there's cash around, there's always hope
But once you see what your cash is worth, you'll deep six over and croak
You might also like
Fast, fierce (Woo) and funny (Funny, alright)
The way people can play (Can play) with your money (My money)

Baby, check it out, there's no doubt
Use your head, save your bread
Baby, check it out
Baby check it out

The Dow Down Jones average today hit an all-time low
And sent the stock market crashing
Thousands panic in the effort to hold on to their assets
Washington has made an official statement
And we are about to take it live to Washington

Make that money, try to stay ahead
Make that money 'til ya drop dead
Make that money, now you're on your own
Now that bank won't give you a loan
Work your fingers to the bone
Makin' that money, gotta bring it home
Got no cash, gotta write a check
If they haven't closed my bank account yet
Money, money
Money, yeah, yeah
Money
Money
Hey, yeah, ooh-ah, hey, yeah
Work your fingers to the bone
