We are eternal funk
Alias 'The Formaldehyde Funkmen"
You can't see us, but you can feel us
(Get up on the funk funk)
Get up
(Funk, funk, funk, funk)
(Feel it begin to rock rock.. Rock Rock... Rock Rock)
(If you're tired of the same ol' sound)
Get up on the Cameo sound!
('Cause we are living funk funk, funk funk. funk funk)
C'mon, dig the funky horns

We can be funky as we want to be and can be funkier than that! We were here before you felt the funk. And we will be hear after the funky feelin's gone!
