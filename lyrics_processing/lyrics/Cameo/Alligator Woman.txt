Hey lady what you say, how about some fun today?
Is it yes? Is it no?
Whatever it is just let me know, don't fake me out. Out!
Oh you make me shout!
Alligator woman, you don't care!
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair!
You just want to tease me, and turn me on
I wish you would leave but I don't want to be alone, No!
Hey, babe I love you so, you know I don't want to go

You ignore my desires, it ain't fair!
You just want to tease me, and turn me on
I want you to go but I don't want to be alone, ho!
