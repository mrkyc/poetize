My father is one of the riches men in this country
He is a member of Who's Who
I wear Gucci, Poucci and Via Ruche, just for fun that is
I have played with Xenon and beyond
I have a town house and a chalet next to the Earl
You know, Earl the Pearl Monroe
Yes, well I had a Mercedes just like his
I think it's beige and brown or, or was it the other one
The one that we take into town
Yes, sir, pretty lady, I can't take much more of this
We've been talking for an hour, I'm so dizzy I can't think
It seems the only subject I know much about is you
Well, I hate to disappoint you but I got things to do
Don't laugh, it ain't funny that I spent most of my money
And my glasses is getting soggy in my hand
I thought a bad girl like you would have some better things to do
To make a person think you are a creep

It's not how you style your hair
(Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

Let it all hang out
(Don't be so cool)
It's not what it's really about
Get back
I don't wanna hear it
I'm gone
I don't wanna hear it
What do you mean that's a nice boat?
My dear, that is a yacht
Are you coming to my party?
Well, if you don't you know your name
Isn't going to mean what it did last year
Oh, yes, I am a city rocker

Hi di, hi di, hi, hi di, hi di, ho
Where you got your character, I don't need to go
I met a lot of people and I know one thing for sure
If you want to make it you got to be boring
