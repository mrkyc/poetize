Let's talk about loneliness
You know sometimes it can fool you
Into believing you're on top of the world
No one can top you or stop you
And everything you've ever wanted
Is right at your fingertips
But, as always
Reality steps in and shocks you
Right back into the present
And all you can do is ask yourself over and over
Why?
What happened to the love that brought us both
So much joy and happiness?
Oh hey, I know things change
People change
But this hurts
I mean it really hurts
I guess it all boils down to the fact
That we never really knew each other anyway, huh?
Yeah, I know
Say, say, wait a minute, let me tell exactly how I feel, ok?

Today I am just a lonely man
But tomorrow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast afar and securities
The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Nights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call
You might also like
But wait a minute
And I'm still lonely (Still lonely, still lonely)
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant
Although every person changes
Different times and different ways
But never all the same

Why? (Why)
Have I lost you (Have I lost you baby)
Why (Why)
Tell me, ooh
Although every person changes
Different times and different ways
Why (Why)
Tell me, ooh
Why


Why?
Why have I lost you baby?
Why?
I've been so lonely
Why?
Oh why?
Why? Ooh
Why?
Why? Tell me, ooh
Why?
Why? Tell me, ooh
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
Oh why?
Baby, yeah
Mm-hmm
I put all my trust
In you, baby
Yes, I did
And I, I found out
That you really didn't want me
