The bampers of chrome and so are the wheels and the stacks
It's got polka dot curtains hangin' on a sleeper of pink
Ah ha this Mack's a dandy some kinda truck they think
In my truck drivin' boots I stand about five foot tree
But don't let this size fool you man I can take care of me
When you see a flash of pink go flyin' by
The next thing you know there's a tailight your eyes
Everybody wonders who'd drive such a rig like that
All the truckers would ask who's the gal in a little pink Mack
( guitar )
So don't mess around if you're looking for a race
To be wiped up by a girl would be a disgrace
Cause I cut my baby teeth on a set of Spicr gears
I'm a gear swappin' mama and I know the meanin' of fear
Everybody wonders who'd drive such a rig like that
All the truckers would ask who's the gal in a little pink Mack
All the truckers would ask who's the gal in a little pink Mack (would you believe)
All the truckers would ask who's the gal in a little pink Mack (oh boy)
All the truckers would ask who's the gal in a little pink MackEverybody calls me the girl in a little pink Mack
The bampers of chrome and so are the wheels and the stacks
It's got polka dot curtains hangin' on a sleeper of pink
