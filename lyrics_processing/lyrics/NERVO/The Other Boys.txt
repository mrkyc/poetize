There's so much heartache in the world today
So why do you feel the need to pull away?
I got someone who wants to show me love (that's right)
He tells me every day I have his heart
But that's not what I want
It's not what I dream of, no
Because something tells me
We should be together, be together
I know you hear me
And we should be together, start being clever

So tell me, why don't you love me like the other boys do?
Why can't you call me up, why isn't it you?
Why don't you love me like the other boys do?
Like the other boys do, like the other boys do

Like the other boys
Like the other boys

My heart, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts for you
Cause my head won't stop, can't stop thinkin' of you
And somethin' tells me we should be together, be together
