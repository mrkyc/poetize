Said you loved me on my birthday
Under the stars hung on my ceiling
Sorry that I was all in my feelings
But sometimes I can't help it
Stuck in a loop and it's only Tuesday
Why do I have to keep overthinking
I picked a fight, but I never meant it
Yet sometimes I can't help it

I know, I know, I know, I know
I'm always gonna let it show
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not sorry that I get emotional
I know, I know, I know, I know
I never wanna let you go
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not sorry that I get emotional

I'm not sorry that I get emotional

I left a note in your suitcase
Saying goodbye, watching you leaving
Give you a kiss, you give me that feeling
Well, you know I can't help it
You might also like
I know, I know, I know, I know
I'm always gonna let it show
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not sorry that I get emotional
I know, I know, I know, I know
I never wanna let you go
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not sorry that I get emotional

Oh, baby I'm (Baby I'm)
I'm sorry no (I'm sorry no)
But being real emotional(But being real emotional)
Oh, baby I'm (Baby I'm)
I'm sorry no (I'm sorry no)
Not sorry that I get emotional
Oh, baby I'm (Baby I'm)
I'm sorry no (I'm sorry no)
But being real emotional(But being real emotional)
Oh, baby I'm (Baby I'm)
I'm sorry no (I'm sorry no)
Not sorry that I get emotional

I know, I know, I know, I know
I'm always gonna let it show
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not sorry that I get emotional
I know, I know, I know, I know
I never wanna let you go
You know, you know, you know, you know
