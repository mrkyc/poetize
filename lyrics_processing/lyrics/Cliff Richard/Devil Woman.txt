I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came in to you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showin' the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast (Uh)

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

"Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall, dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned"
You might also like
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd came there for (Uh)

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

From behind
From behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
Crystal ball on the table
Showin' the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast (Uh)

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you (Oh)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind (Stay away)
Beware the devil woman (Oh)
She's gonna get you (She's gonna get you)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
