I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Well, go and find a rich man, put your arms around him
Tell him that you love him and go out and drown him
May be wich you're riches, you'll find true happiness
But I'll stay here a-rocking, 'cause it's what I love the best
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby

I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
You've got sable mink and a Cadillac
Believe me honey, you're taking things too far
You can't find a true love with a sack of gold
Come on and love me, little honey, before you grow too old
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoes
Honey, I soon lose the blues, wait until you hear the news
You're still my own true, my very own true
You're still my high class baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean to me, baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
