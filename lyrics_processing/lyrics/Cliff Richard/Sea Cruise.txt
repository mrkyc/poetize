Old man rhythm is-a in my shoes
No use sittin' here and singin' the blues
So be my guest, you've got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
I gotta get a-moving, get my hat off the rack
I got to boogie-woogie like a train on the track
So be my guest, you've got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise
I feel like jumpin', baby won't you join me please
I don't like beggin' but now I'm on bended knees
I got to get rockin', baby I ain't lyin'
My heart's beatin' rhythm and it's right on time
So be my guest, you've got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee, Oo-ee baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Get on board!
