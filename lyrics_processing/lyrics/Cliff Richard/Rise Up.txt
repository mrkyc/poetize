Yeah, yeah
All my life I've been a dreamer
Some might say a lucky one, oh
For every dream come true, many come undone
But I know, yes, I know
Yesterday the clouds were darkest, yeah
I could not see the end of it, oh no
But something inside of me never learnt to quit
And I know, yes, I know

(Rise up) They're never gonna break me down
(Rise up) They're never gonna take me down
(Rise up) You know I'm gonna rise up feeling stronger
(Rise up) Even when the night is long
(Rise up) The light of love was burning strong
(Rise up) You know I'm gonna rise up even stronger

I see your world's taking a shaking
I know that lost look in your eyes
I see the mess this old world is making
But I know, yes, I know
You might also like
(Rise up) They're never gonna break you down
(Rise up) Don't ever let them take you down
(Rise up) I know you're gonna rise up feeling stronger
(Rise up) And even when the night is long
(Rise up) The light of love is burning strong
(Rise up) I know you're gonna rise up even stronger

Without love time is wasted
Without love we lose the tasteful life that living
Love's the gift we are given to survive

Yeah, yeah, don't stay down
(Rise up) They're never gonna break us down
(Rise up) They're never gonna take us down
(Rise up) I know we're gonna rise up feeling stronger
(Rise up) Even when the night is long
(Rise up) The light of love is burning strong
(Rise up) I know we're gonna rise up even stronger
(Rise up) They're never gonna break us down
(Rise up) They're never gonna take us down
(Rise up) I know we're gonna rise up feeling stronger
(Don't let them get you down)
(Rise up) Even when the night is long
(Rise up) The light of love is burning strong
(Don't stay down)
