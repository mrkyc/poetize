I like tall speakers
If they've music they're wired for sound

Walking about with a head full of music
Cassette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it
Stereo
Out on the street, you know
Ohohohohohohoho, oho

Into the car, go to work and I'm cruising
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows
Into the breakfast show
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
Oh, oh, oh

Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound
You might also likeI was small boy who don't like his toys
I could not wait to get wired for sound

I met a girl and she told me she loved me
I said: "You love me, then love means
You must like what I like
My music is dynamite"
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
She said: "I'm not a girl you can put on at a standby
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switching to overdrive"
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
Oh, oh, oh

Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound
Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
'Cause I'm wired for sound
