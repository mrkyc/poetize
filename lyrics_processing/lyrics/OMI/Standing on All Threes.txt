You got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
You make me can't sleep
Cause you got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
Oh you make me can't sleep

I got you begging for more with a little foreplay
I got you screaming and saying things weh no fit fi ear play
Kick back, relax baby girl this is your day
You deserve good service, you've earned it, it's ? You make me
Pop off the button, let the zipper undone
Strip tease no camera, not a publicity stunt
This is a gallery a new museum
Reveal the masterpiece and get a critique when you done yeah
Mi take mi time 'cause mi no inna no haste
Baby girl them say haste make waste mi move at a slow pace
Make me lay you down to the waist ooh
You deserve first place because now you got me

You got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
You make me can't sleep
Cause you got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
Oh you make me can't sleep

She teasing me with her innocence
When she pretends as if she depends on my experience
She love it when mi take control
Fi make she feel happy seh she de pan the receiving end
She love it when me finger dem a crawl pan are
Hm make she wet up like the rain a fall pan are
She love it when me make di water run ina canal
Make she crawl upon the wall, no now mi na go stop
Any time you gone a you alone mi truely miss mi
Love it when you make mi jus a talk bare foolishness
The way mi love it you if you wonder if a coolie this
So give it to mi even if a two minutes

You got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
You make me can't sleep
Cause you got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
Oh you make me can't sleep
Standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
'Bout to confirm it and concrete
You make me can't sleep
Cause you got me standing on all threes
Pretty little girl in the short jeans
