I started thinking I got something to prove
You tried to tell me we had nothing to lose
Cause when we danced together, we were one pair of shoes
Cause you're my babylon, babylon
Now I'm living just to live out regret
And I know this love will die if I let it
But what you gave to me I swore I'd never forget it
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

With you, I'm running wild
With you, the city comes alive
With you, we'll set it all on fire
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

So won't you take me back
Back where we were covered in champagne
And everybody thought we were insane
Where you will always be my babylon, my babylon
So won't you take me back
Back to where I knew you would save me
Where everyone else thought I was crazy
Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon
(Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon)

I'm sorry girl, I had to stop for a second
Catch my breath so I would stop second guessing
And when we danced together, yeah you taught me a lesson
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

With you, I'm running wild
With you, the city comes alive
With you, we'll set it all on fire
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

So won't you take me back
Back where we were covered in champagne
And everybody thought we were insane
Where you will always be my babylon, my babylon
So won't you take me back
Back to where I knew you would save me
Where everyone once thought I was crazy
Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon

My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
