What a dilemma!
It's a Shabba ting!
(Trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load (2x))
Yard and foreign kick up!
Bruk whine!
Sing!

Bring up the menu, tell me if you love the features
From the haircut straight down to the sneakers
Turn up the swagger just like the speakers
Whether ragga ragga or neaters the creatures
Well if you like stars, me bring you the sequels
Or even TBS for real funny comedians
Parental discretion is strongly advised
But your past 18, so its not illegal
Me really waan you come rewind pon me gyal
No true me say gyal, you a wife material

Pull up at di gate inna di double seater
Everything fresh, you nuh see no repeaters
Capture her eyes like Jeepers Creepers
Say she glad seh she find me, finders keepers
She tell me she rate me, as di real dad
So she waan follow me just like procedures
Me full a action like Steven Siegel
She request a cup a tea, because she feel bad
Me ba-ba-ba beat it like a steel band
She want me fi stay from dusk until dawn
Me call her baby, she call me King Kong
Stay tuned for the next program


Dem say, "Killa, weh you name?, weh you come from?"
I know Miami it no sound like no England
But it nuh matter cause a me make di hit song
Di kids dem, a sing along like a Chipmunk
Some say hip, some say hop, some say urban pop has arrived
Some say O.M.I
OMI!
Haha
And if you fall from the stage
It's no disgrace
If you survive than so can I
Haha, Yeah
