Balmain to KTZ
Many style from A to Z

Bitch, you ain't got shit on me
Chrome hearts
Fendi furs
Dripped in shits you never heard
(2NE1)

Ridin' down Seoul city
Black on black Lamborghini
Haters can't never see me
Come and get me, too slow
I'm 'bout that paper chasing
Body, fly face amazing
Burn, burn keeps it blazin'
Too hot to handle, can't touch this
You think you with it, with it
But you can't hit it, hit it
You know I got it, got it
'Cause I'm so 'bout it, 'bout it
I let them hoes know
I run this show, show
We get it poppin'
And we stick you for your dough, dough
You might also like
'Cause I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah, I'm so bad, bad
And I'm so good, good!
'Cause I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah, I'm so bad, bad
And I'm so good, good!

Can't nobody hold us down
Nothing's gonna take us down
And you think you can stop it
But we can't stop it tonight
Can't nobody hold us down

Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
We gon' keep it goin' 'bout to run this to-o-own
Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
'Cause we keep rockin', we-we rock-rockin' now

So watch out when we come for you
'Cause playtime, it's done for you
It's my time and it's my time
I'm pound for pound, best to ever come around
Be patient, it's never been done
Asians, we rise with the sun
Invasion, no mercy
Takeover, we thirsty
Every show, we shut it down
Blow your speakers with this sound
Build you up then break you down
We comin' to your town
'Cause I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah, I'm so bad, bad
And I'm so good, good!
'Cause I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah, I'm so bad, bad
And I'm so good, good!

Can't nobody hold us down
Nothing's gonna take us down
And you think you can stop it
But we can't stop it tonight
Can't nobody hold us down

Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
We gon' keep it goin' 'bout to run this to-o-own
Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
'Cause we keep rockin', we-we rock-rockin' now

Let's rock!
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now all I wanna do is
Make you rock
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now make em say na-na-na-na
Let's rock!
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now all I wanna do is
Make you rock
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now make em say na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
