When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as can be
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon they too were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And really changed my very life
Now, my daughter was my mother
'Courrse she was my father's wife
To complicate the matter
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if, if he was my uncle
Then that also made him brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, my step-mother
You might also likeI'm my own grandpa
He's his own grandpa
It's funny I know, but it really is so
For I am my own grandpa
My Father's wife then had a son
Who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, although she is my wife
She's my grandmother too
I'm my own grandpa
He's his own grandpa
It's funny I know, but it really is so
For I am my own grandpa
Now, If my wife is my grandmother
Then I'm her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
'Cause now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
He's his own grandpa
It's funny I know, but it really is so
For I am my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
