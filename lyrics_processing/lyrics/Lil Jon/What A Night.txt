I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone when
I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls
They were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life

Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night

Feels so good (So good)
Feels so right (So right)
Let's make a toast (Make a toast)
To the night (To the night)
It's gonna get crazy (Crazy)
So hold on tight (On tight)
Let's have a ball (Ball)
Live your life (Life)
Let it go (Let it go)
Let it loose (Let it loose)
Release it all (Release it all)
No excuse (Cuse)
Have no cares (No cares)
Have no fears (Have no fears)
Let's act a fool (Act a fool)
Up in here (Hey)
