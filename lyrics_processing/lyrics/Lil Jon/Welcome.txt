I'd like to welcome you to Total Meditation
Ten guided meditations to relieve anxiety, boost focus and find peace
Yes, we're going to be turning down the volume and listening to the voice within
I know, I know
You're probably wondering, "What am I doing here?"
You know me as a rapper, producer, or home improvement expert Hmm
But the truth is, I meditate, a lot
And I've been doing so for years
Before a concert or a public appearance, I try to find a few quiet moments to  myself
To quiet myself for what's ahead of me
And after a long night performing at a club, I meditate so I can wind down
So that I can rest and find tranquility
I'm all for partying and having a good time, but I must  for relaxation, restoration, and finding peace within
So no, I'm not your typical meditation guru
But I am someone who believes in the power of meditation
I am someone who practices meditation
I'm also an artist that's been listening to my inner voice for years
I try to channel that voice into my music and creative projects
Sometimes, with great success
Sometimes, I fall a little short
And now my voice is saying, "It's time to chill"
It's time to find peace (Peace)
It's a time to share my meditation practice with you
