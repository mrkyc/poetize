While attention is way too thick
I can taste your skin on my lips (My lips)
And I'm tryin' to hold the time
Nigga, you know that thing I want
Take your phone out and kick your friends out
I wanna start right here on your couch (The couch)
Pour a shot cause you know what's next
Put them panties again to 
You got me so moist

Moist
When you touch my spot, got me burning so hot
Baby take it down 'fore I get up on top
Moist
Put your face down there while I'm playing your hair
I'ma keep it calm and-and you bet me moist

I know why you want it, I know why you need it
Don't nobody beat it up the way that I beat it
She said that I'm a champion cause I'm undefeated
And I admit hard for ya whenever you need it
Soft and wet, let it set, go, go, go, go
Give it too ya till ya can't take no more, oh
That's that just and bust, wet wide, slip-n-slide
It's a dripped out when you ride
Slow and steady, girl you ready?
Don't get messy, you so kinky
 slow puffing legs open wide
Super wet like some Master God down the side (Ahh)
Tears rolling down them cheeks, it's so sloppy
When we freak, we gon have to change the sheets
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet
Slim poking, when we freak, we gon have to change the sheets
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet

I'm moist, moist, moist
You got me so moist, moist, moist
Touch me below, my panties get soaked
Moist, moist, moist
When you touch me (Moist, moist, moist)
When you kiss me (Moist, moist, moist)
You can check by yourself and see, you got me
