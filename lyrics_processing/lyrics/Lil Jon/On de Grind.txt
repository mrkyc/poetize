Tryin' to find the escape route
Hey, huh
All truths

We stay on the grind (On the grind)
All day and night (Day and night)

With struggling (Struggling)
Suh wi roll through di ghetto  all the time (All the time)
All day and night (Day and night)
We're tired of them suffering (Suffering)
With hustling (Hustling)
Suh wi roll through di ghetto revolution on mi mind

Slum dawg, millionaire, made it out of nothin'
To all of the temptation, 
Took the  young raggamuffin
Something gotta get, but also I'm taking something
Super hard, throw the stones, I got that iron on me
Rastafari, don't make the  on me
I got killers everywhere, it's the City of God
Now ain't nobody see shit, it just a mirage
Sunglasses at night under the street lights
I ain't missing no meals, I gots to eat right
I'm on hustle overdose like that nigga from 
Ain't no hostage, we ain't asking nobody a thing
Tryna stay volunteered and never give up
Tryna keep my head up, but I'm better
It's them bloodclaat change, don't come
Them bloodclaat pain don't come

Come yah suh fi conquer, wi nuh come fi 
Watch it, likkle kid,  lock out, tek mi wheel
Voices dem a echo  go feel
Dung inna di ghetto, sufferation, it's so real
Can I hustle, have a snack? And can a gangsta catch a meal?
Instead of catchin' spaces 'cause informer run go squeal

Lion pon di gangs and seh dem ready fi appeal
Jesus crucified beside some man weh rob an steal
Gangsta paradise and Rastafari come reveal
Size and in the times and everything already seal
Evil force a rise up but mi block dem wid mi shield
Who come fool you up is like yuh fren dem come in vehicle
Pushin' up your ego so yuh feel like Steven Seagal
Risin' up di eagle, squash 'em like a beagle
Muffin gang and Likkle Jon, we sharper dan a needle

Run pon dem so lethal, starrin' every sequel

Quit and mek music dat will shake up yuh cerebral
