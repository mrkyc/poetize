Lady's and gentle man, hey, hey, hey
I don't know about you (what?) but I came to party tonight
Yeah
If you're with me (what?) put your hands up right now
Put them up, put them up, put them up
Drinks up high every time I hit the party
Shots, shots, shots, shots, cause it's time to get retarded
Everybody, everybody grab a motherfucking cup
And drink that shit 'til you get fucked up
Shake that ass like it's your birthday
Stay out all night like tomorrow ain't a work day
Let's get it crunk, let's get drunk
Let's get buck-ass wild, tear it up

Turn the lights down low and let the DJ go
Until the speakers blow
(Stay up 'til the break of dawn)
Take a sip of Jack, she's with a sip of that
There ain't no turnin' back
But hey, I don't care (I don't care)
Wherever there's a party, I'm the first one with a drink in the air
We can share, cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here

Bottles in the air, pour me another one
Who believe in havin' sex? I'm tryin' to get me some
Work it nice and slow, when the bass get low
Jump up on the table and lose control
Fucked up, fucked up, wasted, wasted
Go crazy, get shit-faced
Let's get it crunk, let's get drunk
Let's get buck-ass wild, tear it up

Turn the lights down low and let the DJ go
Until the speakers blow

We don't want this night to end
We won't sleep (won't sleep), then we'll do it again
(Yeah!)
