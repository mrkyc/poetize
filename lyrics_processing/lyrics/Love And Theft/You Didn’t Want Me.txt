Hey, baby, why you look so sad?
I should be the one feeling like that
You told me I was holding you back
I let you go, let you do your thing
Hiding my feelings try to play your game
With my heart it ain't okay

'Cause you didn't want me, you didn't want me
When I was whatever you needed me to be
You didn't want me, you didn't want me around
And now you calling me up, calling my bluff
Wondering if I've given you up
You didn't want me 'til she came around

Maybe it's the lonely day that changes you, babe
You left me in a pouring rain
Gave me no explanation, just blurring my vision
Sweet sunsets, nights we'll never forget
Oh, yeah, you're thinking now maybe
You're wishing it was you and me

Is it that you can't seem to stand
Seeing us happy, holding hands
Or do you really, really want me again
I hope you don't think that I can't see
The spell you trying to pull on me
But it's too late I'm sorry, baby
You might also like
'Cause you didn't want me, you didn't want me
When I was whatever you needed me to be
You didn't want me, you didn't want me around
And now you calling me up, calling my bluff
Wondering if I've given you up
You didn't want me 'til she came around

Maybe it's the lonely day that changes you, babe
You left me in a pouring rain
Gave me no explanation, just blurring my vision
Sweet sunsets, nights we'll never forget
Oh, yeah, you're thinking now maybe
You're wishing it was you and me

You didn't want me, you didn't want me
Don't make this any harder than it needs to be
You wanted to be free
