You're crawling back in my head, stealing the oxygen
And everyone else in here disappears, but the two of us
And the room starts to spin around the chandelier
In the buzz of the crowd I can feel the rush
'Cause you're clouding up my atmosphere
Everybody's got somebody who gets them the way you got me
I still want you, I can't stop me
Girl, I wanna run right to you, then I wanna run away
Girl, I got to hand it to you, you know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew you, 'cause every time I see you standing there
Oh, feels like I'm running out of air
You hit me like a wave, you cover me in the crash
I'm drowning in what you say, it's taking me under, fast
As you're taking me down the hall you make it easy for me to forget
'Cause you're saying everything you know I want you to say
And I'm getting in deeper, the darker it gets
The lights go out and the service fades
Everybody's got somebody who gets them the way you got me
You got me right where you want me
Girl, I wanna run right to you, then I wanna run away
Girl, I got to hand it to you, you know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew you, 'cause every time I see you standing there
Oh, feels like I'm running out of air
You might also likeI still want you, I can't stop me
Girl, I wanna run right to you, then I wanna run away
Girl, I got to hand it to you, you know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew you, 'cause every time I see you standing there
Girl, I wanna run right to you, then I wanna run away
Girl, I got to hand it to you, you know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew you, 'cause every time I see you standing there
Oh, feels like I'm runnin' out of air
