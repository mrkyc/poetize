Saw a young momma laughin' and talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

Saw a Springbreak Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hidin' their Coronas
Like kids do
And I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
Everything it's not

I thought about the songs that'd make us feel better
Thought about fate that ties is all together
I thought about now and I thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right and the times I blew it
Thought about real
Thought about good
And I thought about true
And I thought about you
You might also like
I saw "hungry" misspelled on a cardboard sign
In a dirty t-shirt that said "Roll Tide"
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

Ran into a buddy, said "how long's it been?"
I said "a couple of years", he said "boy it's been ten"
That's what time will do
And I thought about you

I thought about the songs that'd make us feel better
Thought about fate that ties is all together
I thought about now and I thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right and the times I blew it
Thought about real
Thought about good
And I thought about true
And I thought about yo

Ooh
You, ooh
I thought about you, you, ooh
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
Everything it's not

I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
And for a minute or two
