Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You showed up at the party
You wasn't gonna stay too long
But that all changed up when your song came on
Somebody handed you a cup
So you went with the flow and you filled it on up
You feel the buzz in your bones
And then you start making the rounds
You know all too well what's about to go down
You say "hold up, I better go"
Yeah right, next thing you know...
You look up and it's 2 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Like you're VIP at the nightclub
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
Now you're phone's filled up
With pictures that you didn't take
And it's you throwing deuces with 'what's her name'
And there's your boys right there
Tailgate poker table all in on a pair
Here come the country girls
They wanna dance all on ya, wanna rock your world
It was supposed to be a regular night (Regular night)
But now you're like
"To the left, to the left, to the right."
You look up and it's 3 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Like you're VIP at the nightclub
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the right
You look up and it's 4 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Here's to the nights that memories are made of
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the right
