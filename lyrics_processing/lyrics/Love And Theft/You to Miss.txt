They try to move on
Can't stand the pain of you gone but baby that's not me
I'd never try to ease the ache that I feel the pain
Reminds me how real this love has come to be
And I'm not running scared
I will stay right where
I gave you my word
That I would be
And I don't want to hurt
But I know I have to feel
I do it to be close to you
Just to keep you real
And I don't want to cry
But tears are part of life they conquer the impossible
And make you feel alive
And I'm so glad, my love
That I have you to miss
Some people try to fake
They don't feel this
Can't stand to face the realness so they just run away oh
But I want nothing more than you to hold me
So intimately know me
So I'll hurt along the way
You might also likeAnd I'm not running scared I will stay right where
I gave you my word
That I would be
And I don't want to hurt
But I know I have to feel
I do it to be close to you
Just to keep you real
And I don't want to cry
But tears are part of life they conquer the impossible
And make you feel alive
And I'm so glad, my love
That I have you to miss
And it could never hurt so bad that I would trade the love we have
And it could never cut so deep that I would never want to leave
And I don't want to hurt
But I know I have to feel
I do it to be close to you
Just to keep you real
And I don't want to cry
But tears are part of life they conquer the impossible
And make you feel alive
And I'm so glad, my love
That I have you to miss
