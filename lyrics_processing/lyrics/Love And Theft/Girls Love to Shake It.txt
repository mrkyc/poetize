Wheels like to roll like Corona likes a lime
Junior likes to race, Skynyrd likes to rock it
Money likes to burn a hole in both of my pockets
Trucks like the mud, guns like to bang
Me, I like to see you just doing your thing
Rivers like to run and cars like to drive
And girls love to shake it, shake it, shake it all night
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it all night
Shake it, shake it, shake it till the morning light
It ain't that complicated and they do it just right
Girls love to shake it, shake it, shake it all night
Girls love to shake it, shake it, shake it all night
Preachers like a church, guitars like picking
Water likes melon and fry likes chicken
Whiskey likes a barrel, tequila likes a shot
Bikinis like the beach and summers like it hot
We like it loud, crank it up to the limit
I wanna see the whole wide world two stepping
Freedom likes to reign, the flag likes to fly
And girls love to shake it, shake it, shake it all night
