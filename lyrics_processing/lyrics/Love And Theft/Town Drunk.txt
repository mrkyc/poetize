I never knew why, but my mama said if she wanted to, she could stay
A pretty little girl who fought like a boy but she wanted to hold my hand
In a little blue dress that she always wore, yeah, I might have been her only friend
I remember that summer like yesterday, she's to hang around all the time
Down by the creek we would always play and tell secrets by the porch light
Shy as a bird and timid as a flower I wondered where she grew up
I never really thought that much about it but everybody said her daddy was the town drunk
Broken like a bottle, running from the only home she ever had
Tangled in the talk behind her back
Yeah, he thought she was nothing, growing like a weed on the wrong side of the tracks
How could anyone not love a girl like that?
One afternoon in the middle of town, I saw her daddy sleeping on a bench
So I walked up and introduced myself and said his daughter was my best friend
He looked at me like he didn't care and he asked me for a couple of bucks
Right then I decided I'd look after that pretty little girl whose daddy was the town drunk
Broken like a bottle, running from the only home she ever had
Tangled in the talk behind her back
Yeah, he thought she was nothing, growing like a weed on the wrong side of the tracks
How could anyone not love a girl like that?

A girl like that
Several years later, I read in the paper that her daddy had passed away
I was holding her hand, she had the baby in the other, there was really nothing I could say
She looked at me and I gave her a kiss, all that mattered was the three of us
