And so am I
But I want you here
By my side oh
Your smile at me
It's everything
The staring game
That song of love
I look you in the eyes
I try to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place oh
I look you in the eyes
I try to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place
You and me dancing the night away
You can feel my heart beating so hard
We look eye to eye
And I'm swept away
On a moonlit walk on the beach
Watching the sunrise for the first time
I'm in a trance
From the one slow dance
You might also likeYou're standing there alone
And so am I
But I want you here
By my side oh
Your smile at me
Is everything
The staring game
That song of love
I look you in the eyes
I try to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place oh
I look you in the eyes
I try to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place
You and me dancing the night away
You can feel my heart beating so hard
We look eye to eye
And I'm swept away
On a moonlit walk on the beach
Watching the sunrise for the first time
I'm in a trance
From the one slow dance
We don't have to talk
We don't have to laugh at all
I just want you here with me
We don't have to talk
We don't have to laugh at all
I just want to be
You and me
You and me dancing the night away
You can feel my heart beating so hard
We look eye to eye and I'm swept away
On a moonlit walk on the beach
Watching the sunrise for the first time
I'm in a trance
