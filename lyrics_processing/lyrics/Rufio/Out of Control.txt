Give me a reason, I'm on my knees and
I'm betting anything will keep me alive
I'm treading water, your mind is stronger
I'm faking anything that I can't define
You're broken heart's gone and now you're all alone
You're giving everything and now you'll break mine
I'm saying sorry, the words are nothing
Your voice is poison and it gets worse

In time, in time, in time
In time, in time, in time

This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
What intentions?

It's like a bad dream, another story
That's running circles in the back of my mind
See now it's okay to give me nothing
'Cause I was using you so I could get mine
You know I wanted to see only you
But you were trying just to keep me away
We're realizing, we're patronizing
So now it's over but the past it remains
You might also like
In time, in time, in time
In time, in time, in time

This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
What intentions?

These imperfections make it hurt
And you're far away now but I know you're coming home
This is out of control
We can't make it on our own
We keep playing along just to leave us more alone
This is out of control
This happy ending's getting old
But we're playing along
With intentions
This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
This is out of control
We are still locked down today
We keep playing along
With intentions
