And you'll know where you are
You feel like all the time you've wasted
Is as distant as the stars
Is it a chance that you'll try taking?
Or a break from all the world
'Cause you're the loneliest, the loneliest of all
I feel your bent and broken lying to deceive us
Show me a light above my shoulders and my head
'Cause I am sick of all the darkness and the red
Show me a change, a pace that I can just take in
And maybe tonight we'll just send out my home again
You change the plans to your whole life
And you'll know where you are
You feel like all the time you've wasted
Is as distant as the stars
Is it a chance that you'll try taking?
Or a break from all the world
'Cause you're the loneliest, the loneliest of all
I feel your bent and broken lying to deceive us
Show me a light above my shoulders and my head
'Cause I am sick of all the darkness and the red
Show me a change, a pace that I can just take in
And maybe tonight we'll just send out my home again

So build that bridge and we're over
You gotta face the goal, but your heart it seems
Is stuck inside of another dream
So hear me out now, come on hear me out
I feel your broken lying to deceive us
Show me a light above my shoulders and my head
'Cause I am sick of all the darkness and the red
Show me a change, a pace that I can just take in
And maybe tonight we'll just send out my home again
Show me a light above my shoulders and my head
'Cause I am sick of all the darkness and the red
Show me a change, a pace that I can just take in
