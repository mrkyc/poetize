Saw you 'round the other day
Shorty, she was all the way
Looked like you were feelin' me
So I had to come and see
Girly wasn't tryin' to hate
But she had to demonstrate
That she was the queen to be
But she couldn't fight the chemistry

And I say...
I-I-I
I can't lose you, babe
I-I-I
No, oh yeah

She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor (Sugar)
She was oh so tight, like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love

Girl, it's just the sexy way
You back yourself into me
You're more then just a pretty face
You're better then a fantasy
Come on, baby
Don't ignore me
I know what you're feeling for me
You can't fight it
'Cause you want me
Don't you miss this or you'll be sorry
So tell me what it's gonna take (Tell me what it's gonna take)
You've got me all bent out of shape (Got me all bent out of shape)
Thinking 'bout you all day (Thinking 'bout you all day)
And how you gonna make me wait (Come on, ma)

And I say..

I can't lose you, no, no
