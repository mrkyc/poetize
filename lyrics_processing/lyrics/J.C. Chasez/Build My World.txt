Clear my eyes, it's the morning after
Did I fall in love or did I find disaster?
Take a second just to breathe
I pick my heart up off my sleeve
There she goes and I know she knows
By the way she eased out on her tippy-toes
Skip the breakfast tea for two
We made no plans to rendez-vous

Someone for everyone but no-one for me
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find someone
Someone to build my world around, around
So I'll alter love until I find the one
The one to build my world...

Lazy days, I'm in the hazy phase
Of watching countless ways in which my life goes crazy
Foolishness to blame, still, it pains me all the same
Empty faces with empty gazes in a race of changes
I'm losing faith and my pace
You might also like
Tryna keep my feet before I fall
I'm on this endless road with nothing to see (Nothing to see)
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one to build my world around, around
So I'll alter love until I find the one
The one to build my world...

A cornerstone of honesty (All around)
A foundation of gravity and freedom (All around)
A clear and concrete understanding (All around)
A love that's best kept safe and sound (All around)
It's amazing how we feel real, baby
It's from ourselves we so often run
A benefit of clear consequence of heartbreak
Expose the truth and give yourself to love
We often set up to be disappointed
We often crawl before we learn to fly
It's the blur that moves right into focus
It moves it down and moves your heart in line
Build my world around, around (It's amazing, oh yeah)
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one to build my world around, around (Oh yeah)
So I'll alter love until I find the one
The one to build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one to build my world around, around
(Just say it, just say it, just say it, baby)
So I'll alter love until I find the one
