This electricity, it's too much for me
The way you shake my bones
(Oh, the way you shake my bones)
Girl, I'm set to blow
And do you know my name? (Do you know my name?)
Does it make a difference anyway?
The way you love to tease
And tonight I'm on my knees, oh

Sugar
Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Oh, shake it, do it, give me what you got, girl
Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Oh, shake it, do it, give me what you got, girl

This electricity, it's too much for me
The way you hypnotize (Hypnotize me)
With your side to side (With your side to side)
I wanna take some time, and get behind your eyes
Only want to please you
'Cause you'll be making it, making it electric, oh

Sugar
Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Oh, shake it, do it, give me what you got, girl
Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Oh, shake it, do it, give me what you got, girl

Do you know I want a spark of your touch?
I wanna taste you so much while my mind is steaming
Do you know I want a spark of your touch?
I wanna taste you so much
We should be making it and making it electric, oh
Making it electric, oh
I'll do it 'til you're satisfied

Shake it (Shake it), do it (Do it), give me what you got
Oh, shake it (Shake it), do it (Do it), give me what you got, girl
Shake it (Shake it), do it (Do it), give me what you got
Oh, shake it (Shake it), do it (Do it), give me what you got, girl

(La la la la la la la) Running through my body is too much for me
(La la la la la la la) Running through my veins through my circuitry
(La la la la la la la) Running through my body is too much for me
(La la la la la la la) Running through my veins, through my circuitry

Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Shake it, do it, give me what, give me what, give me what you got (Oh)
Shake it, do it, give me what you got
Shake it, do it

Making it electric, oh
