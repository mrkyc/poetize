Yeah, oh

I found a letter on my dresser last night
About a baby on the way
It made me suspicious of another guy 'cause
You couldn't tell me to my face
And so I asked to find out if I was right
That's when your eyes filled up with rage
Now, nine months go by, the baby's not my blood type
Look at the mess you've made

You know I love you so much
Girl, I would never hurt you

But if you play with fire then you'll get burned
When will you learn? Now it's your turn
Remember all the lies you sold me
You made me feel so sad and lonely
Now your fairy tale's unfolding
With nothing left to say
'Cause I loved you all the way
Until yesterday
Oh-oh, until yesterday
Uh-huh
You might also like
Well, damn
Well, can you help me understand
Why you would keep me
While you're sexin' with another man?
Or was it just a one night stand?
Or was it something far more planned
Than what we had 'cause

You know I love you so much
I know your daddy taught you better

But if you play with fire then you'll get burned
When will you learn? Now it's your turn
Remember all the lies you sold me
You made me feel so sad and lonely
Now your fairy tale's unfolding
With nothing left to say
'Cause I loved you all the way
Until yesterday


You know I love you so much, oh
Your daddy should have taught you better
But if you play with fire then you'll get burned
When will you learn? Now it's your turn
Remember all the lies you sold me
You made me feel so sad and lonely
Now your fairy tale's unfolding
With nothing left to say, oh
If you play with fire then you'll get burned
When will you learn? Now it's your turn
Remember all the lies you sold me
You made me feel so sad and lonely
Now your fairy tale's unfolding
With nothing left to say
'Cause I loved you all the way, oh
I loved you all the way until yesterday
Remember all the lies you sold me
You made me feel so sad and lonely
Now your fairy tale's unfolding
Nothing left to say, nothing left to say
'Cause I loved you all the way
