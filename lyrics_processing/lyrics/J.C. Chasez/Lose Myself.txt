Hey, yeah, yeah

She loves daffodils and she keeps 'em on her windowsill
When the wind blows, her smell fills the room
She dreams in color, but does she know that I love her?
I'm swimming in my abyss of insecure blue, yeah

And I'm losin' my head
And I can't get no sleep
But if I reached out
Would you reach out for me?

Knocked unconscious
Walking on water cause I'm thinking of you
(Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Don't you know that love's intoxicating
And I need the abuse? (Need the abuse)
Because I'm nervously falling, you're my destiny calling
(Destiny calling)
What you're making me do?
It's all because I lose myself in you
All because I lose myself in you
You might also like
I don't wanna be invisible, I just wanna be compatible
Longing for something that can only be filled by you, yeah
'Cause I'm fighting with my confidence
Build up my courage, give myself a chance
Because the only thing I think about is you, yeah

Do you know that I'm here? Do I even exist?
I'll dance on velvet skies
With just the thought of one kiss, yeah

Knocked unconscious
Walking on water cause I'm thinking of you
(Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Don't you know that love's intoxicating
And I need the abuse? (Need the abuse)
Because I'm nervously falling, you're my destiny calling
(Destiny calling)
What you're making me do? (What you're making me do?)
It's all because I lose myself in you
All because I lose myself in you

I see the beauty and your strength, baby
And you fight to keep it real, yeah
But I break down your walls (Break down your walls)
With my army of love (Army of love)
Take a journey through my heart, it's a test of fate (Test of fate)
As we hold each other close, our spirits gravitate (Gravitate)
Let's drift into forever, as our boundaries melt away, yeah
Thinking of you
I find myself intoxicated by this drug
Sent to my knees 'cause I'm addicted to your love
All because I lose myself in you
All because I lose myself in you
All because I lose, I lose myself in you
All because I lose myself in you

If you share with me, then I'll find you
And I'll meet you there, down in nowhere
If you share with me then I'll find you
And I'll meet you there, down in nowhere
Baby, my life is yours, just open up the door
I can't believe I found you, yeah, yeah
'Cause if you share with me, then I'll find you
And I'll meet you there, down in nowhere
Down in nowhere
Yeah, yeah
