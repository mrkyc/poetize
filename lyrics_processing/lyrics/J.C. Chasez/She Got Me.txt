Came in on a rocket ship the middle of the night
Coloring the stratosphere, a beauty by her side
She was so hypnotic, staring in her beams of light
It was so mysterious, but something that I liked

What you do to me, I can't explain
You're so good
It's a gamble that I have to take
What am I supposed to do?
Girl, I can't deny

She was traveling through space and time
I've been trapped on this world of mine
Came down from nowhere
You're blowing my mind, yeah

She was such a find, it's like she was designed
Engineered, there's nothing left to perfect her
Waiting on a sign, I was tied in a bind
It'd be nice if I could release all the pressure
Striving to survive while I'm staying alive
Coping with the pains of her pleasure
Decide to cross the line
Play the cards where they lie
'Cause I know there's nothing left but to get her
You might also like
What you do to me, I can't explain
You're so good
It's a gamble that I have to take
What am I supposed to do?
Girl, I can't deny

She was traveling through space and time
I've been trapped on this world of mine
Came down from nowhere
You're blowing my mind, yeah

'Cause I've been waiting patient for a love that's mile high
Floating over galaxies of light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She was traveling through space and time
I've been trapped on this world of mine
Came down from nowhere
You're blowing my mind, yeah
Oh, she got me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, she got me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
She got me, she got me, she got me, she got me
She got me, she got me, she got me, she got me
She got me, she got me, she got me, she got me (Yeah yeah)
She got me, she got me, she got me, she got me
(She got me, she got me, she got me)
She got me, she got me, she got me, she got me (Oh)

She walked right into my life
She walked right into my life
She walked right into my life
She walked right into my life
She walked right into my life
She walked right into my life
