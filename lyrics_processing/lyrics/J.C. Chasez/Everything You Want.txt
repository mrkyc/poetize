The shame is in the greed
No, no

The distance of being just out of reach
Is taking its effect on me
Why do I feel the needs of guilty tendencies
Eating away at who I used to want to be
Caught up in the trapping zone
It's almost impossible to keep up

(Camouflage) Bandaids for my insecurities
(Swimming with sharks) I've become a killer
What about your heart?
I want the love of my life as of yesterday (Where does it stop?)
The more you get, the more you want

Everything you want, you just can't have it
Everything you want, you just can't have it
Everything you want, you just can't have it
Everything you want, you just can't have it

There's always something else around the corner
The appetite is never fully satisfied
Even before you get you're on to the next
Consuming everything in sight
Living in a fantasy world
Trying to digest the fact having everything can make you happy
You might also like
(Work so hard) Fill the void of insecurity
(Self absorbed) I've become the killer
(Restless heart) What's left and who needs it anyway
(Haunted by thoughts of) The more you get, the more you want

Everything you want, you just can't have it
(You just can't, just can't have it all)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(You just can't, just can't have it all)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(Whoa, whoa)
Everything you want, you just can't have it

Whoa...
No-no-no no-no no-no-no

Slow down and take a look around you
The simple pleasures will astound you
The weight of everything move around you
Release the burden that you're bound to

Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money (Oh, whoa, oh)
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money (It's eating away at my soul)
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money (No, no, no, no)
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money (Don't you want the money, money)
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(You just can't, just can't have it all)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(You just can't, just can't have it all)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(No no-no, no-no-no no-no-no)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(Oh, you just can't, just can't have it all)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(Oh no, ooh oh)
Everything you want, you just can't have it
(No no-no, no-no-no no-no-no)
Everything you want, you just can't have it

Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money (Oh no, ooh, oh)
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Don't you want it, want it
Want the money, money
Everything you want, you just can't have it all
