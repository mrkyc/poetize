Speak your mind, just speak your mind
Speak your mind, speak your mind

Gave me a call after working all day
Tell you, "Head on over, over to my place"
You're feelin' sexy 'cause you just got a raise
And you wanna celebrate but you don't know what to say

Girl, speak your mind, 100 ways
It's better for ya, don't be ashamed
Just speak your mind, tell me what you like
Don't hold back now, time to play
Dripped through the hallways 'cause we started in the shower
(Not 99, not 98)
We didn't finish 'til we hit the kitchen counter
(I'll make love to ya, in 100 ways)

You got me curious, I wanna know your game (Know your game)
It's really simple, girl, our goals are both the same (Both the same)
Send me on a bottle rocket straight up into space (Into space)
You're so outrageous, I'm so glad that you came
You might also like
Girl, speak your mind, 100 ways
It's better for ya, don't be ashamed
Just speak your mind, tell me what you like
Don't hold back now, time to play
Dripped through the hallways 'cause we started in the shower
(Not 99, not 98)
We didn't finish 'til we hit the kitchen counter
(I'll make love to ya, in 100 ways)

Woke up next to you, you were lying fast asleep
Didn't think to wake you, you were all up in my dreams
She had, no makeup, no toothpaste, I don't wanna wait
'Cause she's such a sexy dame, I just can't control my thang

Come here closer, let me give it to ya
Wanna sneak up on ya, girl, wanna, uh
Like this, just like this, like this, uh

Don't want that animal inside you to be contained
(To be contained)
I'll be your Superman, you play Lois Lane
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Dip you in chocolate even though you taste good plain
(Taste good plain, plain, plain, plain, plain)
Bite you in the center, sweetest fields of sugarcane
Dripped through the hallways 'cause we started in the shower
(Not 99, not 98)
We didn't finish 'til we hit the kitchen counter
(I'll make love to ya, in 100 ways, girl)

In the middle of the day, babe (Any time you need me)
Hit me up on your lunch break (It's so much fun being naughty)
Got to get you, don't stay late (You're a centerfold, baby)

Adjust the button fly on my Levi's when you walked into the door
Standing 5'9 with legs high as the sky down to the floor
There's a fire burning deep inside ya that you can't ignore
And all the crazy things you say to me just makes me want you more

Got to ya girl, you know I love ya (Listen to ya)
I want you to believe (I'm tired of talking about it)
I just wanna lay you down (I wanna slide up right up on ya)
And help you blow off steam (Let's get our hands dirty)

The playa's crazy (I wanna show ya)
And though she always came across it she was tame
(Girl, you know I love ya)
100 ways is what it takes to feed her craving
(I'm going downtown where it's business as usual)
Not 99, not 98, I'll make love to ya in 100 ways
Know it takes awhile to go through all the different ways
(One hundred positions, we'll go through them all)
But I can't think of a better way I'd like to spend the day so
(With no intermissions, until you get off)
Turn of your cell phone and crack out the Gatorade
(One hundred positions, we'll go through them all)
'Cause it's time to get to business and there's nothing left to say
(With no intermissions, until you get off)

Why chase the clouds we lay upon? Love be set free (Be set free)
So, if you're ready, let's get on with our release (Talk to me)

Speak your mind, 100 ways (100 ways)
It's better for ya, don't be a slave (Come here, girl, that's right)
Speak your mind, speak your mind
