So you wanna be a rock star
Keep it going, don't stop
Work it while your on top, call the cops
Roller coaster riding, baby
Up and down, I love to watch you do it
I just want to get close to you
Find out what it takes to move you
Feel the rhythm, hit the spot, getting hot
All night long

All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

Keep in mind, I'm a love machine
Ready 24/7
Call me anytime you need some extra attention
Did I forget to mention? School's back in session
Get ready for a lesson
I just want to feel alive
And do what it takes to satisfy you
Hour after hour, baby
All night long with you
You might also like
All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you
All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you


All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you
All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you


All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
And all the time, I think about sex with you, with you
All day long, I dream about sex
And all night long, I think about sex
