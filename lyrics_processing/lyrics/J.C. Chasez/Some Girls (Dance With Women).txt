The door is coming off the hinges (Yeah)
About to pass out
No doubt it's hot in here
Because the club is full of women (Yeah)
It's wall to wall and I got my crew with me
We grab a table, spot to chill in
Hunt down a waitress, make an order
Here we go
Throw back a drink and let it kick in
It takes a minute, whose ready to have some fun

Get up and take a lap to mingle
Love being single on a night like this, yeah
So many beautiful young people (What?)
The game is legal
You don't have to kill 'em though
Just look at everyone as equal
While you were dancing she was watching
Feelin' you
Her and her girlfriends by the speaker

I find your playfulness appealing
The cat and mouse race
On your mark, get ready, go
Send you a drink, see what the deal is (What's the deal?)
Held up your glass and blew a kiss, then took a sip
When you were finished, back to business
You and your girlfriends move up
This is how you draw them in
