Yeah yeah
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's like your blood runs through me baby, baby
And I can't get you out my veins
I lust for you, electric lady (Whoa whoa whoa)
The affliction to my vein
And the skies will fall
Without you, I'm inside a hurricane
I would sell my soul
No, n-no, n-no, no

I need mercy
It's the insanity that eats the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fires, my burning desires for you
See, I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you, oh no
I need mercy
I pray that one day you will be here with me, girl
I would never let you go

Ah, ah-ah-ah
Blood shot eyes and I'm so wasted
Why, why-y-y?
Why do I fight when I can't make it?
I'm at the end of my rope, baby (Whoa whoa whoa)
I'm pulled apart from all the strain

I would break the law
There is nothing in this world I wouldn't take
I would sell my soul
But I can't, but I can't, but I can't, no, 'cause...

I need mercy
It's the insanity that eats at the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fires, my burning desires for you
See, I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you, oh no
I need mercy
I pray that one day you will be here with me, girl
'Cause I would never let you go

For you, girl, I would sell my soul
I would even break the law
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't take, oh yeah
And even if the skies would fall
I pray to God you hear my song
Without you, I'm inside the hurricane, oh
I need mercy (Mercy)
It's the insanity eating at the man in me
Girl, I need mercy
All of my fires, my burning desires
I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you, oh no
I need mercy
I pray one day you will be here with me, girl
'Cause I would never let you go

Oh no, no, n-no, no
Yeah yeah

I need mercy
I need mercy
I need mercy
I pray to God I can hold you again
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
I need mercy
Mercy, baby, mercy, baby, mercy, mercy me, girl
