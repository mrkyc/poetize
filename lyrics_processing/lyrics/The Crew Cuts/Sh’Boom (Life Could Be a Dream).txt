Hey, nonny, ding dong, alang alang alang
Boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ayy
Oh, life could be a dream (Sh-boom, sh-boom)
If I could take you up in paradise up above (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
Life could be a dream, sweetheart
Hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again
Oh, life could be a dream (Sh-boom, sh-boom)
If only all my precious plans would come true (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

Now every time I look at you (You)
Something is on my mind (Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-duh)
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine

Oh, life could be a dream (Sh-boom, sh-boom)
If I could take you up in paradise up above (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love (You, you, sh-boom, sh-boom)
Life could be a dream, sweetheart
