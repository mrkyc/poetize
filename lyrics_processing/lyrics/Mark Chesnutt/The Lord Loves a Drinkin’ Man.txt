The Lord loves a drinkin' man
He sent honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn the water to wine
Any man that can do that, oh, he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speakin' in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves a drinkin' man

Well, the preacher man, he told me, "Boy you ain't no good"
"Devil's gonna getcha, best start actin' like you should"
"All the cold beer and bright lights, stayin' out all night"
"Good Book, it tells me, boy, your soul's gonna burn"
Momma said, "Son, you're headin' down the wrong road
"They don't let honky-tonkers up in Heaven, I've been told."
Don't you worry, Momma, I'll see you up in Heaven
And I've been thinking 'bout it and I've come to this conclusion, now

The Lord loves a drinkin' man
He sent honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn the water to wine
Any man that can do that, oh, he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speakin' in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves a drinkin' man

Well, my Daddy said, "Son you're living your life all wrong"
"Lightnin's gonna strike you down before too long"
"That man upstairs, he don't like what you do"
"When you reach those Pearly Gates, you ain't getting through"
Well, I've been thinkin', got a brand new plan
I'm gonna start a little Church down at the Stumble Inn
Hell, that's right, I'm gonna start my own religion
We'll be drinkin' and a-dancin' at the church of Hank Williams, yeah
