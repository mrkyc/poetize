I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you're sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do, I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do, I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
You might also like
I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you, right here with you
Just like this
I just wanna hold you close
And feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do, I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

(I'd still miss you, babe)
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do, I'd still miss you, babe
