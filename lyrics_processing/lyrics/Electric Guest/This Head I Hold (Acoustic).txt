They call me a little grown-up
See, I'm upset because I've always been stuck
But I don't know what it is I'm without
Guess I'm in love with always feeling down
See the problem was I
I was fully consumed
By all of the petty things that I couldn't do
All of the plastic products, shows, and woes
I didn't ever show, I let it go
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and

Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, oh, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
Make me say, ooh
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feeling so cold
What they want, what they want from me
Make me say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What they want, what they gonna be

So find me stuck in some scene
I wanna get out but there's no in-between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that I've sunken so low
See the answer was this
If I wanna be free
I gotta stop playing 'round and running from me
Cause all of the plastic products, shows, and woes
They got my head feeling low, no room to grow
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and

Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, oh, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
Make me say, ooh
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feeling so cold
What they want, what they want from me
Make me say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What they want, what they gonna be
I'm sinking, ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
Get no sleep, feed the vampire
And I say, ooh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, no, it's so tired
