Ooh
You think I'm nothin' but another fool
I'm better
I'm better than you
I'm like, ooh
I can feel it from across the room
Whatever
Whatever I do

I'm like, this mothafucka might sue me
And that mothafucka might boo me
I'ma keep on goin' to a better day
All this other bitterness can fade away
It doesn't matter I'm ugly
Keep tellin' me I don't love me
Nothin' in my pocket, but I'm still okay
All I really know is how I feel today

Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
So turn the music up and get it poppin'
I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight
You might also like
Oh
Never play me on the radio
No manners
No manners at all
I'm like, oh
If you're feelin' it, then let me know
Don't matter
It don't matter, I know

'Cause these days, this mothafucka might kill ya
You act too nice, they won't feel you
Lookin' all around me, but I can't relate
Every day, I'm tryna find a new escape
Everybody's a model
You watch too much, you feel hollow
Nothin' in my pocket, but I'm still okay
All I really know is how I feel today

Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
So turn the music up and get it poppin'
I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight
Ooh, tonight
I got a feeling for the first time in my life
Ooh, it's a celebration
Thought I would die before I ever felt alright
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
And even if I never make a profit
I wanna have some fun 'fore my eyes close
So all that really matters is tonight

Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
So turn the music up and get it poppin'
I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight

Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
And even if I never make a profit
I wanna have some fun 'fore my eyes close
