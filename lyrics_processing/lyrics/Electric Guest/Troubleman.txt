She was young once
Girl of the bohemian kind
In the cold, bright dawn
We watched her grow
Wisdom begun
Season when the river was high
On the gray stone long
I walked alone
Me and my heart
Following the shadow she made
Like a dull sky day
I chased the sun
Back at the start
I was still in love with the way
It's a long way
From what's become

She's got it bad for me
She's got it bad for me
The only game she played
Now turn the other way
You might also likeShe's got it bad for me
She's got it bad for me
The only game she played, she played

Newly grown up
Folded up, the color he wore
See the all new girl
Rehearsed and well
Filling my cup
Playing at the edge of the shore
See the way she moves
I broke the spell

She's got it bad for me
She's got it bad for me
The only game she played
Now turn the other way

Oh, no
Try to fix it 'fore you break it
Then it's gone
Oh, no
I go on, I go on
She's got it bad for me
She's got it bad for me
The only game she played
Now turn the other way


Troubleman
You wished it all away
Gun in hand
You found a path today
And I know nothing about
Troubleman
Your faith was long ago
Foreign land
The sea was made of stone
And I know nothing about

He's gotten bad for me
He's gotten bad for me
The only game he played
Now turn the other way
He's gotten bad for me
He's gotten bad for me
The only game he played, he played

Troubleman
We used to shake the dead
Ship unmanned
The rain was just ahead
And I know nothing about
Where Troubleman
Is just the empty name

Oh, no
Try to fix it 'fore you break it
Then it's gone
Oh, no
