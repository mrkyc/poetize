It's Jeffree Star

Don't get me wrong I throw my hands up on the dancefloor
But the way you work it got me be-be-beggin' for more
So come in close let me turn your Shirley dirty
We'll make it hot sweatin' all through the night singing

(Oh, oh, oh) I got ya dancin' on me
(Oh, oh, oh) We got our hands up singing
(Oh, oh, oh) I want ya body on me
(Oh, oh, oh) So get your legs up (Yeah, uh-huh, that's right!)

I want ya legs up (Le-le-le-legs up)
(Le-le-le-legs up)
(Le-le-le-legs up)
So get your legs up (Oh, oh, oh)
Don't want your hands up (No, oh, oh)
I want ya legs up (Oh, oh, oh)
Don't want your drinks up (No, oh, oh)
I want your legs up

Pounding shots making sure that you're a slammer
'Cause the way I roll you can only nail me if we're hammered
Bitch I'm the queen, on your knees, kiss my feet, please
I like it kinky, sweating all through the night singing

Fast, fast, let's go!
Legs in the air and taking it slow
Hot, hot, don't stop
Bring ya little friend and we'll do a little swap
Fast, fast, let's go!
Legs in the air and taking it slow
Boom, boom bang, bang
