It's Jeffree Star and Breathe Carolina, baby

The director yells cut but the camera's still rolling
This is my life and you can't fast forward it
You wanna stop, you wanna top all the charts
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap

Queen supreme, and barbie teen dreams
Everything's not always what it seems
Christian Dior and Haute couture
It doesn't look good when you're dead on the floor

When you're famous you're hot, always something you're not
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top
If you're famous you're hot, thank God for Photoshop
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top

The director yells cut but the camera's still rolling
This is my life and you can't fast forward it
You wanna stop, you wanna top all the charts
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap

Sew up your self-esteem, it's fantastic
Your body can't move
Paralyzed and plastic
Being real is so sarcastic
When you're dead you'll be airbrushed in your casket

When you're famous you're hot, always something you're not
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top
If you're famous you're hot, thank God for Photoshop
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top

The director yells cut but the camera's still rolling
This is my life and you can't fast forward it
You wanna stop, you wanna top all the charts
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap

To be a star, you gotta lick it, lick it
S-s-suck it, you gotta sell it
Live it, live it
W-W-Work it
Show the, show the, show the
Show the world what you're made of
The director yells cut but the camera's still rolling
This is my life and you can't fast forward it
You wanna stop, you wanna top all the charts
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
The director yells cut but the camera's still rolling
This is my life and you can't fast forward it
You wanna stop, you wanna top all the charts
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
It's a wrap
