You can fuck me till the sun comes up
You can fuck me till the sun comes up
You can fuck me till the sun comes up
You can fuck me till the sun comes up
You can fuck me till the sun comes up
(You can fuck me till the sun comes up)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)

Your eyes are killing me
When you choke me, I can't breathe
Bed sheets cover my needs
Rip them off, take me to my knees
When we start blowing up
Give me whiplash, it feels like love

Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
You might also like
I know you want me, I want you too
You're feelin' frisky, I'm feelin' you
You feel me up, I'm goin' down
You can fuck me til the sun comes up
You can fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me

You stole my sanity
Limbs smashing like a symphony
Your fingers down my spine
I'm caving in tonight
Shut up and tie me up
You're trash but it feels like love

Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot
Burn, baby, burn, burn
You make me hot, hot

I know you want me, I want you too
You're feelin' frisky, I'm feelin' you
You feel me up, I'm goin' down
You can fuck me til the sun comes up
You feel me up, I'm goin' down
You feel me up, I'm goin' down
You feel me up, I'm goin' down

I won't try and stop you
Even though I should
Boy, you drive me crazy
But, damn, it feels so good

I know you want me, I want you too
You're feelin' frisky, I'm feelin' you
You feel me up, I'm goin' down
You can fuck me... (here we go)
