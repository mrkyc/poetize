Get 'em in my hot rod
Give 'em give 'em what they want
Then I drop it like a bomb
I tell 'em what they wanna hear
Make them lips disappear
Honey drippin' in your ear
You wanna lick? I'm right here
But I don't really want that
Complicated hot mess
I think I gotta crush that
Swallowed up my heart fast
I think I need an X-ray
Or maybe just a neck brace
I had to do a double take
You hit me in the best place
I think I need an X-ray
Or maybe just a neck brace
I had to do a double take
A double take, double take
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my hands off
Couldn't get enough (Ayo)
You might also likeI'm shameless and I'll, I'll say this
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my mouth shut
Now I've said too much (Ayo)
It's crazy but I'll, I'll say this
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love for the first time
I can't believe I like you
Doin' things I don't do
I might get a tattoo
I might get attached too
Savin' all your voicemails
Memorizing details
It's like we're in a movie
Yeah it always moves me
You make me wanna fade out
Got my heart on lockdown
This is what I want now
This is what I want now
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my hands off
Couldn't get enough (Ayo)
I'm shameless and I'll, I'll say this
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my mouth shut
Now I've said too much (Ayo)
It's crazy but I'll, I'll say this
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love
I fell in love, yeah
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my hands off
Couldn't get enough (I fell in love)
I'm shameless and I'll, I'll say this
I almost broke my neck
When I fell in love
Couldn't keep my mouth shut
Now I've said too much (I fell in love)
It's crazy but I'll, I'll say this
I fell in love for the first time
I fell in love for the first time
