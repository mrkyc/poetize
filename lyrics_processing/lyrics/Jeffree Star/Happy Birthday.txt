The confetti is coming down
Pretty people are all around
So say it and say it loud
And celebrate your life

Ow-oh-ow-ow-ow, Oh-oh-oh-oh-ow-ow-ow
Ow-oh-ow-ow-ow, Oh-oh-oh-oh-ow-ow-ow
Is anybody thirsty? Let's drink like it's your birthday!
Let's drink like it's your birthday! Drink! (Happy Birthday!)

If you don't wanna be yourself tonight
Put on your black caps and jump in my ride, boy
You can come inside my cake, you can blow my candles out (Surprise!)
And I would like to make a wish rubbin' my bottle and rubbin' my ****
And I, I feel like Vegas, now-now now make a wish

M-m-mazing
I'm a-m-mazing
I'm a-m-mazing
So, so, so make a wish

So, when I go to sleep until the A.M., fix your hair and get back to drinking
Whip cream all over my face ()
If you would like to make a wish, I promise to party, I promise to ****
'Cause you, you feel like Vegas, now, now, now make a wish
