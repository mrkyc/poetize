Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

It's so bizzare that you wanna be a star
When everyone who is just doesn't quite fit in
But if you wanna make it to the very top
Then you gotta get with me, I will show you how it feels
I-i-it's gonna take every inch of your skin
Every bone, every limb, do you really wanna know?
You bought a Louis that you saw in a movie
You just wanna go far, I can take you there

If you can treat me right I can show you the way
I'll let you play with me

Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare
Let me take you to CHANEL 'cause you look like hell
Give a pretty smile, now you're easy to sell
Fix you up, and fix you down, let's hide your scars
'Cause the world will start to play-play-play-play you like a guitar
Now it's time to brush your hair, pretend that you care
Just don't melt in the spotlight's glare
Don't you know life's so grand? I'll steal your man
While you're doing drugs with Lindsay Lohan

If you can treat me right I can show you the way
I'll let you play with me

Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Shut your mouth, and let's just try to make you look more beautiful
Smoking crack with Britney Spears, yeah, that's just the usual
It's not my fault the Jonas Brothers all took turns fucking me
Life's a bitch, say you're sorry, lick my ass on MTV, haha!
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
