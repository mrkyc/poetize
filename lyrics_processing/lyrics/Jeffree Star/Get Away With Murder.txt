I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever
Ever (Hey, hey, hey)
I can't control myself
I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)

There's a mystery inside my head
It was you dripping all in red
Did I hurt you?
Let me make it safe and sound
Can you feel me breathing down your neck?
You're just a perfect little human wreck
But I like you
Enough to destroy you, tear you down

I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever
Ever (Hey, hey, hey)
I can't control myself
I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)

There's a memory inside my head
It feels like a part of me is dead
I should save you
But I want to watch you drown
There's nothing you could say or do
Words mean nothing when your lips look blue
I love you
Now that you're six feet underground

I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever
Ever (Hey, hey, hey)
I can't control myself
I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)

(Hey, hey)

It's time to spill your guts
And I don't like what I see on the inside
I'm looking at the evidence
This seems like a flawless crime
Did you forget that love was dangerous?
And I feel like I'm, I'm
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder
Murder (Hey, hey, hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever
Ever (Hey, hey, hey)
I can't control myself
I feel like someone else

Murder (Hey, hey, hey)

Get away with murder
Get away with murder
