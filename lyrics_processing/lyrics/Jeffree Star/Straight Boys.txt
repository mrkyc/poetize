Straight boys, where you at?
I'm a boyfriend kleptomaniac
Straight boys, where you at?

I want a boy with juicy lips
Who doesn't care I don't have tits
I want a boy like me but hotter
To eat me out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Straight boys, I must confess
Wanna get under my dress?
Give me a kiss, kiss
Give me a fist, fist

Straight boys, where you at?
I wanna hit it from the front to the back
Straight boys, where you at?
I'm a boyfriend kleptomaniac

I want a boy who takes the blame
Puttin' Ron Jeremy to shame
I want a boy under my sheets
With pink stained boxer briefs
They don't have to tell their friends
They're gettin' it from both ends
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
