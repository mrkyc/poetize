J. Star and T. Mills, babe
Hey baby! I wanna give you some of my magic stick
Uh, What? You know you want it
Oh my God, shut up!

I gotta tell something to the girls (To the girls)
I'm on a boat, bitch
And we can sail the whole world
Dressed like I'm a 
Gettin' down in all them pearls
I could give you all of them
And make your toes curl, girl!

I got a little secret for the guys (For the guys)
That wants to know if it's the motion or the size (Or the size)
But if you're the one I pick to be the captain of my ship
Put you in my ocean baby
Would you drive? (Would you drive?)
You know that these guys are quick to claim they're gigantic
But size don't mean a thing, just think about the Titanic!
Maybe I can fake it
Make you think you're doin' damage
Yawn, you just don't understand it!

You told me we were going on a cruise
So how the hell did we end up on this canoe?

They say it ain't the size of your boat
But the motion in your ocean

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I got another secret for the guys (For the guys)
Whose quick to brag and always talk about their size (About their size)
But if my bedroom had a sign like a rollercoaster ride
Would you be too short to even come inside?
Cuz' you know that these guys are quick
To tell you that they're packin'
The truth is I can't see it with some magnifying glasses
Maybe with some tweezers, we can get into some action (Haha, ha)
And boy you got me laughin' (Haha, ha)

But the motion in your ocean

I got her callin' me "Captain"
While she sits on my ship
But the thing you don't know
Is that the ship is my dick
I got people asking "Why's he throwing girls off the boat?"
Because they all got silicone titties and can float!
I make her wetter than the ocean
When I'm ripping off her clothes, and
We could fuck up on deck, yeah
Do it in the wide open
Waves crashin', really smashin'
When we dock up to her mansion
Girl, I know you like cruisin'
Seein' Europe and that shit!
They say it ain't the size of your boat
But the motion in your ocean
