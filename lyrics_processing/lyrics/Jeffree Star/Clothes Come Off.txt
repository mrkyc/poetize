Did you know that I get paid to be me?
I go to clubs and I party for free
'Cause I do what I want and I do it real good (Yeah)
No mistaking, it's about to get served
I'm sippin' cups while I flip a couple birds
Then I'm on my way, goin' in head first (Yeah)

I've seen some shit, been around the world
I spread like fire
You're gonna know it's good
I can make, I can make this go crazy

It's not a party 'til my clothes come off I said it (He said it)
I'll do it (He'll do it)
I'm seeing triple and my face feels numb
It's official, (I love it) this is a good time!
It's not a party 'til my clothes come off I said it (He said it)
I'll do it (He'll do it)
I'm seeing triple and my face feels numb
It's official, (I love it) this is a good time!

When I go out, I go out in style
Haters can hate, but I can't help but smile
I'm Super-cala-fradu-listic-expialla-gorgeous! (Yeah)
Hold my drink while I pour another three
I triple-fist like I'm Jet Li
Yeah, I know how to fight, for my right to party (Uh-huh)

I love this shit, never get sick of it
It's hot like fire
Yeah, I know it's good
I can take, I can take this to the next level
