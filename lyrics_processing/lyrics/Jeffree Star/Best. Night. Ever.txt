Best night ever, best night ever-ever!

Wake up, I put on my makeup
They wanna blow me, blow me, blow me kisses
Hey bitches, if you want the riches
Then you should come, come, come along, come along with me now

Every day like Charlie Sheen
Blacked out, cause a scene
Wasted in my limousine
Every night like Jersey Shore
Passed out on the floor
And now you wanna be a whore

I hope I remember all this in the morning
I hope I remember 'cause all I know is

Tonight is the best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever

Wait! Hold up! She about to throw up
No shame, turn around and tongue you down (Oh yeah!)

Tonight is the best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever

Drink up! Drink up!
