Life vest, hang it up, I go underwater (Go down, go down, go down-down, go-go-go)
Seatbelt, take it off, car crash until I black out (Blackout, blackout, go-go-go)
Do or die daredevil, I'm obsessed 'til I get you I'm in cardiac arrest
Pedal to the fuckin' metal I'm never slowin' down, slowin' down

Yes I confess, I've been lovin' you half to death
See I'ma get you, take you, make you-make you mine, even-even if it kills me  (If it kills me)
My heart's jumpin' out of my chest, and I'ma want you til' my dying breath
Yes I confess I've been lovin' you half to death
See I'ma get you, take you, make you-make you mine, even-even if it kills me  (If it kills me)

If it kills me
If it kills me

Parachute closed up dive right into your love, your love, your love
Blindfold, on the floor, uncensored, I'm hardcore, hardcore, hardcore
Do or die daredevil, I'm obsessed 'til I get you I'm in cardiac arrest
Pedal to the fuckin' metal I'm never slowin' down, slowin' down

Yes I confess, I've been lovin' you half to death
See I'ma get you, take you, make you-make you mine, even-even if it kills me  (If it kills me)
My heart's jumpin' out of my chest, and I'ma want you til' my dying breath
Yes I confess I've been lovin' you half to death
See I'ma get you, take you, make you-make you mine, even-even if it kills me  (If it kills me)

If you do the crime baby I'll do the time
On a tightrope, I'd risk my life
I'd self-destruct fuck myself but fuck baby I-I-I-I-I

Yes I confess, I've been lovin' you half to death
See I'ma get you, take you, make you-make you mine, even-even if it kills me  (If it kills me)
