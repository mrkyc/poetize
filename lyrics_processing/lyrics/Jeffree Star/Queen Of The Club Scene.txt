Now it's 2 A.M. and the party pulls up
Now we're moving out to the city we love
To go whoa, whoa

I feel, I feel electrical from the lights, so bright
You're looking magical in the city tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Tell me
Now that I can see your eyes, eyes on me
Say my name J-E-F-F-R double E

'Cause I'm the queen of the club scene
And they love me
'Cause I keep the bass turned up
It's beating on my heart strings
And they all sing
That they love the queen of the club scene

And if you see me there when I walk on by
I will come to you when the time is right
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You might also like
And if I like the way you look when the beat kicks in
I will let you know as the DJ spins
Whoa, whoa whoa

Tell me
Now that I can see your eyes, eyes on me
Say my name J-E-F-F-R double E

'Cause I'm the queen of the club scene
And they love me
'Cause I keep the bass turned up
It's beating on my heart strings
And they all sing
That they love the way I move

'Cause I'm the queen of the club scene
And they love me
'Cause I keep the bass turned up
It's beating on my heart strings
And they all sing
That they love the way I move
Now the club is hot and you're colder than ice
If you want a shot, better take it tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa

And if you see me there when I walk on by
I will come to you when the time is right
Whoa, whoa, whoa

'Cause I'm the queen of the club scene
And they love me
'Cause I keep the bass turned up
It's beating on my heart strings
And they all sing
That they love the queen of the club scene
