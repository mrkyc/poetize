I want a love so good
So good that it'll make me sick
To touch, but I need it

You are the love to my Cobain
Blood to my blade
And you're no good for me baby, no good
You are the pin in my grenade
Can't pull you away
And you're no good for me baby, no good
Give me kisses again

Never gonna quit my addiction
And I like you keep me so conflicted
And I like it even when you hit it
La da da
Da da da

Take it up a notch, I might need stitches
Keep it dirty just like Sid Vicious
I know you wanna lick my delicious
Da da da
You might also like
You are the love to my Cobain
Blood to my blade
And you're no good for me baby, no good
You are the pin in my grenade
Can't pull you away
And you're no good for me baby, no good
Give me kisses again
You are the love to my Cobain
Kiss me again
You are the love to my Cobain
Give me kisses again

Tie me up - don't need no restrictions
You can take it all with such conviction
I kinda wish that we could switch positions
La da da
Da da da

Take it up a notch, I might need stitches
Keep it dirty just like Sid Vicious
I know you wanna lick my delicious
Da da da
You are the love to my Cobain

You are the love to my Cobain
Kiss me again
You are the love to my Cobain
Give me kisses again

I want a love so good
So good that it will make me sick
To touch, but I need it
Don't tease or I'll bleed
Oh oh
Don't tease or I'll bleed
Yeah
Don't tease or I'll bleed
Yeah
Don't tease or I'll
Don't tease or I'll
Don't tease or I'll bleed
