You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it (Where'd it go?)

Left, right, left, retrace my steps
I swear I had it right here and these things just so disappear
Back and forth, I break a sweat
Promise I guard it with my life, it's so much for do or die

Everything now means nothing to me, I got to keep shaking
Something I can't live without somehow I break it to pieces
Somehow I never learn my lesson and
You, you're no exception

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
Where'd it go? All over the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh, went out of the window
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You might also like
I been, I been looking round, oh oh
I been, I been looking round, oh oh

High and low, I'm searching
I look for the faces that I know, maybe they'll take me to you
Run in place so I'm going nowhere
I end up where I start, right back at your broken heart

Everything now means nothing to me, I got to keep shaking
Something I can't live without somehow I break it to pieces
Somehow I never learn my lesson and
You, you're no exception

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
Where'd it go? All over the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh, went out of the window
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my-my-my
Slipping right through my fingers, oh I can't believe it
It's all just happening so fast
So answer me this, what if I can fix it?
Would you give me another chance?

Can I hold a little love?
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it (Dropped it)
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it (Lost it)
Where'd it go?

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
Where'd it go? All over the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh, went out of the window
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my-my-my

I been, I been looking round, oh oh
I been, I been looking round, oh oh
