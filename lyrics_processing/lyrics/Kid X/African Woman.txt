I see so much God in my woman
I give you all of my good word
You're all that I coulda, dreamt
Let me indulge in your good love
Flowin' like the water
You are what I call a, Queen, yeah

I wanna take you on a date (Ntombazane ipantsula ligcwele ngawe)
And take you to some place you don't know (Ungaphel' umoya, ngipheth' into yok'thenga)
You look amazin' in that dress (Ngiyacala uk'bona umntwana omuhle kanje)
Is that a sign of things to follow? (Ngiyaz'fela bakithi)

It's your natural scented perfume that I can't get enough of
I high key wonder at the number of essential oils that get infused with that raw sheer butter
To come up with a potion worthy of being on your skin
Folks say that you got it from your mother
But they don't really know shit
I'm caught up in the motions
Heart's pulsatin' when we all up on each other
It could get beyond smoke, I'm all fire emojis
In you I see a Queen of an era
A dream manifested in a being that's forever
You, what my heart's been needing and better\
Look you in the eye it's clear
Loving you's a forever mood, that I ain't never coming down from, oh
We floating underneath the stars, they all came to witness, yes
