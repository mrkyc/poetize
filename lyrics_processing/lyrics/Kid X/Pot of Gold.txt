Yeah, I'm holding on my imperfections, turning on my vocals
Six PM in Austin Texas and I'm smoking on a benji that's a
 my thought that we could all just get arrested
Put it on record that these moments are so precious
Time spent debating about getting lost out in the country side
So these tall ass buildings find time to meet the destiny
See my name in a starlight type epiphany
Been patient and I'm hard-wired for the victory
So unconventional with the rhyme style
If not to mention, I've been aging like fine wine since the nursery
And still the best of me is yet to come
My eighty-eight born, one of one self-cut can't be replicad
Not in a million light-years of avatar
My  and it got rose from the concrete
African jungle, now everything is in arms reach
This is everything my fam prays for
This is everything a nigga grinds everyday for
Still I miss the old times, how the name go
This for rainbow and sunshine after the rainfall
On May fourth, history was documented
In a moment so spiritual, may the fourth be with you
This for everybody who looked out for me
In case you catch me with a telescope out on my balcony

I've got dreams, you've got dreams too
I feel lost, you feel lost too
See the stars pointing North to the road my heart belongs
You might also likeI've got dreams, you've got dreams too
I feel lost, you feel lost too
See the stars pointing North to the road my heart belongs

Came a long way and I'm still going places
This golden opportunity is precious jewellery
The type you'd have to search through an entire oasis for
You're out your mind if you think I'm gonna waste it
Thirty-two and approaching a new pick
Your biggest star couldn't tire up my own shoelaces
What's the seat at the table? I'm a whole other being
The legal guardian of the stakes that keep raising
A game-changer at every throw of the dice
The critics try to offer all sorts of advice
Go tell them, when I see their texts, they getting blue-ticked
If I script it, only God can proofread
Truth is, I can't be denied what I'm here for
Nor can I ever pay a mind to the rearview
Moving steadily, I'm mapping out the way forward
My every single line like an earworm
Getting closer to manifesting everything that I've dreamt of
Mansion, all type cars for my kinfolk
No streams of incoming till wrinkled in the face
And nowhere near losing my momentum
Still, a problem, my simplest of verses can kick it to the cab
And point you to where the word is
Non-violent, just raw feelings
They conspiring and it's all theories
Never bothered by the bickering of those who've never risked what I risked
To come close to what I cross yearly
From the bottom where the crib it had no ceilings
My experiences of dreaming out loud
I'm sending my whole script, now I can live 
Still converting tries from a million yards out
There's more to what meets the eye
So clearly, I'm a product of a big 
I've got dreams, you've got dreams too
I feel lost, you feel lost too
See the stars pointing North to
The home my heart belongs
See the rains leave a trail through
Golden pots pointing straight to home at last
 in my roots
The home my heart belongs

You've got a feeling
You've got to follow that gut feeling
You've got a feeling
You've got to follow that gut feeling
Let it take you out
Let it take you high
Let it make you out
Let it make you shine
Let it take you out
Let it bring you in
Follow the feeling
Let it take you out (Let it take you out)
Let it take you high (Let it take you high)
Let it make you out (Let it make you out)
Let it make you shine (Let it make you shine)
Let it take you out (Let it take you out)
Let it bring you in
Follow the feeling

What are the chances that I'd make this far?
I'm proof beyond debate in many ways that it's possible
I'm dreaming of showers at the Vic falls
I swear to navigated the pitfalls against all odds
Understand, I came up rapping on the radio
To claim every single blessing God had put my name on
None of these happens without a K.O., Easy, Tukza, Zinga, 
Proof to be pivoted, ung' bona ngi la
, Kwesta, Nota, SR, there's no way I can thank them enough
Your showing up is something that I can't overlook
Through the years, we've had our fair share of ups and downs
Lessons I couldn't have learned in many other ways
Looking back I can't that I'm surprised at how
My lowest moments turned out to be growing pains
Here I am walking in my purpose
All while breaking every shackle in my ankles
Never lost sight of what my work is
One step at a time know I'm far from perfect
Though I strive to attain it
All attempts prove futile but in due time
I learned the burdens being wronged and forgiveness
One sure away to keep my energy replenished
For the sake of my sanity, feeling responsible
For all the ills in the world and wishing that I could fix it
Problem-solving's when I'm feeling at my truest
Kinda funny 'cause my third name is Mlungisi
Trying to do better than yesterday today
Sinc the more things change, the more they remain the same
Swear, I can't even put it into words
