And stumbled 'cross two friends of mine
I see their faces stained by in the coffee grinds
Black liiiiiifeeee
Can't i now defy you
In this black life
Black knife stabs me in the back
I reaaalizeeee
I sense their coming to me everyday most all the time
I feel the predator he knows my name by now allright
God knows i've taken all that I can stomach up to now
But from the corner of my eye i dreeam about
I want a blueeeee liiiiiiife
Basking in the light
I want a blue skyyyyyyyy
Oh not a cloud in sight
Want a bluuee liiiiiiife
No need for me to hide
From this black liiiiiiiiight
Do you hear me noooooow
(gotta turn around)
I still I stand here unemployed and overqualified
Keeper of the king the strychnine in the troughs tonight
Black life
Can't i now defy yooou in this black life
Black knife stabs me in the back
I reaaalizeee
