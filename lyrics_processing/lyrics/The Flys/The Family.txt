Ok this song,uh, is called the family
And,uh, we got a close family of people we 're working with
And we appreicate that
And this is uh a really appropriate number
Tell it to the family
Ya see it growing day by day
You know you sell it to the people
Making music our own way
You know you see it in our faces
See us out at the coooooolest places
Tell it to the family
Yeeeeeeeah

Making music our own way

See us out at the coooooolest places
