ComPetition's gettin crazier
Maybe the old school's gEtting lazier
Its a mad mad world
4 all of us
Trying 2 make a bone
Just selling our songs
All of us Today here
Trying 2 find our way here
Walking in the fast lane
SomEebody get me off this train
Somebody get me off this train
Somebody get me off this train
Man the whole damn world is going insane
FiRe in the pit
Fire in the pit

Its a dog eat, dog eat, dog eat dog world
Trying 2 reach some lil' girls
Moving frOm the backstage

Representing here a new school
Surfin round you old fools
Vocalizing like the Beach Boys
Coming here 2 make some noise
