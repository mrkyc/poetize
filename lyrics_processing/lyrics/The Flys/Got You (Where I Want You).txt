Hey, what's the point of this?
Oh, hey, what's your favorite song?
Maybe we could hum along

Well, I think you're smart
You sweet thing
Tell me your name
I'm dying here

Ah-ooh, got you where I want you, oh yeah
Ah-ooh, got you where I want you, yeah

Hey, maybe just a smile
Oh, hey, did you know that I can dance?
Could we talk for a while?

Well, I think you're smart
You sweet thing
Tell me your sign
I'm dying here
