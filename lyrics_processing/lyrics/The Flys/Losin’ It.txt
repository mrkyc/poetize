You know what I mean
She wants to be friend
And damn you know what that means
She combs her hair
In a very special way
She makes me nervous
And I just dunno what to say
No one understands
She's a very special girl
No one understands
Why she rules my world
Everything's okay
When things are going good
You know what I mean
I knew that you could
I think I'm losin' my
I think I'm losin' my
I think I'm losin' my mind
I think I'm losin' my
I must be losin' my
I think I'm losin' my mind
Her mom says I'm obsessed
But the hell is wrong
Damn I'm thinking 'bout her now
Even while I'm singing this song
No one understand
She's a very special girl
No one understands
Why she rules my world
Everything's okay
When things are going good
You know what I mean
I knew that you would
You might also likeI think I'm losin' my
I think I'm losin' my
I think I'm losin' my mind
I think I'm losin' my
I must be losin' my
I think I'm losin' my mind
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it
She thinks i'm crazy
You know what i mean
She wants to be friends
And damn you know what that means
The way she flips her hair
Drives me insane
The way she bats her eyes
Goes straight to my brain
And all those little sighs
When she's feelin good
You know what I mean
I just knew that you could
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it
Losin' it losin' it losin' it losin' it

I think I'm losin' my mind
I think I'm losin' my
I must be losin' my
