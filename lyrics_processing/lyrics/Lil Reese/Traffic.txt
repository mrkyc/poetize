Young Chop on the beat
Don Cannon
We ain't really with that talking, bitch, we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life, man, catch him in traffic
We-we ain't, we ain't-

We ain't really (No) with that talking, bitch, we 'bout that action (That action)
He not (No) 'bout that life, man, catch him in traffic (Skrrt)
We ain't really with that talking, bitch, we love that action (That action)
I lost so many niggas, turnt into a savage (Let's get it)
And real life no movie shit, bitch, we clap (Bitch, we clap)
Where I'm from, this Chiraq, you get left as a tragic (As a tragic)
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic (Too dramatic)
And where I'm from that's three hunnid, normal spelled backwards (Let's get it)

Letting a nigga goon me, I can't imagine (No)
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic (Skrrt)
My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it (Man down)
My niggas do it for me, ain't no way around it (Let's get it)
Blood hound for that money, bitch, I gotta have it
Going crazy, twenties, fifties, hunnids, bitch, I'm cashing (I'm cashing)
And I ain't really with the talking, bitch, I'm money stacking (Let's get it)
And he ain't really 'bout that life, 'cause he don't love that action (That action)
And they don't come from where I come from, they wasn't born a savage (A savage)
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch, catch me in traffic (Skrrt)
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin' (No)
