Niggas is fuckin' stains man
I need that (hah, racks), show me that (racks)
We need that (Bang bang), I need that (Stain)

I heard he holdin', on the load, I need that
He say he out here in the field then show me that
And man these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that
And watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back
Niggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back
Put 300 on my back, I'm a runnin' back
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back

Doing me that's where it's at, no sneak dissin' none of that
At the top that's where we at, y'all beneath us that's where yall at
Old niggas talking bout them old racks but where they at?
And if he holding old racks we running in there, where they at?
Same hood same niggas, this where we at
Look out for my family man, fuck the rest
And if you with me then you with me man, fuck the rest
Head shots when we aimin' man, fuck yo vest

I heard he holdin', on the load, I need that
He say he out here in the field then show me that
And man these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that
And watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back
Niggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back
Put 300 on my back, I'm a runnin' back
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back
