I'm totin' a big ass, bone crusher
Excuse him, he don't know better
Now watch him, go through yo leather
Like click-clack we're on your schedule
If you knew better, you would do better
I'm getting money now, I used to shoot niggas
Who that in the cut? It's the crew nigga
Them my dogs boy don't make me let 'em loose nigga

Don't make me bring my dogs out the cut with them sticks
I might just pop out the cut with ya bitch
I'm up in the club in the cut with the shits
Rolling whole pounds and I'm pouring whole bricks
I can't talk to you pussy boy you's a narc
Think that you a sharp, hit your ass with a dart
Hop up in this foreign, hit your ass with the car
Thinking that you cold, put this heat to your heart
I got King Kong in my blunt
I got Donkey Kong in the trunk
I got Ceaser in my backpack
Up this bitch and go grat-grat
