Maybe it's my style, maybe it's my crib and she say them niggas boring
All we know is win-win, bitch, yes, we scoring
Real nigga shit, 300, we don't fuck around
Bad bitches call me just to fuck around
They don't like dicks, they just like for me to dick 'em down
Talm 'bout that goofy ass niggas tryna sit 'em down
Boy, she a star look at that ass, straight head spinner
Huh, you see my squad, and we go hard, yes, we some breadwinners
Yup, that thot there she a runner, 3Hunna they'll run her
Good head, she a goner, kush strong, gobble monster
Feds taking pictures so I gotta stop and go

Fuck nigga, fuck nigga (Fuck nigga)

Fuck nigga, fuck boy, pussy nigga, the best is I
You on the stand, shots fired, man down, you'll testify
Snitches run they mouth, my niggas, them niggas, we don't play that
Couple drillers come and drill you, my nigga, right where you stay at
My biggest hater is the reason I can't get no sleep (No sleep)
N-n-no sleep, F-fuck the police
'Cause I ride out solo dolo, my niggas, my family, 3Hunna
Red beam on the 30 that's a no go, GBE, OTF that's the logo
Free Five, free Law, free Bruh though
Lost some real niggas from a long time ago
Grind time so you know I gotta grind though
Prime time so you know I gotta shine though
We riding, we riding with a strap or two
And we don't go back and forth like the rappers do
And they say these niggas ain't hating
This Chicago, the motherfucking capital (What?)
