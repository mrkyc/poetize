Ay man, all these niggas that's riding
I can't tell them nothin
I can't tell them nothin

Too many niggas ridin', I can tell them nothin'
My lil Bro'nem gon' slide, I can tell you nothin'
300 they gon' ride, you can tell them nothin'
And if you ain't slidin', I ain't gone tell you nothin'
Ain't gon' tell you nothin' (nah)
No, I ain't gon' tell you nothin' (no)
So many niggas slidin', you can tell them nothin'
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin'

Lil bitch I'm on that money, on the money hunt
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin'
300 they gon' silde, we gone pull right up (skrt skrt)
And when it's time to ride, you can tell us nothin'
And he don't be outside, man he be put up
Call my phone, I'ma ride, I'ma pull right up
And when it's time to ride, you gon' see all of us
He rapping like he street but I don't know what's up

Don't let nobody bring you down cause they ain't down with you
And I'm a hound for that bread, watch me get it up
