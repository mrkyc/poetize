Money all on me bitch

Damn
I don't fuck with y'all
100 bricks in the trap

I'm smoking on the gas, so stinky like waddam (Damn)
My neck and my wrist so froze like waddam (Damn)
Pockets on swollen and they looking like waddam (Beep)
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam (Skrt skrt)
Waddam (Damn), waddam (Damn), waddam (Damn), waddam
Pull up on the scene, all the bitches like waddam (Skrt skrt)

You that nigga from the lam, you get down
I heard about your service, don't fuck with clowns
And if a nigga think it's sweet, get blammed
Them 300 boys don't fuck around
We be up on that block, we chop you down
Serve them fiends anything now
Anything go for cheap now
It's a drought but it ain't sweet now
Don't try to play us, you get manned down

I'm smoking on the gas, so stinky like waddam (Damn)
My neck and my wrist so froze like waddam (Damn)
Pockets on swollen and they looking like waddam (Beep)

Waddam (Damn), waddam (Err), waddam (Damn), waddam (Fredo Bitch)
Pull up on the scene, all the bitches like waddam (GBE baby)
Waddam (Savage Squad), waddam

Out of town trips, got me feeling like the man
10 bands in my pants just 'cause I can
Don't feeding these bitches money, man, I just give 'em grams (Cocaine)
Just robbed my plug for a brick and spent it on a chain (I did)
Got niggas talkin' drugs but they ain't sold a thing
I still keep it on me, man, it ain't shit changed
These bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
These bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
In the trap, servin' junkies, steady countin' hundreds
I break the work down then I give it to my cousin
First of the month, man, you know my trap jumping
If you ain't got no work, man, you better sell something
I'm smoking on the gas, so stinky like waddam (Damn)
My neck and my wrist so froze like waddam (Damn)
Pockets on swollen and they looking like waddam (Beep)
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam (Skrt skrt)
Waddam (Damn), waddam (Damn), waddam (Damn), waddam
Pull up on the scene, all the bitches like waddam (Skrt skrt)
