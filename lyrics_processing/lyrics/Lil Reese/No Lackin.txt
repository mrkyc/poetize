He reached for it, that's a dead body
Elmer Fud double pound shotty
My neck rocky and I'm off a molly
My bitch bad with a buffet body
Young nigga shoot at anybody
All these bands got a nigga cocky
Trapped in a club mothafucka
Lil Reese get em
Man down let the piece hit em
Do it broadway and police with em'
Yellow tape let the streets get em'
Chalk him out
White sheet denim
Bow bow I'm bustin' at em
I'm ballin hard no NBA
My bitch a diamond
Lisa Raye
Spent 20k at least a day
Do it weekends nigga, I do it everyday
She with me she go everyway
Count this money 'till my fingers hurt
When I hit the pussy, I bet she squirt
Selling dope, we ain't got to work
Real nigga, no tight shirt

Lotta paper bring a lot of haters, Capiche
And the more you make, will be the more you make, It ain't sweet (no)
Well I do me (f'sho)
Will I lose sleep (I dunno)
If I fall down before they start counting back on my feet
Let's go
Its that flyraq meet chiraq, there's no contest with their flow
All of my hairs out, with young dreadlocks, couple real niggas from the go
Like I said in one song
Life is lame with no goals
Barely brag about dope whenever I don't you niggas ignore
Chop be cooking that cracka nd talking hard rock and talking that snow
Chop will send me that track, I send that shit back, back of that hurst
Trapping something I know, something I did, just keeping it real
As a matter of fact, you never moved crack
But knowing y'all routes, prolly throw a brick bitch
