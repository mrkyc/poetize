Oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

There's so much shit I wanna do to you (You, you, you, you)
First you gotta step into this room (Room, room, room)
Look into my eyes, I'ma look right into yours
Cut the lights off but don't you close the door
Tonight I'm gonna make my hallways echo you (You, you, you)

I pull my shirt off (Ayy)
Pull your jeans down (Ayy)
Oh baby, take your time (Ayy)
Now turn around (Ayy)
As our bodies catch the mirror
Let me grind into the song
I'ma do you all night long

And I'ma go slow, slow (Slow), slow (You, you, you)
And I'ma go slow (Slow slow slow), slow (Slow, slow, slow), slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
But I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
I'm not finished 'til you're finished
You're gon' get yours, I'ma get mine
(I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine)
And I'ma take my time (Time)
And I'ma go slow
You might also like
Shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-sh-shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-sh-shawty like it slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
Shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-shawty like it slow
Sh-shawty like it slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

Baby, I'ma do you 'til you lose your mind
Baby, you're so motherfuckin' fine, ayy
I'ma do your little body like a rollercoaster
So hold on tight, lay on my shoulder
And slowly but surely I'ma break that body like a cake
You're gon' sweat these sheets out (Ayy)
I'ma mess your hair up (Ayy)
And I'ma wild out on you (Ayy)
Like I don't give a fuck (Ayy)
Until it's three o'clock, four o'clock, five o'clock, six
And I gotta take my time with you
'Cause your shit is the shit

And I'ma go slow, slow (Slow), slow (You, you, you)
And I'ma go slow (Slow, slow, slow), slow (Slow, slow, slow), slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
But I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
I'm not finished 'til you're finished
You're gon' get yours, I'ma get mine
(I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine)
And I'ma take my time (Time)
And I'ma do you slow
Shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-sh-shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-shawty like it slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
Shawty like it slow
Sh-sh-shawty like it slow
Sh-shawty like it slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

Oh, that's it, here we go
Put my love in the air
If the curtains are open I don't care, let 'em stare
Out the room, on the wall, every step on the staircase
Baby, let me make your day, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
