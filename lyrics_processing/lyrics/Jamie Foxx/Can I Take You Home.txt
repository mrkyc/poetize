So many ladies in the room
All that I can see is you
This dime piece is in this place
But you came through and took the case
'Cause I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me in your world
Yes I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me prove it to you one on one
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
And love you like I want to

I'm not here to waste your time
'Cause I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me in your world

And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me prove it to you one on one

Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
