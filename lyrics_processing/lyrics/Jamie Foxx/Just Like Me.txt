Say, Foxx (Yeah-eah-eah)
I had, I had a chick, man (Yeah-eah-eah)
She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah-eah-eah)
I did the same thing to her, but
She ain't have no right to do me like that though, dog, for real (Yeah-eah-eah)

You been seeing him and I know
And I was with her and you knew about it
But I was too blind to see it, baby
And you was out here doing the same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our car? And did you let him drive?
'Cause she's been by the house, she's been in the car
I even let her push the Porsche around a couple times

Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it, baby
And it ain't a point in feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that bub'
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don't know how to act
On the floor, backin' it back
Man, I can't be mad
She just like me-e-e-e-e
She just like me-e-e-e-e
She just like me-e-e-e-e
She just like me
You might also like
Now, it's so easy for me to imagine what you been doing, baby, so I don't even have to ask (No)
'Cause you ain't the only one that's been keeping secrets, baby, so it ain't no sense in me playing back
And I can't say nothing 'cause I did you wrong
And I was on some bullshit when I let that bitch up in our home
She's also known just like me
And she played the game like one of my homies

Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it, baby
And it ain't a point in feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that bub'
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don't know how to act
On the floor, backin' it back
Man, I can't be mad
She just like me-e-e-e-e (Getting money, having fun, man she)
She just like me-e-e-e-e (In the club, throwing ones, man, she)
She just like me-e-e-e-e (Twenty-fours on the Range)
She just like me (Go on, shorty, do your thing)
Hey, shorty who you fooling? You know I'm way too cool for you
To run that game on me, play me, try to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwin' her just like I hear he doin' you
Why you worried 'bout me doing me? I see you doing you
I can make her better though, you gon' let him ruin you
Just for the record, no, I wouldn't have her unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you, that booty do be moving, boo
Late night, straight pipe, that ain't nothin' new to you
Wait a minute, can't tell me shit
Wanna tell me somethin', then tell me this
If I would've never would've hit that chick
Would you even ever know dude existed?
Nah, got me twisted
Your ass, goodbye, I've kissed it
Now you all on his dick
Shorty, look at this bitch

You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that bub' (Bub')
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me (No one wrong, shorty)
She don't know how to act
On the floor, backin' it back (But that don't take away from the fact)
Man, I can't be mad
She just like me-e-e-e-e (You dealin' with a man with an ego, you know?)
She just like me-e-e-e-e
She just like me-e-e-e-e
