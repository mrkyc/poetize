Uh

Can I, can I, save you from you?
'Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do, girl
'Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'ma say to make you mine
But live, girl, have some fun, girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you
You might also like
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type? (Uh, yeah)
For your type (Uh, look)

Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl, quit playin', you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no, I get it, girl, I'm wit' it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
'Cause man, it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall
I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
