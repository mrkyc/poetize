Yeah, you know, Mary
These past couple of years, I've been going through some changes
Good and bad, but you know what?
At the end of it, it's still all love, girl
Yeah
Oh, oh baby

You stayed awake half the night
Love has just, put you through changes
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
It must be love that's on your mind
You doin' things, you wouldn't before
And you oughta know that

Love will make you oh so happy
Inside, I, I, I
I can't control it but it just takes me over, and
Love will make you oh so sad
Make you cry, I, I, I

Changes
Love changes, ooh, love changes
That's what love puts you through
Love changes, ooh, love changes
Changes
That's what love makes one do, oh, oh
Ooh, love changes
You might also like
Oh, wonderin' if it's real this time
Just not another half-goodbye
You walk around starry-eyed
Can't believe love would hurt again
Hurt again
I can't believe that this love will

Love will make you oh so happy (Make you oh so happy)
Inside (Yes, it will), I, I, I
I can't control it but it just takes me over, and
Love will make you oh so sad
Make you cry (Cry), I, I, I (Oh)

Changes
Love changes, ooh, love changes
That's what love puts you through
Love changes, ooh, love changes
Oh, changes
That's what love makes one do, ooh
Ooh, love changes
