They stole our hit! I never thought...

You got me to think for you now

I've tried to make good without much successs

You got me to think for you now

Ev'ry time I try for more, I wind up with less

You gotta put your soul on a moral break
Get to the point, you just gotta

Take
Steppin' to the bad side, woo, woo, woo

Steppin' to the bad side
You might also like
Gonna take a mean, mean, mean ride

The smile I had is gone away

Those that steal are gonna pay

Steppin' to the bad side
Today
Steppin' to the bad side, woo, woo, woo
Gonna take a mean ride, woo, woo, woo

The smile I had is gone away

Those that steal are gonna pay

Steppin' to the bad side, today

I tell you now it's got to end
No more trusting them my friend
We're gonna change our style, change our tone
Make the songs we sing our own
Steppin' to the bad side, woo, woo, woo
Gonna take a mean ride, woo, woo, woo

I'll get you all the breaks you need
In just two years we'll be in the lead
You can't sit back, it's plain to see
Open your eyes and trust in me

Steppin' to the bad side, woo, woo, woo
Gonna take a mean ride, woo, woo, woo

I was a man who tried to be good

I was always misunderstood

You can't play fair or be too meek
You gotta get way down and show your danger

Streak
Steppin' to the bad side, woo, woo, woo
Gonna take a mean ride, woo, woo, woo

Steppin' steppin' steppin'
Steppin' steppin' steppin'
Steppin' steppin' steppin'
Steppin' steppin' steppin'

Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' steppin' steppin' Steppin' to the bad side

A man just stole my woman from me
He took her down to Tennessee
She was the best girl I ever knew
If it wasn't for him she'd still be true
I've always been a good man, it's been said
But when I catch that man, he'll wish he were dead
Men like him make good men mad
Starting today I'm gonna be bad, yeah-heh

Yeah-heh

Steppin' to the bad side

Woo, woo, woo

I had to take myself a mean ride

Woo, woo, woo

Oh, you know that smile I had is gone away Woo

Steppin' to the bad, oh Steppin' to the bad side
Steppin' to the bad side Steppin' to the bad side
Today Step on
Yeah-heh
Yeah-heh
Step on, step on to the bad side Step step to the bad side
Step on, step on, steppin' to the bad side Step step to the bad side
