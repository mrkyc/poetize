:Chorus:
Dont cry mama, i miss em' too mama, wipe your eyes mama, all we can do mama,is hope and pray mama that one day mama everything will be ok no more rain mama, so dont cry mama, it's alright mama,all we can do is keep his memory alive mama,so wipe your tears mama, ten years mama,even tho it's not the same i'm still here mama
:Verse 1:
I was bad news on the block,throwin rocks,and every now and then the neighbors would called the copz, my little brother always try to cover up for me,I went from throwin rocks to throwin dice n hustlin,mama im sure u loved my lil bro a little mo,and even tho you couldn't keep it on the real low,i'd kill fo another chance 2 see him once again,I'm sorry for the way i was n how i must have been, 'cause i was bad i was nothin but a troble kid,i didn't always get the lovin lil brother did,he was gonna finish shool and made us all proud,i was one to break tha rules n never thought bout it,but things r dead now i wish that i can take em bak, if he was here i wonder of the kid would say to that,i made you mad i made you sad but dont cry mama let me wipe the clouds from your eyes
:Chorus:
And What i would give to see you again,(what i would do to see you again, lord tell me will this pain ever end),he was my little brother, he was my best friend (you know u were my best friend man im missin all the time that we spent) with every year that goes by it seems like jus yesterday,this emptiness in my heart keeps burnin won't go away, i keep tellin my mama everything will be ok one day we'll be together n a beter place, mama please dont cry, (don't cry mama, wipe your eyes mama, don't cry mama(tears me up inside (yeh u know it tears me up inside) to see my mama cry, don't cry mama, dry ya tears mama
:Verse 2:
Dear Lord shine ur light so we can find our way,after every dark night, theres a brighter day,even tho he's gone, mom im still right here,but i really feel like it should be him right here,close my eyes, visualize, all my loved one's faces, i miss u wanna be with you feel like trading places,would give mah life for yours no questions asked,so i can sleep in peace finally rest at last,things ain't just the same gotta keep on going,wanna cry deep inside but i just can't show em', tryin ta hold my tears threw the coldest years,wanna cry while them young thugs pouring beers, every body's hurtin,all the family n friends,this story no happy endin so sadly it ends,keep your memory alive as long as im alive ,but i can't become a man n keep tryin to survive
:Chorus:
And What i would give to see you again,(what i would do to see you again, lord tell me will this pain ever end),he was my little brother, he was my best friend (you know u were my best friend man im missin all the time that we spent) with every year that goes by it seems like jus yesterday,this emptiness in my heart this burnin won't go away, i keep tellin my mama everything will be ok one day we'll be together n a beter place, (mama please dont cry, don't cry mama, wipe your eyes mama, don't cry mama)tears me up inside (yeh u know it tears me up inside) to see my mama cry, don't cry mama, dry ya tears mama
