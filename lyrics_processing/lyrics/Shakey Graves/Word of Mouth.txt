When I go to sleep you know that she sees me, too
Oh yeah just standing around like the popular kids
Just hoping Saint Peter will let us in too
He says, "If you value your life, stay off the drugs
If you value the drugs, stay off the map
If you value them maps, you'd better travel, son
And if you don't want to travel then you'd better run, yeah."
(Vocalizing)
Yeah well I knew a king in his purple throne
You know that he had some trouble so he's all alone now
Well I used to bring him little presents from time to time
He'd sit me in his castle and he'd pick my mind
He said, "If you value your heart, stay on the road
If you value the road, stay on the top
If you value the top, you're gonna suffer son
And if you don't wanna suffer then you'd better run, yeah."
(Vocalizing)
Well I see my boss in his practical suit
You know I'll toss him in the cellar, won't give him no food
Yeah, when anybody tries to tell him what to do
He holds his breath until he turns blue

If you value the crime, stay out of doors
If you value them doors, you'd better lock 'em son
And if you don't want to lock 'em, you'd better buy a gun."
(Vocalizing)
Yeah, well I saw a snake in an apple tree
You know I didn't trust a word that he hissed to me, no!
Yeah he said, "It must be getting awful lonely trying to save the world;
Just buy a collared shirt and try to fuck some girls."
He said, "If you value your limbs, stay in the game
If you value the game, stay in that style
If you value that style, you're sinking son
And if you don't want to sink, then you better run."
