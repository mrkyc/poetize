I might be the worst
But you'd know the best
You drive the car
I'll do the rest
The getaway was quick and clean
We make an awful perfect team
You never know how fast you run
Until the bullet leaves the gun
Everybody on the floor, this is a stickup!
Why would you sink so low just to get high?

Oh, crime!
It's a young man's game
I want to take you where I'm going
'Cause half the fun is never knowing
If and why we've lost our way
To find that everything in life
Is worth its price
But there's nothing you can't steal

I  couldn't stop
I couldn't say
My innocence was locked away
It's far too late 'cause now you've seen
All the wicked parts of me
The bully got the girl next door
I had it all and wanted more
So give me everything in the register!
Why would you sink so low just to get high?

Young man, what did you do?
I saw your face on the 6 o'clock news
You had to get your fifteen minutes somehow
Judge not lest ye be judged
Fear not unbearable love
Oh, what a life

Oh, crime!
It's a young man's game
I want to take you where I'm going
'Cause half the fun is never knowing
If and why we've lost our way
