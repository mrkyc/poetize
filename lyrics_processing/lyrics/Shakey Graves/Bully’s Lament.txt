Well lanky Lenny is too tall to be lost and found
Too big for the cages at the city pound
Oh what will he do
Yeah what will we do for fun and for free
It seems the roads are growing wider and wider 'most every day
I used to love to drive but now I stay off them lanes
What is the use of standing up if there's nowhere to lean
Yeah, but somehow were getting by
It seems a little bit easier to touch the sky
Something is coming for you
Somethings coming for me
Oh but can you see

No yeah no no no no
We're not like the others
Yeah maybe its true
No  yeah no no no no no
We're not like the others
We couldn't be
Oh if we wanted to
Ooooooooo

So poor lazy Lauren is too small to go out of doors
She's too loud for the neighbors
Oh she's to slow for the chores
What will she do
What will we do for fun and for free
Seems the roads are growing wider and wider 'most every day
You know I used to love to drive but now I stay off them lanes
What is the use of looking out if there's nothing to see
Oh but you and me
