Well, he's out of season, out of sync
Oh lord, what must his family think
And you must be getting his feathers wet
Well, she always seems to be the talk
Until she drops you like a rock
Well, you should've been a better friend to him
Well, I dusted all the bones out of my yard
I fixed the screen door, raised the barn
But still you call me from the moon every single afternoon
Tell me all about the astronauts you've come to love
And how the earth looks from above
And how I should've been a better friend to you
But, I've never seen life as a chore
A treasure for to find
I've read the news, abused the booze
And often wondered why
My smile remains
Though thinking pains the average passer-by
Oh, they'll sink like stones into their homes
Away from teeth like mine
Yeah, and so I came to hate my skin
And all the holes you'd hidden
And the way you let my legs waltz the weeks away
By your side
Well, you should've been a better friend of mine

The song, of which, I'd never heard
Oh, a melody so fine
The whole world would pine
And it's a tune to give the boys the blues
And turn the horses into glue
You know, I should've been a better friend to you
Yeah, I should've been a better friend to you

Well, I've never seen life as a chore
Or a treasure for to find
I've read the news, abused the booze
And often wondered why
Oh, my smile remains
Though thinking pains the average passer-by
Well, they'll sink like stones into their homes
Away from teeth like mine
Yeah, you should've been a better friend of mine
