Can't spare a dime for charity
Because perfect change is what matters to me
Pinch every penny and stroll to the bank
Beg for a loan on my humble estate
Teddy, Georgie, sweet Benjamin
My terrible friends
They never call or even pretend
To worry about me when money is thin

I can't afford to fall in love
No I can't afford to fall in love
(Excuses, excuses)
Yeah I got plenty of other (excuses, excuses)
I can't afford to fall in

No time for this, no time for that
No time for patience, no time for a laugh
No time to know that I'm out of my league
No time to get myself back on my feet
No time for you, no time for me
No time for lessons, no time to be free
No time for good times of sweet memories
No time for stragglers or sympathy

I can't wait for the phone to ring
I can't wait for summer, I can't wait for spring
I can't wait for someone who can't wait for me
I can't wait to fall in love

I can't wait for the phone to ring
I can't wait for summer, I can't wait for spring
I can't wait for someone who can't wait for me
I can't wait to fall in love

I can't wait for the phone to ring
I can't wait for summer, I can't wait for spring
I can't wait for someone who can't wait for me
I can't wait to fall in love

I just can't wait
Oooh
Excuses, excuses, excuses
Oooh
