Well you and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

But now I mumble and you choke
Well I ain't so scary on my own

Well, I don't know

You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me

Well, you and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin' your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

But even when one is dead and gone

I hear you call my name but no one's there
Except a feeling in the air

You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah, you and I both know that the ghost is you
Used to walk around screaming, oh, slamming all them doors
Well I'm all grown up now, I don't scare easy no more
Yeah, you and I both know

Yeah, you and I both know
