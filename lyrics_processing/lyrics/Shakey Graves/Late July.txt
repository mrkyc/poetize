Dipped my heart and hands in honey
Snake Lady done stole my savings
Told gold digger she was having my babies
Well,  gold digger swung, snake lady fell
I took Gold Digger up to Chapel Hill
Oh, I married her fast, murdered her young
Oh, took my money back and made my run
Well, bus driver, all in red
Yeah, go pull this bus over and end up dead
Yeah go drive this bus down to Mexico
Park it on a cliff where that good grass grows
Till a chopper came along one sunny day
Oh, to burn my crops, lock me away
Well I'm eager, young and qualified
Got a date with that chair, oh, in late July
Ooooh
Yeah so, tell My mama, old and grey
Sittin' at-a home weepin' away
Oh. Her only boy washed down the drain
Gonna take her son oh and lock him away
Well, mama should be proud of me
Oh, I lived like a man, I'll die like a king
Cause I'm eager, young and qualified
Got a date with that chair, oh, in late July
Ooooh
