Well, I been spendin' all my money on weed n' pills
Tryin' to write a song that'll pay the bills
But it ain't came yet, so guess I'll have to rob a bank
I guess it could be worse, it ain't that bad
At least I ain't sittin' in ol' Baghdad
In the middle of a hot damn desert, sittin' in a tank
Well, every time the wife talks, a baby gets mentioned
I'm so broke I can't pay attention
Lord, how it tears me up to see her cry
Oh, I been spendin' all my nights on the internet
Looking for a clue, but ain't found one yet
Just a bunch of Mopars, guitars, & other stuff I can't buy

Well now, Lord, if you can hear me
Won't you throw a damn dog a bone?
'Cause if the Devil shows up with a better deal
This old soul's a-goin' down
Oh, I sing 'em real pretty, sing 'em real sad
And all the people in the crowd say "He ain't half-bad"
Well, they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain
If you want it, you can have the crown

Well, I been sittin' on my ass like a bump on a log
Watchin' Andy and ol' Boss Hog
I guess I ought to get up and go out and find a job
Instead of sittin' on the couch, trying to find the next line
I'm sure there's gotta be a better use of my time
Like figurin' out which one of these banks I'm a-gonna go rob
Well, the name of the game is hurry up and wait
But that ain't putting no food on my plate
Or gas in my car, and I drive a Bronco
So, Lord, if I could just get me a record deal
I might not have to worry about my next meal
But I'll still be trying to figure out what the hell rhymes with Bronco
