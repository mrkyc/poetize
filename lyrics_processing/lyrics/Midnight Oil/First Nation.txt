Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

First nation, first nation
First to deserve an explanation
First nation, first nation
Last to receive an invitation

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

First nation, first nation
When we gonna start the conversation?
When we gonna start the celebration? (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
When we gonna end the exploitation? (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
When we gonna say the word "invasion"?

Out loud
We're waiting
Still waiting
Nation within the nation
Still waiting
Nation within a nation

Earth black the church lacked the first fact
80 thou' turned demon days and a dirt nap
Generate the trauma that made a kid rage
Now the ment' capat' be filled with all that
Fall back
Why my cousin commit?
Why my uncle locked up?
Why my aunty forget how to put a glass cup down?
Fighting the fit
We done been brainwashed into fighting the temptay'
Fought Armageddon and I be out the next day
Of course I'm a get 'em till the spirit run empty
My corpse full of venom outcome of the invade
How dare you try to put me up in grave

Strong vision, tradition
No ticket, no admission
No government indecision
No token recognition

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
First nation, so ancient

Let's sit down and talk about appropriation (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Let's sit down and talk about compensation (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Let's sit down and talk about reconciliation

Out loud
We're waiting
Still waiting
Nation within a nation
Still waiting

When will the light switch?
24/7 in a crisis
White noise killed black thoughts I sense
There's a shift, it'll come by the nights end
When will the light switch?
24/7 in a crisis
White noise killed black thoughts I sense
