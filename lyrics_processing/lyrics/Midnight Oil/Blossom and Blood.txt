You the mothers who sent your sons
Wipe away your tears
For those who fought and those who fell
Become our sons as well
You the warriors with your words
Throw away your spears
You talk of times of peace for all
And then prepare for war
Verse 2
All the people with dreams, all mothers with sons
All people with dreams never woken at night by the sound of guns
Like a child that's born on a moonless night
Like a child that's born, we parachute down to an unknown fight
Chorus
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
Verse 1
You the mothers who sent your sons
Wipe away your tears
For those who fought and those who fell
Become our sons as well
You the warriors with your words
Throw away your spears
You talk of times of peace for all
And then prepare for war

Whatever you've done, whatever you think you've done, whatever you've done
There's a hope in the heart says never again
Whatever you say, whatever you say, whatever you say
It's the price of peace to remember that day
Chorus
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
Verse 1
You the mothers who sent your sons
Wipe away your tears
For those who fought and those who fell
Become our sons as well
Chorus
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
This city of blossom and blood
This city suffered more than it should
These sidewalk silhouettes not washed away, not washed away
