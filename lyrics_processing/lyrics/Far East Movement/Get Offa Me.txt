I'm just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knockin' at my do'
I'm not who you lookin' fo'

One two
Trek life y'all
Far East Movement
Damn cops man

Man, all I'm trying to do is just drive my car
Turn my beats up and rhyme these bars
But even when I abide by laws
You run my plates just to find my flaws
Now I understand stopping crime's your job
But since I ain't a criminal
And I don't rob or steal from anyone
Don't bother me dawg
Bustin' U-turns to follow me far up the street
With your hand on your heat, now what's that for
I ain't a thug just because I got a hat on
Don't pull me over just to act like an asshole
And if you don't believe my answers what you ask for
My skin color and police are like past foes
When they was hanging us from trees with a lasso
They oversee a steady beat on my ass yo
But when I call y'all in need man y'all react slow, damn!

It ain't the way I walk, the way I talk
But when it comes to two-eleven I'm the brother they want
I do a record with Trek, I sweat like Mike
I'm the extraordinary type of brother you like
They ain't tryna hear that (Who?), Officer Jack Move
Got me on the hood wanted for something I can't do
'Cause I got a bald head two hands and two feet
Plus the dude was Japanese so it's gotta be me
They toss me in the backseat like a hooker on vine
Yo guess who's sittin' next to me, my man Trek Life
Man, this is bullshit dawg, it just ain't right
Both of us locked up on the same damn night
They pulled me over tellin' me I made an illegal right
They told me I'm the guy they looking for because of my eyes
Then they took us to jail saying we all look alike
'Cause we damn good looking and we doin' alright

Ring, ring, pick up the phone
If it's the bill collector tell him I ain't home
I ain't got a bankroll you heard me singin' the blues
But if they really want it, I got I.O.U.'s
You don't really gotta stress about the cash I'm making
Couldn't really get me for no tax evasion
I get letters saying that they need a payment
I write them right back, tell 'em please be patient
You getting what you give, yeah you got what you wanted
None of y'all are fam' I ain't keepin' a promise
What do you expect from a kid who's in college
Ya I got a lotta' credit so you know i'ma charge it
New rims, DVDs, lava lamps
And if I need some weed get a cash advance
Yo I think we hit our limit, man we maxed out
How we gon' pay it off?
Man we assed out
Im just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knocking at my do
Im not who you lookin' fo'
Officer get offa' me
Officer get offa' me
I'm just doin' my thing, let me be
Officer get offa' me

 Yeah it's the wrong fucking guys, we gotta let 'em go
