It feels so good to be me
Yeah
We livin that million dollar dreams
My life...yeahhh
My life feels just like a dream
Chasing cream, i'm a fein
Maybe i'll win that lottery
Rock diamond rings
Yo check the bling
All them greens ain't what it seems
All them hoes don't mean a thing
All them whips can't ride for me
But my family down to die for me
Been a few years thru the good n bad
Yea I been more down than da wallstreet crash
Now back up just for the fans
Lets pack that uhaul full of cash
Spread the love, time to grub
Gotta show momma i'm the one
Praise the lord that i'm alive
Just throw that money in the sky
I'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire
You might also likeI'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire-aire
(8X)
A millionaire aire..
Feels good when the homies rydin
Everyday feels like a Friday
Crank that beat when the sun is shinin'
With the top down i feel like flyin
Over on the freeway catch me if u can
If you want beef you can put it on the glass
My girl got back in the sunset tan
We livin that goodlife don't be mad
Yah can't do it, like we do it
Feels so good when i bump my music
Troubles in the air
I dont care
Im livin everyday like a millionaire
I'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire
I'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire-aire
(8X)
A millionaire aire..
I feel like a millionaire
Check it out
Some girls are money hungry
Well they get nothing from me
Sometimes i might dress bummy
Then they start actin funny
If i was dr. Evil
Then would you wanna holla?
You'll probably make the man
One million dollars
I know youre out my league
But baby thats all good
Ima keep it movin
Just like a playa should
As far as ways for grindin'
I got different ones
How you think i be ballin'
With insufficient funds
But if you down for real
And you down to chill
I'll have you out in hong kong spendin
Thousand dollar bills
We're out there durin food fights
We did it for the city
Animal's out the cage now
A yo whos comin with me
FM and Jin
Yup we keep it so fresh
Kevnish
J-splif
Yes we makin Prohgress
This a millionaire joint
I'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire
I'm walkin on air
Livin on a prayer
I look up at the sky
And i feel like a millionaire-aire

A millionaire aire..
