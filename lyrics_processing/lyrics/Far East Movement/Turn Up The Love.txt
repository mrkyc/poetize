We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove

Just turn it up now

Get get it poppin', hop the molly
Dirty bass, we so body body
Too legit, we can't quit the party
Super freaks, no Illuminati
So one, two, hit the booze
We on YouTube, nothing to lose
So let it loose 'cause the sheep don't sleep
Like pop pop pop pop
Alright

Drop low to the L-O
V-E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no (Hear me no)
Here's some love for your stereo (Stereo)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
You might also like

So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove

Go ahead now flos your love like a heart of gold
Dirty bass to bake a tussy roll
If you don't low on the floor
I got a crew that will handle that cookie jar
Damn girl, I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guest list you plus two
That's what you call a move
Like pop pop pop pop
Alright

Turn me on like this your song
Dirty bass got love to give (Turn it up now)
Mad monopoly all night long

Yo, let me see that grill from here to here
So much love in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give
