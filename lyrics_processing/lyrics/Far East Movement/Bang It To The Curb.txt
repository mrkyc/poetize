B-bang it to the curb
B-bang it

Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb

Bangin down the block with my Remy bottle
Reppin 213, California lotto
Servin all the fiends like King Taco
My cheese, nachos, flossin til ya unfollow
Windows down the 'Lac, just an ass crack
Nothin but the Alpine system on smash
Hit the stash in the dash, better puff puff pass
Flyin faster than the 5-0, bang it to the curb!

Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb
Oh word, we absurd
Got that fire, we can burn

Fat beats for that kitty from the underground
Hit up Sidney Samson if ya need a fat fix
Lootin liquor stores time to flick the match sticks
