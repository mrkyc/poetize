Diamond chains don't mean a thing
You by my side is all I need
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dipping through the clouds is how we chill
All eyes on me is how I feel
I'm flossy (Yeah), I'm flossy (Yeah)

Got me buzzing on your love, straight shot no chasing
Heartbeat hitting harder than the bass tonight
It's all good tonight
Feeling richer than Jay-Z, stunting like Baby
Take the wheel girl, drive my crazy
Tonight, everything's all right

Yo, everywhere we cruise, all eyes on you
That's my boo, that's my boo
Everywhere we cruise, all eyes on you
That's my boo, that's my boo

Diamond chains don't mean a thing
You by my side is all I need
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dipping through the clouds is how we chill
All eyes on me is how I feel
I'm flossy (Yeah), I'm flossy (Yeah)
You might also like
Like a fresh new tat, I forever want to rock
I want to hit the avenue and show you round the block
'Cause we young, we fly, and we thirsty
So we gonna live it up like it's your birthday
Hypnotized, I could never take my eyes off you
Used to have a rack of honeys now you're all I do
Iced out coupe for your iced out boots
Going ham with my cheese, baby, cordon bleu

Yo, everywhere we cruise, all eyes on you
That's my boo, that's my boo
Everywhere we cruise, all eyes on you
That's my boo, that's my boo

Diamond chains don't mean a thing
You by my side is all I need
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dipping through the clouds is how we chill
All eyes on me is how I feel
I'm flossy (Yeah), I'm flossy (Yeah)

Floss your bass in the air right now
All my bassheads turn the bass up loud
If you're feeling that thump then throw your hands up
Dirty bass flossing in the house
Floss your bass in the air right now
All my bassheads turn the bass up loud
If you're feeling that thump then throw your hands up
Dirty bass flossing in the house
Diamond chains don't mean a thing
You by my side is all I need
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm flossy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dipping through the clouds is how we chill
All eyes on me is how I feel
