These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

People say that I should've be chasing papers
The ones who say it claim they ain't movers and shakers
I mean, I feel the principle, but back to reality
What's the point of me working if I can't feed my family
Strategy? I got none, and that's abundantly clear
So I take pride to be the new pioneer
And I'm living moment to moment hoping someone will notice
Then go back for my folks and everybody support us
Bought us a couple minutes 'cause they knew that we finished
We winners, we had it in us ever since we beginners
Visions of gettin' money, that's the new frontier
But I ain't gettin' no money, I'm making income here

These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

How to make mistakes, I apologize
Got my hands dirty, chasing devil's pie
Through the ups and downs I learned to realize
Don't ever take for granted people close in your life
I'm broke in my pockets but love I got plenty
Blessed with good people, you couldn't pop a pennies
We in this thing together, no weather's gonna stop this
Trains left their station and breaking's not an option
Times gettin' difficult 'cause people tryna cross me
Whisper this and that behind my back, killing me softly
But my skin's thick, that nonsense doesn't hurt
I'm 'bout to be major before I leave Earth

These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

New suit (Right), clean shoes (Right)
Make sure my tie's right and my fade is tight
It's been a long time comingfrom rags that feel drumming
Different strokes introducing Asian folks
Blues I'm still humming, birds I'm still wantin'
Freestyle's back on the curb, I'm still bussin'
Can I get a little bitty of time
You know I earned it, puttin' in work like my granddad first did
My man Catch birthed it, innovated a purpose
Power to the people no matter the surface
When we rise together you gon' say it's worth it
And if time is money, I got seconds to earn it
Without you, there's nothing like an empty bucket
Without you, I'd say "Bucket? Who that?"
You was the fans, the homies and fam
I wouldn't lose you for nothing, love
These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

I say farewell
