I got a fetish for these kicks
Fe-fetish for these jeans
A fetish for my hoodie, gotta have it I'm a fiend
Fe-fetish for these kicks
A fetish for these jeans
Fetish for my hoodie, fe-fe-fetish fetish fetish

Sweater on tight as the nights get colder
City zipped up and the hood on my shoulders
Haters looking green like a three-leaf clover
I've got a pair of everything I know of
I've got gear that's free like bail watch me rock it
Double day sales
Every day new jeans and a new shirt
From next year, it's like I'm back from the future
A fly outfit, on my hoverboard
Take that off and put this logo on your chest
Rep the west, Downtown to Sunset
Melrose to Fairfax, damn I'm fresh!

Got-got-got-got-got a fetish

For this pair on my feet, pro wings with velcro
Then L.A. Gear's Greatest Night's in shell toes
Thought they were the dopest until I saw the Jordans
Had to cop some but they cost me a fortune
I was just a kid, the freshest on the block
After school shootin' hoops pumping on my Reeboks
Kept my shoes always new, coming straight out the box
Every day different colors on my Nike high-tops
Air Force's, Airmaxes, even had a pair of Vans
K-Swisses, Chuck Taylors, can't forget the Timberlands
Bathing Ape's with the matching hoodie from Japan
But no matter what I'm wearing people staring like, "Damn! "

Fit from a brand New Era
Got the home town on the crown that I'm wearing
Looking for a love from L.A. to Paris
If you got style let me see what you sharing
If you got a tank top sweats and some kicks
Gimme that girl if my t-shirt fits
Mini-skirt works if you got nice hips
If you don't need a bra then you got nice tits
You're lookin'right when you rock a corset in a thong
Even better when you're dropping it with nothing at all
Take your sweater off in the Summer, Spring and Fall
'Cause skin's back in and it ain't the mall
