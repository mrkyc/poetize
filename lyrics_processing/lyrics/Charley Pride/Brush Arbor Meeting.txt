I'll fly away ( in the morning )
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away ( I'll fly away )
Years ago, when I was just a boy in the Oklahoma hills
We didn't have a church in which to pray
So the people got together and they built one of their own
Just a shelter made of poles with a roof of hay
Well, it wasn't just a Baptist or the Church of the Nazarene
For the people of all faiths came there to pray
And it didn't make no difference to the color or the time
And lots of folks would sing till break of day
When they called in a Brush Arbor meeting
Oh, you could hear the people singing far away
Just praising the Lord, and shouting victory
I can still hear 'em singing it today
There is power, power, wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Nowadays the churches are so pretty and so nice
And they all have different names upon their door
How I wish we all would shout and sing like we used to long ago
And come together like we did before

Oh, you could hear the people singing far away
Just praising the Lord, and shouting victory
I can still hear 'em singing it today
Gimme that old time religion
Gimme that old time religion
Gimme that old time religion
It's good enough for me
And they called it a Brush Arbor meeting
Oh, you could hear the people singing far away
Just praising the Lord, and shouting victory
I can still hear 'em singing it today
Just praising the Lord, and shouting victory
