Sitting in my bedroom
Thinking everything through
Wondering when we'll come through (come through)
All this
Tension and this weirdness
You're my other half it
Feels like something's missing (missing)
Too long since I got a hold of you
And I know that there'se nothing I
Woudn't do
Oh I'd fly to you
Every little piece of me
Sitting on a pebble wings
Oh I'd fly to you
Letting go of everything
I'd leave it on a pebble wings
And I never give up
Always be flying to you
Oh tell me my love
Tell me you're flying too
Building
Building onto something
This time it's a wall and
I just wanna knock it (do-ow-own)
Do you
Miss my imperfections?
Do they make you question
Everything we have and (have and)
You might also likePlease don't let it get the best of you
'Cause you know
That theres nothing I wouldn't do (do)
Oh I'd fly to you
Every little piece of me
Sitting on a pebble wings
Oh I'd fly to you
Letting go of everything
I'd leave it on a pebble wings
And I never give up
Always be flying to you
Oh tell me my love
Tell me you're flying too
There's something about
The way you looked into my eyes
I was lost
When we met I knew that
I was so o-o-over
Got my heart attached to yours and now
I'll fly to you
Forever
My love,my love
Oh I'd fly to you
Every little piece of me
Sitting on a pebble wings
Oh I'd fly to you
Letting go of everything
I'd leave it on a pebble wings
And I never give up
Always be flying to you
Oh tell me my love
Tell me you're flying too
Oh tell me my love
Tell me you're flying too
Oh tell me my love
Tell me you're flying too (too)
Tell me my love
