Think the clouds are clogging up my brain
Like the weather drain same as the tears on my face
And I'm stuck up in the storm eye
I guess I'll be alright

Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then it hits me like, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, no (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

And you're that wind that swept me off my feet
Got me flying 'til I'm crying and I'm down on my knees
That's what Dorothy was afraid of
The sneaky tornado

Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
There's no place like home (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

I'm boarding up the windows
Locking up my heart
It's like every time the wind blows
I feel it tearing us apart
Every time he smiles, I let him in again
Everything is fine when
You're standing in the eye of the hurricane
You might also like
Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane
Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane

I'm flopping on my bed like a flying squirrel
Like a little girl hurt by the big bad world
Yeah, it's twisting up my insides
Can't hide it on the outside

Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, it hits me like, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, no (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

And that's when you hold me, you hold me
You tell me that you know me, I'll never be lonely
Say we made it through the storm now
But I'm still on the look out

Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
The air's getting cold (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Cold (Cold, oh)
I'm boarding up the windows
Locking up my heart (Hey, hey)
It's like every time the wind blows
I feel it tearing us apart
Every time he smiles, I let him in again (Let him in again)
Everything is fine when (When)
You're standing in the eye of the hurricane

Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane
Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane (Hey, hey)

He picks me up like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
Yeah, he picks me up like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
And I'm floating, floating (Ooh, oh-oh)
And I don't know when, know when
I'm gonna drop (Ooh, oh-oh)
He's got the way, he's got the way

I'm boarding up the windows (Yeah)
Locking up my heart
It's like every time the wind blows (Oh, oh)
I feel it tearing us apart
Every time he smiles, I let him in again (Let him in again)
Everything is fine when
You're standing in the eye of the hurricane
Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane (Hey, hey)
Here comes the sun, here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the hurricane (Standing in the eye, oh, yeah)

And he picks me up like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
(He's got the way)
And he picks me up like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
(He's got the way)
