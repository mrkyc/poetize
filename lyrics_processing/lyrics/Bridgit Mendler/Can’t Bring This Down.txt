Shake my head like this
You better stop it
Too high, too quick
You are the one
I never felt like this
If I'm being honest

I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I can't bring this down)

Shake my head like this, you betta watch it
Bettin' on your lovin', makin' profits
I'm a prophet, I'm just honest
Clean up nice, fly as comets
We take off like my conscience
So I don't wanna bring this down, down
Don't get scared when my friends all around
I need your TLC
Chasin' down your waterfall
While you got both eyes left on me
I don't mind if I O.D., 'cause you're the only drug I need
And if I get too high, it's probably where I need to be, please
You might also like
Shake my head like this (like this)
You better stop it
Too high, too quick (too quick)
You are the one
I never felt like this
If I'm being honest (yep)

I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I can't bring this down)

Shake my head like this
You make me spin around
Take a trip back to my hometown
Show you what's goin' down, down!
Boy, you got dimensions
Not a simple one I know
Saw you in my mentions
Shot my heart and caught my soul
Floating off to somewhere
Wave goodbye to folks at home
Heaven is a place that only we know
Your body is heaven on Earth
Your convo is Mama's dessert
Sweet and deserved
And we know relations take work
So roll up them sleeves and come here
(Whop, skrr)

Shake my head like this (like this)
You better stop it
Too high, too quick (too quick)
You are the one
I never felt like this
If I'm being honest

I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I can't bring this down)
I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't bring this down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't bring this down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
