I'm the kind of girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out
About to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you staring at me, and I was thinking clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm hunting for the honey
And I'm kinda shy, but you're super fly, yeah
I could be your kryptonite, like...

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud, but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la la la la la, and I'll find you
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not

Hello, my name is (Bridgit), nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Living like a fairytale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
37 cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail, like...

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud, but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la la la la la, and I'll find you
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud, but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la la la la la, and I'll find you
Ready or not

(You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs)
Ready or not (here I come, oh)
Ready or not (ready or not, whoa)
Ready or not (ready or not, ready or not)
(Boom-batta-boom, batta-boom, batta-boom)
