From this view, I see colors
The blacks and the blue
Here comes another night (Oh, no)
Without you, lookin' over the trees and the roofs
And I don't know what I would find

I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you're spendin' all your time with

But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
Sayin', "I'm coming home"?

In this room, you're the wallpaper
Sticks like glue into my memory
So do you think me over once in a blue moon?
'Cause you always rise to me

I don't know if you're even in the city (City)
Don't know if you're even at home (Home)
Don't know who you're spendin' all your time with
You might also like
But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
Sayin', "I'm coming home"?

Gone without a trace
You've been so M.I.A
Was passin' through your neighborhood
Boy, you've been abrupt
I never get enough to know that you still think of me, too

And I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you're spendin' all your time with

But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
Sayin', "I'm coming home"?
Yeah, do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
Sayin', "I'm coming home"?
Yeah, do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
