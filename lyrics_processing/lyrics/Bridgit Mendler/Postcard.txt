I wanna play with your race cars
I'm not a Barbie doll, throw me a baseball
I wanna get on your team and get my hands a little dirty
I heard from a little birdy that

You don't think I can take it
Or that I'm made for it
Or that I got it in my bones
So what makes you think that

It's boys only, no girls allowed
But there's no way you can keep us out
You can't bring us down
If I feel it burning in my core then
I'll take that bright little spark
And I'll hold it tighter in my heart
Then all your little darts
If you say I'll never reach the moon
I'll send you a postcard soon

What if he's into fashion
Or if he likes ballet?
Doesn't get the time of day
Cause he's built for the field but feels like his love is somewhere else
And no matter what he felt they
You might also like
Told him he couldn't take it
Cause he's not made for it
He doesn't have it in his bones
So what makes you think that

It's girls only, no boys allowed
But there's no way you can keep us out
You can't bring us down
If I feel it burning in my core then
I'll take that bright little spark
And I'll hold it tighter in my heart
Then all your little darts
If you say I'll never reach the moon
I'll send you a postcard soon

It says, "Remember what you said back then and if I listened to you
I will never be where I stand"
And I grew into these shoes
That I've taken on the world and back again
What made you think it's

Boys only, no girls allowed
But there's no way you can keep us out
You can't bring us down
If I feel it burning in my core then
I'll take that bright little spark
And I'll hold it tighter in my heart
Then all your little darts
If you say I'll never reach the moon
I'll send you a postcard soon
Soon
