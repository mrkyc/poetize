If there's an ocean
It's just a puddle
That I've got to get across
Any mountain, I'll climb over
Like a kid on the monkey bars

I know you're out there somewhere
I know you miss me just like I miss you
No matter what, I'll get there
And you know I'll never stop

I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
You know I'll find you, I'm never far behind you
I swear these words are true
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you

Can you hear me?
Hear me calling?
I know sometimes it's tough
To hold on, keep believing
When you don't feel strong enough
You might also like
Everyone out there gets scared
You know I love you
Just like you love me
No matter what, I'll get there
Ain't no way I'll ever stop

I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
You know I'll find you, I'm never far behind you
I swear these words are true
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you

Every minute
I'm getting closer
I'm gonna show you
Any second
I'll walk through that door
Here I come, yeah
Oh, here I come
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
You know I'll find you, I'm never far behind you
I swear these words are true
I'm gonna run, run, run, run, run
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you

Ooh la da da
Dua dua dua dua
Ooh la da da
