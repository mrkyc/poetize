I know exactly how you feel
It doesn't matter what you say
I see the sun begin to set
And we gotta, gotta get away
I got a patch of open road
I already miss you with all of my soul
So before we both get old
I think we gotta, gotta get away

I kept wishing, bought the tickets, stuck them on my wall
Let's rip them down and leave the town before the cops can call
And bring us back, cover our tracks in the dust
I think we must

Take on the world, let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby
Love will tell us where to go
Oh, oh, oh, through a dark night
Oh, oh, oh, without a sunrise
Oh, oh, oh, and we will be alright
And love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go

The wheels on this train keep turning
We're flying with the birds and
The world's so bright, it hurts when
We're on the getaway
I'm the Bonnie to your Clyde
You're the moon and I'm the tide
I, I want this for all of my life
Since the night that we got away

I kept wishing, bought the tickets, stuck them on my wall
Let's rip them down and leave the town before the cops can call
And bring us back, cover our tracks in the dust
I think we must

Take on the world, let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby
Love will tell us where to go
Oh, oh, oh, through a dark night
Oh, oh, oh, without a sunrise
Oh, oh, oh, and we will be alright
And love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
When things get rough, when we have loved
We've got enough to tell us where to go
When we get lost, when love is all
All that we got, to tell us where to go
Then we're alright, we'll be alright
Love will tell us where to go
Then we're alright, we'll be alright
Love will tell us where to go

Take on the world, let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby (Be my baby)
Love will tell us where to go (Go-oh, woah)
Oh, oh, oh, through a dark night (Dark night)
Oh, oh, oh, without a sunrise (Ah-ah)
Oh, oh, oh, and we will be alright
And love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go (Go, go)
