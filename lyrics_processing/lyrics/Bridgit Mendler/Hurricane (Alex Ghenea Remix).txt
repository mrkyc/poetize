Like the weather drain same as the tears on my face
And i'm stuck up in this storm eye
I guess I'll be alright, oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh, Oh, uh oh, uh oh
Then it hits me like, Oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh No, uh oh, uh oh
And you're that wind that swept me off my feet
Got me flying till I'm crying and I'm down on my knees
That's what Dorothy was afraid of
The sneaky tornado, Oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh Oh, uh oh, uh oh
There's no place like
Home, home
I'm boarding up the windows
Locking up my heart
You might also likeIt's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearing us apart
Everytime he smiles
I let him in again
Everything is fine when
You're standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
(Standing in the eye of)
He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
Yeah, He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm In the eye of the hurricane
I'm flopping on my bed like a flying squirrel
Like a little girl hurt by the big bad world
Yeah, It's twisting up my insides
Can't hide it on the outside
Oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh Oh, uh oh, uh oh
Then it hits me like, Oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh no
And that's when you hold me, you hold me
You tell me that you know me
I'll never be lonely
Say we made it through the storm now
But I'm still on the look out, Oh, uh oh, uh oh, Oh Oh, uh oh, uh oh
The airs getting cold, cold
I'm boarding up the windows
Locking up my heart
It's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearing us apart
Everytime he smiles
I let him in again
Everything is fine when
You're standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
(Standing in the eye of)
He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
Yeah, He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm In the eye of the hurricane
He picks me up like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine, like I'm In the eye of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine, like I'm In the eye of the hurricane
But i'm floating floating
And I don't know when, know when
I'm gonna drop
He's got the way
He's got the way
I'm boarding up the windows
Locking up my heart
It's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearing us apart
You're standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standing in the eye of the Hurricane
(Standing in the eye of)
He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine, like I'm in the eye of the hurricane
Yeah, He picks me up, like he's got the way of the hurricane
And I think I'm fine, like I'm In the eye of the hurricane
Ooooooo, Oo, Oooooo
Ooooooo, Oo, Oooooo
