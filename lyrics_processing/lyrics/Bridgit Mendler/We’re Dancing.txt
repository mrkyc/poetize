When you take my hand
Your face is all I see
And all the walls fade to black
Like a movie scene
Our feet start to move, what you do to this linoleum
It's like the perfect dance floor
Put your hands 'round my waist
I hear the violins
And one step is all it takes
And my head spins
I don't see the walls at all since the minute
That we stepped away from this place

We're dancing
And then the world disappears
We're dancing
To music no one else hears
It's magic
It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing
You might also like
World is soft like a blur
All I see is color
Hardest fall, so it hurts
When we're with each other
You're a sweet songbird
When you're singing in my ear
Goosebumps run down my skin, when

We're dancing
And then the world disappears
We're dancing
To music no one else hears
It's magic (Hey)
It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine (Oh-oh)
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing

I think that we could live
For moments like this
The sweetest romances
Feels like there's all this magic
And we just gotta grab it
When we're dancing, yeah!
We're dancing
And then the world disappears
We're dancing
To music no one else hears
It's magic
It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing

We're dancing
And then the world disappears (Hey!)
We're dancing (Woah)
To music no one else hears (Hey, hey)
It's magic
It's like we're stopping time (Oh-oh)
When your heart beats mine (Oh-oh)
When we're dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing (Ooh)
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
