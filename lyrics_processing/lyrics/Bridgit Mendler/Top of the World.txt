You got that fresh way of talking
It could be four in the morning
And you're making me trip
My heart skip, skip the beat
You know that this is amazing
Please tell me why you're hesitating
Let's risk it all, risk the fall tonight

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Love will take you high
We'll be sittin' on top of the world
Baby, you and I, we're born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sittin' on top, sittin' on top of the world

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I hear the wind in the trees
And I'm weak in the knees when
You're holding me close
Got tingling toes tonight
You got me so elevated
You wanna jump, why you waiting?
Let's risk it all, risk the fall tonight
You might also like
Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Love will take you high
We'll be sittin' on top of the world
Baby, you and I, we're born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sittin' on top, sittin' on top of the world

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
Begging you, begging you
Begging you, begging you

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Hold on tight
We'll be sittin' on top of the world
Baby, you and I (Baby), we're born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sittin' on top, sittin' on top of the world
Take the rope and climb

We'll be sittin' on top of the world (Oh)

So just hold on tight
We'll be sittin' on top, sittin' on top of the world

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ooh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Sittin' on top of the world)

We will be, you and me
