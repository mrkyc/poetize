Darlin', is it dark?
Is it dim in the restaurant?
'Cause you're lookin' like a blind man
Lookin' away, it's too late, it's too long
See me givin' shade
While you're leanin' all the way right around me
To that other girl, and it hurts what I want is

Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie right at me
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme full screen
Focus, focus, trim the borders, baby
I break that spell you see, 'cause...

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me
When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

Rude boy
What you out on the town for with a girl?
If you want more, set her down
Or you'll pick her up when I'm gone, 'cause I'm done
Lady, that is me
Not a side piece
Put your arm right around me
Yeah, let her know, let her know I'm the one
You might also like
Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie right at me
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme full screen
Focus, focus, trim the borders, baby
I break that spell you see, 'cause...

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me
When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

Oh, whip, whip, whip
Oh, whip, whip, whip
Oh, whip, whip, whip, oh
I'll break that spell you see, 'cause...

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me
When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me
Whip, whip, whip
