Deep underwater is where I left my love
Clean at the surface, shallow to the touch
Nothing left, he's a wreck buried deep in the sand
Now I don't feel a thing when I'm holding his hand
And I'm asking myself, "Will I sh-sh-sh-sh-shiver again?"

Oh, I know how to feel, I know that love exists
It's asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis
Oh, my Lord, where's my soul? How did we end up like this?
Fast asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis

Dig a little deeper, baby, hold your breath
Take a seat at the counter, just give it a chance
Every bro in the building with his back to the wall
Not for me, be discreet, I should try not to yawn
I shut 'em down, shut em' down like a sniper on call

Oh, I know how to feel, I know that love exists
But it's asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis
Oh, my Lord, where's my soul? How did we end up like this?
Fast asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis

Hey, hey
I know sometimes we lose sight of hope
I know that you don't falter often, when you do, you grow
I know that life can have you lost like your compass broke
A ship adrift at sea, oh me just tryna be your rope... oh
And I don't think they really know the rest of it
Everyday is Friday, so your calendar, irrelevant
Photobombing planets, never planned to
Take a better pic, knocking on Atlantis doors
I'm surprised they let us in, let us in
I can see you working on your patience
Working on your nerves, need a better occupation
You just say the word, and then we right back to the basics
When you out here ballin', guess you bound to catch a flagrant
I'm just tryna wild out with the fam
We came from the bottom, I don't think you understand
House up in the sky, I guess that always was the plan
You was flying with me, I think I forgot to land

Oh, I know how to feel, I know that love exists
But it's asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis
Oh, my lord, where's my soul? How did we end up like this?
Fast asleep with the fishes down in Atlantis
