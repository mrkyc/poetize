Walkin' down picket fence
Run my hands along the edge
And music plays in my head
Hear the song before I go to bed

When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow
And I remember, oh I remember
I remember my summer with you

Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows, hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone, wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
(With my best friend)

West coast winter breeze
As it blows through the palm trees
And they wear their Ray-Bans and spray tans
Oh, I wish it was summer again
You might also like
When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up this song echoes off my pillow
And I remember, oh I remember
I remember my summer with you

Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows, hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone, wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
(With my best friend)

I fly to you all the way across the states
I'd fly to you, hear me the winter day
Oh, I'd follow the sun
And come right to your door
I remember my summer with you

Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows, hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone, wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows, hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone, wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
