It's a long road and it gets windy
Fog is real low and it's so blinding
Oh, I'm tryna steer, tryna take the lead
But I feel like the road is steering me
Getting so lost, like a castaway
Feeling so crossed, like a renegade
And I'm tryna call out in the big city
Just a small voice and no one's listening to me

Oh-oh, tell me where to go
Tell me that you know just how bright I glow

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, oh woah

Oh, I'm blending in and I'm sticking out
Like a sore thumb that they don't know about
Wanna make peace, wanna just breathe
Wanna be the light that makes them all believe
I'm the race car, not the spectator
I'm the hero, not the narrator
Hercules battling, conquering everything, yeah

Oh-oh, tell me where to go
Tell me that you know just how bright I glow

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter (No, no)
You're the city lights (You're city lights)
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire (Mm)
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, oh woah

Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
Everybody knows that everybody glows like the city lights
The city lights, oh woah, oh woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, city lights
You are, oh-ah

Every time that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights (You're the city lights)
Every time that you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh (Ooh woah, woah, woah, woah)
