Oh for whatever reason
Each time I see him
It goes all wrong
Like when I'm at the shower
Wet hair and power puff t-shirt on

If you told me what you want
Oh I bet that I'm a good fit
Boy you saw me so wrong
'Cause every time I lose it

No doubt, I got no game
My friends
They'are all the same
(Undateable)
You can't loose, if you never try
That's why me and you
We're undateable for life
We're undateable for life

This world is first impressions
The first twoseconds are all you got
This time I wasn't on it but
Honest promise, I'm all you want
You might also like
If you tell me what you like
Oh I bet that I'm a good fit
Caught me at the wrong time
'Cause every time I lose it

No doubt I got no game
My friends, they are the same
(Undateable)
You can't lose if you never try
That's why me
And you
We're undateable for life
(Undateable, undateable)
We're undateable for life
(Undateable, undateable)
We're undateable for life

I met a girl online on Instagram
She was out of my league so I was a fan
Till I took her on a date and things quickly changed
Turns out she has no brain
She would talk about her yorkie and how she's the best
And how all of her exes could flex and have pecs
So I started to drink so I wouldn't get pissed
Because if I got drunk I'd be shallow and into it
(Don't look at me like that Ron)
(Yeah yeaaaaah!)
No doubt, I got no game
My friends, they're all the same
(Undateable)
You can't lose if you never try
That's why me and you
We're undateable for life
(Undateable)

No doubt I got no game
My friends, they're all the same
(Undateable)
You can't lose if you never try
That's why me and you
We're undateable for life
(Undateable, undateable)
We're undateable for life
Undateable, undateable
