As she goes walking by
She never talks to me
She's just a little shy
She's all that
She's all that
She's all that
Sometimes she smiles at me
But then she looks away
Distance is breaking
Getting closer every day
I've tried to get you off of my mind
But that motion gets me every time
Don't know what I'm gonna do

She's all that
She's all that
Girl gonna hook me to the groove
She's all that
She's all that
Girl gonna hook me to the hook me to the hook me to the groove
All of the other guys
They try to take their time
She never looks at them
How can I make her mine
She's all that
She's all that
Open up the way through
To get me to your heart
Tell me what I can do
The girl pulls me apart
You might also likeI've tried to get you off of my mind
Oh baby
Oh baby
But you girl
You get me every time
I don't know what I'm gonna do

She's all that
She's all that
Girl gonna hook me to the groove
She's all that
She's all that
Girl gonna hook me to the hook me to the hook me to the groove
Kick it
What's up man yo
T is in the house and I'm about to bust
Around in your face boy
When you find a girl like the one I found
Well there ain't no point in looking around
Cause if her love is true and she really cares
Well it's all that and it's everywhere
She's got the ways and means
To drive the fellas wild
But she's afraid to be
Used up and pushed aside
Just put your trust in me
There's nothing I won't do
Oh baby talk to me
There's so much I can give to you
I tried to get you off of my mind
Yes I have
But you girl, you get me every time
There's nothing I can do

She's all that
She's all that
Girl gonna hook me to the groove
She's all that
She's all that
