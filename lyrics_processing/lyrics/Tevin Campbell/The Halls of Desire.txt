Come and take a walk, take a walk down the halls of desire
I'll do what you want, what you want, I can take you higher
These are the halls of desire

Door number one is for best friends
Inside, there's simply a hug
Perhaps we'll pass this one quickly
For emotionally never leads to love
Door number tow, ooh, opens easy
But there's only a kiss inside
You're the only one who can tell us now
Will a kiss keep you satisfied? (Will it, baby?)

Come and take a walk, take a walk down the halls of desire, mhm, mmm
I'll do what you want, what you want, I can take you higher
These are the halls of desire

Door number three is a good one
On occasion it can be the best kind
Open it up and you'll find
You'll be against the wall in a slow, sexy grind
After which, you open door number four
I can only tell you what's not inside
If you open this door, baby, your clothes won't take the ride
These are the halls of desire
Here we are at door number five
And the feeling inside is immeasurable
Over and over and over and all over
My hands do things pleasurable
You might also like
Come take a walk
I'll do what you want me to
I'll take you higher (Higher)
These are the halls of desire
Oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
Your best bet is to skip door six
We'll just say it won't bring you heaven
Never will we mind we'll just step inside door number seven

All of my love will surround you, baby
What happens inside, no one really knows
But if you go you'll come out with a smile
And that's reason enough to go
Come on and take a walk, babe
Come on and take a walk, babe
Down the halls of desire
Oh oh, come on

Come and take a walk, take a walk down the halls of desire
Oh, I know what you want, what you want
I'll do what you want, what you want, I can take you higher
These are the halls of desire
Come on in and find a slow, sexy grind
Oh, come on

I'll do what you want, what you want, I can take you higher
(Higher, higher, babe)
These are the halls of desire
Ooh, ooh
