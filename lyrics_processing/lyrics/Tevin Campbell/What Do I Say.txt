Mhm, mmm, hey, yeah, yeah
Woo, ooh-hoo, my darlin', uh-huh

Girl, we've been the best of friends
And I never want that feeling to end
But you've got to know what's been on my mind
'Cause I've been holding back, baby, for the longest time

And every night, I lie alone in my bed
Pictures of me lovin' you runnin' 'round my head
Now, baby, it's time to let you know
That I want you, and I need you
And I never want to let you go

What do I say?
What do I do?
Tell me, baby, just to get next to you
What do I say?
What do I do
Tell me, baby, just to be next to you?
Oh, what do I say?
You might also like
Maybe you'll turn and walk away
That's a chance that I've got to take, yeah
Said I got to know do you want me, too
'Cause I won't ever be free, baby, 'til I know the truth, yeah yeah

We always talk about the good times that we've had
But girl, tonight, let's talk about what lies ahead
'Cause baby, when look into your eyes
I wanna touch ya, I wanna hold ya
I wanna love you for the rest of my life, baby

What do I say?
What do I do
Tell me, baby, just to get next to you?
I wanna know, what do I say?
What do I do, girl?
Tell me, baby, just to be next to you
What do I say?

And every night, I lie alone in my bed
Pictures of me lovin' you
Runnin' 'round and 'round and 'round my head
And baby, when I look into your eyes
I wanna touch ya, I wanna hold ya
I wanna love you for the rest of my life
What do I say?
What do I do, baby
Tell me, baby, tell me, baby, just to get next to you? Yeah
Oh, now what do I say?
What do I do
Tell me, baby, just to be next to you?
Oh, baby, what do I say?
