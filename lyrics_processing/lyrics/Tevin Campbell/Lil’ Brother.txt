Say, baby, how you doing?
How you doing?
My name is Tevin and I'm 15
And I love to kick it with you, baby
So what's up?

Oh, really?
Don't you think you're just a lttle bit too young for me?
Do you know who I am?
And speaking of taking me out
Can you even drive?

Baby, I drive stick
So what's up?
You got to get with the program

Please
I don't think you even know what a stick is

Wait a minute, baby
Listen
You might also like
Mmm-mmm

I know you're 17
Bet a million dollars
I could make you scream
The word is out all over town
That teenage lovers only bring you down
You're so attracted to those older guys
Tell me why
(Why you wanna be so close?)
You'd rather spend your time with superflies
And pass me by
Baby, don't shut me out
I'm not your lil' brother
Baby, I can turn you on
Lil' brother
Make you want to scream and shout
I'm not your lil' brother
Stronger (?) and you think I'm grown
Lil' brother
Why you wanna do me wrong?
Chill out with me
And let the evening flow
You'd be surprised at all the things I know
I might be young
But I got news for you
Those older guys will break your heart in two
You keep hanging with those older guys
Tell me why
(Why you wanna be so close?)
Girl, I know that I can treat you right
Each and every night
Baby, don't shut me out
I'm not your lil' brother
Baby, I can turn you on
Lil' brother
Make you want to scream and shout
I'm not your little brother
Stronger (?) and you think I'm grown
Lil' brother
Why you wanna do me wrong?

You're a cute little boy
But you're only 15
I need a real man at least 19
I'm sorry, baby
You could never be my lover
I can't go out with you
You're like my lil' brother
I'm hard
I'm know I'm 15
The dudes you like can't even make you scream
I'll blow your mind
I'm a stone-cold lover
Spend the night with me
You'll never be alone
You're so attracted to those older guys
Tell me why
(Why you wanna be so close?)
You'd rather spend your time with superflies
And pass me by
Baby, don't shut me out
I'm not your lil' brother
Baby, I can turn you on
Lil' brother
Make you want to scream and shout
I'm not your lil' brother
Stronger (?) and you think I'm grown
Lil' brother
Why you wanna do me wrong?
Lil' brother
Why you wanna do me so wrong, baby?
Lil' brother
Ooh
I'm not your lil' brother
Lil' brother
I'm not your lil' brother

Look, Tevin
Would you please stop singing this song?
It is not working
You are not the one

Wait a minute
It's working for me

Why don't you go play with your Nintendo?
I don't have no more time for this

Wait a minute, baby
I want you
What's up with that?
(I'm not your lil' brother)
I'll give you my French fries
