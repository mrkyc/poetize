Don't wanna play those games no more
I don't wanna break your heart
Don't wanna play those foolish games
'Cause I feel that you're the only one for me

When I was a young boy I believed
That love was just a dream
Played around with your emotions from the start
But now I can see
That there is more to life than dreams
I finally found someone who makes my life complete
And I know within my heart, your love is true
And that's why I don't...

Don't wanna play those games no more
I don't wanna break your heart
Don't wanna play those foolish games
'Cause I feel that you're the only one for me

How could I be so selfish then
Knowing the things that I know now
All the times I tried to love you
I needed you to show me how
But now I can see
That there is more to life than dreams
I finally found someone Who makes my life complete
And I know within my heart, your love is true, so...

Should I just be on my way?
