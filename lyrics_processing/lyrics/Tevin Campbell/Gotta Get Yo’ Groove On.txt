Tonight
You're gonna get your groove on
You know what I'm sayin'?
Get your groove on
That's right
Hey
Get your groove on

Tell me, people, why you holdin' back?
Won't you feel the beat from this funky track
Ain't no time to waste, get up on your feet
For a real good time, I got what you need

Oh, people, feel the feeling
Don't you know you need some party time healing
Girls are dancing, DJ's grooving so right
And right now I'm in need of a party
Let's get it on, baby

Girl, don't be afraid of me 'cause I won't bite
And baby, I can promise I will do you right
So if you're in the mood to rock with me tonight
Then we can hit the groove until the morning light
Gotta get my groove on (Groove on, groove on)
Gotta get your groove on (Groove on, groove on)
Gotta get my groove on (Groove on, groove on)
I got to get your groove on (Groove on, groove on)
