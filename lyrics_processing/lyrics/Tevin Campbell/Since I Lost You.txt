Oh yeah
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, oh girl
Oh yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah
Listen, baby

Waiting for the sunshine
Standing out in the rain
Trying to forgive myself
For causing you pain
Used to have a sweet thing
With the sweetest girl around
It's hard to keep on going on
Knowing that I let you down

Bluebirds don't sing (Bluebirds don't sing)
Skies above are gray (Skies are gray)
What can I do? (What can I do?)
I'm so lonely without you (Lonely)
Without your smile (Without your smile)
Make my gray skies blue (Ooh baby)
Nothing compares to you

Since I lost you, girl
You know my head's been spinning 'round
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found
Living life without you, girl
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no no no
Ever since I lost you, girl
I been crying, crying, crying
You might also like
Winter turns to springtime
Flowers bloom after rain
What if we tried starting out
All over again
I just can't be giving up
Your love without a fight, no no no
Girl, you know I still believe
That we can find the light

Look to the sun (Look to the sun)
Open up your heart (Open your heart)
Love finds a way (Love finds a way)
Gonna see a brighter day (See a brighter day)
If you believe (And if you believe)
Won't you take my hand (Take my hand)
And give me another chance

Since I lost you, girl (Since I lost you, yeah)
You know my head's been spinning 'round
(Oh, since I lost you, girl)
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found
(I haven't been myself since you're gone)
Living life without you, girl (Ooh)
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no no no
(Raining every day and every night)
Ever since I lost you, girl
I been crying, crying, crying
Ooh, oh, oh, mmm
Ooh-hoo, ooh, ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I want you back (I want you back, baby)
Baby, take my hand (Oh, take my hand)
Let's give love another chance (Another chance, yeah)

Since I lost you, girl (Oh yeah)
You know my head's been spinning 'round
(Ooh, since I lost you, yeah, ooh yeah)
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found
(Oh-ho, ho)
Living life without you, girl
(Living my life)
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no no no
(Ain't no sunshine in my sky)
Ever since I lost you, girl (It's been raining)
I been crying, crying, crying
(And I've been crying, ooh, ooh yeah)
Since I lost you, girl (Since I lost you)
You know my head's been spinning 'round
(Oh, and it's because of you)
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found
(Ooh baby, come back, come on back to me, yeah)
Living life without you, girl
(You know I need you)
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no no no
(I need you with me)
Ever since I lost you, girl
(I want you back, baby; come on back, baby)
I been crying, crying, crying (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Ever since I lost you, girl
