I've lived the life a citizen's supposed to
So why I gotta be the illegitimate nephew?
Remember me, Uncle Sam? I fought your war
And went all out not knowing what I was fighting for
Sam, why'd you let 'em rape my great grandmother
Then go to the oak tree and hang her brother?
When they were slaving, there wasn't a fuss
So where was you when they was in my yard burning the cross?
Do you love me or what, Uncle Sam, what is it?
You wanna maim me and claim the grand wizard?
Let that pass and marched for a just cause
Then got uncivilized rights with unenforced laws
Passed your curriculum, got a diploma
And can't get a job 'cause my skin has color
You say things changed between now and then
Now I wanna know the difference between me and him?
(Can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?)
I'm your nephew, yes it's true, oh, can't you hear me Uncle Sam?
(Hear me, Uncle Sam)
Can I sit upon your bended knee just like the other man?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Can't you hear me, Uncle Sam?
