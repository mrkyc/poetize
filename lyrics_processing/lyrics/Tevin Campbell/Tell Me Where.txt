No, no, no, no
Ooh baby, uh-huh

I know your story
He stayed out late last night and he didn't even call
But don't you worry
You can cry on my shoulders
I just wanna hold ya

'Cause I'm the one that cares for you
And when you get lonely, you can call on me, girl

Tell me where
Where it hurts you and I'll kiss you there
Tell me where
Where it hurts you and I'll kiss you there

No pain, no sorrow
I'll be there for you when you wake up tomorrow
So don't cry, don't worry
I'll be there quicker than quick and faster than a hurry
