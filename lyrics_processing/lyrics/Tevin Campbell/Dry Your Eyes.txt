Another man has broke your heart
You run to me, to ease your pain, yeah
Why can't you see it in my eyes
That I'm in love and I want to make you mine

We can't be lovers 'cause you think you'll lose your friends
But that's what try to tell me time and time again, but no way
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you
And I know in my heart I'll always be by your side
So dry your eyes

Baby, dry your eyes (Yeah)
There's no need for you to cry
(There's no need for you to cry)
So baby, dry your eyes (Why don't you dry your eyes?)
I'll be here for you always (I'll be here)

I often lay and visualize
How sweet it'd be, just you and me, babe
Us side by side and hand in hand
Ooh, it could be so nice if only you'd give me a chance
You might also like
We can't be lovers 'cause you think you'll lose your friends
By now you've got know that I'll be here until the end
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you
And I know you know I'm tired of watching my baby cry
So dry your eyes

Baby, dry your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
There's no need for you to cry
(There's no need for you to cry)
So baby, dry your eyes (Oh baby)
I'll be here for you always (Always)
Baby, dry your eyes (Oh, hey, baby)
There's no need for you to cry (There's no need, no need)
So baby, dry your eyes (No need, oh yeah)
I'll be here for you always (Oh)

I'll never give up trying (I'll never give up trying)
One day you'll be my girl (You'll be my girl)
'Til then, we're just friends, yes
I'll be here to dry your eyes
Mhm, baby, I'll be right here to dry your eyes
I'm gonna be right here, oh baby, yeah
Baby, dry your eyes (Dry your eyes)
There's no need for you to cry
