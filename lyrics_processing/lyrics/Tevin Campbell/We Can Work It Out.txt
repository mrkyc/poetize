Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight

Things ain't going smooth right now
But I know we can make it
We've got to get through this somehow
If we let it all fade away
We'll both be in pain
'Cause I know we still care

Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right (We're gonna make it right)
Baby, we can work it out (Ooh)
Don't wanna fight (Ooh yeah)

Our love stayed strong
As if nothing was wrong
You're everything I've always dreamed of
I can't let you go, baby, you ought to know
You might also like
We know we're in love (We're in love)
So why don't we just take the time to get it right
(Could you tell me, we gotta get it right, yeah)
I'll always be here for you (Always be here for you)
(Just for you, baby)
(I just) I just need you by my side

Baby, we can work it out (Yeah, baby, no)
