(Beautiful) Mmm, oh-oh, yeah, yeah
(Beautiful) Mmm, oh-oh, oh
Beautiful thing

I guess I don't wear them on my sleeve
The feelings for you I bear
I don't wanna get all sensitive, no
But if you don't know, I care

Communication's a strange relation to me
Forgive me, if you can
But the secret
Is that I'm overjoyed inside, you see
And when I pray I tell the Man...

It never ceases to amaze me
She's all I dream about
Beautiful thing
Conversations never phase me
She's all I talk about
Beautiful thing
You might also like
How could you really ever know, ever know
If I never extend my hand?
I don't wanna make you run away
So I pray you'll understand

My hesitation with love relations could be
My only doubt and fear
Then, baby you came
Into my life and now you're all I dream
And once again I'm thanking Him...

It never ceases to amaze me
She's all I dream about
My beautiful thing
Conversations never phase me (Oh-ho, oh)
She's all I talk about
My beautiful thing
Every day's a new adventure
So happy that I got
My beautiful thing
From November to November
She's all I wanna shout
Beautiful thing
Oh, darlin', so beautiful (So beautiful, oh yeah)
She's all I dream about...
She's all I talk about...
It never ceases to amaze me... (To amaze me, yeah, to, yeah)
Conversations never phase me
(Never phase me and I know, know)
Beautiful thing

It never ceases to amaze me
(Never, never, never, she's all)
She's all I dream about
Beautiful thing (I dream about)
Conversations never phase me (Beautiful)
She's all I talk about
Beautiful thing (She's all I dream about)
Every day's a new adventure
(Oh, every day's a new adventure)
So happy that I got
My beautiful thing (So happy that I got my beautiful thing)
From November to November (Oh-ho)
She's all I wanna shout
