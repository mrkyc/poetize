Until the break of dawn
The break, mmm, the break, until the break of dawn
The break (The break), mmm, the break

Are you satisfied
With the way I love you?
Are you satisfied?
'Cause I just can't deny
That the way you love me
Makes me melt inside, ooh baby

I'ma gonna give it all up, my baby
As long as you want it
My kiss is gonna cover your body
Up and down and all around

Until the break, the break of dawn

What's your fantasy?
Maybe we could play it out
Just you and me
In my wildest dreams
I couldn't have imagined such intensity
