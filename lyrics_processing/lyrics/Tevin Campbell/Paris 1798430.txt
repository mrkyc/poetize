Yeah yeah yeah
Hey
(Paris 1798430) Woo, ooh-hoo
(Paris 1798430)

Ebony American, heart torn in two
Watching his soul disappear with no trace or clue
A brother got lost livin' for the city
Takin' dope from the man
Ain't nowhere to run when it's from Uncle Sam, yeah

(Paris 1798430) My soul's in hiding
That's where a brotha be hiding 'til he get his due, hey
(Paris 1798430) My soul's in hiding
Gimme a call when we can live as large as you do, hey

Tears spill out in anger, our black is now blue
Our blood can be spilled as well but it will not make the news
Unless we're taken out one by one for the wrongs we have done
What else can you live by if you die by the gun? (Bang)

(Paris 1798430) Ooh, my soul's in hiding
That's where a brotha be hiding 'til he get his due, oh
(Paris 1798430) My soul's in hiding
Gimme a call when we can live as large as you do, oh

Woo, yeah (Woo)
(Paris 1798430) Oh, whoa-oh

So you know his mother will raise him you know like the best she can
And uh, you know it could have been much easier you know if she had like another man
And uh, it's kinda hard being happy you know, livin' on hope and good luck
And uh, it's kinda hard having pride when you ain't got bucks
Woo, ooh, whoa, oh yeah

(Paris 1798430) My soul's in hiding
My soul's in hiding
Oh, my soul's in hiding
When a baby cries, you know what? I envy his tears
So little does he know of the ignorance and fear
That will divide us until we are willing to change
Until the cup that we drink from is the very same
My soul'll be hiding
My soul'll be hiding
Hiding (Hiding), hiding
(Paris 1798430) Woo, hoo, ooh
(That's where a brotha be hiding 'til he get his due)
Yeah yeah yeah
(Paris 1798430)
Give me a call
(Gimme a call when we can live as large as you do)
I will listen
(Paris 1798430) I will listen (I will listen)
I will listen (I will listen)
