Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah

Got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion
By reaching out for each other's hand
Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along, yeah
One way or another
Together's where we both belong

If we listen to each other's heart (Oh yeah)
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time ever, we're seeing it eye to eye

If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us
And find a way to bring me to you
So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out, oh
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you down (Nothing's gonna stop us now)

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart (Whoa, yeah)
And maybe love is the reason why (Ooh, yeah)
For the first time ever, we're seeing it eye to eye

(Love is why we're seeing it eye to eye) Yes, we are
(I think that we're seeing it) Seeing it eye to eye
(Love is why we're seeing it eye to eye) Seeing it eye to eye, yeah
(I think that we're seeing it) Seeing it eye to eye
(Love is why we're seeing it eye to eye) I think we're seeing it eye to eye, yeah
(I think that we're seeing it) Eye to eye

If you're ever lonely, stop
You don't have to be
After all, it's only
A beat away from you to me (Take a look inside and see)
Yeah

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why (Ooh)
For the first time ever (Oh, we're seeing it), we're seeing it eye to eye
Seeing it eye to eye
Seeing it eye to eye, baby, whoa (Eye to eye)
For the first time (Seeing it)
For the first time (Seeing it eye to eye)
(For the first time ever, we're eye to eye)
Seeing it (Seeing it, baby)
Seeing it eye to eye (Yeah, yeah)
(For the first time ever, we're eye to eye)
For the first time, oh yeah, yeah (Seeing it)
Yeah, baby, we're seeing it eye to eye (Seeing it eye to eye)

Yeah (Seeing it)
Come on, hey (Seeing it eye to eye)
Eye to eye, eye to eye
(For the first time ever, we're eye to eye)
Eye to eye, eye to eye
Eye to eye (Seeing it)
Yeah (Seeing it eye to eye)
Eye to eye
