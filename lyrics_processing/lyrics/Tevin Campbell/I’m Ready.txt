Yeah, baby, oh, oh, come on

Baby, it was uncool to love me
Then leave me standing here now without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore, whoa, whoa

Sometimes when I'm alone I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again, and take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me, yeah
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me, yeah

I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore
See, I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore, whoa, whoa
You might also like
And once again, I'll be right here
Waiting to share your love
But I hope this time for once
We'll forever mean it, oh, oh

See, I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever (Forever)
Hey love now, yeah, come and love me forevermore
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore, whoa, whoa

I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever (Forever), and ever, baby
Hey love, come and love me forevermore
Come and love me, love me
I'll make you love me, 'cause I'm ready
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love you) forever (Forever)
(Oh, ho, ho, ho, forever, yeah)
Hey love, come and love me forevermore (Forevermore), whoa, whoa
I'm ready (I'm ready), yeah, to love you forever (Forever)
Hey love, come and love me forevermore
I'm ready to love you forever (Forever)
