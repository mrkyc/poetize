Get out of bed or face this day
But I need to
Needle in my eye
I just need you to go sit down
Cause I told you I'd bury it deep in the ground
A joke a stroke of genius
Probably somewhere in between
No joke the broken records laughing
While she gasps and screams
A lull from up above my neck
But still below my spleen
I am what I am who am I?
I don't know what that means
But I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I'm not a kid?
That's my mistake
Get out of bed?
Nah fuck this day

But I told you I'd bury it deep in the ground

A lull from up above my neck
But still below my spleen
I am what I am who am I?

I wanna be Dave Grohl
I wanna be Dave Grohl
