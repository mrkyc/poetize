We both had our issues
I love you, hate you, then miss you
I know that we both feel the same
I want you to be honest
The only thing that I wish
You would just do it when we're face to face
But here we are
Two separate places
In the bed
Same room, I'm feelin' naked
You know I hate it
I think it's time we finally face it
Don't complicate it
We takin' more L's than Meek Mill is
And we ain't even famous
Ok, now dab

Write it down
You erase it
Gave you my heart
You misplaced it
Gave you keys to the crib
And then you still sleep in the basement
Gave you the lights so you can see
But baby girl you still playin'
Not givin' up
Tighter than the eyes of an Asain
But let me drive and I'll take you to places
That you've never gone, yeah
Know what you worth
And I wanted you more than a Yeezy sweater
Callin', I'm callin'
Now you gon' treat me like a bill collector
You gon' really make me
You might also like
Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know what we do, yeah
We playin' games
Not trying to lose, yeah
Baby tell me now what are we doing?
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
Know that both of us gon' live and learn

We just can't continue
If we don't know what we into
I know that we gon lose our way
It's like we both on an island
With no one on it, just silence
And we're looking for someone to save
Us from each other, we treading water
We both can't swim but the tide is makin'
This complicated
I don't know if we'll ever make it
I know you hate it
Put some respect up on your name if we get married, baby
No games like Birdman
Write it down
You erase it
Gave you my heart
You misplaced it
Gave you keys to the crib
And then you still sleep in the basement
Gave you lights so you can see
But baby girl you still playin'
Not givin' up
Tighter than the eyes of an Asain
But let me drive and I'll take you to places
That you've never gone, yeah
Know what you worth
And I wanted you more than a Yeezy sweater
Callin', I'm callin'
Now you gon' treat me like a bill collector
You gon' really make me

Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know what we do, yeah
We playin' games
Not trying to lose, yeah
Baby tell me now what are we doing?
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
Know that both of us gon' live and learn
I can take it, I can take it, we gon' live and learn
I can take it, I can take it, we gon' live and learn
Know we made mistakes
And I know that this ain't right
But I don't care what that means
Shawty, if I got you ever lie

Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know what we do, yeah
We playin' games
Not trying to lose, yeah
Baby tell me now what are we doing?
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
