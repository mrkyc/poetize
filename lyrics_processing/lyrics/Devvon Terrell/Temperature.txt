Please stop texting me at 3 in the morning
Shawty if you next to me
Got to get up in the morning
Fuck how I'm feeling now
Cause you got in my mind yea
I was just chillen but now you got me
On your time yea ( whoa whoa)
You don't got to worry about loving me
Do this shit right here no repercussions (yea)
All I want to hear is that you on your way
Hope in that lyft or Uber come right now
Damn it's still 3 in the morning
We in LA everything closing
At 2 in the morning
All out of options so you are my options
So slide thru
I just want to be inside you
These are the words of a side dude
I don't get caught up on titles
I'll rather sit back be idol
I need you just the way you need me
I can be your in between kind of lover talking about
A sometimes times kind of lover
When he texting you girl I don't notice
Put it on silent so I can focus
We can even put on vibrate yet
Set your Alarm for work in the am

Tryna feel you out when I kick game
Go to fast let me switch lanes

Love me not let me know
Verse 2
Tell me what's good baby I'm right here
Tryna feel you out but you still not clear
When you leave me out here I go
So cold don't know how much
You take me out the zone
Or you be fucking with me
Slow texting me wonder if you
Playing with me
Are you hot or you cold
Or am I warm yea
Getting closer to you shorty
Right now yea
Giving me the runaround yea
Stop driving round in circles
Like I said hop in that Lyft or Uber
Come right now
It's later than 3 in the morning now
If this was New York sun will be up
And that just kills my vibe
We in LA so we got us more time
So slide thru
I just want to be inside you
These are the words of a side dude
I don't get caught up on titles
I'll rather sit back and be idol
I need you just the way you need me
I can be your inbetween talking about
A sometimes times kind of lover
