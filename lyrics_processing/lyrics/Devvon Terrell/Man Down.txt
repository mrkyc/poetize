Love you then hate you
But they would never be the same without you
This is why you never talk to strangers (Man Down)
I been on my shit, I been pretty lit
You can take all the air out this room and I still burn you off the fumes
Burn nigga, what you earn nigga, these are my figures
Do you like MJ? 'cause you can't beat it, this is my thriller
Gorilla it get no realer, this what I say
I don't like having kids in my zoo, I'm like Harambe
Someday they gonna need me
When it comes to family I never play, I end a show like I'm Kanye
Oh nooo baby
All you niggas irrelevant
Y'all the type to help Donald Trump become president
Evidence, we are so different
Some got no presence, others so gifted
This is the mission
You get this free, no tuition
I am like the floor, when it's dry never slipping

I know we all on the same shit
You really you know it, they can't put a (man down)
Up for a while that can change quick
I tell myself that they can't put a (man down)
You might also like
When it get to talking, just realize you gotta love it
This is when you know you doing something (man down)
Everybody gonna want a favor
Now that you got food, everybody at the table
Love you and they hate you
All about that timing
Put me under pressure and I come off from the ground like diamonds
Shining, trying to blind ya
I've notice that when you finally get that, money comes with way more problems
Problem, don't want a problem
You not in my row or my fucking column
Lonely at the top, too many at the bottom
I feel like LeBron on the break, who gon' stop him? (man down)
Man down on the way down
Here to teach a lesson nigga put your hand down
I think that I'm elevated, don't it get you aggravated
Trying catch me off guard like Solange in the elevator

I know we all on the same shit
You really you know it, they can't put a (man down)
Up for a while that can change quick
