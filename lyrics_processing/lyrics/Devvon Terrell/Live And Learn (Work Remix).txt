We both had our issues, I love you, hate you then miss you
I know that we both feel the same
I want you to be honest, the only thing that I wish you
Would just do it when we're face-to-face
But here we are, two separate places
In a bed, same room but feeling naked
You know I hate it
I think it's time we finally face it
Don't complicate it, we taking more L's than Meek Mills and we ain't even famous
OK not that bad

I write it down, you erase it
Gave you my heart, you misplaced it
Gave you the keys to the crib and then you still sleep in a basement
Gave you the lights so you can see but baby girl you're still playing
Not giving up I'm tighter than the eyes of an Asian
But let me drive and I'll take you to places that you've never gone yet
Know what you're worth and I wanted you more than a Yeezy sweater
Calling I'm calling now you gon' treat me like a bill collector
You gon' really make me

Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know-o-o what we do
Yea we playin games not tryin to lose yea
Baby tell me now what are we doin'
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
Know that both of us gon' live and learn
You might also like
We just can't continue if we dont know what we into
I know we gon lose our way
Its like we both on an island
With no one on it, just silence
And we're looking for someone to save
Us from each other, we treadin' water
We both can't swim but the tide is makin'
This complicated, I don't know if we'll ever make it
I know you hate it put some respect up on your name if we get married baby
No games like Birdman

I write it down, you erase it
Gave you my heart, you misplaced it
Gave you the keys to the crib and then you still sleep in a basement
Gave you the lights so you can see but baby girl you're still playing
Not giving up I'm tighter than the eyes of an Asian
But let me drive and I'll take you to places that you've never gone yet
Know what you're worth and I wanted you more than a Yeezy sweater
Calling I'm calling now you gon' treat me like a bill collector
You gon' really make me

Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know-o-o what we do
Yea we playin games not tryin to lose yea
Baby tell me now what are we doin'
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
Know that both of us gon' live and learn
I can take it, I can take it, we gon' live and learn
I can take it, I can take it, we gon' live and learn
I know we made mistakes
And I know that this ain't right
But I don't care what that means
Shawty, if I got you ever lie

Spend all my time with you
Nobody gotta know-o-o what we do
Yea we playin' games not tryin to lose yea
Baby tell me now what are we doin'
Cause I know you put him first
Nobody gotta tell me how this works
Know that one of us gon' wind up hurt
