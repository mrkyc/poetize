What you tryna do now?
What you tryna do now?
All my friends are telling me to stay away from you
But what you do to make them feel that way?
It's probably 'cause they couldn't have you
And I'm so so so close
And I ain't tryna prove them wrong
I'm tryna do you right
I'm trying to be that nigga you call when you feel lonely at night
Wearing shit that I like
Know you want something to drink
You don't want nothing clear, nothing pink
Hennessey's a friend to me
Takes me places I want to be
Got that shit on my side
Cause on the other we riding Uber like shooters

Girl you are a blessing
That's why I be flexing
I be bragging all to all my friends
Talking 'bout you
Ah yeah, ah yeah, you ain't going nowhere
'Cause I don't really see ourselves with no one else
Girls you like hard to find
You call me, I'm switching my lineup
Don't worry about the timing I don't care if it's late
'Cause if I come through
Then you call it now
I want you to myself
No don't slow down
Seeing me which you don't care if they hatin'
Our shit is priceless
They can't afford us
Riding around all through the city while they fuss
We belong here while they lookin' like Torus, yeah
