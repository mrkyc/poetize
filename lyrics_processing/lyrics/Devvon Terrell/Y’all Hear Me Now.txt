This year I want me a milli
Separate friends from my enemies
Buy my momma house
And curse out my father repeatedly
Yes, you gave life to me
But I know that you just never believed, yeah
People gon' hate
Niggas never wanna see you be great
Look at me now
I know I'm on my way to my teachers and trainers
All that I can say
That I can say is

Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Got me like
Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now

You can never be the boss
If you don't know what a slave is
Fresh to the game like a newborn baby
Hanging out with niggas I would never really trust
I put that on all I love
I ain't following the motherfuckers so
You never really notice until you're getting older
Everybody really got they own image
Say they wanna see you winning
Then they go dismiss you
What's the issue?
Look at me now I look down at my haters
Wanna start come through to your place, you play
All about my money, I'm all about my families
Say fuck all that's bullshit, I want me a Grammy
You wanna party, I'd rather record
Nobody makes real shit no more
Moving in silence, that's a major key
I know that all of y'all finally see me

Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Got me like
Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Everybody want respect but it go both ways
Never trust a person that can't look you in the face
Say you happy for me but I know you telling lies
Got 'em looking like Jordan when they all cry
Show it all in the plan, but they don't look
I remember selling drinks, just to buy my books
I remember writing hooks, just to pass time
Little did them niggas know it was the last time
They would see me tryna write for 'em
See them posting pictures like I'm hype for 'em
Blowing up my phone I press the ignore
Every time my phone be ringing they be wanting favors
Reading the text like "what you doing lately?"
I'm at work and I don't really think I'm coming home soon
Really can't explain, but I'll show you
This is what I owe you, really that I got damn thing
This is for everybody that told me "Don't rap or sing"
I'm up right now, I'm the referee I call the shots right now
I know she's mad, could be us right now
Everything changed, it's not the same, it's not the same, I like it
There's no going back now, really in my bag now
Finally got a voice, everybody looking
Just another young kid from Brooklyn

Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
Got me like
Okay, okay
Okay, okay
Y'all hear me now
Y'all hear me now
