Hold up
Hold up
Oh yeah

Tell me what you want, baby
Don't let it go
I know you want it now
I'm just waitin' on you (Hold up)
These bitches got me fucked up
And I don't wanna front, but
I'm scrollin' through my phone now
I'm about to double tap it
So you know how I feel

I don't even know what your name is
To show you that I'm there
I'm likin' shit from weeks ago
Don't try to front like
We both likin' pictures for nothin'
I think that you're my favorite, favorite

I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
My woman crush Wednesday
Tell me what's better
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
My woman crush Wednesday
Tell me what's better

Damn girl, you've been bad since your throwbacks
Who's that girl? Real fine like you Eve Eve
And even Stevie J comment on your Kodak
Hold up, let me slow up
You'll be my woman crush Wednesday once the picture load up
I don't care, one follow, not a model but got models in their feelings
Leavin' Heat like LeBron leave from Cleveland, baby
You should check your DM, ho

I don't even know what your name is
To show you that I'm there
I'm likin' shit from weeks ago
Don't try to front like
We both likin' pictures for nothin'
I think that you're my favorite, favorite

I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
My woman crush Wednesday
Tell me what's better
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
I really wanna tell her, wanna tell her
My woman crush Wednesday
Tell me what's better
Oh baby, oh baby, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
