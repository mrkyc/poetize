You say the Devil is a liar, well it gotta be a five-six
Brown eyed chick, gotta way with your words
Would you say, "Oh I believe you"?
There's so many parts to you that I never knew existed
Oh baby till now and I'm such a fool cause I knew that
You changed, I been peeped your way
You're friends with all these niggas, but I never complained
I know it was more than just texting your phone
Tell me why we just can't all get along
This ain't ninety-five though, feeling like a new guy
Say goodbye to the good and hello to the bad guy
You put a bullet through my heart though
So cold with the feelings, I'ma leave you outside though
Burning and you just can't tell
You 'bout to go through it baby oh welcome to hell
Girl I do not mean to yell, I'm just talking how I feel
Let me calm down, let me get right
I don't want you to see me this way
I don't wanna give you all this satisfaction of seeing me in pain
But I know you gon' see, oh girl one day you gon' see
That you had a good thing going
Never gonna find another nigga like me so

(I just wanna tell you off)
Oh I want you to know about yourself, yeah
(I just wanna tell you off)
I want you to know that you ain't right
(I just wanna tell you off)
I really gotta tell, oh I really gotta tell you off, yeah
I just wanna tell you off
I just wanna tell you off
You might also like
No girl, I don't wanna talk
Drop me off, why you pulling in this parking lot?
See there's a lot of shit I want to say, but I gotta try to refrain
Because I'm bottling it up and then I use it as pain
To paint a picture of a girl with no morals or heart
I wanna tell you off, but I'd rather tear you apart
Don't know where to start
Remember when I sat in your car
I saw a hickey on your neck
You tried to say "It's a scar"
Dummy
You're all lovey-dovey, don't call me hubby
Don't say you love me, now we're over, done, sorry honey
Oh your memories fuzzy? Funny how it works
Funny how I'm worth less than a meat-head, no shirt
And you prefer blacking out off a bottle of wine
I prefer never wasting my time
You see its easy to find a big ego with a bigger behind
And all I want is to fall in love with her mind
Yes I'm Witt

(I just wanna tell you off)
Oh I want you to know about yourself, yeah
(I just wanna tell you off)
I want you to know that you ain't right
(I just wanna tell you off)
I really gotta tell, oh I really gotta tell you off, yeah
I just wanna tell you off
I just wanna tell you off
Been hoping and wishing
That lately you feeling the same thing I'm feeling
When you sleep at night
Know that you're thinking, I know that you're thinking
Now what am I doing with these guys at night
Nothing with them, oh girl we were so serious
Now fucking up what we had right here
This situation is so damn complacent
You open your legs to somebody that don't even care

(I just wanna tell you off)
Oh I want you to know about yourself, yeah
(I just wanna tell you off)
I want you to know that you ain't right
(I just wanna tell you off)
I really gotta tell, oh I really gotta tell you off, yeah
I just wanna tell you off
