Oh girl, I think I want you now right now (now, now)

Bow chicka, wow wow (wow, wow)

Thinking that we should just go away, a girl like you gets everything
Know that you don't need it, yeah
Wanna show you how much I care
I don't wanna be compared to what you had
I don't see us being friends here
Skipping to the part where you just noticed that I want you
Going for your dreams, all lined up, haunting you
Girl, I can't sleep cause your my fix
You know that I hate when your in my head
Know that you got your own thing going
New York to L.A, I can't wait for you to touchdown
No I'm not thirsty, just proud of you
So proud to show you to my town

Ok, hate it, but you never goin' to stay
We be making time for each other like a mo' fuckin' playdate
Always catching Red Eye Flights, I'm sleeping all day
So I gotta gather energy to get a replay, going for the weekday
Girl, you love to see the city for the views
So I always get a room up high
Riding down the west side, I know you hit the traffic
But we always getting there on time
You don't know what I be feeling
You don't know what I be feeling
Having you here is like me having steak everyday
In the moment, it's good, but then my health is going to lose
One of my habits I like it, you know that I know that you ain't no side chick
And I can't say we official, but when you leave
I can't front girl like I just don't miss you
I'll be in the front, yeah (I'll be in the front)
We don't got to front, yeah (we don't got to front)
And we don't gotta wait here (don't wait)
I know, you know what I know, girl ain't no later

Oh girl, I think I want you now right now (now, now)
I wanna see what you about ('bout, 'bout)
Bow chicka, wow wow (wow, wow)
If I get you, girl, I'd be proud
So proud
Oh girl, I want you here right now (right now)
I wanna see what you about (about)
Bow chicka, wow wow (wow, wow)
