I just wanna have a conversation
How we gettin' to this situation
How you tell me that I'm doing wrong
And then I put it in your hands, you misplace it
Always startin' with a nigga changing
If you runnin' out of shit to say, than say it to me
Going from my girl, to friend, to enemy
I'm feelin' like you tryna' put an end to me

And I got blood on my hands
I feel we're getting closer to the end
When does it end?
You know that we can never be friends, ah yeah
Who started the fire, which one of us is gonna burn here?
And I feel the storm, if it rains, let it pour
'Cause everything is really starting to hurt, yeah

The fire that is in your eyes
It puts the fear of God in me
And I know that you feel the same
We have no control
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)

Been guessin' and guessin' and guessin' for years
Finally feel like I'm facing my fears
Enemies exist, but no one compares
Gave you the shirt of my back
Now I feel like I'm sitting here naked and bare, huh
People get cold in the real world
Shit can get hot when you feel the stress
It's crazy how temperatures rise
You go from hard to hurt, to worse, to hurt to death
I dont know why we invest, love is a feeling that all of us get
You let a person in, you give them all the keys
You pray to God that they will never ever leave
Then you come home and you open your door
You realising that someone left open your door
Everything gone, keys on the floor
Callin' and callin' ,but they press ignore
This is the life that I chose
I'm just hopin' that you know
It can go from dark to night, to hot and cold
To red and white roses everywhere you go

The fire that is in your eyes
It puts the fear of God in me
And I know that you feel the same
We have no control
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and the rain)
Yeah
Feel like im dying here, time and time again
I found myself in situations where I'm just denying shit
Sweep it under rugs, and than I lift it up
And then I got a whole pile of shit
Procrastinating on major things
And now I'm feeling like I did it to ya
But who is to blame, when you both feel the same
And I feel like I'm on fire
Praying for the rain to kill all my desires
We have no control

The fire that is in your eyes
It puts the fear of God in me
And I know that you feel the same
We have no control
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
Of the fire and rain (Of the fire and rain)
