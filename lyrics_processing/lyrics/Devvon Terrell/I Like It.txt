Ain't no night, like a young God night

Same shit, new day, fuck around, just got paid
Wanna feel this everyday? Imma live my life my way, because
I like it, when you see my team is winning
I like it, knowing it's only the beginning

My niggas don't got no needs
Sit and watch, you can do that for free, yeah
That's your shorty, but we make her go long, go long
Good beef, that filet mignon
She living good and I don't think she wanna come home
And we don't try to be them boys, but tell me what you want

We could beat a nigga on our worst day
Shitting on you in the club, nigga, no birthday, replay
Everyday's a god damn movie
Bunch of superstars, lights camera action, never losing
If you know that you ain't no hater
And you ain't worried 'bout the next man paper
See you at the top, don't tell nobody wait up
I'm feeling like I need everyone to know
You might also like

Uh, okay, tell me where niggas started
All the friends I used to have were quickly dearly departed
Calling me cold hearted, sold it to me, I bought it
Bullshitting, saying you're down, your syndrome is so retarded
But it's cool, you know what I like
Doing all the god damn things I like
Can you feel that, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
Bragging you went to jail, you ficticious with your issues
And all the things that you claim, but


Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air
My team so strong, my circle so tight
Ain't no night, like a young God night
My team so strong, my circle so tight
Ain't no night, like a young God night
