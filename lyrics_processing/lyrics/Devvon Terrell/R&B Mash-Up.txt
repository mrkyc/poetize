My name is Devvon Terrell
I am the living weirdo
I'm gonna sing you seven songs with DJ First Choice
I really hope you like it

Said that you want to be more than friends and I get it
I'm not the type to do anything girl without your permission
I'm just trying to chill with you like ice in a cold winter
I know what you looking for the word is gorilla

King Kong ain't got nothing on me
Climb to the top and you gon' see
Know you want more, oh what could it be?
Stop running 'round and just look for me
Young, free, cruising down the west side
I treat you like you treat yourself because I show my best side Sometimes I be thinking you too good believe me
But I'm willing to put in work like I'm Drake and you Ri-Ri
I got a feeling you needed me but you not gonna say it
I'm gonna give you the juice, call that the fruits of my labor
You know that you ten out of ten and I made my decision
It's me and my girlfriend

So I'mma bring the money, bring me only your time
Only need to happen one time one time, yeah
Everyday is ghost when everything is potent
High up off of you and baby we ain't even smoking
Whoa, I know what I know
Baby I'm a player and I know that you're a coach
Know that other niggas around you doing the most
I want to represent you on my team
You might also like
Let me rock the boat, know that you so damn independent
I'mma let you finish your speech but wait, let me finish
Seeing you as a masterpiece, feeling no limit
You bring the law to my order, ice to my tea
Got these other dudes around you but they'll never be me
It's a short shot they missing like Shaq for three
No shame, know they gonna hate
Get in trouble for a nigga like you Kim K

Feeling like the summer rain, don't you ever take my sun away
Got no kids oh let me explain
Talking 'bout that thing that wakes me in the morning
When it's freezing cold you come up and it's warmer
Got you on the cover, making you happy know that's a habit Pulling things out of nowhere like go go Gadget
Seeing you in my future I can't go past it
Having you in my presence I cannot wait to have it
One of these days, I'll make you mine
Nothing to say, it just takes time
You're like the summer rain, and that don't feel the same

Rain is clearing and it's time to party yea
Know we drinking, call an Uber or Lyft
It's not the original it's probably this
Fiesta, fiesta, tu besta
Shorty about our business so I invest in her
You and me never lose, offers you cannot refuse
Shorty so loud the neighbors know my name, yes Jous
Ooh, I would never lose you
Say they want your mind but they really want to do you
Say that they can take you, I say homie do you
She gon' break your heart when you come out with the usual Like
I wanna know your name and, wanna know if you got a man, wanna know
I wanna know everything, I wanna know your number and if I can come over and...
Know that she not gonna like it
Maybe thinking how I notice and I'm not a psychic
You can never revoke a woman like that like a sidechick
The only answer for me, when I call
