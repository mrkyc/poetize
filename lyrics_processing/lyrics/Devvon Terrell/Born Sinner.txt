Verse 1
I'm a born sinner
If you ever sinned this song for you you
I'm a Born sinner and
If you ever sinned this songs for you you you
Protect me from my enemies
Protects me from those who
Don't want me here
Lie to me kindly and
Tell me that this is our year
Don't get it twisted the greatest
Enemies come from your circle
It's the ones you never see that can hurt you
And that's a fact young boy in BROOKLYN
Repping dodging smith and Westins
Friends kept me out of trouble
While they got arrested
I guess to them I was just an investment
They saw me doing good in school
And always told me that this ain't for you
See that's the difference between day ones
And who got here late
Real homies don't hand you shit that
You can't take but a hater will give you some
Bricks throw you in the lake
While they run off with the one you love
Cause they want your place
Call it Fake
My niggga Lou play point
And I'm the quarterback
Cause your circle should make
The perfect person
So when ya finally get it
All deservant  I do this for my family
Team so it's all worth it

I'm a born sinner so
If you ever sinned this song for you you you
I'm a Born sinner and
If you ever sinned this songs for you you you
Verse 2
Protect me from my troubled past
Feel like the storm I'm in will never past
Sometimes when I get that happiness
It never last
I'm holding on I'm  really
Drowning trying not to
Hit the surface
Looking at my sins was it all worth it
No this is fate nights I wasn't safe
Brought be better places
Days I waited for that bread to come
Taught me how to chase it
Life can be so basic
But it's still so complicated
How am I supposed to win
If I can't tell who's real or pretending
Never finish got to walk the path
Get your sin in
You gonna wind up with some people
That been here since the beginning
Don't want to see you finish
And that's the realist thing that I can say
Lord knows I'm happy for every birthday
Every problem that I ever had really
Taught me that I can never take an opinion
If they don't got the facts
Think they know you
But really be talking crazy
Cause everyone is a sinner
So what u saying
Chorus
I'm a born sinner so
If you ever sinned this song for you you you
I'm a Born sinner and
If you ever sinned this songs for you you you
I'm a born sinner so
If you ever sinned this song for you you you
I'm a Born sinner and
