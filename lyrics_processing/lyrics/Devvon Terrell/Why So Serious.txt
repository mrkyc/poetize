Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious, yeah
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious, yeah

I don't know why anybody hatin'
Tell me why you so damn mad right now
Take this shit too serious yeah
Life too short for the bullshit
Spread love that's the Brooklyn way
Reppin' B.I.G. and today was a good day
About to fuck up the streets and I mean that in a good way
Imma worry about my problems tomorrow I'm out
Out on the town
Mixing the drinks with the women
They partying
And it's going down
Everything speeding up faster
I know that Sunday morning I'ma need me a pastor
Oh you know my heart
I don't wanna end my life knowing it ain't start yet
Can live fake like Santa
Gotta live my life like panda, panda

Feeling the groove
Not thinking about what we do
Not thinking about work or school
If you feel the same come through
We can go dab to Marvin Gaye
Or wear fresh kicks with a suit and tie hey
You only live once
And I'm gonna live it
That's why I'm asking you

Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious, yeah
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious, yeah

What would you if you had 24 hours
I would probably be drinking Hennessy in the shower
Round and round we go
Shots every hour
Shorty so quiet but when she smoke she's loud
Goddamn
Got the whole world in my hand
Why we tryna live when we know it's the end
Now that just don't make any sense
Wait till you dying I'll finally start living
I'm on fire
Not going down like that
Living to my last day here
Live like that like that
I'm like Kanye West
I don't care
Live with no regrets
Don't know when my last day is
I'm just saying how I feel
So I'm

Feeling the groove
Not thinking about what we do
Not thinking about work or school
If you feel the same come through
We can go back to Marvin Gaye
Or wear fresh kicks with a suit and tie hey
You only live once
And I'm gonna live it
That's why I'm asking you

Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious, yeah
Why so serious?
Don't ever act like you don't get curious
Why so serious?
