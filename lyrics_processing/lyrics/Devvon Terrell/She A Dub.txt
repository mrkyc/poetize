Yea yea
Don't worry about it she a dub, yea
You the only one I show love, yea
All my exes looking like ghosts, yea
Only see you when I make a post
Now that I got you I feel better
I look at them, I look at you, oh that's a step up
That type of girl I love, she shittin' on my exes
They hit my line, I tell 'em all don't leave a message
Since I got you my exes lookin' like ghosts
Once upon a time, I wish that you were mine
Now you're upon my time, ain't nobody messin' if so

I got you so I don't need my ex
I got me a whole new flex with you
They looking like ghost
And you in here looking like goals

If I gotta say so, yea
You can see the halo, yea
All them other girls is dead to me, yea
Now that I got you next to me, woah
If I gotta say so, yea
You can see the halo, yea
All them other girls is dead to me
Now that you next to me, Oh you
You might also like
She want me back and that's a mess
If you feel a weight then get it off your chest
I'm not going back, I'm not going back
If you looking for my feelings you gon' need a map
Ring my line, new phone, who dis?
If you ain't get the news, you'll read all about it
New girl never ever got me feeling stressed
She giving me all the answers to the test
She remind me all the reasons that I left for
Every morning that I wake up I feel better
I look at them, I look at you, oh that's a step up
That type of girl I love she shittin' on my exes
Don't hit my line, I tell 'em all don't leave a message
Oh girl you messed up-up-up-up, flex
Once upon a time, you thought you were mine
She's so God damn fine
I won't mess it up with her

I got you so I don't need my ex
I got me a whole new flex with you
They looking like ghost
And you in here looking like goals

If I gotta say so, yea
You can see the halo, yea
All them other girls is dead to me, yea
Now that I got you ne-ne-next to me
If I gotta say so, yea
You can see the halo, yea
All them other girls is dead to me
