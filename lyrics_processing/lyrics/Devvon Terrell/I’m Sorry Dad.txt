Papa was a rolling stone
Don't know when he'll be home
Oh I did it on my own
Oh I did it on my own

What up dad?
I know that this'll probably make you mad
Or maybe have you thinking 'bout the things we never had
I'm your son, did you know that?
The way you treated me my whole life you never showed that
Man fuck the Kodak, the pictures I'm seeing of me and you
Is us by your BMW Coupe
Man that's so you
Flyest nigga I ever knew
Every time I saw you, was Prada and all designer
Tell me was I the problem?
I just wanted my father
I just wanted the love, my nigga, not just your wallet
Wanted to be fly, but I needed a pilot
I asked you for all of those things, but you said stop it
You told me man up, but where the man at?
I'm not tryna bash you, I'm tryna' tell ya where I'm at
You know that I love you pop, I'm just sayin' what I needed
But I love the man I am today and that's just why I'm leavin'

Father oh where are you I been
Father oh where are you yea

I love you yeah

I know you got your own family
But I'm so confused
I thought you loved my brother more
Oh you never knew?
I always thought y'all had this bond in so many ways
I 'member you called me to fill out his financial aid
Damn, what the fuck did I do?
Was I a sucker ass nigga cause I sang your truth?
All I ever wanted when I was younger was to be you
'Til my mom told me all the things you used to do
You used to play dog, but that ain't none of my business
That's between you and my mom, made your own decisions
Not gon' front, first day of school I was fly as ever
Then I turned 18 and you told me that your pockets give up
But I thank you, cause little did you know that shit would make me
Wound up buying a studio to make some money daily
Look at me now, pop, young nigga finally a success
No matter what you did to me I never loved you less
