Are you ready, Paris? Soul clap!
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah
Give me the bass, give me the bass, one time

Said the table to the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair
Can't nobody
Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able!
Fuck with us
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!"
Can't nobody
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try
Fuck with us
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?"
Say, can't nobody
So they both went slowly down
Fuck with us
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
Can't nobody
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side
Fuck with us
"See the table and the chair
Have come to take the air!"
Y'all... say it y'all
But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
'Til to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house
When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother!
Can't nobody fuck with us
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little brawny-
Say it, y'all
Mousey and the beetle dined
And danced upon the heads
'Til they toddled to their beds
Can't nobody fuck with us
Good God
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)

Revolution, baby, way down low
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Say what a beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Come on

Say it louder, y'all
(Oh-wee-oh-ooh)
Say it louder, y'all
(Oh-wee-oh-ooh)
