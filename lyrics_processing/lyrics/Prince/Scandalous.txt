Come closer
Feel what you've been dying for
Don't be afraid, baby
Touch it and explode
Understand, understand that I love you
But more than that
I want you
Everybody always told me
Good things come to those who wait
But I've got so much on the menu
I just can't, I just can't
I can't wait, baby
I can't wait, baby
I can wrap my legs around you, girl
'Cause sugar, you know you're just the kind of lover
That I've been looking for
Tonight, why don't we skip all the foreplay, mama
And just get down here on the floor

Scandalous
I'm talking 'bout you and me
Marvelous
Baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight, it's going to be scandalous
'Cause tonight, I'm going to be your fantasy
