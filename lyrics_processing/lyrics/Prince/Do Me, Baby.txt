Here we are in this big, old, empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me, baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oh, give it to me 'tiI just can't take no more
Come on and do me, baby
Like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait, oh

Here we are looking for a reason
For you to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So, baby, please stop teasing me
(Ooh) What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad
So...
