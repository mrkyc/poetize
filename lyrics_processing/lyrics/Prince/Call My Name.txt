Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

I heard your voice this morning, calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard that it didn't really sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door
And ever since that day, I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth
That I

I just can't stop writing songs about you, I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you and feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl, I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours, but I love it when you call my name, yes, I do

I heard a voice on the news saying people wanna stop the war (Stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you, they'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today? The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home, they'll only see you and me making love inside

I just can't stop writing songs about you, I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you and feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl, I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours, but I love it when you call my name, yes, I do

I never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before (Never seen the moon before)
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real (I'm talking 'bout real love)
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another, I'd have to steal you (I'd have to take you from your man)
I might be tempted to break the law 'round here
Because your beauty, it gives one pause (Yes, it does)
It slows me down

I just can't stop writing songs about you, I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you and feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl, I might go insane, right, right
I know it's only been three hours, but I love it when you call my name, yes, I do

Honey, won't you call, call, ooh, call my name?
Call it, call my name
That's right
