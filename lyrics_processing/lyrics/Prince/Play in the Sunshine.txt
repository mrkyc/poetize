Oooh, doggies!
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh!

We want to play in the sunshine
We want to be free
Without the help of a margarita or ecstasy
We want to kick like we used to
Sign up on the dotted line
We're going to dance every dance
Like it's going to be the last time
We got to play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up to ten
I want to meet you (Meet you), kiss you (Kiss you)
Love you (Love you), and miss you (Miss you)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Someway, somehow
I'm going to have fun
See Prince LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like
Play in the sunshine
We going to love all our enemies
'Til the gorilla falls off the wall
We're going to rock him
We're going to roll him
We're going to teach him that love will make him tall (Somehow)
Aah, pop goes the music
When the big, white rabbit begin to talk
And the colour green will make your best friends leave ya
It'll make them do the walk
But that's cool
'Cause one day, everyday will be a yellow day
And let's play

We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Someway, somehow, I'm going to have fun
