You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as you
Hot desert sun, you can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is well earned
So you best believe

I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)
Turn the page

When you give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
You can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries
(All your worries)
All your miseries
(All your miseries)
You can put them in a little boat and ship them off to sea
'Cause

I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)

I got a thousand hugs and kisses
For when you come back home
Uh, come here!

The world can be
Well to put it frankly
Such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts forever
Is kinda hard to find
Most of the people we know just lookin' for a reason to cry
As long as you got me I got your back and this is why

You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as you
You can lock the door (lock the door)
You better turn off the phone (turn off your phone)
'Cause I'm gonna give you a thousand reasons why we need to be alone
Oh oh
Ooooh oooh
Hey baby
I got a thousand hugs for you
And when you come back home
Sugar baby

I wanna hold you
Tie you up in lace
And I wanna kiss you
Kiss you all over your face
I wanna love you all up and down
Give you love like you never had
Blindfold, gagged, and bound
I'm wanna love you, baby
One time
Two time
Three time

I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
Love you up and love you down
