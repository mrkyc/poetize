No making excuses, i guess i feel like i dont fit
Your speaking but i just dont hear you
Who do you think is listening?, you noticed i didn't
Go figured if you got a minute
Your reaching, im leaving
Dont say i haven't gave you nothing
It's getting just a little creepy, the thoughts of never nothing sleeping
It's hard to say whats on my mind, words always are one step behind
Chorus:
Im waiting on a red light (waiting on a red light)
Sitting on a time bomb (sitting on a time bomb)
Nothing seems to go right (nothing seems to go right)
Im still remaining calm (im still remaining clam)
Walking on a tight-rope emotionally amazed
Acareful execution that slaps me in the face
Im waiting on a red light but still remaing calm
Im fed up, so boring, swimming in a pool of quick sand
Not making a scene, please insert a nervous breakdown
Take a needle stitch my mouth up
Then apply alittle make up, all the stupid things i said
Prssure keeps building everyday
