I was a little shocked that he was right on time
He was really well mannered as he opened my door
He seemed like the man that I've been lookin' for
He took me to a fancy restaurant
And told me to order anything I want
I went to the bathroom and called a couple of friends
And said, "Oh my God, he's such a gentleman"
You wanna have a good time
As he slipped me some wine
And then I started to feel really sleepy
And he had this creepy look in his eyes
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
It won't be worth the costs you paid
This will be a date you'll never forget
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
It won't be worth the costs you paid
This will be a date you'll never forget
I woke in the morning at half past eight
And I couldn't remember what happened to my date
My stomach was woozy and I didn't feel right
I couldn't recall a single thing last night
You might also likeMy best friend Suzie called me on the phone
And said, "Girl, you really had it goin' on"
If you could imagine the fucking look on my face
When I finally realized I was a victim of date rape
I went straight to his work
And shoved his face in the wall
"I hope you had a good time, motherfucker
Now it's time to say goodbye to your balls"
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
It won't be worth the costs you paid
This will be a date you'll never forget
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
It won't be worth the costs you paid
This will be a date you'll never forget
The moral of the story to make myself clear
Is that all you rapist assholes better run with fear
I would think twice before your next date
'Cause you'll just end up someone's bitch in cellblock eight
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
It won't be worth the costs you paid
This will be a date you'll never forget
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
I'll just wake up and break your neck
So don't touch me while I'm sleeping, babe
