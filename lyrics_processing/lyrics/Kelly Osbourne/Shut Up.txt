I don't necessarily agree
Stand up, sit down, be nice
Did ya hear me ask for your advice?
Don't bother trying to tell me your beliefs
Your point of view is pretty screwed to me
Do this, do that, on track
Do me a favor and don't talk back
Round and round, and the conversation
Always ends where it began
Round and round, and I need a vacation
I got a headache from you
Shut up, don't want to hear your voice
Shut up, I'm sick of all the noise
There's nothing you can say that means a damn thing to me
So shut up
Blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah
That's what it sounds like you said to me
You nag and you brag and I gag
There's so much beauty in what we have
You must have better things that you can do
Or does your life revolve around me too
What you want, what I need, oh please
I think you get off hearing yourself speak

Always ends where it began
Round and round and I need a vacation
I got a headache from you
Shut up, don't want to hear your voice
Shut up, I'm sick of all the noise
There's nothing you can say that means a damn thing to me
Shut up, don't want to be polite
It's messed up, how you always think you're right
There's nothing you can say that's gonna change the way I am
So shut up
