Let's get to the point everything you have you dont want
And all you seem to do is want for more
You never hear a word i say
Im wondering what moti-vates
Your self-ish intu-ishion to get your way

All the games you play
Makes everybody run away
Im sitting here just waiting for you to come around

So why you always think that im so retarted
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your lifes not full and your miserable

Where do we go from here
Its getting really hard
To classify your Untolerable behavior
Or is it me
My chance to break the ice
A chance bepends on the roll of the dice
Can you help me under stand what is it you fear
You might also like
Please tell my why
All the games you play
Makes everybody run away
Im sitting here just waiting for you to come around

So why you always think that im so retarted
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your lifes not full and your miserable
Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents i holed dear
So im sorry im still here

All and night
Only few is right
It doesent matter who is wrong or right

So why you always think that im so retarted
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your lifes not full and your miserable
Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents i holed dear
So im sorry im still here
So why you always think that im so retarted
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your lifes not full and your miserable
Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents i holed dear
