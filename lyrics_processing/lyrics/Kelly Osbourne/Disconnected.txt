He knows me just like my mother
My temperamental sides
The reasons I despised
Loving you
So how's it feel to be hung out there
To be the one who doesn't know where
Everything went wrong
And why I wrote this song
Just for you
You used to be my happy ever after
But now I know that nothing is forever
You and me
Was misery
I pushed reset
We disconnected
I used to think you were everything
I would need
But now I know you're the crush
That could'a killed me
Save your breath
'Cause I'm not upset
I'm just over it
And we disconnected
You might also likeDon't look at me like you're confused
And you can't believe I left you
Like you're some amazing prize
That depends whose eyes you're seeing through
'Cos when I see you I'm reminded
Of all the wrongs you never righted
Underneath your cool
Hope you're drowning in a pool
You've fallen in
'Cos you can't swim
You used to be my happy ever after
But now I know that nothing is forever
You and me
Was misery
I pushed reset
We disconnected
I used to think you were everything
I would need
But now I know you're the crush
That could'a killed me
Save your breath
'Cause I'm not upset
I'm just over it
And we disconnected
Take back your rollercoaster of a life
I found a better way to waste my time
Beat it boy I found another
He knows me just like my mother
My tempermental sides
The reasons I despised
Loving you
You used to be my happy ever after
But now I know that nothing is forever
You and me
Was misery
I pushed reset
We disconnected
I used to think you were everything
I would need
But now I know you're the crush
That could'a killed me
Save your breath
'Cause I'm not upset
I'm just over it
