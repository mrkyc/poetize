How can anybody ever change
When the whole world wants you to stay the same?
I guess you just take the blame
Of being someone who had to find her own way

In your dreams you're fabulous
But in your life, ridiculous
See Alice had to go to Wonderland
To sip upon the tea that left her in a trance, yeah

In Suburbia It always stays the same
How can anybody ever change
Uh oh uh oh uh
In Suburbia People never change
When the world wants you to stay the same
Uh oh uh oh uh

Life for you is just a great big game
You have no control and all you feel is shame
Don't try to numb the pain
Tomorrow comes and you will be OK
You might also like

But in your life, ridiculous
