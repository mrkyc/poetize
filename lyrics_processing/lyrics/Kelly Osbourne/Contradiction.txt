I forget all that I saw
I don't feel you anymore
Oh I need you
But I don't need nothing at all
But your kiss
That I don't miss
And your smile
That I defile
And oh your touch
It ticks me off and
Oh your way
It makes me crazy
I don't want you
Do you want me
It's an addiction
The friction
Of contradiction
I love you
I love you
I love you
When you go
You might also likeI love you I love you I love you
So tell me no
I love you I love you I love you
Leave me alone
I hate you I hate you I hate you
I need you so
Tell me more now
But don't let me know too much
The knowledge screws me up
I may want you
But I don't want nothing at all
But your time
When I'm busy
And you're mind
To make me dizzy
I'll be fine
When you don't miss me
You'll be mine
When you don't piss me
Off
Why can't you see right through me
And my addiction for friction and contradiction
I love you
I love you
I love you
When you go
I love you I love you I love you
So tell me no
I love you I love you I love you
Leave me alone
I hate you I hate you I hate you
I need you so
I love you I love you I love you
Get out here
I love you I love you I love you
When you're not near
I love you I love you I love you
You're killing me
I hate you I hate you I hate you
What's wrong with me
(Cuz I don't need nothing at all)
But your kiss
That I don't miss
And your smile
That i defile
And oh your touch
It ticks me off and
Oh your way
It makes me crazy
I don't want you
Do you want me
It's and addiction
The friction
Of contradiction
I love you
I love you
I love you
When you go
I love you I love you I love you
So tell me no
I love you I love you I love you
Leave me alone
I hate you I hate you I hate you
I need you so
I love you I love you I love you
Get out here
I love you I love you I love you
When you're not near
I love you I love you I love you
You're killing me
I hate you I hate you I hate you
