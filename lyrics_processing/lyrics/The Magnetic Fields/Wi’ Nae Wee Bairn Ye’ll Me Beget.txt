Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a nightingale
My song will warm thy heart
Well I'll turn into a threshing machine
And tear thy bird apart

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a vampire
And kiss you on the neck
Well I'll turn into a silver cross
And send thee back to Heck

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
See The Magnetic Fields LiveGet tickets as low as $16You might also likeBut I'll turn into a hydrogen bomb
And atomize the air
Well I'll turn into a cockroach
And you'll see if I care

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a supernova
And burn up everything
Well I'll turn into a black little hole
And you'll turn into string

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into God Himself
And then you'll come to me
Well I will not believe in you
And then where will you be?
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
My ainly pang'll be regret
