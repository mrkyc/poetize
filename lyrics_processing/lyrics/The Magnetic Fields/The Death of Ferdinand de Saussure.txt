I met Ferdinand de Saussure
On a night like this
On love, he said, "I'm not so sure
I even know what it is
No understanding, no closure
It is a nemesis
You can't use a bulldozer
To study orchids", he said, "So

We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love"

I'm just a great composer (clap, clap, clap)
And not a violent man
But I lost my composure
And I shot Ferdinand
Crying, "It's well and kosher
To say you don't understand
But this is for Holland-Dozier-Holland"
His last words were:

"We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love"
His fading words were

"We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
