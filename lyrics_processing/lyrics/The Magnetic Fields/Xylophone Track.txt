I leave my only shoes
To my dear, dear mother
I leave my only shoes
By the time you read this
I will have died of the blues
Scream, little choo-choo
Bang your xylophone track
Keen, stupid choo-choo
Clang your xylophone track
You can wail all night long
But you can't bring her back
(Bring her back
You can't bring her back
Bring her back
You can't bring her back
Bring her back
You can't bring her back)
I've done so much crying (Bring her back)
The flesh has left my bones (You can't bring her back)
I've done so much crying (Bring her back)
The flesh has left my bones (You can't bring her back)
I can play my ribcage (Bring her back)
