Too gold, too blue
You took the truth
I cried, you flew

You called me mad (And I am mad)
As a hatter
Some fall in love (Some fall in love)
I shatter
You make it rain
Too bleak, too stark
Should night not fall
You make things dark

You called me mad (And I am mad)
As a hatter
Some fall in love (Some fall in love)
I shatter
Bang, here am I
No one, nowhere
No ground, no sky
No light, no air
