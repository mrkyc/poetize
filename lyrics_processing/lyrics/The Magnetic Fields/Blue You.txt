The stars in the sky harmonized singing it too
And I, far below was singing low and slow for you
And I know all the world was singing the blues
The Queen was singing the blues
The President played the saxophone sounded so alone
It was on the news
And from Ursa Minor in what looked like an all night diner
Came lonely luminous creatures whose only human feature
Was singing the blues soft and low
The blues was singing the blues
The dead in their graves and the Gods in their caves
