You wanna know
If we fell in love too fast
You wanna know
If this is, well, too good to last

You're asking the wrong questions
You're opening the wrong doors
I love you, I can't touch you anymore

I can't touch you anymore
There's so much to hate you for
I love you, I can't touch you anymore

You want to tell me
Fifty ways you've left your lovers
You want to tell me
How you loved two hundred others

You're asking the wrong questions
You're opening the wrong doors
I love you, I can't touch you anymore
