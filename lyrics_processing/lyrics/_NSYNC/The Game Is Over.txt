Ah yeah
Oh yeah

Invincible
Is what you think you are
But that's so typical
Though you think that you're a star
You act like everyone (everyone)
Revolves around you
Baby, you drop the ball (drop the ball)
And now the game is through

'Cause you tried to play both sides (both sides)
You got caught up in your lies (in your lies...)
And now you're runnin', you're runnin' out of time

You played yourself (game over, game)
But did you, did you think that you can really find love on someone else? (Game over, game)
You're makin' moves, you're gonna lose
You know you played yourself (game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again 'cause the game is over

Take it personal
'Cause I did when you cheated on me
You may be beautiful
But there's more that the eye can't see
You're so predictable
The way you calculate each move
Heads I win, tails you lose
Because you don't have the right to choose

'Cause you tried to play both sides (both sides)
You got caught up in your lies (in your lies...)
And now you're runnin', you're runnin' out of time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You played yourself (game over, game)
(Ooh)
But did you, did you think that you can really find love on someone else? (Game over, game)
You're makin' moves, you're gonna lose
You know you played yourself (game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again 'cause the game is over (yeah)
How could you think that you could do me like that?
Runnin' behind my back
How could you do me like that? (do me like that)
Now the game is over (oh)
How could you think that you could do me like that?
Do me like that?
Do me like that?...

Played yourself (oh)
But did you, did you think that you can really find love on someone else? (girl, you thought)
You're makin' moves, you're gonna lose
You know you played yourself (played yourself)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
(Thinkin' you can get one by me)
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again 'cause the game is over (oh, oh)
You played yourself (oh oh)
But did you, did you think that you can really find love on someone else? (find love)
You're makin' moves, you're gonna lose (oh oh oh)
You know you played yourself (you know you played yourself)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
(Thinkin' you can get one by me)
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again 'cause the game is over
