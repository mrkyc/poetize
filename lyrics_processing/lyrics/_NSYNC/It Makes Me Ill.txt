I was hangin' with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hopin' that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh!
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by lookin' that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back

Call me a hater, if you  want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (ain't right)
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to
That's true-- I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside (inside)
'Cause I can't see you with another guy

It makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him

Girl, I know that we broke up
But that doesn't mean you should give the cold shoulder
'Cause you know that I truly do adore ya
And that other guy can't do nothin' for ya
(Can't do nothin' for ya)
Uh, see
I can tell that you don't really love that guy
But there's no need for you to go and waste your time
I think you know I love ya more
Girl, you gotta let him go
I want you, so just give him the boot

Call me a hater, if you want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (ain't right)
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to
That's true-- I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside (All: inside)
