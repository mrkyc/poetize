Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
You know I like you, right?
But would you be my girlfriend?
Listen

I don't know why you care
(Why you thinkin' 'bout him, mama?)
He doesn't even know you're there
(He ain't even paying attention)
No, no
'Cause he don't love your eyes (nah)
And he don't love your smile (nah)
Girl, you know that ain't fair (c'mon)

In the middle of the night (mmm)
Is he gonna be by your side? (no, no)
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby, when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

Girl, you should be my girlfriend

Does he know what you feel
(Does he know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real? Yeah (are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind (nah)
Or does he break your stride? (c'mon)
Did you know that love could be a shield? Yeah

In the middle of the night (oh)

Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea, oh
So why don't you be my girlfriend? (yeah, yeah)
