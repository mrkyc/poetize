Waiting
For your piece of the pie to drop out of the sky
(Gotta go get it)
Hesitating
For somebody else to run and pass you by
(But you never get your time)

There ain't no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life (do your thing)
There ain't no excuse for comin' up short
The ball is in your court
So reach up and touch the sky

Are you doing your thing and doing it well?
Are they looking at you, hating
Saying, 'ooh'?
Are you doing your thing and doing it good?
Do your thing, thing
Do your thing, thing oh (do your thing)

Do your thing...
Ooh... (oh...)
You might also like
Keeping
Yourself from taking on your perfect dream
(You gotta free your mind)
And being
Something somewhere that you read in a magazine
(But you never let you shine)

There ain't no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life (do your thing)
There ain't no excuse for coming up short
The ball is in your court
So reach up and touch the sky

Are you doing your thing and doing it well?
Are they looking at you, hating
Saying, 'ooh'?
Are you doing your thing and doing it good?
Do your thing, thing
Do your thing, thing oh
Are you doing your thing and doing it well?
Are they looking at you, hating
Saying, 'ooh'?
Are you doing your thing and doing it good?
Do your thing, thing
(Believe can't nobody do it better than you)
Do your thing, thing
(Believe can't nobody do it better than you)
Are you doing your thing well?
Are you letting your dreams come alive?
Are you doing your thing good?
Believe can't nobody do it better than you
(Can't nobody do it better, yeah)
Believe can't nobody do it better than you

Gotta run, gotta break, gotta go
Gotta take everything that I bring
Never did fall
Gotta hump, gotta bump, never sit, never stop
Never quit on a swell of a lump, ah
If you really want it bad
You can't ever drag your feet to the beat
Of the sound of defeat
Even if you got heat, whoa
Never take your mind off of the beat, so

(There ain't no excuse)
There ain't no excuse for losing your feet (losing your feet)
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life (do your thing)
There ain't no excuse for coming up short (do your thing)
The ball is in your court
So reach up and touch the sky (sky, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Are you doing your thing and doing it well?
Are they looking at you, hating
Saying, 'ooh'? (ooh)
Are you doing your thing and doing it good?
Do your thing, thing
(Believe can't nobody do it better than you)
Do your thing, thing, oh oh oh
(Believe can't nobody do it better than you)
Are you doing your thing and doing it well?
Are they looking at you, hating
Saying, 'ooh'?
