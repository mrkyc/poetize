You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you, up, up against the wall
Uh, alright
Two-step, uh

I was just doing my thing
Hangin' out at the spot
You know the place we go
The music's John Blaze hot
And everybody was feelin' the DJ (the DJ)
The smoke cleared
And I saw this beautiful lady

The lights went low
And the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow
And you know what happens now
The girl was fine
And she knew she had game
What more do I have to say?

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grindin'
Shawty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up
When she had me up against the wall

It's almost two o'clock
It's time to make my move
The after hour spot
Is where I'm going to
'Cause I've gotta have some more
I'm lookin' for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me, I see
A fine young lady's eying me

The lights are low
And her friends were all around
I walked up to her slow
And you know what happens now
She turned around
And she worked in the worst way (the worst way)
What more do I have to say?
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grindin'
Shawty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up
When she had me up against the wall
(Shawty had me up against the wall)

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Whose the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball
The disco ball, the disco ball
Standing next to strobe lights
Dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night
Out at night (night, night)

What more do I have to say?
(Two-step)

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grindin'
Shawty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up (at all)
When she had me up against the wall (ooh yeah)
She took my hand (oh)
We never said a word at all
We started grindin'
Shawty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up (at all)
When she had me up against the wall
I just got caught up
When you had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see ya up, up against the wall
We don't (ooh, oh oh)
We don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall

We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
