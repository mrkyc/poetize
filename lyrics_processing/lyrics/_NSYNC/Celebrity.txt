If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me?
If I didn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity?

(Lately)
I've done a little thinking
'Bout the things that satisfy you
It's making me wonder
'Bout the things that you, you see in me
I hate the way you like to say
Your man's a (celebrity)
Baby, what's the deal?
I thought you wanted me for me

(You gotta)
Say what you mean
(You gotta)
Mean what you say
('Cause you keep)
Pushing me away
'Cause I ain't got no time to play
So I say
You might also like
If I wasn't a celebrity (oh)
Would you be so nice to me?
If I didn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
(Baby) If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity?

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity

I'm glad that you are having a good time
Living the life that I made out for me
'Causing the splurges
Spending my money on everything you see
See it would be different
If you had something, maybe like a J-O-B
You need to get your thing together, yeah

(You gotta)
Stop running games
(Just sayin')
It ain't about my fame
('Cause you know)
If things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago
So I say
If I wasn't a celebrity (yeah)
Would you be so nice to me? (yeah)
If I didn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me?
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity? (yeah)

If you really love me
You try and show me
That it ain't even 'bout my name ('bout my name)
But you tried to use me
And lied to fool me
So we can never be the same (be the same)
So now I'm leaving you behind
I found somebody
Who can love me for me and that's all I need, yeah

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
If I wasn't a celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity (oh woah, woah, oh...)
If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me? (if I wasn't a celebrity)
(Oh)
If I didn't have cheese like everyday (can you tell me?)
Would you still wanna be with me?
(Would you still wanna be with me?)
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings (diamond rings)
And all those other expensive things (hey yeah)
(Expensive things)
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity? (if I wasn't a celebrity)
If I wasn't a celebrity (celebrity, yeah)
(Oh) Would you be so nice to me? (celebrity, yeah)
If I didn't have cheese like everyday
(If I didn't have cheese like everyday, yeah)
Would you still wanna be with me? (still wanna be with me?)
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
(And all those other expensive things)
Would you be so into me (no no no)
If I wasn't a celebrity? (celebrity)

If I wasn't a celebrity
(If I wasn't a celebrity)
Would you be so nice to me?
(Would you still wanna be with me?)
If I didn't have cheese like everyday
(If I wasn't a)
Would you still wanna be with me?

If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
(If I couldn't buy no diamond rings)
And all those other expensive things
(Would you still wanna be with me?)
Would you be so into me
