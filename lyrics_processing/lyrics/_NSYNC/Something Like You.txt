Yeah
Oh oh

So many times
I thought I had it in my hands
But just like grains of sand
Love slipped through my fingers
And so many nights
I asked the Lord above
Please make me lucky enough
To find a love that lingers

Something keeps telling me
That you could be my answered prayer
You must be heaven sent, I swear...
'Cause

Something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true, this is what God has meant for me?
'Cause baby, I can't believe
That something like you could happen to me
You might also like
Hey yeah
Something like you

Girl in your eyes
I feel your fire burn (feel your fire burn...)
Oh, your secrets I will learn
Even if it takes forever
With you by my side
I can do anything (can do anything)
I don't care what tomorrow brings
As long as we're together

My heart is telling me
That you could be my 'meant to be'
I know it more each time we touch
'Cause

Something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak (yeah)
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak (no no no no)
Could it be true, this is what God has meant for me?
'Cause baby, I can't believe
That something like you could happen to me
Something magical (something magical)
Something spiritual (something spiritual)
Something stronger than the two of us alone, yeah
Something physical
Something undeniable (something undeniable)
Nothing like anything (anything)
That I've ever known...
'Cause

(Something)
Something happens when you look at me
(Happens)
I forget to speak (something happens, baby)
(Something)
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
(Happens)
My knees get so weak (oh...)
(Could it be)
Could it be true, this is what God has meant for me?
(You were meant for me?)
'Cause baby, I can't believe, no, woah
That something like you (something like you...)
Something like you
That something like you could happen to me
Something happened
Yeah hey
Ooh..., hmm...
Can't believe that you happened to me
