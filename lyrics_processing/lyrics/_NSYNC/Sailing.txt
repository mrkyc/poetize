Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right, you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby, believe me, oh
It's not far to Never Never Land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby, believe me, oh

Sailing (takes me away)
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
I heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me (soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free, yeah

Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing, sailing
All caught up in a reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me? Oh
You might also like
Sailing (takes me away)
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
(Takes me away to where I wanna be)
I heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me (soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby, believe me, oh

Sailing (takes me away)
Takes me away (takes me away)
To where I've always heard it could be (I heard it could be)
I heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me (soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free, free
Sailing (takes me away)
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
(I heard it could be)
I heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me (soon I will be free)
