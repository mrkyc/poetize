Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

It's not easy to be alone
It's not easy to fall in love
Every night
I just get down and pray
That you'll come my way, yeah
I never had a girl like you (girl like you)
I never know what love could do
Wish you'd come
Baby, and set me free
I can't let it be, yeah, hey hey

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you
You might also like
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

I'm waiting for the phone to ring
And all the wonder love should bring
All the things
Darling, I've left behind
Please give me a sign
A little smile would light my life
And a single touch would blow my mind
Girl, you know
And now you got to be mine
'Til the end of time

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you
Wherever I go
Whatever I do
My heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go (wherever I go)
Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

Oooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ain't nowhere, your love
