Oh oh
Hold on
Uh, you know what?
Can we back it up just a little bit?
I said, "why?"
I said, "why?" (All: why?)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh oh
Yeah, yeah

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
It couldn't be more right
We are what they call a 'perfect match'
Somethin' that you can't touch
Down to the last bone, you're my baby

But too be honest, there's just one thing
A part that is missin'
You don't seem to care at all...

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me?
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you?
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I suppose to do right now?
Why can't you love me?
Why? Tell me, my baby
You might also like
Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong?
Now I'm hearin' that you're seein' someone new
And I wanna know who
But does he love like I do? My baby...

But I promise you this one thing
Whatever that's missin'
I will make it up to you
So tell me, baby now

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me?
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you?
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I suppose to do right now?
Why can't you love me?
Why? Tell me, my baby

Gettin' under my skin
Messin' up my mind
Never lettin' me in (All: to your life and)
Tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me?
And how I'm suppose to live without
If there is no way
To make you feel the same way too?
You...
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
We are what they all call a 'prefect match'

Tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me?
(How come you don't wanna?)
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you? (without you?)
Tell me, tell me just how (tell me how)
What am I suppose to do right now?
Why can't you love me?
(So tell me, why can't you fall in love with me?...)
Tell me, tell me, baby (oh baby)
How come you don't wanna love me?
(How come you don't wanna?)
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you? (without you?)
Tell me, tell me just how (oh, oh oh)
What am I suppose to do right now? (what am I suppose to do?)
Why can't you love me?
Tell, tell, tell me why?
Tell, tell, tell me
Oh oh oh (yeah)
Tell, tell, tell me, yeah
Oh oh
Said, tell me, baby
Tell, tell, tell me, yeah
