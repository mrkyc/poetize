Yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh
Mmmh...

I don't know how
I don't know why
But girl, it seems you've touched my life
You're in my dreams
You're in my heart
I'm not myself when we're apart
Something strange has come over me
A raging wind across my seas
And girl, you know that your eyes are to blame
And what am I suppose to do (suppose to do)
If I can't get over you? (get over you?)
And come to find that you don't feel the same

'Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too...
I've been falling, falling
Ever since the moment
I laid eyes on you...

Falling, falling, falling
When I laid eyes on you...
Falling, falling, falling
Yeah

I lose my step
I lose my ground
I lose myself when you're around
I'm holding on for my life
To keep from drowning in your eyes
Girl, what have to done to me (yeah...)
To make me fall so desperately?
To think that I don't even know your name
No no
And how am I suppose to live (suppose to live)
If I can't get over this? (get over this?)
And you decide that you don't feel the same, yeah...

'Cause I'm '(cause I'm) falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too...
I've been falling, falling
Falling
Will you stay or will you go?
Heaven
Heaven knows what my future holds
Questions
Questions linger on my mind
Daybreak
From daybreak to dark of night
I'm falling
I don't know what's come over me
Can't you see (can't you see)

That I'm falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too, yeah, hey, hey, yeah...
Falling, falling
Ever since the moment
I laid eyes on you

Oh...
