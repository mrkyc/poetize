Oh oh oh
Right now, babe
Soon as the stars shine
I'm gonna make you mine
Oh baby

You got it
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes
You got it
I need it
Your love is what makes my heartbreak

Let me tell you how I feel
I need your lovin', girl, give it to me
Never met a girl like you
I know you like the crazy things we'll do
(The crazy things we'll do)

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries, there's no pain (pain...)
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust
Girl, just give me all you got...
'Cause girl, you got the love I need
You might also like

I'll do whatever it takes (whatever it takes)
You got it (you got it)

Your love is what makes my heartbreak (break...)

You, you, you got it (yeah)
(Oh oh oh)
You, you, you got it
Lance: Ba
Joey: Ba

You are in my dreams at night
Whatever I do, you're always on my mind
I can't wait until the day
When you and me are one in love this day

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries, there's no pain (ooh ooh...)
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far (ooh...)
If you feel true love and trust
