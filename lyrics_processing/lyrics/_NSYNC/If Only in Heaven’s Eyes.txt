Ooh
Oh yeah

I never thought you were
A fair-weather friend
You never let me down
You're true to the end
You're in the darkest hour, when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me, for you
And you should know

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
(Things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (Joey: losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(JC: Someday), someday, you'll see (you'll see)
If only through heaven's eyes (eyes)
Only through heaven's (oh)

I still remember
The things that you said
I keep your worth alive
I could never forget
'Cause in the final hour, you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
You told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth
And you should know
You might also like
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
(Things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (Joey: losing you)
(Oh)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday), someday, you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes (eyes)
Only through heaven's eyes

And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering them all (them all)
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all
And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world
Be strong
JC: Strong
Chris: Strong
Justin: Strong
Lance: Strong

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
(Things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (Joey: losing you)
(Ain't worth losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday), someday, you'll see (you'll see)
If only through heaven's eyes (eyes)
Only through heaven's
(Through heaven's eyes, heaven's eyes)
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
(Only, only, only)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losing you, losing you)
(Oh yeah)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday, someday)
Someday, you'll see (you'll see, you'll see)
If only through heaven's eyes (eyes)
Only through heaven's (through heaven's eyes)
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
(Wasn't worth the things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losing you, losing you)
(Oh)
