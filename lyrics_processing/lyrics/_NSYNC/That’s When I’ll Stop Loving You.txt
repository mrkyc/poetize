When winter comes in summer (mm-hmm...)
When there's no more forever... (hey yeah)
That's when I'll stop lovin' you...
(That's when I'll stop lovin' you)

I'm sure you've heard these words before
And I know it's hard
For you to trust them once more
You're afraid it all might end
And a broken heart
Is scared of breaking again

But you've gotta believe me
I'll never leave you
You'll never cry long as I am there
And I will always be there
You will never be without love

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth...
Oh, you'll know then, baby
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop lovin' you...
(That's when I'll stop lovin' you, yeah)
You might also like
Long as sunlight lights the sky
Light of love will be
Found in these eyes of mine (these eyes of mine...)
And I will shine that light for you
You're the only one
I'll ever give this heart to

What I'm trying to say is (to say...)
Nothing will change this
There'll be no time you won't find me there
'Cause I will always be there
You will always have all my love...

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever (hey yeah, yeah, yeah)
When lies become the truth... (oh...)
Oh, you'll know then, baby
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop lovin' you...
(That's when I'll stop lovin' you)

When this world doesn't turn anymore
When the stars all decide to stop shinin'...
'Til then I'm gonna be by your side
I'm gonna be lovin' you forever
Everyday of my life (ah....baby)
Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well you'll know then, baby
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop lovin' you...

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth... (become the truth, yeah)
Well you'll know then, baby
That's when I'll stop lovin' (that's when I'll stop lovin')
That's when I'll stop lovin' you... (oh...yeah)
When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth...
(Well you'll know then, baby) That's when I'll stop lovin'
(That's when I'll stop, babe)
That's when I'll stop lovin' you...

That's when I'll stop, babe
I'll stop, babe
