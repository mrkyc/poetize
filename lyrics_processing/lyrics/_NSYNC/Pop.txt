Dirty pop
(Yo, BT)

Sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about
"What's the deal with this pop life
And when is it gonna fade out?"
The thing you got to realize what we're doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of melody
We're gonna bring it 'til the end, c'mon now

It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go, and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
Come on, now

Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (You can't stop)
And the music's all you got (C'mon now)
(Wade Robson: This must be)
Pop
You might also like
Dirty pop
B-baby, baby, you can't stop
I know you like this dirty pop
(Wade Robson: This must be)

(Now, now, now, now, n-n-n-n)
Now, why you wanna try to classify
The type of thing that we do?
'Cause we're just fine doin' what we like
Can we say the same for you?
Tired of feelin' all around me animosity
Just worry about yours 'cause I'ma get mine
Now, people, can't you see?

It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect, oh
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go, and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
C'mon
Do you ever wonder why (Why)
This music gets you high? (Gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your (Feel it when your) body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (You can't stop)
And the music's all you got (Baby, c'mon)
(Wade Robson: This must be)

Ooh...
Man, I'm tired of singin'

Dirty, dirty, dirty pop!
Dirty pop
Do you ever wonder, wonder, wonder, won-?
(BT)

(Oh) Do you ever wonder why
(Ever wonder why?)
This music gets you high? (Gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your (Feel it when your) body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (Baby, don't stop)
And the music's all you got (C'mon, now)
(Wade Robson: This must be)
Do you ever wonder why
(Do you ever wonder)
This music gets you high?
(How it gets you so high, baby?)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your (Feel it when your) body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop
And the music's all you got
(Wade Robson: This must be)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Do you ever wonder why
(Ever wonder why?)
This music gets you high?
(Music gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your (When your) body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (You can't stop)
And the music's all you got (Baby, c'mon)
(Wade Robson: This must be)
