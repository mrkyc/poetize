Baby, you're not the only one
Oh, ooh ooh
Oh yeah, yeah
Hey yeah

I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of...

Baby, you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached
You might also like
He doesn't give you the kind of attention
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)
'Cause he always looks around
His eyes wander 'round
He doesn't see you like I see, yeah

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
Baby, I would give you love
The kind of love that you'd only dreamed of, yeah

Baby, you're not the only one
(Baby, you're the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
(Hurt in the past)
But if you want it, here's my heart
(Here's my heart)
No strings attached

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
So if you want to take a chance with me...
Lance: Ah...
Joey: Ah...
Justin: Ah...
JC: Ah...
Chris: Ah... (JC: Oh, oh oh)

If you (baby) take a chance with me
(Take a chance with me)
I'll be everything you need (everything you need)
Because it's our destiny... (oh)

Baby, you're not the only one
(Baby, you're not the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
(To be, to be afraid)
And I know that you've hurt in the past
(Hurt in the past)
But if you want it, here's my heart
(Here's my heart)
No strings attached (oh oh)
Baby, you're not the only one
(Baby, you're not the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
(You don't have to be afraid)
And I know that you've hurt in the past
(Know that you're hurting)
But if you want it, here's my heart
(If you want, here's my heart)
