Hey
Oh oh

You drive a pretty car
You know how fine you are and
Nobody needs to say it, no way
They love the clothes you wear
They compliment you and I
Just love the way you play it

But the only thing you dream of
Money can't buy for you, oh
And in my dreams
I'll make your wish come true

(For the) For the girl who has everything
I bring (I bring) you love (hey)
I bring you love
'Cause the girl who has everything
Can't get enough (enough)
Of my love
You might also like
Why do you run and hide?
Say what you feel inside and (say what you feel)
Why must you always fake it? No way
Girl, you need to understand
Your heart's safe within my hands
And I promise I'll never break it, woah, woah, woah

I know that you still dream of
What money can buy for you
And in my dreams
I'll make your wish come true

(For the) For the girl who has everything
I bring (I bring) you love (woah)
I bring you love (I bring you love)
'Cause the girl who has everything (oh baby)
Can't get enough (can't get enough of my love)
My love

If you just let me try
My baby, listen
I'll help you find
What you've been missing (oh yeah)
You gotta listen to your heart
And not your mind
(Oh oh oh baby, yeah)
For the girl who has everything (everything)
I bring you love (I bring you love...)
I bring you love (I bring you love, yeah)
'Cause the girl who has everything
Can't get enough (can't get enough...)
(Can't get enough)
My love (of my love)
For the girl who has everything
(I can't, 'cause you want my love)
(And I'm gonna give it to ya) I bring you love (woah)
I bring you love
'Cause the girl who has everything (oh yeah)
(Oh baby)
Can't get enough (woah)
