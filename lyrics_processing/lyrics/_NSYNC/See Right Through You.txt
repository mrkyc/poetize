Tell me, what can kind of girl would wanna play me?
Tear me down, then try to break me?
Baby, how could you betray me
After all I've done for you
Took you there, bought you this, now it's not enough, babe
You better get your story straight, babe
Tell me why you wanna play

These games, they gotta stop (oh)
I'm 'bout to get pissed off (ooh yeah)
You had to keep leading me on
Baby, you thought you had me fooled but I see through you

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
You see a man who thought you loved me
You played me like a fool but I see right through you
I look into your eyes
I'll tell you what I see
I see a girl who ran game on me
You thought you had me fooled but I see right through you
