It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you (Hey)

Baby, I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much, but baby, we can win

Let it go
If you want me, girl, let me know
I am down on my knees
I can't take it anymore

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Oh, alright

Baby, don't misunderstand (Don't misunderstand)
What I'm tryin' to tell ya
In the corner of my mind (Corner of my mind...)
Baby, it feels like we're runnin' out of time

Let it go
If you want me, girl, let me know
I am down on my knees
I can't take it anymore
Oh, oh, baby

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
Tearin' up my heart and soul (Alright)
We're apart, I feel it, too (I feel it, too)
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
(Tearin' up my heart and soul)
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
(We're apart, I feel it, too)
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
