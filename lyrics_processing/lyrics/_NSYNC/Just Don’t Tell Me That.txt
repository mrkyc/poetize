Oh oh, no no
Alright

You like to be seen at
Every party at the Playboy Mansion
Fun, sad
I know I gotta draw the line
You wanna be in the flashes of light (of light)
Holding me tight (tight)
With your phony laugh
I guess you gotta be photographed

You can say it's real
But I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me
That it's gonna be your last lie
No, baby I won't fall for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that
You might also like
You like to drive in my Jag
And spend every dollar of my credit
Baby, guess what
Hit me with your golden eye?
I guess you wanna be part of the ride
Live for the night
But I've seen it through
I've had enough of being close to you

You can say it's real
But I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me
That it's gonna be your last lie
No, baby I won't fall for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that
No no
It's not about love
(Not about love)
No no

You wanna be in the flashes of light (of light)
Holding me tight (tight)
Girl, it's all up to you
But whatever you do
I don't wanna hear it

You're not gonna love me
I won't go for that
It just won't happen
Even if you say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love

Just don't tell me that (that)
You were gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
Baby, you don't have to tell me
That it's gonna be your last lie
No, now baby I won't fall for that
Even if you did say (even if you did say)
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
