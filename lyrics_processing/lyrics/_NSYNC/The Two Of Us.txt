Uh
Oh oh oh
Hey yeah, yeah

Girl, when we started, baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairytale is gonna end
See I was thinking that it clicked one day
(Clicked one day)
That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you, girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything that I've been feeling deep inside
And listen good 'cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready...

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call
'Cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl, it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute baby, I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us
The two of us
'Cause in a room full of people, you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby, I'll be there
Telling you I care, this I swear
Girl, it's just the two of us
The two of us
You might also like
Baby, I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through
I sent you flowers on a Saturday (Saturday)
Inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling knowin' I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say (ooh ooh)
Just take a chance (take a chance)

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call
'Cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl, it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute baby, I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us
The two of us
'Cause in a room full of people, you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby, I'll be there
Telling you I care, this I swear
Girl, it's just the two of us
The two of us
It just gets better with each day
(Maybe someday...)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid...

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (waiting for your call)
'Cause tonight we're gonna do it all (gonna do it all)
Girl, it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute baby, I was thinking we could hook up
(Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah)
It's just the two of us
The two of us
'Cause in a room full of people, you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby, I'll be there
Telling you I care, this I swear (I swear)
Girl, it's just the two of us
The two of us

Oh oh oh
