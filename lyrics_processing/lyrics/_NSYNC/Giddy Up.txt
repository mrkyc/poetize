Gotta giddy up
(Yeah, *NSYNC, giddy up)

(Come on, just drop the verse)
Gotta giddy up

Tried to get ahold of you last night
Called you on the phone
Thinking to myself, 'something ain't right'
Girl, were you alone?
Letting little things come between us
All we do is fuss
When all I wanna do is show you love

So I say, hold up
I'm tired of all these lies, yeah, yeah
Hold up
And if you wanna make things right (that's right)
Hold up
I'm tired of all these lies
Hold up
'Cause if you wanna make things right
You've got to giddy up

Giddy up, giddy up (I gotta giddy up, giddy up)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up now
Giddy up, giddy up, gotta giddy up (oh...)

Remembering the way we used to be
Everything was cool
And now you've gone all this to me, babe (to me)
Maybe we can turn this love around
Give it one more try
You see, every time you're thinkin' about sayin', 'goodbye'

I gotta say, hold up
I'm tired of all these lies
Hold up
And if you wanna make things right (that's right)
Hold up
I'm tired of all these lies
Hold up
'Cause if you wanna make things right
You've got to
