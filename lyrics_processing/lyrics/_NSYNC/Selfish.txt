I just don't understand
Why you're runnin' from a good man, baby
Why you wanna turn your back on love
Why you've already given up
See I know you've been hurt before
But I swear I'll give you so much more
I swear I'll never let you down
'Cause I swear it's you that I adore

And I can't help myself, babe
'Cause I think about you constantly
And my heart gets no rest over you
You, you, yeah, yeah

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
And you can call me hopeless
(Hopeless...) Baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you?
(To prove that I'm the only one)
So what's wrong with bein' selfish?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
I'll be takin' up your time
'Til the day I make you realize (Realize)
That for you, there could be no one else
I've just gotta have you for myself (For myself...)
Baby, I will take good care of you (Good care...)
No matter what it is you're goin' through
I'll be there for you when you're in need
Baby, believe in me

'Cause if love is a crime, hey yeah
Then punish me, I would die for you
'Cause I don't want to live without you
What can I do? Oh oh

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
And you can call me hopeless
(Hopeless...) Baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you?
(To prove that I'm the only one)
Why do you keep us apart?
Why won't you give up your heart?
You know that we're meant to be together
And why do you push me away?
All that I want is to give you love
Forever and ever and ever...
(Forever and ever and ever...)

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopeless
(Hopeless...) Hopeless
Because I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you?
(To prove that I'm the only one) Oh

Selfishly I'm (hey yeah)
In love with you (oh)
'Cause I've searched my soul
(Searched my soul, baby)
And know that it's you
Selfishly I'm (selfishly I'm)
In love with you
'Cause I've searched my soul
(Searched my soul down deep inside)
And know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
(I'm so in love with you)
'Cause I've searched my soul
And know that it's you
I'll prove that I'm the only one for you
So what's wrong with being selfish, selfish, selfish?
