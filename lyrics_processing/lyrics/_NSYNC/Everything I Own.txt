You sheltered me from harm
You kept me warm
You kept me warm...
And you gave my life to me
You set me free
You set me free...

The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I will give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What a time
What a time...
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you...
You might also like
And nobody else could ever knew
(Nobody else could ever knew)
The part of me that can't let go...

And I will give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
(Said, I would give everything)
I would give everything I own (everything I own)
Just to have you (just to have you)
Back again

Is there someone you know
Loving them so
But taking them all for granted? Hey yeah...
You may lose them one day (JC: lose them one day)
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear
The words you long to say... (JC: long to say, 'ay... yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give up my life
Give up my heart...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything I own
Everything I own (I own)
Everything I own
Everything I own (everything I own)

You know, baby?
My love for you will always be true
That's right
Because there is no me without you

I would give everything I own (without you, baby)
Everything I own
Nobody can love you, love you, love you, love you like I do...

And I will give everything I own (everything I own)
(Everything I own...)
I'd give up my life, my heart (my life, my heart)
My home (my home...)
(Baby)
I would give everything I own (everything)
(Give up my heart...)
(Everything I own)
Just to have you back again
