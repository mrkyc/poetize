I hear them saying listen to me brother, when you're not strong
I can carry that load on
Listen to my words and keep them in mind
Don't let that devil sneak up behind you
Listen to me now, and look to the sky
You can see me if you open up your eyes
Listen to me brother, I'm holding out my hand
Reach out and take it if you can
I know it won't be long til the morning
And I can feel it coming
It won't be long
But now I'm caught
Between midnight and the dawn
I hear them saying listen to me child, don't be afraid
I'm right here beside you all the way
Listen to me child, everything is all right
All you've got to do is keep walking to the light
I know it won't be long til the morning
And I can feel it coming
It won't be long
But now I'm caught
Between midnight and the dawn

Between midnight..
Yes I'm caught between midnight...
I know it won't be long
