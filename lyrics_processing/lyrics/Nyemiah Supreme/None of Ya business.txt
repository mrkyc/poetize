Supremacy
Yeah
Ha
Uh ha, Uh ha, Uh ha
B-A-D
You gotta get a grip
Runnin' round worried bout who I'm gon rip
Where I'm getting stick
Really ain't none of ya business(mind ya business)
Look
Now if I wanna go and hit a shorty that I know (Okay)
Why you think you got the right to really even know (You don't)
If I ain't ya mother, daughter, cousin, or your auntie
You're just mad cause you want me (I think you just mad)
Relationship is two, but you, making it three
Acting Like you really care, but you, just tryna be
All up in my mix
Messin' up my shit cause you ain't got nobody to hit
Let's switch
He can't stand me but he gone double stand me
Got two families and worried 'bout my panties
All up in my shit, with ya baby mom's hit
Talkin' bout yo' Liss is that even ya' kid?
If you worries bout yourself ain't no time for me
Ain't no matter who I crush it ain't a crime you see
It's certain rules that don't apply when you're a dude
And you ain't a girl so don't tell me what you would do

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of Ya Business
And if she wanna be a freak n' selling on the weekend
It's none of Ya business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skin to
It's none of ya business
So don't try to change my mind
I tell you all the time
It's none of ya business
Look what you do to the girl that's loving you
Steppin' on her with the bottom of your shoe
It's different cus I'm a girl
I wish that I can flip the visions of all the world
It's different cus I'm a chick
I keep tryna explain it, but this shit they wouldn't get
They want lip but not if it's real shit
Gossip, gossip you really gotta stop it
You got your foot in your mouth so put a sock with it
Are you bored with your life you got too much time
Get yours instead of being in mine
And if I got problems, you can't solve 'em
Clocking me, jocking me, blogging me
Don't even know me but you're looking for monogamy
Stop it B
Chorus
When the tables turn
They will learn
