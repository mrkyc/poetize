If you black, this is not for you
If you white, this is not for you
But if you a thorough bitch, this is for you

Come closer, baby, don't move
I ain't spit a lie in my rhyme, I'm so true
Lil' Polly Pocket, Minnie me's won't throw
The long blonde Don, with shades, I'm Jane doe
Uh uh uh
In Queen's, I'm that bitch
Got the hair on may's pics, they cream with black stitch
I love with I'm saying, "Supreme, you that bitch."
The ball is so hard, they grabbing they tip
Leave niggas embarrassed, Simon I say so
Give me your bank card, whatever I say go
Been hitting' niggas up since we were wearing Girbaud
I still don't want your money, just don't wanna spend my dough
I bet I take, that nigga, talkin' showin' my figures
Matte black Sedan, with all of my bitches
V.I.P too small, I need somethin' bigger
It's on, we break down your wall, then we turn up

Why the sad face, I though about it?
Y'all niggas broke, not a dollar
Can't blame us, we not the problem
All we tryna do is, turn up

Are you with me, take it off
Lights on, pants off
The ass off, back off, this ain't a knock off
32, 20's, 6 40, got your niggas lockjaw
Roll the reefer, roll the pop, roll the kush
My mama listenin', lemme stop
Take a shot of Ciroc, turn up
Takin shots at Supreme, get your ass, burned up
I don't even talk unless I'm gettin' payed
NYC, top down, cruising down the runway
Rather be the boss talking' crazy
The blonde, long braid, you see me, turn up

Why the sad face, I though about it?
Y'all niggas broke, not a dollar
Can't blame us, we not the problem
All we tryna do is, turn up

You ain't know, I'm an Alabama nigga
Got worldwide paper for long hair bitches
So why not pose and take a pic for the press
All these O's, what is it worth, can you guess?
 Nah nigga, you ain't got my finesse, you ain't got my fa-sass, fuck outta here, kiss ass, this all year, too bad
This time is to pay off, town down in the Jag, decided to take the day off
Just to lay off, cook it well, let's break the bread, my nigga go get your weight up
I'll never leave the house without the burner
I'll never know when a nigga might try to turn up
Why the sad face, I though about it?
Y'all niggas broke, not a dollar
Can't blame us, we not the problem
All we tryna do is, turn up
