Supremacy
Ha, I told him meet me by the AMG
Pull switch, ain't nobody playing me
A chess game, You just a rook and i could get a peddle up
Queen crown, queens down we hopping out the jeep now
We deep now, the team wyle, Supremacy  like 3 thous
????? on the mic i tell him beat it
And he calling me conceited cos what he got i don't need it
It's a house party point me too the liquor, where the bottles
I brought all the models so the niggas gone follow
Patrone shit, u just tryna bone a bitch
You don't even own shit, so i can't condone it
I'm looking for a cute one, he gotta be a new one
Driving in a ???? oh yeah, the blue one
Dance floor rocking, bottles and bootys popping
We messing up the couch, they gone throw us out the house
And we sliding across the floor, sneaking niggas through the door, bad girls so we bein wild
He ain't get my number - email, so we pen pals
Cuties too my left, super models to my right
Hood bitches in the back just incase they wanna fight
???? i'm going straight to the pros
And when i blow it ain't gone be through the nose
You know i got that flow, that'll close up the show
For the show, gotta get a couple stacks just to go
You be on that lame shit, i don't even try to
Swag so smooth i got ??????
You might also likeOh the reason, they calling me the reason
I'm laying down a season, the pepper
And i even got them sneezing
But straight shots, we ain't drinking out the cups
I went in cos i'm ill, i ain't living of the luck...
I went in cos i'm ill, i ain't living of the luck
And i do it for the love but it's all about the buck
When i strut, hit the brakes i'mma have a nigga stuck
Did i mention the supremacy, you ain't seeing this mentally
If you knew what it meant to me, you would know it was sent to me
I had to swag out, on this beat quick
Break it in half, titanic sea sick
They sleeping on me, shake em out their dream
Shout out to queens, it's nyemiah supreme
