What we gonna do right now
Is we're gonna introduce you
To the best love making experience ever
El latino caliente, Pitbull
La mamita mas rica in the game right now
Adassa, go ahead, took

Erotic, so naughty, your lovin' is like an ancient tale
It moves me, it thrills me, I long to be with you anywhere
(?), and jewel cases, start your way from here to there
You got me feelin' sexy, I'll please you while you please me
(?), I'm yearning, take me on a lover cruise
Animosity is burning, your cobra's searching for my juice
Guiltily swinging, (?)
Feeling like a black bee, feeding on you like a beast

Turning the cream, like I was moving
Turning the cream, start to consume it
Turning the cream, make me lose it
Turning the cream, do me like the kamasutra

Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Do me like the kamasutra
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there

Sexual pleasure, satisfying every thrill
Find me a treasure, nibble on my hip my ear
Doing your duty, come and arouse my senses boy
You'll be my favorite toy, suffocate me with your doy
What you've discovered, places that no one has been
Like there's, no other, that can send me on a spin
Giving, receiving, (?)
I'll be your mistress tonight, lose yourself in my thighs

Turning the cream, like I was moving
Turning the cream, start to consume it
Turning the cream, make me lose it
Turning the cream, do me like the kamasutra

Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Do me like the kamasutra
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there

Ay Dios mio
Keep talking dirty baby
Me, I'm from the south side
You know I'm dirty baby
Ay Dios mio
Mama so sexual
And she's got me feelin' stiff like a vegetable (oh)
Come on baby take me to the point of no return
Teach me I wanna learn
Kamasutra, please me, please me
Show me how to give it you, mami now
Just tell me what you like
I can kiss, I can nibble
I can pull, I can bite
Make love all night
It's wrong, it's right
Who cares
As long as I'm on you like white on rice
(Do me) In different positions
From back, back, front baby just this
I wanna make that kitty cat meow
Baby just turn me out
Kamasutra
Turning the cream, like I was moving
Turning the cream, start to consume it
Turning the cream, make me lose it
Turning the cream, do me like the kamasutra

Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Do me like the kamasutra
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Anytime, (do me) anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
Do me like the kamasutra
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, just call me I'm there
