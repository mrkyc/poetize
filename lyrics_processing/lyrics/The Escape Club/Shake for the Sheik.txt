All around the big bad world
On the CIA machine
Ten ten the President's men
In a big black limousine
There's an ICBM flyin by
Get down and get to work
High, high, we're high and dry
And we're dancing in the dirt

Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got reds in the bed
Hear them dancing in my head
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got the blues, bad news
My heart's dropped down to my shoes
Yeah yeah

Shake!

From the holy temples of Beruit
To the factories of Japan
You've got to shine your shoes and hide your loot
And get rich while you can
There's a redneck rapping at my door
With bibles and grenades
And I'm fighting for a one man's war
In bad black mirror shades
You might also like
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got reds in the bed
Hear them dancing in my head
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got the blues, bad news
My heart's dropped down to my shoes
Yeah yeah

Shake!
Shake!

Fat cats, big ass rats
Jumping to the beat
Black, black oil and crack
In a big black limousine

Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got reds in the bed
Hear them dancing in my head
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got the blues, bad news
My heart's dropped down to my shoes
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got reds in the bed
Hear them dancing in my head
Going to shake for the sheik
Till I feel my body break
I've got the blues, bad news
My heart's dropped down to my shoes
Yeah yeah

Shake! (yeah yeah)
Shake!
