This party's over but it just keeps on going
And I should really leave here but I can't get out the door
Down in the basement, they just took on a new groove
And they ran out of cool new, but they just sent out for more
Here we go again
Can't leave the party
Having a good time
Can't leave the party
(Since 1989)
Can't leave the party
(We're grooving to the vibe)
Can't leave the party
And you ain't leaving, dead or alive
I met a princess, she said she come from outside
She got stuck to a mirror soon as she walked in the room
She neocon recitals, she said she satisfies those
High rolling rollers keep her living in the groove
Let me tell you now
Can't leave the party
Having a good time
Can't leave the party
(Since 1989)
Can't leave the party
(We're grooving to the vibe)
Can't leave the party
And you ain't leaving, dead or alive

Emo teenagers tell me that they've been chosen
But I, I've seen those vampires from like twenty years before
They got no shadows and they, they shimmy slowly
Look like Bela Lugosi, yeah, they're crowding out the floor
Here we go again
Can't leave the party
Having a good time
