And I can't move and I can't breathe
I'll admit you really got me spellbound
You kicked in like a drug on me
Sent me on a ride, messing with my mind
You got to me so suddenly
You walked right in and knocked me out
When they were crowning Miss America
You filled my eyes, you shook me up
And I didn't even notice her
You just came in, wrote your name on my heart
When they were crowning Miss America
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You peel the layers off one by one
Like some strip fantasy
If I could reach out and touch the sun
You'd really make a mess of me
Could I win the prize? You can bet I'd try
But it don't come easily, you're telling me
You walked right in and knocked me out
When they were crowning Miss America
You filled my eyes, you shook me up
And I didn't even notice her
You just came in, wrote your name on my heart
When they were crowning Miss America
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got a taste but I want more, pick me up off the floor
Can't move, can't relax, you gave me a bad attack
One look and I'm energized, I'm still flying high
Burned into my eyes
Messing with my mind
You walked right in and knocked me out
When they were crowning Miss America
You filled my eyes, you shook me up
And I didn't even notice her
You just came in, wrote your name on my heart
When they were crowning Miss America
You walked right in and knocked me out
When they were crowning Miss America
You filled my eyes, you shook me up
And I didn't even notice her
You just came in, wrote your name on my heart
When they were crowning Miss America
