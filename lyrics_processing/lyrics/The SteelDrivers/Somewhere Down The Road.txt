He said I don't believe in that mess they call Heaven
Never bought in to fairy tales
He was just some stranger talking, but it took away my breath
And I thought I heard a cry straight outta hell

Oh, the folly of the lost
Those who stand and mock the cross
Brother, pray for their souls
Let us pray for their souls

Somewhere down the road, there's a reckoning I know
Where the truth's gonna shine like the sun
Where every knee will bow when it all starts going down
Friend, if you ain't ready when it comes
This may be the end for you
You may not care where you go
Me, I'm headed somewhere down the road

Oh Lord, I felt the power of my sweet mama praying
Mister, that saint's been gone for years
She taught me to love Him and never forsake Him
She said, baby, we're just travelers down here

Dust to dust
In this I trust
I don't know when
But I'll see her again

Somewhere down the road, there's a reckoning I know
Where the truth's gonna shine like the sun
Where every knee will bow when it all starts going down
Friend, if you ain't ready when it comes
This may be the end for you
You may not care where you go
Me, I'm headed somewhere down the road

I think about that man sometimes
Still pray to God he saw the light

Somewhere down the road, there's a reckoning I know
Where the truth's gonna shine like the sun
For every knee will bow when it all starts going down
Friend, if you ain't ready when it comes
This may be the end for you
You may not care where you go
Me, I'm headed somewhere down the road
