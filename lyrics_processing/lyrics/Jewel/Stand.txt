Walk in a corner shop
See a shoplifting cop
See the old lady with a gun
See the hero try to run
Nothing's what it seems, I mean
It's not all dirty, but it's not all clean
There's children paying bills
There's monks buying thrills
There's pride for sale in magazines
There's pills for rent to make you clean
Marvin Gaye, there's no brother, brother
Woody Guthrie's land can't feed Mother

Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one to blame
For all the pain that life brings
If you will just take me, it might just complete me
And together we can make a stand

A waitress brings me lunch
We meet, but do not touch
On TV, D.C. is selling lies
While in the corner, King's dream dies
Go to the counter, pay for me and my friend
A homeless man pulls out a roll, says it's on him
The mayor has no cash
He said he spent it on hookers and hash
See Jewel LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one to blame
For all the pain that life brings
If you will just take me, it might just complete me
And together we can make a stand

You will love me, I will love you
You will love me (Go to the counter, pull out some cash)
I will love you (He spent it on hookers and hash)

Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one to blame
For all the pain that life brings
If you will just take me, it might just complete me
And together we can make a stand
Mothers weep, children sleep (You will love me)
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one to blame (I will love you)
For all the pain that life brings
If you will just take me, it might just complete me (You will love me)
And together we can make a stand (I will love you)
Mothers weep, children sleep (You will love me)
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one to blame (I will love you)
For all the pain that life brings
If you will just take me, it might just complete me (You will love me)
And together we can make a stand (I will love you)
