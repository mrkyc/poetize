You and I walking slowly
Hand in hand
Footprints in the sand
Watch the wind as it plays
Throwing shadows across your face
The sky was so blue
Your eyes so green
The air glittering
So sudden, so swift
Love came to us
Just like a gift
I lived here, you lived far away
Our lives called us back, no, we could not stay
With a sad sort of smile, you took my hand
Said while we're apart, you hope I understand that

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever

Fast forward, our love story
I still remember that day
Her small precious face
You stared into her eyes
Hypnotized by her smile
But your job meant you had to travel
But we weren't ready for you to go
You held our daughter with a sad sort of smile
Said while we're apart, I want you to know that...

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever
God forbid there'll come a day
When the light in my eyes fades away
But from your hearts, I will not go
No bounds shall my spirit know

'Cause you'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever
You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
