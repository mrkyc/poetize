Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh-oh

I'm layin' here dreamin', starin' at the ceilin'
Wastin' the day away
The world's flying by our window outside
But hey baby, that's okay
This feels so right, it can't be wrong
So far as I can see
Where you wanna go
Baby, I'll do anything

'Cause if you wanna go, baby, let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss, have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

If you wanna see that Italian tower leaning
Baby, we can leave right now (Right now)
If that's too far, we can jump in the car
And take a little trip around town
They say that California is nice and warm this time of year
Baby, say the word, and we'll just disappear

'Cause if you wanna go, baby, let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss, have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever, oh

It's a big world for a boy and a girl
Letting go of it all
Holdin' on to one another
Oh, there's a hole other world to discover
Under the covers
So if you wanna go, baby, let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
If you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss, have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever
Let's just lay here forever
Stay here forever, oh-oh
