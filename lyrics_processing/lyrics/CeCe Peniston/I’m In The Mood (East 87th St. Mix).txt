And I'll come back for more every day
Feels so, so good to me (I'm in the mood)
Makes me feel oh, so right
I'm in the mood, ahaha, boy
I want you forever
I'm in the mood
Verse 1:
Let's start tonight out right
You and I bathed in candlelight
Tasting the wine on your lips
Touching your body tenderly with my fingertips
I feel a sweet sensation rushing through my body
It needs no explaining, it's for your lovin'
Just dim the lights and ask me what I want, oh, baby
So I can say exactly how I feel
Chorus:
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day

Verse 2:
Let's not spoil the moment, boy
Unplug the phone so we can be alone
There is something about your kiss
That makes me feel like nothing else exists
Let's get into the moment, we won't regret it
There's so much passion between us, we can't control it
This is a night that we soon won't forget, oh, baby
I've never been more ready for your love
Chorus:
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day

And I'll come back for more every day
