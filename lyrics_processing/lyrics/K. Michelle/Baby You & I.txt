See you looking at another chick and now we fighting all up in the club
But when is all set and done we go home and make love

You and I we step on the scene we're killing them
Dudes be all up in my face chicks be trying to get at him
Cause you and I is a hell of a dream team
Yep they say we're both crazy but daddy you done raised me
To be a better woman and that's why
We go smoke together go drink together go love together don't leave me ain't no better


You and I, can't beat us

Haters wanna ride us but baby we're a two seater
Ain't no room for bullshit, they be on that bullshit
Cause we always shopping and smoking on that shit
Since we're talking bullshit, yo sex is the good shit
Mush it mush it love when we get good shit
They say we don't make it out all they do is run their mouth
Without  a doubt, now look at us we're something to brag about
Skies ain't the limit baby the space is how we're living baby

You and I period, we're the shit period
Ain't nobody touching this or come close
You and I in this bed I pull my back up
We got so hard in this bed babe and we're making love
We like the show Ripley's believe it or not
It's like making magic when I climb on top
You and I, I love them titles
Sing to my heart my American idol
Cause you and I don't need no one else
We can talk or anything won't mean it nothing
We gonna be together on stormy weather we can do whatever
