It's been awhile since I had a love that's all mine
Niggas came to and went and not wasting my time
I'm maintaining screaming out
Fuck it, I'll be fine
But I can't act like it don't ever cross my mind
I would give all this shit up
Just to stay home and be your wife
Fold some clothes give you what you like
Boy, you just don't know

You gon' luck up when you get it
Boy, you better not miss it
I'm gonna give you all this love

'Cause when I find a man, he's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
'Cause when I find a man, he's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me, when I get a man
You might also like
I'm gon' roll it up, back it up, pour it, how you like
Baby, one hit just might change your whole life
Baby, I'm down to ride, I'm in the passenger side
This good love we got can't be denied
I wanna give this shit up
Just to come home to you at night
Don't care how I feel
I'll make sure you right
You can have whatever you like

You gon' luck up when you get it
Boy, you better not miss it
I'm gonna give you all this love

Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
When I get a man
I'mma treat him like a king
He gon' be my everything
He gon' love the hell outta me
I won't hold back anything
No more heartbreak
I got a new song to sing

'Cause when I find a man, he's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
'Cause when I find a man, he's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
