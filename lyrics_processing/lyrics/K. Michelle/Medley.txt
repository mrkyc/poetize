I'm looking good I'm having fun this is the best night of my life
Uh I'm off the patron, I need a ride home boy this could be the best night of your life
It's K. Michelle on your motherfucker radio
Somebody call and ask Jive what they waiting for
F-f-fuck it it don't matter though
Cause I'm still a star I'm a shine even if they let it go
But thank you for the titties and the teeth though
I keep trying trying to tell'em I ain't Keyshia Cole
No disrespect though I'm in the club with my heels on
Watching black china swing by the pole
King of diamonds you can find me throwing money like a nigga do
You ain't doing nothing I'm gonna liquor too
I'm a bigot too shout out to my haters what you wanna do
Cause I'll take ya nigga too
From the hood we feeling good this is the best night of our life

Where's Lupe I wanna have a fiasco
Lupe do you mind if we have sex
Lupe I think your lasers album is the best
Boy we can watch TV with the sound off
Put salt around the bed keep the sex demons out
Do you mind if a wear my Reeboks cause with these on heels on I can't make it drop
I know this shit's unusual sex with a mermaid in a pool
Why you're sitting there looking confused
Gotta set the monkey bars in my room
I can't swing from them I swing from you
You think you'll call me?

All I care about is money in this city where I'm from
I'mma sip till I feel it I don't drink until it's gone
I don't really give a fuck and my excuses that I'm young
And I'm only getting bolder somebody should have told you
I'm all one yeah damn it I'm all one
How you ban me from the building what the fuck did I do wrong
I'm just sitting watching TV and my video was on
And on top of all that shit you tell me that my budget gone
If he ain't got no hits why don't you send his ass home
