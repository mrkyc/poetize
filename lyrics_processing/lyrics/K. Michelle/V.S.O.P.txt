Hit the lights, can't let no one see me get down
It's alright, I know they think I get around
You and I got something they can't know about
Really only heaven knows my heart

You know this ain't an ordinary love
We got so much history in the stories about us
So come on over, baby

We gon' light some candles tonight, very special
We gon' do whatever you like, very special
Got some Henny chillin' on ice, very special
Hope you make the rest of my life very special
Very special, all night

Warm my bed, it's a little cold on your shoulder
Mama said I will understand when I'm older
In my head, even if you tell me it's over
I'll pretend you told me I'm your all

You know this ain't an ordinary love
We got so much history in the stories about us
So come on over, baby
You might also like
We gon' light some candles tonight, very special
We gon' do whatever you like, very special
Got some Henny chillin' on ice, very special
Hope you make the rest of my life very special
Very special, all night

"He ain't suppose to be with you"
That's what everybody gon' tell me
But I really can't count on
What everybody gon' tell me
She ain't seen her baby in a couple days
And I'm looking at my baby right up in his face

Flowers and gifts, restaurants
I swear he buy me anything I want
That's why I'm so quick to
Put that music on for him, listen to it, baby!

We gon' light some candles tonight, very special
We gon' do whatever you like, very special
Got some Henny chillin' on ice, very special
Hope you make the rest of my life very special
