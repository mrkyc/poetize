He got older but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose you
Try to talk to him can't get through
Every day he's a different dude
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real

You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry?
Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just keeping it real
You might also like
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

Gonna take more than a miracle
To change him just let him go
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man? It's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise

You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
