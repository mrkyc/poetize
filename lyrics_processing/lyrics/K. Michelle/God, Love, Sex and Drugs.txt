Tell me how to do it like James Brown! (Whoa!)
Tell me how to do it like James Brown! (Yeah)

Got the coffee table, got the paper, got the Scriptures
Got the liquor, got the Swishas
Bout to get turnt up
Got the Bible, turn the pages, hit the switches
Get the digits, call the homies
Tell them all to pull up!
Backbone to the pavement
And I pray beyond the spaceships
Two feet on the ground, fuckin' up
Screamin' "Oh my God!" now

Got a vice, cold as ice
Whatever your drug of choice, you pay the price
So don't you knock me down or knock it 'til you try it
Don't judge me!

They say that we're crazy (Hit me!)
Hoooah, 'cause they don't understand us, us!
(Yeah, uh!)
(That what they talkin', uh)
But now they talkin' crazy!
(Always talkin' crazy)
Who said that I can't have everything I want?
(One more time now!)
Ooooh (the revolution will be televised)
Talkin' God, love, sex and drugs!

Call the doctor, call my daddy, call my mama
Call the pastor, this communion
Tell 'em fill my cup!
We admit that we got issues
God forgive us, we are sinners
Guns N' Roses, middle fingers up!

Gotta vice, wrong and right
Whatever your drug of choice, you pay the price
And, Lord, I'm just hopin' to get a second try
Don't judge me!

They say that we're crazy
(Aw shit now!)
Hoooah, 'cause they don't understand us, us!
(Ha-ha, yeah!)
But now they talkin' crazy
Who said that I can't have everything I want?
(Everybody drunk, huh?)
Ooooh
Talkin' God, love, sex and drugs!

(Oooooooh!)
'Cause you fall for anything if you don't stand for somethin'
(Oooooooh!)
And are fears alike well, you know come a dime a dozen
(Oooooooh!)
When it all comes around full-circle, we did it out of lo-o-ve!
So don't you tell me
People say that we're crazy
Huh, they don't understand us, us!
(I'm just sayin, fuck it!)
But now they talkin' crazy
Who said that I can't have everything I want?
Noooo why?
Talkin' God, love, sex and drugs!

I want it all!
I'm like, ATM!
I want all the money!
I want some God
Some loooove
A lot of sexxxx
And some drugs!
You know, nothing illegal!
