Y'all niggas ain't shit
Nor is yo daddy, or your grand-daddy, that's the problem

I wasn't born last night
I know you niggas ain't right
You can ride for a nigga ya whole life
New pussy fuck it up in one night
Now he done played you, got you in his bed
Told you that he love you, when he really loved your head
Man, these niggas about them games
Pimp that nigga out and treat a lame, like a lame
I don't care, my moneys been the same
But you don't fuck the niggas I do, there's levels to this game
I ain't preaching there's a lot of shit I don't know
But one things for sure, never trust a ho
I'ma show y'all how to do it
Get a team of niggas, put all they ass through it
Girl you loved him, but he ain't love you
'Cause if he loved you, he wouldn't act like he do
While you sitting round cryin' cause of them
He ain't worried bout you, worry bout yourself
Stack that paper, girl get yo checks
Fuck that nigga, be onto the next

I got hitters in the street, they'll do that shit for me
Broke lil THOT ain't even worth it, she just jealous of me
'Cause I'm hotter in these streets, than when the Pacers beat the Heat
You living in a fairy tale, you can tweet ya life away (tweet, tweet, tweet)
You be fuckin' a lot of niggas
