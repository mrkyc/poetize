You got the right one
You got the right one

I just really hate you
All that game you've been running
Now it's time that I played you
And why I let you do me
Like doors wide open you ran right through me
But you done found the right one, nigga

Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh, boy you really don't know how you making me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gon make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

You got the right one
(Now you gon see who you been dealing with)
You got the right one
(Now you gon see who you been dealing with)
You might also like
Damn, I really hate you
I'm a say it again cause the truth is I made you
Now you out here fronting
When you was just begging me
In the rain, down on your knees trying to explain
See you know, I know the truth but still you wanna go there?
You got the right one, nigga

Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh, boy you really don't know how you making me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh, you really gon make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

You got the right one
(Now you gon see who you been dealing with)
You got the right one
(Now you gon see who you been dealing with)

Don't wanna make up, don't wanna be homies
And when you see me act like you don't know me
You think you fly, you think you grown
Every since I left you been calling my phone
You ain't never gon find another chick like me
You ain't never gon find another chick like me, no
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

You got the right one
(You thought you'd get away but I got yo black ass)
You got the right one
(That's why you lost the game and I laughed at yo black ass)

And that's the end
