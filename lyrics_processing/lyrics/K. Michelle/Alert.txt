Pass another edible
I'm just tryin' to do something unforgettable
Uh, I feel like I gotta let 'em know
Salute me, lil bitch, I'm the general!
Uh, sit it down, be humble, this is K-Dot
And I quit, I was never on the choppin' block!
You a jiggaboo, all you do is pop and lock
In the same picture guaranteed you get cropped
My shows' black girls, they like fine wine
When it comes to me and you, it's a fine line
I do this with my eyes closed, this is prime time
I'm 'bout a dollar, little mama, I don't like dimes!
Listen, Jose, stay off my timeline
Matter of fact, stay off them white lines
It takes ten of you, now that's a lifetime
I'm 'bout to kill these hoes, but there's no lifeline!
Your man took you to the jeweler yesterday
I told your nigga every kiss begins with K
A stainless steel Rollie?  No, not today
I need that flooded AP like right away!
Peter Piper picked a pepper, you the type of nigga
Never ever, I'm so clever
Check the weather, Hunter Heather
I'm so fly, don't got no feather
Balmains on, and they leather
I'm a G, seven letter
ABCs, still not better!
Fuck you all, I been better
Be humble or be humbled
Your man's a scrub, he fumble
Fuck them rappers who mumble
I make them rap-thinkin' bitches tumble!
I am K-Dot, last name not Lamar
You on TV, bitch, but you're not a star
That's a C-Class Benz, that is not a car!

What's wrong with this bum-ass bitch, huh-huh?
Bitches always talkin' shit about what I ain't done or what I'm gon' do
I done forgot half the shit that you bitches will ever learn in your whole entire motherfuckin' life!
I'm the OG, ho, and you know it
That's why ya motheruckin' man sit over there
That motherfucker bout this cash
I gets the MONEY!
ATM, All The Money, bitches!
HA!
That's why they mad, hoe
You jiggy-boogie bum-ass bitch!
Salute the general, bitch!
OG, you just a hoe, G!
