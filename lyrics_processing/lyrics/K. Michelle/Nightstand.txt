I got it gridlocked, 2 Pac
3 shots, let it sink in
Hot ride outside
Four door, chauffeur driven
Here I've got more to lose than you

Three o'clock in the morning
Y'all be on that other shit but I ain't on it
Tryina give me your advice but I don't want it
I've got things to do
Phone ring, I call 'em later
Just dissed this nigga for my vibrator
Hope you ain't in trouble
Cause I can't save you
No no no no no oh

Put it on my nightstand, baby
Can you keep it right there baby?
Got it on my nightstand, baby
These pills and these potions gon' save me
Baby, please excuse my behavior
But can I get back the fucks that I gave ya?
Tryna mellow out, I need to blaze up
Can't wait to get back to my nightstand
You might also like
Gotta a nigga right here on my left
I've done rode him to death
Guess I gotta please myself
Tell me why I can't feel it no more
Most of y'all niggas can't afford sleeping in my bed
That new 'rrari, Bugatti you rapping about, boo
Boy its level you're lying ain't none of it true
Just being honest I promise that jewelry that you gave me
I never even wear it and I like Drake better than you
All my boss bitches know

So put it on my nightstand, baby
Can you keep it right there baby?
Got it on my nightstand, baby
These pills and these potions gon' save me
Baby, please excuse my behavior
But can I get back the fucks that I gave ya?
Tryna mellow out, I need to blaze up
Can't wait to get back to my nightstand

(Hold up!)
Uh!
Wish these niggas know me better
Tryna tell me who I had in my bed
Poppin' Percocets by the two
He ain't talking money, keep it movin'
Every time I come around
Here's a, here's another lie on the cover
Are they friends or just fuckin'?
You know something gonna come from it
These petty bitches lyin' they don't know about me
You can be a player 'bout it
And tell me to my face what you say about me?
I can't spend another day on it
Save it for The Shade Room
Put it on my nightstand, baby
Put it on my nightstand
Put it on my nightstand, baby
Put it on my nightstand
