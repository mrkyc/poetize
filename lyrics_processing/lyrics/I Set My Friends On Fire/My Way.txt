Yeah, baby
Skwaaaah
Skwaaaah

Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out of my brain
But first off I'mma start by sayin' this, aye
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, aye
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot swear I won't miss, aye
Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

This is something you should know
I don't have to chase no hoe
I spotted you, you had that glow
Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexing on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely ever left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, aye
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, aye
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, aye
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's on sink, aye
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, aye
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all in her dreams, aye
Well he mad as fuck, when they sex she scream for me, aye
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, aye

Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit
Cancel out my ex, I put a line through that bitch
I like all my S's with two lines through them shits
Everybody trying fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gonna hate, just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James 'cause I'm going hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'mma start by saying this
Goddamn, goddamn
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, aye
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, aye
Baby, won't you come my way?
