Said that you don't love me now, what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a body bag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back

All my life all I do is I try and I fall
I just wish it was from somewhere high
But I'll stay inside if you want me to
Yeah, stay inside if you want me to
But when you come around, baby, please hold me down
I know I make mistakes, pick me up off the ground
Should've stayed inside like you told me to
Should've stayed inside like you told me to
I can't resist, yeah, blood on my wrists, yeah
Hands 'round my neck, yeah, tats on my chest, yeah

Pull up to my funeral and you're grieving
You couldn't bear then, I say you leaving
Follow you everywhere you go now
Tryna make you see me, I don't know how
I try to make you see me, I don't know how
You're taking too many drugs, it's too early to join me now
Now all you do is sleep 'cause you don't wanna cry
Because you think you're the reason I had to die

The pain that breaks my heart each day
I'm not okay
Sunlight shining through my window
Lets me know that I'm still alive
But why did I ever let you inside my heart?
I'm such a fool
