I know exactly why you're wearing that dress
It's about time you chose that easy, sleazy access
Yeah, a hit and run, a rip and dip
A mild stare, a slow sip
Coronal mass infections and lizard-like whores
Are actually what killed all the dinosaurs
This late breaking news makes your head spin like an owl
Bleeding from all the vessels, you should find yourself a towel

Scratch you off my list
I've been meaning to, just like an itch
I was stoned to death
When I took your last breath just like a witch
I'm bigger than you, and I'm way bigger than him too
Get ready for the big debut
Cumming is one of my favorite things to do

Whenever we talk
You're a deer in the road and my lips are sealed
You constantly surprise me
But I have to move swiftly before you smash the windshield
I'm always the one to bring us back
Affectionate souvenir from a foreign, perilous municipality
To something less insecure and severe
You might also like
Scratch you off my list
I've been meaning to, just like an itch
I was stoned to death
When I took your last breath just like a witch
I'm bigger than you, and I'm way bigger than him too
Get ready for the big debut
Cumming is one of my favorite things to do

Decagon Czarina!
I heard you collapse behind the lavatory stall
Consuming anything that pokes its head in and out of the wall
You've got time continuum tears running down the side of your cheek
Asphyxiating for eons leaves no time for us to speak

Scratch you off my list
I've been meaning to, just like an itch
I was stoned to death
When I took your last breath just like a witch
I'm bigger than you, and I'm way bigger than him too
Get ready for the big debut
