Starting the car but the engine is stalling
Fell off a billboard while I was going all in
This is the year of the rise of the fallen
Identity established
No one needs to confirm
Mine is here to stay
Yours wasn't long term
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
Keep on pushing important things to the side
Every time I try to hang out the rope keeps coming untied
Shook hands with Hades before I hopped in the ride
I just declined the number one charting album worldwide
You're a little bitch
That's been known
Stole my style
And tried to make your own
Those unrecognized talents
Smoking on these trees
Trying to find my balance
And now my bones are flashing
Sippin' on this plague and cars are crashing
You might also likeBitch, I'm notable
Bitch, I'm quotable
The painful price is nonnegotiable
Used for one album and then you're disposable
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
Keep on pushing important things to the side
Every time I try to hang out the rope keeps coming untied
Shook hands with Hades before I hopped in the ride
I just declined the number one charting album world wide
You're a little bitch
That's been known
Stole my style
And tried to make your own
Those unrecognized talents
Smoking on these trees
Trying to find my balance
And now my bones are flashing
Sippin' on this plague and cars are crashing
You're on the floor and my cellphone is calling
Starting the car but the engine is stalling
Fell off a billboard while I was going all in
This is the year of the rise of the fallen
Identity established
No one needs to confirm
Mine is here to stay
Yours wasn't long term
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp
