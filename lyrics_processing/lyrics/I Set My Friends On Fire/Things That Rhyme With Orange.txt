I'm so iconoclastic; I'm clastic!
I only want you to think I'm fantastic
I'll participate in what you believe
If you give me the attention!
Yeah, yeah, that's the only compensation
I want to be included in your conversation
So am I "in" or am I "out"
What is there to think about?

What is that paint brush for?
Are you preparing to draw me?
No, wait, please don't!
I am scared of what I'll see...
I'm not a perfect picture portrait
But I am working on it!
I've been thinking about being cool
I must have to admit!

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds
But if it wasn't for you
We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds
How am I supposed to choose, which one I belong to?

I think I'll perpetuate a pre-existing runway (Runway, runway)
I guess it's  almost as cool as creating
A fresh new elaboration yourself
It's a marker! It's a sign!
It's something we define!
It already exists, but you helped refine!
An emblem for all your aesthetic kin
To recognize you by!

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds
But if it wasn't for you
We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds
How am I supposed to choose, which one I belong to?

Obscenity is a crutch for traffic drivers
If you need to use the restroom, just ask politely
I like the way I do it, better then the way you're not
Lifting up the toilet seat was the way I was taught
Obscenity is a crutch for traffic drivers
If you need to use the restroom, just ask politely
I like the way I do it, better then the way you're not
Lifting up the toilet seat was the way I was taught
It has to be a unanimous determination
Because one opinion would be a pointless appreciation

Yeah, sure thanks for the invitation
Don't want to be included in your conversation
It's too late! We've overthrown!
I took all your friends, and you're all alone!

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds
But if it wasn't for you
We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds
