Variegated potpourri courts
Hoping nacre swooshes in front of all
The kibitzers, a slice of yesteryear
You can almost imagine catching it
Before I begin to fear again
It bugs me every year and then

You are like a grain of sand
Can you speak in our dull language so
Each of us can understand?
I have a Major Arcana flush
Are you fond of the truth?

I'm building you a small home
Window doggy, window dotty
Haven't you seen the movie
Pink Flamingos? Don't worry
I won't make you put shit in your mouth
Unless that's something that you're into
That cloak services no mimicry
If the jar jingles in front of me

You were using the word 'invasive'
Incorrectly when you told them
We were all going extinct
Surprise, we're invading your citadel
Permit, permit! Are we gonna slam
Your portcullis with an obelisk?
Yes, I know the final result
And I damn well know the risk
You might also like
When we get in
We're not gonna be that nice
Although we might sell a few of you
For a good price, a good price
When we get in
We're not gonna be that nice
Although we might sell a few of you
For a good price, a good price

It might be hysterical for you
But that's my father's wife you're talking about
However, baby dolphins can easily
Fool your kind, keeping this good news to myself

Used to love to splash. Do I hear drooling?
That's what the tone of your voice implies
It seems to see it all right before it dies
They'll never forget it, and neither will I
Used to love to splash. Do I hear drooling?
That's what the tone of your voice implies
It seems to see it all right before it dies
