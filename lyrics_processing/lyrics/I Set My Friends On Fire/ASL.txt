Where did you see it?
Where did you see it?
I said (I said), I saw it coming (I saw it coming)
Where did you see it?
Where did you see it?
Why are you panting, baby?
Is it too hard to keep up with what you said?
From the outskirts of common sense
This is extremely uncommon
So many lights ahead
If only we kept our eyes open
But now I understand that even if I was blind
I could have clearly seen how filthy you really are
(Anonymous voices, anonymous voices)

Sure
It would have been an excellent story
But I had to get up off the train
Get up, jump off with me
Hold my hand and I'll explain everything

Would you mind never speaking to me again?
If only it was that easy, story teller
I would like for you to remain a myth
Tell me another lie
That it's all going to be okay
Eating up every word you say
And it's starting to taste good
I haven't heard one thing you have said
This whole time you were talking
I was too busy picturing you dead
I haven't heard one thing you have said
This whole time you were talking
I was too busy picturing you dead

Everything I thought you would be
And everything you thought you would be
I thought before I thought before it
And everything you were about to be
I was thinking about, but then everything
In front of my eyes became an optical illusion
And then I wanted to strangle you
Strangle you so hard until you choke
And bleed and bleed everywhere
I don't want to see it, but I have to see it
Because you enjoy my pleasure
As much as I enjoy the pleasures of killing you
I want to kill you and die for you
And then you tell me "Amen, amen"
You said that before you said you believed in Christ
Oh my god
If I were to end abruptly
Would it leave you wanting more?
If I were to end abruptly
Would it leave you...
If I were to end abruptly
Would it leave you wanting more?
If I were to end abruptly
