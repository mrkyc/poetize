The River Life

Give a little more throttle, plane it out nice
Watch out for stumps, left means right
Drove my daddy 'round seven bush hooks
Can't learn about that in them old textbooks
Me and my buddies used to skip school
And jump in that boat and ride to half moon
Tried to be smooth 'til the plug popped out
Sunk daddy's boat and just about drowned
Daddy came home and found me outside
Beat me with a piece of electrical wire
Years went by, he bought a new boat
I said daddy can I drive, he said nope

You got a long ways to go
Before you know what makes that river flow
Boy, it's gonna take a lot of time a million miles
Just you and that old Jon boat
But, if you learn to take sweet time
And realize the fish won't always bite
Son, there's so much life waitin' for you in that river
Livin' that river life

I was raised up right, on the Altamaha
Some of the best cat fishin' I ever saw
I still remember runnin' ol' trout lines
And checkin' them out before supper time
Ain't nothin' in the world like riverbank campin'
Fishin' all day just to see who's champion
Cheese grits and a little Bud Light
When the sun goes down we'll have a big fish fry
Get the grease hot while the fish are soakin'
And don't take them up 'til they all are floatin'
Boy you gotta love this ol' river life
A poor man's beach and a country boy's paradise

You got a long ways to go
Before you know what makes that river flow
Boy, it's gonna take a lot of time a million miles
Just you and that old Jon boat
But, if you learn to take sweet time
And realize the fish won't always bite
Son, there's so much life waitin' for you in that river
Livin' that river life

Drive on in, by the brim bed
Put your cricket on and let him run with it 'til the hook's set
A good mess 'bout a five gallon bucket
If you can't catch that man it ain't gonna cut it
Gotta go ahead and gut 'em when you get to the bank
Hit the cooker with the flame when you lit the propane
Some damn good eatin' when you do it how it's done
Hell a bad day's fish, still a good day's fun
Damn right I was raised up like that
Ain't nothin' but a redneck river rat
Still laugh when I think back to daddy sayin'
"Boy you didn't do too bad"
You got a long ways to go
Before you know what makes that river flow
Boy, it's gonna take a lot of time a million miles
Just you and that old Jon boat
But, if you learn to take sweet time
And realize the fish won't always bite
Son, there's so much life waitin' for you in that river
Livin' that river life
You got a long ways to go
Before you know what makes that river flow
Boy, it's gonna take a lot of time a million miles
Just you and that old Jon boat
But, if you learn to take sweet time
And realize the fish won't always bite
Son, there's so much life waitin' for you in that river
