And if I go back home alone tonight
Two blue pills another bottle
Of that I don't need to chase her
Now that you're gone
You know that's the only thing that's left of me (That's left of me)
There's so many pictures you didn't have to burn
So much love that I didn't even earn
Oh get drunk boy
That's the only thing that's left for me (Left for me, left for me)

I just let her go let her leave
Tear wiped away with the end of a sleeve
So much pain so much grief
All she had do it in just one week
But I miss her anyway
Could've had her best friend any day
As I pulled away in my Chevrolet
Thinkin' to myself it's a hell of a day
I washed my hands I'm checkin' out
I think it through without a doubt
Told her that I want her out
Guess she stayin' at her momma's house
All these things I do for spite
Got a love chalked up to foolish pride
But it's okay, it's alright
Have another beer and call it a night

That's the only thing that's left for me (Left for me, left for me)

Get a little bit restless sometimes
I get my drink on too
Something inside me lights up a wildfire
I take a pill or two
You start to wander all through my mind
I gotta step around the corner
Just to dry my eyes yeah
90 proof bottle sittin' on my bedside
Goodnight little lady hope you had a good time
But this ain't the way it's supposed to be

And if I go back home alone tonight
Two blue pills another bottle
Of that I don't need to chase her
Now that you're gone
You know that's the only thing that's left of me (That's left of me)
There's so many pictures you didn't have to burn
So much love that I didn't even earn
Oh get drunk boy
That's the only thing that's left for me (Left for me, left for me)
And as the sad song plays on
Same ol' story of a broken home
Sittin' here drunk and stoned
By myself, broke and alone
Let's just say I called you up
To see how you are, and say what's up
Ask you what you doin' tonight
Say hey little lady won't you stop on by
But I know that'll never happen
So I'ma keep drinkin' and keep on yappin'
On how we were long time ago
How we fell apart, how we grew so cold
Have a couple of cold Lights
Laugh about our old fights
Reminisce on the old times
Girl it's feelin' so right

If I go back home alone tonight
Two blue pills another bottle
Of that I don't need to chase her
Now that you're gone
You know that's the only thing that's left of me (That's left of me)
There's so many pictures you didn't have to burn
So much love that I didn't even earn
Oh get drunk boy
