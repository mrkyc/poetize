Got a call from a buddy of mine
That I ain't seen in a long long time
He was comin' into town for the day
And he thought that he might stop by
He said I hate to interrupt your weekend
So just tell me if you got any plans
I told him that I had a cooler of beer
And I could sure use an extra hand
Doin'

Nothin' in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long
A hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs
A lotta nothin' in particular and I do it well
So much of nothin' on the schedule now and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

I got my ass in the lawn chair, my toes in the clay
I done called all my folks, and they on their way
I got ribs on the grill, and I'm smokin' a ham
I got a cooler full of beer, so I don't give a damn
Just sittin' in the shade where the cool breeze blows
I got the boom box bumpin' Mr. David Allan Coe
Then my crazy neighbor Bill just stopped on by
And old uncle Paul just came through with some wine
And you know it gets hotter when the sun goes down
And the homemade wine, it's been making it's rounds
And we all catchin' up like a redneck reunion
Y'all stop on by, cause we'll still be doin'

Nothin' in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long
A hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs
A lotta nothin' in particular and I do it well
So much of nothin' on the schedule now and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

Just a down south river rat
I'm always lookin' for a place that I can kick it back
You know I got a big cooler of them Warmouth
And I'm invitin' y'all to come and ride out, ride out
Just a wonderful night, under the canopy light
Drinkin' the brandy and Sprite, havin' the time of my life
You know them youngin's in the tire swing, hangin' from a pine tree Lady in her tight jeans, lickin' on an ice cream cone
Phones ain't no good around here
So hit the power off button, go on and getcha a beer
Old 50 patties on my new grill from Sears
And when I pull the aux cord you better hold your ear
Just a backwoods boy doin' backwoods things
On the weekend days I like to practice my aim
In the city people tell me that I'm wastin' time
I like to call it drinkin' time, we take our time doin'

Nothin' in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long
A hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs
A lotta nothin' in particular and I do it well
So much of nothin' on the schedule now and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help
Nothin' in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long We can do this stuff all day, country girls come out and play
A hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs We always get it on this way
A lotta nothin' in particular and I do it well We can do this stuff all day, country girls come out and play
