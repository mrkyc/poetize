Slipped off the tracks, face hit the ground
Left all alone, there ain't no one around
I know, I'm heartbroke, just like a sad song
But every one that I hear reminds me you're gone
Your daddy told me if I came back
His 30-30 sittin' right up on the gun rack
And I was thinkin' that maybe you might have called ma
She told me "Baby, I don't wanna get involved"
I know what I done, it hurts so bad
And I'd give anything if I could go back
Small town boy but you already know that
Life started comin' at me so fast
I get so mad, I gotta ride off
I wanna stop by, but would you even talk?
Last chance, can't be the last fight
I just gotta baby, maybe we can make things right?

You ain't gotta cut me off (Cut me off)
Hang up the phone every time I call (I call)
Baby without you I'm lost (I'm lost)
Was it really all my fault? (My fault)
And I just wanna make things right (Things right)
I only wanna make things right (Things right)
I just wanna make things right (Things right)
Tonight, tonight

Now for the first time in a long time
I was up with a pen before the sunshine
And there's an emptiness inside when you ain't near
And it's hot outside but there's a cold front here
And it don't really even gotta be like this
Girl you seen my fears and you looked like this
I was standin' on the porch when the sun came creepin'
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday and that Mustang leavin'
Damn, and I ain't gonna beg you back
I just sit there and laughed as you grabbed your bags
And I watched you disappear while I throwed back beer
It was all she could do just to hold back tears
A tear's worth a thousand words when it's done right
Write a song it's a  thousand tears when it's sung right
I lost the love of my life because I didn't try
And all I wanna do is just make things right tonight

You ain't gotta cut me off (Cut me off)
Hang up the phone every time I call (I call)
Baby without you I'm lost (I'm lost)
Was it really all my fault? (My fault)
And I just wanna make things right (Things right)
I only wanna make things right (Things right)
I just wanna make things right (Things right)
Tonight, tonight
You ain't gotta cut me off
Hang up the phone every time I call
Baby without you I'm lost
Was it really all my fault?
And I just wanna make things right
I only wanna make things right
I just wanna make things right
