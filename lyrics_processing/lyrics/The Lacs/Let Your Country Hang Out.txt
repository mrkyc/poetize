I ain't ever had a pot to piss in
Welcome to country livin'
I'm takin' what is given
Fried chicken that's finger lickin'
I was raised on Pabst Blue Ribbon
Front porch pickin' and grinnin'
And as long as I'm here I'ma drink some beer
And keep my country folks jiggin'
Then you show the city just what they missin'
Cookin' greens up in the kitchen
Askin' us just how we did it
Cornbread with them fixins
Man you think we slippin'
Little shine and some fishin'
Take your dog runnin' and hog huntin'
Scared you like the dickens
Y'all prolly think we talk silly right
Redneck and hillbilly kind
The country's what we really like
Never like that ol' city life
Up at dawn and rest at night
Push us around you bet we fight
Work daylight 'til dark
And you get it 'til you get it right

I was raised up south GA
Southern swamp and southern praise
Don't make fun of my southern ways
Get down, get loud, drink all day
I'm on my way to my honey hole
Big cottonmouth in that money hole
Stat Jack forty homemade bite
All I need is you to hold the light (Yeah)
One shot double ought buck
Back in my truck filled up with blood
Tailgate down, big rack shinin'
DUI, I don't need to be drivin'
Hold up law dog your doin' too much
Got a night permit in my old Ford truck
I lay one down when I want to buddy
That's the way we get down in the country
Kinfolk way back in the sticks
Whip the shine up, thirty of fifth
Paw paw diggin' up Mason jars
Load the car then burn them tires
Make a little noise when you get back home
Crank that Hank, that Cash, that Jones
Livin' his life in a country song in the country he belongs (Ha)
