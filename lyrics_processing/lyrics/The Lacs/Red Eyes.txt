And I see red eyes behind the headlights again
And he's so fly no matter how high he gets
And two more one night stands in the dark
He's both of their hearts and just fallin' apart
Drinkin' the loneliness up just one more time
And I see red eyes behind the lights
And I see red eyes behind the lights

She's been sober a year and a half
And all the things she tried to leave in the past
Was here livin' in this small town (Small town)
And all her family tried to keep her away from him
'Cause judgin' by the alcohol on his breath
He's up to no good again (No good again)
And she gets so lonely until the teardrops turn into wine (Wine)

And I see red eyes behind the headlights again
And he's so fly no matter how high he gets
And two more one night stands in the dark
He's both of their hearts and just fallin' apart
Drinkin' the loneliness up just one more time
And I see red eyes behind the lights (Yeah)
And I see red eyes behind the lights

Yeah, he had that Firebird, that feelin' inside her
He knew what drives her, ran her mom to spite her
Voted the cutest couple by the seniors while in high school
But a different tone while at home creepin' breakin' all the rules
Her side of the family was the church crowd class act
For his it was the roughnecks, wrong side of the tracks
And her momma said "Baby don't throw your life away"
And she said "I love him mamma everything is gonna be okay"
Your mother's so upset cryin' took jet car phone
And the daughter said "You better learn to love him mom or I'll be gone"
Then that car rolled the drive she kissed her folks goodbye
And she said "You got to realize there's more to him then red eyes"

And I see red eyes behind the headlights again
And he's so fly no matter how high he gets
And two more one night stands in the dark
He's both of their hearts and just fallin' apart
Drinkin' the loneliness up just one more time
And I see red eyes behind the lights
