(Ride)
Wanna pop a top and leave the past behind
(Ride)
A little country high, a little peace of mind
Wanna take a
(Ride)
A little back woods ride, cleanse my soul
So roll on, and roll on down them old river roads

I call, (I call) shotgun
A little less work and a lot more fun (Lot more fun)
Gallon jug of, moonshine (Moonshine)
Movin' slow-mo watch the time fly by
Hey, I know what you want to hear, but
I say it's been a long damn year and
I'm afraid of what you might find
Gotta ride through the country
Just to ease my mind
No phone, (No phone) no calls (No calls)
Don't worry about nothin'
Let your mind get lost
Gotta, tall truck, (Tall truck) tall trees (Tall trees)
When it gets too bad I can always leave
And find that spot where the time just stops
And the river right there if it gets too hot
So wild, (So wild) so free, (So free) it sounds just right to me

(Ride)
A little back woods ride, cleanse my soul
So roll on, and roll on down them old river roads

If I could just scratch the week off for a minute
And all the bullshit that comes along with it
Maybe get a little gumbo stuck in the treads
And drop a little cricket in a big brim bed
Drinkin' my beer, singin' my song
Ridin' dirt roads, not much wrong with that
It get's a little better with time
And time's the only thing I know that betters the wine
I remember daddy sayin' never follow the signs
Just ride 'til every road is planted there in your mind
Pretty soon your daddy's boy will be a one of a kind
Just kick back and roll to your favorite rhyme

My problems, how they leavin'?
Kick back 'cause I know the reason
Got some, feelin's up, (Feelin's up) not knowin' (Not knowin')
I don't care about where I'm goin'
Keep drivin', (Drivin') no fear (Fear)
Riverbank I love it here (Love it here)
My mind is, so clear
Feel the breeze and taste the beer
Life can pull you in so many ways
I sit and reminisce 'bout them good old days
When the things were simple, and work was tough
When time sat still, never had to rush
You could, concentrate on the finer things
Like chillin' with the family on the front porch swing
When right at home is where you wanted to be
Now that sounds just right to me so

Wanna take a ride
Down them old river roads
Let me get that feelin' again
That country cleansin' my soul
Wanna take that ride
Even though nothin' has changed
I feel like wastin' my day
My problems driftin' away
