That's what she thinks

She says that I drink way too much
Get a little buck wild now and then
Wanna call all my friends
She says that I drink way too much (Well hey)
But you only live once so you might as well take a swig

I showed up to the house about quarter to nine
She was waitin' at the door said "Oh my my"
Said "I'm gonna tell you 'bout your drinkin' 'bout one more time"
I said "You got your thing, I got mine"
But I'm not drunk baby I'm just feelin' good
I spent the whole day cruisin' back woods
And I know I didn't call and maybe I should
Could I drink a little less? Hey, maybe I could (Alright)
But I don't know why you act this way (Naw)
I ain't doin' you wrong, and I say
Me and my boys like to have a good time (That's right)
Drinkin' a few just to easy my mind
And then she asks "Was it beer, Jack, or Jim?"
I know how you get, when you're with your friends
I reply "Moonshine", as I head down the hall
Then I locked her out the bedroom just because (Wow)

She got my Jim Beam bottle out of my back seat
But she never gonna find my Jack D
Took my keys to my four wheel drive
Had one too many of them old Bud Lights
Straight up, I don't drink too much
But on weekends I tie one on
That's just how I get down
Me and my boys ain't doin' nothin' wrong (Nope)
I say "Hey little girl won't you loosen up?"
Get your cup let's mix 'em up
Dance on the porch, take a few shots
'Til we both pass out there in the same spot, hey

On a tailgate, (Tailgate) I need another shot (Another shot)
It's Saturday, (Saturday) let's hit another spot (Another spot)
I'm at the lake now, (Lake now) I need another beer (Another beer)
Ain't nothin' but a party, up in here
I said I'm out of beer, (Out of beer) I need some moonshine (Moonshine)
Another Jager Bomb, (Jager Bomb) and I'll be doin' fine (Doin' fine)
Now I'm down by the river, pour me a drink
And I don't really care about what she thinks (Nope)
