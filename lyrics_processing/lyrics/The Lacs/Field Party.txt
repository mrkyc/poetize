You damn right, it's Friday night
Grab the Busch and the Bud Light
Meet me in the pasture back in the pines
We in the spot that the cops can't find
Turn up the Jones turn up the jar
Fire up the smoke, grab that old guitar
We're just some good ole boys and girls about to get wild
It's goin' down field party style

Rippin' up them dirt roads, stirrin' up them cattle
Show you where to make shine at as long as y'all don't tattle
Got beer kegs in truck beds, party around that bonfire
Horseshoes and corn hoe, roped off with barbed wire
Bad broads with tanned legs, raised up on cornbread
Dancin' with them daisy dukes, all they do is turn heads
Rebel red bikini tops, man you know you want it
They drinkin' on that hunch punch, 'fore long they start to flaunt it
So crank up them eighteens as loud as they can get
'Bout thirty miles from anything, the law ain't hearin' shit
Y'all get drunk and show out, cut lose and go wild
Here it's goin' down, down field party style

You damn right, it's Friday night
Grab the Busch and the Bud Light
Meet me in the pasture back in the pines
We in the spot that the cops can't find
Turn up the Jones turn up the jar
Fire up the smoke, grab that old guitar
We're just some good ole boys and girls about to get wild
It's goin' down field party style

Let's get it crunk and do it right, we gon' crank it all night
Tell your mom and old man, they can bring the whole nine
We got them tailgates down and the shots goin' round
Hit 'em up and get 'em up and tell this whole damn town
We got the bonfire blowin', the crowd is steady growin'
Five thousand plus will be here before you know it
Got the grilled fired up, cookin' every kind of meat
We got the freaks in bikinis headed down to the creek
We got Harleys over here, mud trucks are over there
Rednecks and hillbillys 'bout every damn where
Come one, come all, that's how we do it in the south
All we need is a field and we'll turn the party out

You damn right, it's Friday night
Grab the Busch and the Bud Light
Meet me in the pasture back in the pines
We in the spot that the cops can't find
Turn up the Jones turn up the jar
Fire up the smoke, grab that old guitar
We're just some good ole boys and girls about to get wild
It's goin' down field party style
It's goin' down, field party style
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, field party style
Soak
You damn right, it's Friday night
