Cause you got what I need pretty mama, all those times where I was good as gone
You come back even though I did you wrong, you got what I need pretty mama
Cause you know me sometimes I like to get wild, and only you can slow me down

I got that pretty mama syndrome, I can't wait to get home, I know its tough it
Got rough ever since I've been gone, I've said some things you've said some
Things that we didn't mean, I did some things you did some things but we still a
Team (that's right), let's talk it out and just relax, stay home and kick back
For 3 whole days its ok, makem wonder where we at, cut the phones lock the doors
Call in work forget the chores, let's have fun and just forget what the hell we
Was fightin for, cause we got a good fling, and seeing its a good thing, a
Little diamond ring and a house back in the woods thing, you knew this in the
First place, I miss
You in the worst way, and I still love you like the first day (so I say)

You got what I need pretty mama, all those times where I was good as gone you
Come back even though I did you wrong, you got what I need pretty mama, cause
You know me sometimes I like to get wild, and only you can slow me down

Its been a long time comin down a slippery road, remember so many times that I
Went solo, why I hoped you wouldn't find out I been drinkin, and stood there and
Lied to your face without blinkin, cause you wanted to call to check when I was
Goin, I was too drunk to talk so howd you end up knowin, I was lost and the only
One to save me was you, and we got so separated I didn't know what to do, and
Yeah it took a while to notice feelings were true, and after, after a while
There was no doubt it was you, cause you taught me how to smile again, stood up
To my wilder friends, ain't no other way nothins gonna tear us down again
