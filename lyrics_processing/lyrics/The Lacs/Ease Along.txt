Well I've seen some pretty bad brawls
Black eyes and broken jaws
If you talk loud 'round here
Boy you better be tough like an ol' Ford truck
Now a good clean fight to me is just fine
But when a buddy pulls something from his belt line
Things go from bad to worse when a gun gets drawn
Well I had a good time but I think I'm 'bout to ease along

'Cause a pistol grip ain't supposed to mix with a gut full of alcohol
That ol' right hand'll go to shakin' wantin' to kill 'em all
So waiter keep the tip, I'm 'bout to split before for somebody drops the ball
Hey I had a good time but I think I'm 'bout to ease along
Think I'm 'bout to ease along
Think I'm 'bout to ease along

Now I've been comin' to this ol' honky tonk for awhile
Country boys talkin' noise just to make them girls smile
We relax kick back and maybe have a few shots
Playin' the country jukebox, whether you like it or not
There ain't a damn thing wrong with friends and eight ball pool
'Til this stranger in the corner started actin' a fool
The little city slicker couldn't handle his liquor
Started talkin' 'bout the country folks, so y'all go figure
I mean it happened so fast he couldn't figure it out
He couldn't get the taste of Georgia boot up out his mouth
That little sissy in a cowboy hat that ain't real
You ask what happened now he's nappin' from the Lac boy sleepin' pill
Somebody better get him 'cause he don't belong
And I ain't goin' back to jail so I'ma ease on along
