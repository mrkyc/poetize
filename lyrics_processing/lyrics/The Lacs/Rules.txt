He said boy you got some big ol' shoes to fill
Kick back a few shots of the jar when you want to
Never leave a good friend astray
These guns I'm passin' down son they ain't toys

I was raised in a place that was known to be rough
I was washed on the bank down a decent bluff
The muddy river water runnin' was a lesson for me
It taught me 'bout the only way to get to the sea
And it ain't about the race that was back in the day
See you can't desecrate them old southern ways
My great-granddaddy always flew confederate flags
Papa Reilly did too and so did my dad
It's funny I'ma let this lesson live on
Got to law down the law with two boys of my own
Show them how to do it when I am dead and gone
I can rest easy knowin' that their southern strong

I said boy you got some big ol' shoes to fill
A lot of workin' like a dog out in them fields
Kick back a few shots of the jar when you want to
Never take it too far
Never leave a good friend astray
Got to mean what you say a good firm handshake
These guns I'm passin' down son they ain't toys oh yeah
A few rules for a southern boy

I'm rollin' through the backwoods, sippin' on a that good
Thinkin' about a time it was just some ol' flat wood
Chain gang slings and breakin' them oaks
And Uncle Noodle taught me all about makin' them roads
I thought I was tough but not half as damn tough and rough
As my daddy and grand daddy was
Hey, spread your wings and go act strong
But eventually your roots will bring you back home
We got different ways of cope'in and movin' along
But me I ride the same roads that I grew up on
That I blew up on and now you up on
And I'll never forget the ones dead and gone

I said boy you got some big ol' shoes to fill
A lot of workin' like a dog out in them fields
Kick back a few shots of the jar when you want to
Never take it too far
Never leave a good friend astray
Got to mean what you say a good firm handshake
These guns that I'm passin' down son they ain't toys
Just some rules for a southern boy

He said boy you got some big ol' shoes to fill

These guns that I'm passin' down son they ain't toys
