Bonfirin', moonshinin'
Four-wheel drive with the mud inside it
Big gunnin', no runnin', won't back up we just keep it comin'

Cut me on loose in the backwoods
Buck knife, shotgun, shine and I'm all good
Ridin' on some old back roads, gettin' live
Creek bank, tail dropped with a bonfire
Rebel flag flies high around here
Pretty women with them tanned up thighs 'round here
We keep a cooler full of ice cold beer
And we like to keep our trucks sittin' high around here
We keep it movin' slow, we keep it feelin' fine
We keep it anyway but livin' that city life
So if you didn't know I guess you know now
This is how the country folks like to hangout

Bonfirin', moonshinin'
Four-wheel drive with the mud inside it
Big gunnin', no runnin', won't back up we just keep it comin'
Woah-oah-oah-oah what you know about them country boys?

Now where the payments ends up against the two path road
And my family and friends the only ones that should know
Take a right at the big lot go past the food plot
Wrap it on around and then you'll find my spot
Now my pad is just a little shack in the woods
But my gun rack keeps my food stacked and I'm good
I take a swig of the shine, a little backwoods proof
I can't help to ask myself man what would Hank do
He probably laugh a little bit then he'd light up the smoke
And at the end he would finish off his Jimmy and Coke
I'm just a small town country boy, backwoods raised
And at the end of everyday that's how I'm going to stay (Hey)
