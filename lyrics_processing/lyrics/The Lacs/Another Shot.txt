I slam my glass on the bar not thinkin' 'bout where you are
But I know the liquor won't last
And I'm probably gonna take it way too far
I'm DUI on the way to your house
But I know deep down that I'm never gonna see you again
Still I drive by slow and turn the Kenny up loud
Tin man cause it's kinda how I'm feelin' now
I ain't gonna find a way to get you back
And I did you wrong and I can't change that
Maybe the crying will go and lay me flat
Wake up and do the same tomorrow

So pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I've got to ride baby
And pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I got to ride, oh yes I do

I ain't even thought about ya baby for the whole week long
And lately I just work eat sleep and I'm gone
I got the weekend comin' then it's time to unwind
5 o'clock Friday evenin' and it's quittin' time
So I head to the bar with a couple of friends
And all they heads turn when you stroll in
You didn't even speak when you walked right by
Hey but I saw that look in your eye
Looks like you want a reconciliation
But baby girl it's a bad situation
I'm big 'cause the bartender's hot
And me and her are leavin' after one more shot
So uh
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
So pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I've got to ride baby
And pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I got to ride, oh yes I do

How 'bout another round will you mix me up a strong one?
I don't wanna 'member when I wake up in the mornin'
I don't care to talk 'cause the whiskey still callin'
Can't believe she gone I guess I miss all the warnin's
A lot I could have done just to keep her from leavin'
I thought she was the one but I guess I was dreamin'
What I thought was a part of me is now a part of my past
And I know you feelin' me, you mind feelin' my glass?
Sitting in a bar, see I'm glued to the stool
And I feel a lil' foolish bein' here singin' the blues
I can't sing one note and I can't carry a tune
But I'll have another shot and dedicate it to you

So pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I've got to ride baby
And pour me another shot, to get you off my mind
And pour me another shot, and then I got to ride, oh yes I do
