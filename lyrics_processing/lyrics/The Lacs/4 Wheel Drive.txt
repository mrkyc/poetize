The weather man said its lookin' good today
Already hear the thunder and its fixin' to rain
Holler shotgun baby cause we're fixin' to ride
We already got the Busch in all covered in ice
Jump in and pop the clutch let it holler and cry
You're just a city slicker boy so why you bother to try
Anybody could see the man look at the tires
MT-44 chromed out bullet holes
If you wanna make a beer run its all on you
Most trucks need one lane mine needs two
I love ridin' high and chillin' with the boys
Good girls good drink make a little noise
Got the pedal to the floor mat
I'm on a roll cause I ain't got stuck all day
Got a rebel on the mud track
Got a blonde ridin' shotgun with me and she's ready to play

Shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
Keep the speed down low and the seat up high
While your stuck up in the mud let me slide on by
Sh-shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
Shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
Keep the speed down low and the seat up high
While your stuck up in the mud let me slide on by
Sh-shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
And I don't even know why I'm doin' this song
Cause when you hear the pipes blast you know it's on
Z-71 over so much chrome
So high up in the sky make you stand alone
56 inch tires and a two foot lift
I got to roll out the ladder just to get my chick
It's a real swamp buggy so you know what's up
Gotta keep playin' kick kickin' up mud (Kickin' up mud)
Got the camouflage swade and the RealTree on the dash
I'm the mudbog champ can you hear those glass packs
Got my hound dog Bo tucked down in the back
And "Cracker" on the tailgate written in black
When I'm on the pavement we rumble and roar
Got them little country girls comin' back for more
Mud trucks and trains in a country boy thing
I'm just doin' what I do 'cause them city boys can't

Shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
Keep the speed down low and the seat up high
While your stuck up in the mud let me slide on by
Sh-shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
Shawty wanna ride in my four-wheel drive
