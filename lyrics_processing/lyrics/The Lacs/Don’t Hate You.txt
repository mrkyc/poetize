I hate everything, mmm

I guess that you had different plans
30 acres nice house good job
And the pots was all pissed in
And now I'm just a bitter man
'Nother drunk old grouch full of doubt
And I ain't got many shits to give
The liquor just feeds that old flame
Getting pissed off at the thought of your face
I'm sick of losin' it all to your games
I'm gonna get gone from all that I hate
'Cause

Ain't enough liquor up on that wall
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
Go and figure it's time for last call
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
You, you had to go and ruin everything
Now this drink is what I love the most
I hate givin' up but I don't know what to do
I hate it that I don't hate you
I don't
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
Whatever
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
I've been ridin' round thinkin' 'bout you
Yeah I've been hidin' out drinkin' Crown too (That's right)
And I propose a toast and I hope the best for you
And ain't but one thing left to do
It's five o'clock ain't fit to stop
Pop a top and bend the block
For a fifth of Bacardi to the back of the bar
This Makers Mark is fit to drop
Memories lets wash 'em down
Don't believe then watch me now
But the blood to the ground
'Til the round and the pound
Lets set them up and knock 'em down

Ain't enough liquor up on that wall
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
Go and figure it's time for last call
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
You, you had to go and ruin everything
Now this drink is what I love the most
I hate givin' up but I don't know what to do
I hate it that I don't hate you

Sittin' round drinkin' in this bar all night
Throwin' back shots and I'm feelin' alright
The feelin' creeps in and I start to think' 'bout you
But I know what to do
Ain't enough liquor up on that wall
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
Go and figure it's time for last call
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
You, you had to go and ruin everything
Now this drink is what I love the most
I hate givin' up but I don't know what to do
I hate it that I don't hate you
Ain't enough liquor up on that wall
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
Go and figure it's time for last call
(I hate it that I don't hate you)
You, you had to go and ruin everything
Now this drink is what I love the most
I hate givin' up but I don't know what to do
