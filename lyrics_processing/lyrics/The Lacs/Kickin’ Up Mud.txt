I'm just a country boy (Boy) with a big ole truck (Truck)
The only way I ride (Ride) I keep it jacked up (Yeah)
I got some big tires, they make some big ruts
And every time I drive yeah, I be kickin' up mud
(Kickin' up mud)
I got that Real Tree across the leather seats
I got two 12's in the back bumpin' coming down the streets
I'm cranking Johnny Cash I'm talkin' Man in Black
And if you don't like it then y'all can kiss my country ass
(I'm kickin' up mud)
30.06 on my back gun rack
See a whitetail buck put him on his back
7mm or 12 gauge shotty
We ain't tryin' to get drunk or hurt nobody
Lordy lordy you got a sexy body
Just get muddy and shake it shawty
Crunk in the mud slap gettin' drunk
Dirty dancin' kickin' up mud

Big truck (Big truck), big tires (Big tires)

Cut me loose, let me go
I gotta go find that mud hole
Feel so sweet, I just creep
But call it my riverado
Better bring your rope, bring your chain
We get riled up when it starts to rain
Like oh my, look at that truck
I bet ya a beer that it won't get stuck
(Kickin' up mud)
Pulled up slow pulled up nice Mickey Thompson's 45s
Pretty little girl with some tanned up thighs
Askin' me if she can ride
Like what you think girl? Hop on in
Pick the hole and I'll drive it in
Floored the gas we slippin' slidin'
Paintin' that truck behind us
Uh! Oh!
