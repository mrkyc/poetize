It's the perfect time to set 'em up
Throw 'em back and get her gone
Left me here with nothin' much
Nothin' but some drinkin' songs
All I got is plenty time, sit me on a bar stool
Doesn't matter any kind of Bourbon with some cold brew (Yeah)
I got a plan and I pray it's gonna work
Pretty soon if I ain't drunk I'm gonna think about her
There's a lot I could've done guess I ruined everything
Tried to tell you I was sorry but I knew you wouldn't stay
So hey bartender can you put me in the zone
Here's a twenty Mr. Taxi, can I catch a ride home
Need another shot of courage and a bottle to keep
Face down, passed out, I'm finally gettin' some sleep

I might as well get drunk tonight
A few shots at the bar oughta do me just right
Enough beer to get you off my mind
I might as well get drunk tonight
Might as well get drunk tonight
(Bartender, one more round)

I'm gonna get drunk as a skunk and baby that's my mission
Gonna get on a Corona and practice fast repetition
And did I mention that I fixed in a few shots at the bar
You know how I get when I get to drinkin' at dark
Liquor called me the bigger quicker picker upper
And Jim Beam straight now I'm a bad mothertrucker
Yeah, I'm ten feet tall and bullet proof to some
A modern day Holiday when it comes to a gun
One hell of a dancer and a smooth romancer
I'll show you Casanova how to get all the answers
Or at least I think I do in my intoxicated mind
I think I miss her, let's forget her, just one more time
