Damn it's nice, just one call
Two head lights, that's my dog
'Cause I've been gone, I've been slippin'
Man he said need a little money, start trippin'
And I said naw naw, it ain't nothin' like that
He pulled out two shots of Jack
Leaned on the hood said "What you got?"
That talk we had won't be forgot (Naw)
I miss back in 03 bein' you and me that's all we need
Shoot, back then we was wild as hell
At least two or three times you posted my bail
Told me don't stop when the road gets rough
Slip and fall you got to get back up
All those times y'all showed me love
Man I can't tell y'all boys thanks enough

Sometimes we mess around and get in a bind
Lord, I'm all out of luck, need a buck, need a ride
Just a handful of people that you know you can call
When you broke, when you lost
When you caught up with the law
You ain't gotta think twice 'bout nothin'
If you ever need somethin', buddy I'll come runnin'
And when I get the call you can bet I'll roll
Let me know, let me know, let me know

I'll be sittin' on go when I get that call
You damn right 'cause that's my dog
It don't matter what I got goin'
Hang right up and get it rollin'
Remember that time when I needed a ride
You didn't hesitate to put me inside
That calmed me down and talked me out
Somethin' dumb for running my mouth
We've seen the ups and felt the downs
Did bad stuff all around this town
You was there when things got harder
Who said blood is thicker than water
Lord knows we ain't even kin
We've been down through thick and thin
Whether we brothers or we friends
My ride or die until the end

Sometimes we mess around and get in a bind
Lord, I'm all out of luck, need a buck, need a ride
Just a handful of people that you know you can call
When you broke, when you lost
When you caught up with the law
You ain't gotta think twice 'bout nothin'
If you ever need somethin', buddy I'll come runnin'
And when I get the call you can bet I'll roll
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Sometimes we mess around and get in a bind
Lord, I'm all out of luck, need a buck, need a ride
Just a handful of people that you know you can call
When you broke, when you lost
When you caught up with the law
You ain't gotta think twice 'bout nothin'
If you ever need somethin', buddy I'll come runnin'
And when I get the call you can bet I'll roll
