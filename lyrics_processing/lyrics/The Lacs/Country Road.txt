My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Back to the place where I come from
My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Just how long have I been gone
Lord take me home
Lord take me home

I say bye to my folks as I pack my clothes
Mama don't cry I was born to go
You gonna see my name in them big city lights
And daddy you know your boy will be alright
I thought the big city life was the place for me
But things ain't always what they cracked up to be
Fell flat on my back searchin' for my soul
Now I'm headed back down my country road

My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Back to the place where I come from
My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Just how long have I been gone
Lord take me home
Lord take me home

Get on down the road now
I got a sack and a Uhaul
I'm gonna make it back to Georgia before the dew fall
A six pack and a half a pack of Pall Malls
Red wine, the kind that give ya lock jaw
Old tires ain't seen dirt roads in a while
But the grass gettin' green so I know I'm in the south
Old back wood fiend and there ain't no doubt
I was born in the south go on take me to the house

My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Back to the place where I come from
My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Just how long have I been gone
Lord take me home

Thank God I was born in the south (Born in the south)
Country folk gonna ride on out (Ride on out)
(Lord take me home)
Thank God I was raised in the south (Raised in the south)
Country folk gonna ride on out (Ride on out)
Back roads cruisin' on a two path lane
Stoppin' by the field checkin' out the sugar cane
Rollin' down by the creek, switch it off and just listen
My roads ain't found on that navigation system
Stop and look at the deer track
Grabbin' me a beer from the back
30.06 by my side, can you feel that?
A right at the chicken pen,a left at the back lodge
We made it to the river and we never touch a black top

My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Back to the place where I come from
My country road take me home
Take me to the place where I was born
My country road take me home
Just how long have I been gone
Lord take me home

Thank God I was born in the south (Born in the south)
Country folk gonna ride on out (Ride on out)
