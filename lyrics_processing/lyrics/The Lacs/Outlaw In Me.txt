I'm just a drifter so, here I go
Lock and load, hit the road
It don't matter if I'm ready 'cause I got to go
I stay strapped up, I got my boots tight
I'm fully focused man, I got my head right
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in my own mind
I'm not a follower, I make my own line
If it's my last night, I hope God lets me in
Tell him I was a good man
Tell him I was a good friend
Some want to see the light
Some want to be the thunder
Some like to play at night
I can't sit back and wonder
And they don't know what they got until it's all gone
And God knows that I'ma ride until I'm called home

I got the wind on my face and hell on my heels
It's the devil deep inside that I just can't kill
It's that good man I just can't be
There's nothing' left in the mirror but a trace of me
I'm just livin' my life
Momma taught me wrong from right
No apologies, I'm alright, livin' free
It's just the outlaw in me
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
I know I'm an outcast, throw me off the wagon
They label me a problem, Momma, I don't know what happened
Got me draggin' around my past, I put my middle finger up
And every police that I pass harassin' followin' my truck
So I hung out with them boys on the wrong side of the tracks
Started drinkin', stated fightin', started likin' being bad
Man I only took a drag now I smoke them by the pack
First the devil drags you in and then he stabs you in the back
Didn't listen to me did ya boy I guess you got to learn
Like the sign is tryin' to tell you, up ahead is gonna burn
So for everything it's worth, y'all I'm sorry about my past
I didn't know the things I've done would come and bite me in my ass

I got the wind on my face and hell on my heels
It's the devil deep inside that I just can't kill
It's that good man I just can't be
There's nothing' left in the mirror but a trace of me
I'm just livin' my life
Momma taught me wrong from right
No apologies, I'm alright, livin' free
It's just the outlaw in me

(Oh) I got that open road
Heavy steel
This rebel soul is hard to kill
So tell the law to come and get me
On a steel horse ridin' through the dirty sin city
I got the wind on my face and hell on my heels
It's the devil deep inside that I just can't kill
It's that good man I just can't be
There's nothing' left in the mirror but a trace of me
I'm just livin' my life
Momma taught me wrong from right
No apologies, I'm alright, livin' free
