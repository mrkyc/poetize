Live from the sand bar
Ain't no work goin' on this weekend
Feelin' fine and no tan lines

Sand bar on the river with a cooler of beer
Half a dozen girls and the water is clear
Ladies it's okay to take your tops off
A perfect combination with the sun and the sand
I always try to keep some tannin' lotion in hand
Ladies let me know if I missed one spot

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldn't believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way that I live my life
It's a country boy's paradise

Lil' string bikinis and Corona flip flops
Me and my buddies standin' on the toolbox
Ladies it's okay to take your tops off
I think that I'm in heaven would you give me a pinch
And I know what it means when that little blonde winks
Maybe me and you need to go for a walk

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldn't believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way I live my life
It's a country boy's paradise

On a pontoon boat, headed to the beach
So many girls, look so sweet
Now baby doll, what's your plan?
Could you ride with me? You bet you can
With a white t-shirt and an all red thong
She jumped right in lost her phone
I saw her frown and I said what's wrong
She grabbed a beer and said it's on
Don't look now but she's on the boat
Droppin' it down and gettin' low
People are comin' from all around
And we look like a floatin' town
Oh my my oh hell yeah
She danced so long her face is red
She let out one big rebel cry
And the top came off and she let it fly

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldn't believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way that I live my life
