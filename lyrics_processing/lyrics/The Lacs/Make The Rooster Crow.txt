Stand up, tattooed, doin' her thing
Drivin' me wild, like I'm goin' insane
It won't take much, 'bout three or four drinks
She can get loose, not worry 'bout shame
Drop it to the flat line, rattle that cage
Them boys at the bar messin' 'round, get rage
Try movin' in fast, she tell you get gone
Girl is shakin' that ass to her favorite song (Drop it down low, low)
Dance to the night, into the hot sunrise
Got me perched up high, for them tanned up thighs
Man I'm on another level but it's all good though
Girl drop it down low, make the rooster crow

Shawty shakin' and she looks so fly (That's right)
This girl here is just my type (Uh huh)
Big hips and that ass so fine
I really wanna take her home tonight
I ain't never seen that before
The way she droppin' n' scrubbin' that floor
Make me wanna say oh my Lord
Movin' so fast, like it's stuck in fast forward
So many sides 'til the lines got blurred
She's droppin', man, that's so absurd
City girls got nothin' on her
Drop it down low, make the rooster crow

Drop it, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop

Shawty got a cup boutta get drunk
Walk into the club, boutta get crunk
Somebody make 'em all show out
Now your ass gonna get thrown out
She's sweatin' and she's startin' to glow
Now she went from her head to her toe
Bend it over and you already know
She drop it down low, make the rooster crow
