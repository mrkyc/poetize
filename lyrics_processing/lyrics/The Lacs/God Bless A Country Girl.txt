She gets her redneck on, a rebel red hot honey
Got a pickup truck, plus her daddy got some money
Makes a sweet potato pie, that'll shut your mouth
Ponytail to the side when she hangin' around the house
A little tomboy growin' up, huntin' and a fishin'
Shoot a 30.06, got a Carolina skiff
And if the creek gets high, she got a four wheel drive
A couple chains in the back, a little mud on the tires
Hell yeah, she's a hot one man I think I got one
She can go all day fishin' in the hot sun
Man I guess I'm lucky to be livin' in the sticks
Boy just take a look around we got the baddest little chick

You can find them in the sticks or way up town
God bless a country girl

She's a beauty queen, but she loves to mud bog
Likes frogs, man this broad likes to hunt hogs
Likes to fish and she fire in the kitchen
Cube steak, mashed taters and a little fried chicken
And I can say everyday, is that she's perfect for me
Knows how to clean a gun and makes the best sweet tea
Hey, a young girl with an old school soul
Man she had her first job when she was eight years old
Ain't worried about dirt and ain't afraid to work
Loves Holey Jeans but she can rock that skirt
They don't make them like this, she's the last of a kind
So fine and divine, so glad that she's mine
