Oh, It's just another thing to me

Another day on the grind for a couple cents
I kiss goodbye to my relevance
The world throws stones while I ride the fence
I'm holdin' on enough to bring up something that finally makes sense
It's like I'm livin' in a war zone
And they can write it on my tombstone
Here lies a man that don't cry
With ash on the feet in front pillar heels
I've been up and I've been down
But my place ain't on the ground
I'd rather meet death on my feet and life on my knees
Trouble ain't nothin' but another damn thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Boy that's right)
'Cause it's just another thing to me
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
You know it ain't a thing with it
So I focus on the game but I can't get it
I got my people wonderin' if I still got it
So I'm reachin' out the window for my pill bottle
And I will follow
Devil wanna ride with me but I ain't lettin' him
I got a lot of my problems but I ain't stressin'
I'm on a path of my past of my days gone
I keep on fightin' and I'm tryin' to find my way home
Head to the sky and ride just to stay strong
My time tickin', quicker like I'm on a payphone
They don't wanna hire me 'cause my piss is cloudy
Lookin' down, but they don't know nothin' 'bout me
They bringin' the wickedest sickest person out of my soul
So I'm takin' 'em, makin' 'em work down them old dirt roads
I rearrange some things but there ain't no changin' me
Man it's plain to see, it's just another thing to me

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see (Let's go)
'Cause it's just another thing to me
It's in the past man, so don't think about that
Made some real bad choices, I can't take back
That's why I don't brag about the things I own
Cause I can make a wrong turn and it'll all be gone
I still bust my ass to make ends meet
I understand a better plan is on it's way for me
And hey it's just another day
And I'll get by
Just keep walkin' with my head high, you know

I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
I've been up and I've been down
And I've been beat and pushed around
I'll pick myself up off the ground
Just wait and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Just another bridge I'll have to burn
Just another lesson I'm bound to learn
Buddy ain't damn thing changin' me
So watch and see
'Cause it's just another thing to me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-yeah-ahha
