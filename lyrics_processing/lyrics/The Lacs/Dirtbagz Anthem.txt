Where my dirtbagz at? (Way up from the dirty south)
Where my dirtbagz at? (From the east to the west and way around)
Where my dirtbagz at? (If you don't give a fuck put your hands up now)
Where my dirtbagz at? (We gonna turn up 'til the switchboard )

Welcome ladies and gentleman to the best show under the big top
We want y'all to sit back and enjoy
And if y'all get offended, we don't give a shit

Where the hell my dirtbagz at?
Put your hands up, God damn I ain't Shaq
See I got a smart ass mouth when I rap
'Cause them other boys ain't up top where I'm at
Chevy auto got a filly and the Willie and the high res 
Not a chicken put the liquor in the shot glass
Kinda funny how I stick up when they get mad
This Dirt Rock and we dirtbagz

Put your hands up bitch I done failed to mention
Got a couple dirtbagz and I failed to list 'em
Got a charge at large and it failed the system
Caught a case in the place now they call dementia
If y'all want it come and get it
Y'all gon' get that Sonny Liston
Here to stay down for my one percenters
Merrill-Lynch and it's our business (Ha ha)
See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
Clay asked me if I could spit eight bars
I said sure but I rap about scars
And I got more nation it's gonna take a lot more
Leave 'em layin' in their piss on the vomit floor
Drugs hurt more kids than the common core
Keep 'em in line I'ma commodore
When them dirtbagz pile through your lobby door
You ain't never seen shit like this before (Like this before)
This year I'm rich, last year I was piss poor
Just get up and go get it and I kick doors
Now get your ass out my way or I'll kick yours
Champions baby, Crimson Tide
This the brand new shit the old shit died
Got a whole bunch of dirtbagz down to ride
Born and bred in the south and we live or die, 'Bama

We some low down dirty boys
From the bottom makin' noise
Rollin' through your city bumpin' past Detroit
Brown bourbon just bought a bottle just to fill the void
But I been through state line to state line to make mine
Tell them fake swine, the hate's fine to break mine
It take more than talkin' shit through the grape vine
You gon' need a bigger shotgun to try to take mine
I tell you one thing that I'm not like
It's yellow belly rappers in the spotlight
Makin' you average hoes fold, stop light
Lookin' at these dudes like what you lose, cockeyed
So roll the blunt and blaze the marijuana
From Georgia to Nevada, we spittin' just like a llama
No need for the melodrama, you can pull it on your mama
Dirt Rock motherfucker we the new Americana I'ma dirtbag
Where my dirtbagz at? (Way up from the dirty south)
Where my dirtbagz at? (From the east to the west and way around)
Where my dirtbagz at? (If you don't give a fuck put your hands up now)
Where my dirtbagz at? (We gonna turn up 'til the switchboard )
 & Cymple Man]
All them YouTube views, you think you advancin' (Hah look at this bitch)
He's on stage dancin'
Guess it tickles the fancy
You just ain't shit to me pansy
So keep tiptoein' 'round the fire
'Til you burned all your britches up and then y'all doomed
'Cause you don't really want war you just wanna talk tough, Kim Jung Un
You can get rowdy bro and be the crowds hero
But when I touch the mic you on ground zero
You can suck a dick, bet you saw that comin' right
'Cause you thought a glory hole was a peep hole (Sissy bitch)
I'm probably turnin' you on
I gotta be careful, all the shit that you blown
Not just opportunities I mean the few MC's
That you had to suck to get the fuckers on your song (Yeah)

I ain't playin' with a motherfucker, think it's a game
I'm Wild Bill Hickok with a shotgun
30 aught trigger nine like a pop gun
It's complex but you 'bout to catch a hot one
Dirtbag, dirtbag, what is up dude?
If you ain't there from then it's fuck you
Six feet deep in the dirt right above you
If you ain't ridin' dick when they talk they don't love you
Six shooter tucked down by the abdomen
Tell tha thing get the click like an African
Better get 'em to the point like a javelin
Tryna keep a seat warm in my abstinence
'Cause I'm bad, bitch a dirtbag
Used to ride coach now I'm in first class
'Til you see the top and you wanna turn back
Bitch pallbearers and they ain't really earned that
People call me hater, I know (I know)
I could do what you do, blindfold (Blindfold)
Playin' like a side kick, Tonto (Tonto)
'Til I get to kickin' like a bronco (Bronco)
Thinkin' it's an end, like Sopranos (Sopranos)
But I'm about leave you on a high note (High note)
I do the same thing with my eyes closed (Eyes closed)
Y'all wanna see a beast you will not know
It's the , yeah I'm city and I'm country
Real recognize real and all them pretty women love me
 back to Georgia bought me a four-wheeler
I got a load of money but he's not a drug dealer (Woo woo)
I just touched right down
At the airport flyin' in and out of town
Spend a lot of hours to establish my sound
And I ain't copy cat shit so where the hell is my crown
I be countin' up stacks in the Provost with the LACs
You ain't got a body cap and a hundred snap backs
Sayin' studio trap me knick nack patty wack
Put a  on my vocal, mix it and run this shit back
Gotta wrestle with the strap, beat the case it ain't rap
LEDs in the ditch, that's a hater's pay back
Hundred thousand in the truck, that's a rented Maybach
When you see me in the streets just holler "Dirtbagz"

Where my dirtbagz at? (Way up from the dirty south)
