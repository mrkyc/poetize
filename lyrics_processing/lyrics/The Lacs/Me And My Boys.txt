Meet me on the bar top, hard shots
Nothin' less baby 'til we make this party start
We got nothin' else to do
Put the money in the jukebox, sad song
Nothin' wrong with it if you mix it all in with beer
Yeah, I've got a have a domestic brew
Get me on the dance floor, ten more shots, I'm on
And I'm gonna party 'til the early morn'
Turn the cell phone off, put them Lac boys on (Woo)
Ain't nobody gonna go home

'Cause me and my boys get drunk, 'til the sun comes up
And if I ain't doin' that, hell, then I ain't havin' fun
Talk a little, I shoot the Jack
Maybe call up miss Mary Jane
When the lady gets mad, I just tilt one back
And Me and my boys gon' drink
Me and my boys gon' drink
Me and my boys get drunk

Put my cup in the sky, on a cold river night
Just made some moonshine, taste that sweet apple pie
Got the bonfire blowin' in the back of the house
See there's one way in, and one way out
'Cause I'm a dirt road rider with some spiked up cider
Me and my boys 'bout to pull an all nighter
With the big loud speakers in the back of the truck
Gettin' loud, gettin' drunk, 'til sun comes up, hey!

And if I ain't doin' that, hell, then I ain't havin' fun

And Me and my boys gon' drink
Me and my boys gon' drink
Me and my boys get drunk


Just call me up, I'm headin' to town
If I'm comin', then I'm comin' to stay
Set 'em up, I knock 'em down
And knock it out the way

I've been drinkin' for years, straight tequila and beers
And through the laughter and tears, through the boos and the cheers
And man the man in the mirrors, and thought of callin' it quits
But I'm still finishin' my beers, he's still raisin' his fists
I think I got too many sunrises under my belt
I act a fool just as soon as we get done with this here
I go to town like old Chesney, man I ain't back yet
I'm blowin' doja from Texas to Georgia bit
I like to bust a fat chill, take a big swill
Got so drunk I can't remember if I ate them pills
Aww damn, what is this bottle in my hand?
I'm just sayin', just woke up in my truck
And still not givin' a damn
Me and these Lacs ain't even makin' up noise
Cans cracked, tilted back, stackin' stacks
Just as we're tellin' these stories
And man I think I'm 'bout to run on my boys
Ridin' strong, grippin' hard, actin' fast, singin' songs
It's just me and my boys
'Cause me and my boys get drunk, 'til the sun comes up
And if I ain't doin' that, hell, then I ain't havin' fun
Talk a little, I shoot the Jack
Maybe call up miss Mary Jane
When the lady gets mad, I just tilt one back
And Me and my boys gon' drink
Me and my boys gon' drink
