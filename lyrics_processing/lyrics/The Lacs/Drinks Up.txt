So put your drinks up on the weekend
'Cause them workdays sure been creepin'
What's up? Is anyone gonna get tore up?
Drinks up for party time
Monday mornin' ain't gonna come cheap but
I'm gettin' loose with some folks like me tonight
Yeah, so put your cups up high
Drinks up for party time

I'm on a mission tonight, I prolly ain't comin' home
I got this urge to get drunk and it won't leave me alone
I'm gonna buy a few shots for every one of my boys
Until the owner throws us out for makin' too much noise
So have a hell of a night, go make a memory or two
And if this alcohol involve you, you know we actin' a fool
I'm up on top of the bar, hell I'm way up in the sky
I lost my keys to my car, somebody give me a ride
Hey man I'm losin' my mind with folks that I never seen
We all got one thing in common, we like to drink as a team
I know that I'm gonna crash wake up in somebody's grass
I'm gonna have to tell the boss man to kiss my ass

So put your drinks up on the weekend
'Cause them workdays sure been creepin'

Said I've been workin' all week and I'm just tryin' to get paid
I got enough beer money and today is the day (That's right)
The boss talkin' to me 'bout workin' OT
I sure need the money, but y'all know me (Hah)
For five straight days I've been walkin' the line
And you can stick your overtime where the sun don't shine
If I make it to the truck I got a case on ice
Pop a top, cut a block, and start this night off right
I need to roll to the liquor store to get a few things
I seen a couple homeboys and they was thinkin' the same
They said "Party at the field" I said "I'm already there"
And I'm gonna feel it on Monday man but I don't care
I get my, drink on, (Hey) and my, sing on (Hey)
A little, beer pong, and it won't take long
So put your cups up here, (Yeah) and scream out loud (Yeah)
I gotta say cheers to this party crowd
