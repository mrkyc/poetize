Oh now there she go, she might have done something in
She holler way across the bar, say baby hit me again (That's right)
I need to go another round and party all night long
Tip the band a couple hundred just to keep rockin' on (Woo)
She revved up, fired off, like the Fourth of July
She go to shakin' it around to get a wanderin' eye
And I don't know bout how they do it where you from but son
Them girls out in the country they be gettin' it done

Watch you drop it down, and get it low
Round and round, here she go
Pop, lock, and hit the floor, country girl original
Shake it, shake it, shake it, 'til the sweat pops out
A little shine up in the hind, know what I'm talkin' about
And you know I can't believe exactly what I see
She lookin' better than them heffers on CMT
They call her shotgun Jenny, 'cause shes quick on the draw
Got me twitchin' in my britches with her hand on the wall
Baby doll, with no bra, man I guess it got lost
Look at the size of them thighs, now I'm callin' the hoss
Let's go deep up in the creek before I'm bringin' her back
'Cause I ain't never seen a country girl shake it like that

Oh just a ways down a shady gravel road (Come on)
Yeah there's a jukebox jumpin' on a hardwood floor
And the beers stay ice damn cold (That's right)
There's a neon sign that's a blinkin' (Ha ha)
Big & Rich'll be playin' tonight
And them old Lac boys and a bunch of country girls
And they shakin' everything that they got, just right
