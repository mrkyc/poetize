Redneck boy and I'ma put that on my everything
Y'all say yous and we say y'all
Y'all call it an accent we call it a drawl
Y'all say "Gimme that" and we say "Please, miss"
Y'all eat oatmeal and we eat cheese grits
We do it for the shiners and them dirt road riders
For them forty hour workers and the party all nighters
For the Jim, Jack, Johnny and the Maker's Mark
For them little country towns and them trailer parks
Redneck
And I'ma rep 'til I D-I
A lotta y'all folks still really can't see why
We gotta keep it real all the way 100
We the purest in the world and they can't take that from us
