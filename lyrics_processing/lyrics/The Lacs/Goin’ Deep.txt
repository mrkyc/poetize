Roll up in a game Friday afternoon
Got 'em all loaded up in the camper too
Fire up the grill sit back and chill with a cold one
You got VIP hangin' out with team deep
Time to get wild sling some mud in the creek
Sun goin' down no stoppin' us now
Come on boys we got trails to ride down

Goin' deep in the mud
Poppin' suds catch a buzz
Rain or shine were gonna have some fun
Skinnin' it back cooler on the back rack
Sexy southern girls give you a heart attack
No asphalt, no concrete
Just ridin' these trails down through the creek
If you're scared we don't care
You can watch them over there
Just wait and you'll see
We're all about goin' deep
Yeah goin' deep
(Yeah, don't be scared of it now, woo)

Man I've been workin' like a dog bunch of over time son
But it's finally payin' off I got my money stacked up (Yup)
Me and my buddies spend the weekend in the mud
Bought the biggest baddest ride just to go and tear it up
Don't back up for nothin' even if it sink (Hey)
Just in case I do I put my cooler on the bank
Just some redneck boys tryin' to beat the heat
Little country girls scream when you drive it in deep

We're all about goin' deep
Yeah goin' deep
(That's right, aww yeah, that's how we do it
That's the only way we know)

I got that camouflage Can-Am, hit that hole a damn HAM
Redneck Woodstock that's the word around town
The cooler strapped down and a gun up in the rack
'Cause they yellin' ain't no tellin' man when we comin' back
Follow us if you wanna but I hope you can drive
Or be snorkeled up (Yeah) 'cause you ain't keepin' it dry
You better autobox the phones so they don't get soaked
And hold on to what you got or better hope it can float
Goin' deep in the mud
Poppin' suds catch a buzz
Rain or shine were gonna have some fun
Skinnin' it back cooler on the back rack
Sexy southern girls give you a heart attack
No asphalt, no concrete
Just ridin' these trails down through the creek
