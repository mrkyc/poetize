She's a back road rider
That pulls all nighter
She's the pedal to the floor that makes me hold on tighter
A couple shots of her and I start to lose control
She's the Jack in my Coke
(She's the Jack, she's the Jack)

I wake up every mornin' thankin' God that I found her
Can't control myself every time I come around her
She's my best friend, road dog and my homie
No need for lookin' cause she's my one and only
She's my crutch if I can't walk, voice if I can't talk
Sexiest thing I ever seen and that ain't all
Boy she can get down, handy with a gun
She's a deer lead shoots and hits 'em on the run
She ain't the kind of girl that likes the ritzy little wine
She's the kind that puts the chicken livers on the line
Then catch the catfish she skins 'em up to fry
She's my baby, the reason I love my life

She's a back road rider
That pulls all nighter
She's the pedal to the floor that makes me hold on tighter
A couple shots of her and I start to lose control
Yeah she deserves all the finer things she desires
Thank God she's in love with this 9 to 5'er
She's a movie star and me I'm an Average Joe
She's the Jack in my Coke
(She's the Jack, she's the Jack)
She's the Jack in my Coke

My whiskey woman got it goin' on
We date back to 98', tastes kinda strong
But y'all know everything is better with age
I pop a top on her and drink it for the rest of the day (That's right)
You know E&J is fine with me and cheap as hell
If I can't find a friend of mine the key makes me drunk as hell
Lately I've been sippin' on the bourbon up in Tennessee
Two or three shots of that and I'ma have to take a knee
Buy a ring and get a spot we can chill
While gettin' Scotch in bottles, we can get to poppin' the seal
She got me buzzin' on the strongest stuff that I've ever found
Just a couple shots and man I end up chasin' her down

She's a back road rider
That pulls all nighter
She's the pedal to the floor that makes me hold on tighter
A couple shots of her and I start to lose control
Yeah she deserves all the finer things she desires
Thank God she's in love with this 9 to 5'er
