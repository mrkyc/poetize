It's a long ride, long road, long line of a lot of shows
Look close and you can see my crooked little smile
I've been dreamin' about it my whole life
I think it put a few pounds on me
Ol' six string kinda sticks out on me
A bunch of fast food, a ton of Bud Light
Little sound check always keeps the band tight
Coast to coast doin' shows for good folks
Man I love it but I never wanna see it snow again
Nothin' in the world like a bunch of fans
Singing every line holdin' up the beer cans
Dear friends gotta roll but we had a blast
Need sleep and a couple of us need a bath
Hang out with the youngin's and my better half
Mama's cookin' me a honey ham

Now I'm goin' back to Georgia
Just can't wait to see that old state line
Now I'm goin' back to Georgia
Been laid up here got Georgia on my mind

The alarm clock's ringin', gotta get up, gotta go
But them boys still singin', gotta hit another show
I holler at my boys 'cause you know we stay down
I try to bring 'em out every time we came around
Packin' the bags and livin' outta suitcase
So bad on the road that the food tastes
Missin' home and mama's cornbread
It won't be long until I'm in my own bed
I keep rollin' and just play it to 'em every night
I take a swig of the shine to get my head right
Chasin' dreams right behind the headlights
A song is good for the soul if it's said right
Ten more days and ten more shows
Got that rig stretched out, let the black smoke roll
When we get back home no phones will ever find me
Wastin' time way back up in the pine trees

Now I'm goin' back to Georgia

Now I'm goin' back to Georgia
Just can't wait to see that old state line
