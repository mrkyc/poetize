That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
It's half past 12 and now I know that you're just a memory
It's the middle of the night I'm feeling so right with my fist full drinkin
Baby done gone, when you comin home, I guess thats wishful thinkin
A drunk mans words are a simple mans thoughts, at least thats what I've heard
If that's the case look around this place, because now I'm better off without her
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
It's half past 2 and now I know that you're just a memory
You never did say I was right
Wasn't that hard to do
Now I get a buzz every night
Never made one damn shit to you you told me you love me but baby I don't lie
Might've said this could've said that but you said goodbye
Makes me want to drink till the sun comes up like an old West cowboy
Made my round, every bar in town
Get drunk because I ain't your cowboy no more

That you ain't the one for me

Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know

It's half past 5 and now I know that you're just a memory
You're just a memory
I've been doing a little thinking in a whole lot of drinking
You better call the Coast Guard because baby we sinking
In a river of a love that never did exist
Took a cooler full of beer just realize this
Put a quarter in the jukebox, me and you were on the rocks, play another sad song to see where it stops
In the corner of my mind I knew it wasn't going to last
Pop a top, cut a block, and let's leave it in the past
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
