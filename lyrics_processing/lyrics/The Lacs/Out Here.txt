Yeah, better know where you at out here

Just a roughneck, country bumpkin
What y'all think? Keep it comin'
Close knit, we take care of our own
We'll be here when y'all long gone
Pine trees, the black ground
Them country folks don't back down
Better learn how to act 'round
Or get your ass straight slapped down
My daddy taught me how to hold a gun
Lead and shoot, hit em' on the run
Plow and plant, live off the land
Hunt and fish and how to be a man
We don't need no grocery store
Just go to the field and get some more
We tried to tell them city folks
But they won't ever really know
Got a old knife and a old truck
Bunch of old guns and some old stuff
I was taught to live them old ways
Been doin' this since them old days
We don't need no big mansion
Just a mud hole or a river landin'
Crank it up, grow with us
We'll show y'all how the country does

Out here, shotguns and buck knives
Disappear in the woods by sunrise
And out here, it's all built with your hands
You gotta live it to understand, that's how we do it
Way out here where the law don't be patrollin'
You can throw back beer, raise hell, no one'll know it
Buddy, way out here, it's slow and easy livin'
Got a buzz on chillin'
That's how we do it out here (Way out here)

Southern talk, southern raised
I'll be damn, I ever change
Hit that jar, pass it 'round
Kick back, Pa gon' tell 'em
'Bout them dirt roads, that dead-end
Them rednecks get loose
And my four-wheel drives my best friend
That Bentley ain't gon' do (Naw)
So I creep on to that creek bank
'Bout drunk as hell, can't see straight
That jon boat with a twenty-five
Pay me no mind, ease by
No street lights flashin' on
No service on my cell phone
That shine got a little bit of bite
But it goes down right, call it that homegrown
Boys, how y'all like that shotgun?
Ain't got to aim when I pop one
That buck up in the back of that truck
Them boys like, "Damn, he got one"
I shoot it, skin it, clean it
Drop it in my pot to fry
If the rack is big enough
I hang it on my wall to shine
Ain't no lie, can't do that
Granddaddy find out, whip that ass
Redneck laws we grew up on
Take them back roads, can't go wrong
Buddy, my bloodline and my last name
Ain't shit changed about me
See, y'all high class and I'm white trash
And that's all I'm ever gon' be (Yeah)
Out here, shotguns and buck knives
Disappear in the woods by sunrise
And out here, it's all built with your hands
You gotta live it to understand, that's how we do it
Way out here where the law don't be patrollin'

(Out, out-out-out here) Where we come from
(Out here, out-out here) We like to shoot our guns
(Out, out-out-out here) We take care of our own
(Out here, out-out here) That's where we call home
I said out here, where we come from
Out here, we like to shoot our guns
I said out here, we take care of our own
Out here, that's where we call home
