I'm feelin' good about tonight, I'm country boy fresh
I'm what them country girls like cause I'm country boy fresh
Dirty boots, dirty truck, where I stay is a wreck
But that's just how I ride because I'm country boy fresh

I love my Atlanta Braves ball cap
It's almost black from the tree sap
I'm a country boy with no newly suits
Got my slip on Georgia boots
When I get dressed I don't need no mirror
Brand new shirt where's my scissors
Cut it up and take the tag
Use the sleeves for an ole' grease rag
My Levi's got them blood stains
From that eight-point buck I shot last spring
Yea I shot him out of season
But I had me a real good reason
I was in my feed, makin' my rounds
Seen a buck, laid him down
Loaded him up went straight to town
Got that meat hundred eighty pounds

Yeah, slide into my blue jeans
So fresh so clean
Head on out to that mud hole
Hot girls and the beer ice cold
It's just me and my redneck buddies
A couple of chains cause it might get muddy
Cash my check buy my drink
Find me a lil' ole country thang
Yeah, I'm gonna get my buzz on
Don't wanna hear no love song
Gonna get drunk 'til the sun comes up
'Cause that's just what us rednecks does
Idle on down that back road find a lil' spot to park
Man you down by the creek got a bunch of wood
Let's see if we can make a spark, come on
