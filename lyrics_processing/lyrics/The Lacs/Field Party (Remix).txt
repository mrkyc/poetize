You damn right it's Friday night
Grab the Busch and the Bud Light
Meet me in the pasture back in the pines
We in the spot that the cops can't find
Turn up the Jones turn up the jar
Fire up the smoke grab that old guitar
We're just some good ol' boys and girls about to get wild
It's goin' down field party style

We in the field check, back in the woods check
We havin' a party check, it's gon' get rowdy yeah
That's what I thought would happen
When me and the Lacs start rappin'
JJ gon' do some sangin'
Country girls start shakin' that thing and
Ain't nothin' better than bein' out at the field party
See Bobbie Joe drop it low, she got that real body
Man she can plow a field, and she can skin a buck
Barely got that big ol' truck, she's hot and loves to fish
Man I wish y'all could see exactly what I'm seein'
And if Picasso painted country this is where he'd be in
Ain't nothing better than tan lines and tailgates
Two steppin' under heaven to a little George Strait

I got some mason jugs, I say let's pass 'em round
If you ain't gettin' drunk, you with the wrong crowd
You see that smoke cloud comin' from around the shed
Halo shades on hidin' cause my eyes are red
Yeah, it's about to be a fun night, cooler full of Bud Light
Party til' the sunlight, sunlight
Yeah, I don't see not law around, drinkin' til' we all drown
Yeah that's how we get down, get down
Aww them Lac boys is back again
We comin' through we done brought some friends
We bring the food, and we bring the shine
We get the party crunk every time
Bout to hit that stage I'm fittin' to sing
And I done drank a fifth of Beam
But I don't fall down to the ground
And just hit them with that country lean
Gonna get back up and I fill my cup
Come on Colt let's crank it up
There's a party back in that right field
Way up past that shine still
Get on in and shut the gate
So the cops can't come and regulate
We wouldn't have it another way
It's Friday night, so I say
You damn right it's Friday night
