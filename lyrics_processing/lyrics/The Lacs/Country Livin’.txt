Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light
Yeah we talk slow, most of us poo', but I think I found paradise
Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light

You never catch me straight laid back, all up in the Maybach
That don't  make them work boots face that
I'd rather be up in the '81 Chevy with the 8 track
Bumpin' that way back, rollin' clean like Ajax
Rollin' through Savanna with a Vanna like I'm Sajak
Hey Pat I know that you hate that
But the haters lookin' at me like they don't want a guppie
Like how did he say that (Say that)
But I don't think I'm out of order just a country boy reporter
That just simply has to state facts (State facts)
'Cause I've been pimpin' since pimpin
And shrimpin' and dippin' and limpin'
And you can check up on the day back (Day back)
I got a camouflage cutie with a bangin' little bootie
Now how you gonna rate that (Rate that)
If you ever think I'm lyin' just to hit 'em and rewind
And listen for the play back (Play back)

Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light
Yeah we talk slow, most of us poo', but I think I found paradise
Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light

See The Lacs LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
I creep back up in the cypress stump lake
Find a big ol' chunky lighter
Got her tied up with a chain (Yeah)
It's free pickin's if you live around close
If you don't Mr. Remington will let your ass go
Ain't nothin' much goin' on past 10
Bunch of high school friends huntin' shit to get into
Pretty soon you got that crooked ass grin
'Cause the hunch punch gin runs about 110 proof
See I can show you how to creep 'round incognito
Lay the seat down in that dookie brown El Camino
Stay up whiskey bent and hell bound
How you like my creedo
I ain't sweatin' 'bout gettin' caught
'Cause the law is all we know
You see a patch of woods me I see potential
Wrap a fence around the edge
And throw some cattle in the middle
Hey it ain't much of your business
But this tractor ain't a rental
Front to back, back and forth
Matter fact, now play your fiddle boy

Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light
Yeah we talk slow, most of us poo', but I think I found paradise
Now baby this country livin' let me think I never wanna see the light
