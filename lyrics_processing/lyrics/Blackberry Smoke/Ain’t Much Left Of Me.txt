Well my fall from grace was a sight to see
Good turned to bad and bad turned to misery
I found out what it is and what it's not
And all I ask for sure ain't what I got, no
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see, no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me, no me
Thought that I'd hit bottom but I ain't there yet
'Cause you'd be surprised at how low a man can get
I watched all them dreams slip through my hands
Now I'm getting out of here while I still can
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see, no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me
That's right mama

Nobody even cared what became of me
Do I have to get down on my knees
And ask the Lord above, have mercy please?

Well there ain't much left of me
I said there ain't much left of me, no
