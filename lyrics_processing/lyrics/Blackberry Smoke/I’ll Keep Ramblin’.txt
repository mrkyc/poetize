Solid gold watch in my front pocket
Hangin' on a shiny diamond tree
John B. Stetson hat that I am wearin'
Just to keep my head out of the rain
Big, fat road of borrowed money
Twenty-five years of borrowed time
Ain't no tellin' where I'm goin, baby
Let me tell you, that suits me just fine

Nothin' can hold me still for too long
I sing a trav'lin' song
Can't put a thing on a stone when it rolls
Believe I'll keep ramblin' on and on

I don't play with just one mama
I got all of 'em in the game
Hollywood to New York City
You best believe they know my name
Wide open is the way I'm trav'lin'
All-in is the only way I bet
You can tell me "Home is where the heart is," mama
But I'll tell ya "I ain't found mine yet"
