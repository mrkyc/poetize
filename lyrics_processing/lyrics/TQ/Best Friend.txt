My best friend
I remember the day I met ya
U almost drove me crazy
So much you had me going
(But it wasn't like my girlfriend)
As I commence to get to know ya
All the things that I told ya
Times you asked me to hold ya
Pretty damn hard to explain
You always talked about being so lonely
How your nigga always trippin'
Tellin' me he treat ya like shit
Don't know why you messing with him
Just couldn't find no happiness
But your to damn beautiful for this
So my only mission is
To prevent from anyone
Trippin' on my best friend
(Chorus)
I'm gon' get there
You gon' be there too
Only wanna see you happy
In case you didn't know, you're my best friend
You got me and it's gon' be us too
So now you gotta keep your head up
I'm gonna be your best friend
You might also likeEverytime I'd sit and think about it
You make me wanna check that busta
But your so far away
Plus you wouldn't let me anyway
Everytime I see ya why you gotta be crying
Don't look like you get no sleep at night
Baby girl is everything alright
I ain't gonna worry 'bout ya
But I got so much damn love for ya
It's a struggle to keep my sanity when I know you ain't happy
And I'm trying let you be
But it just don't work
Cos any minute I be in the club going burzerk
Wouldn't work on that jerk that's pulling your skirt
Your proctecting so nobody hurt you no more
If your coming with me baby
I'm a open the door
And u ain't got to cry no more
(Chorus - 2x)
I can't lie
You would be my baby if I didn't have a girlfriend
Only one I'm not gon' be in love with
And then we'd be huggin'
And if a mothafucka try to hurt you, I'm actin' up
You don't need to worry, I'm a serve on him (chop him up)
You ain't lived your life enough to let this punk nigga box you up
(That's why I got your love)
