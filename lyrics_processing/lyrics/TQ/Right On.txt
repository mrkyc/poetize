In my city it's a summer night
I'm rollin in my caddy
I'm listening to marvin gaye
I got my seat laid way back
As i slide down the boulevard
I see the ladies and i pass em
This is my beautiful ghetto scene
And it's the only way i'll have it
This is californication
We keep it gangsta
I don't know what they told you
But get it together
Cause it don't stop
And it won't stop
And it can't stop
We keep it going forever
And i got my hat to the back
Drop my top
My base bump all
Through the parking lot
I gets my ride on
Right on
And i got me a fresh throw back
Air force ones
Step on the scene
Bout to have some fun
I gets my ride on
Right on, right on

I ain't trippin homie
Hustle why you wanna
Goin out to the girls in at the nail shop
You ain't scared to back it up and let it drop, drop, drop
Yeah baby that's alligator skin
I'm coverin up all the swooshes
And feel free to bring a couple of friends
I'ma show you how to do this
Out here it's just a way of life
You get used to it
Good dro mixed with good sunshine
Can't you hear it in the music
Give me love
This is californication
We keep it gangsta
I don't know what they told you
But get it together
Cause it don't stop
And it won't stop
And it can't stop
Gotta keep it going forever
And i got my hat to the back
Drop my top
My base bump all
Through the parking lot
I gets my ride on
Right on
And i got me a fresh throw back
Air force ones
Step on the scene
Bout to have some fun
I gets my ride on
Right on, right on
I come from next to nothing
I'ma have not
I still got pride in what i have got
And ya'll remember when we sold rocks
And now we ain't gotta, god bless hip hop
We sip crystal and smoke weed all day
That's the only way to play
Throw all them silly cares away
Holla if you hear me now
Dedicated to them boys on the corner
I ain't trippin homie
Hustle why you wanna
Goin out to the girls at the nail shop
You ain't scared to back it up and let it drop, drop, drop
This is comin from the california kid
Gemini baby
Comin at ya in a couple minutes
This is something crazy
And i got my hat to the back
Drop my top
My base bump all
Through the parking lot
I gets my ride on
Right on
And i got me a fresh throw back
Air force ones
Step on the scene
Bout to have some fun
I gets my ride on
