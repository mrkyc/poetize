Where my folks at
It's your boy
And we're about to take it back (can we go back a little bit)
Way back (back a little bit)
That's right
Wake up, wake up, holla at ya boy
I gotta little story to tell ya
I know I've been gone for a minute
But I'm back on the block
Coming right back where I left ya
I represent the worldwide westside
You heard many times
I'm California's son
Go get a case of ice cold coronas and
Meet me at the corner and
I tell ya how the west was won
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"this could be heaven or this could be hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...

Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
"please bring me my wine"
He said, "we ain't had that spirit here since 1989"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
Cold cristal on ice
She said "we are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with they steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Nooo
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the pa$sage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive"
