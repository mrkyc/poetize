I kinda wanna drive Lexuses
Sit back and live life high with the best of shit
WIth a wrist full of ice in my president
And a pocket full of Debbies that you can't imagine
Guaranteed to make the best of it
To have a yacht on a lake with water beds in it
And a whole lot of women that are singin' to my shit
With they hands up in the audience
Screamin' they want it - they want it
When I was a lot younger, I used to sit up at
The park and drink on St. Ides
Drunk as fuck I used to wonder why
Some niggas roll sixty-four on D's
And some niggas let their khakis hang on their knees
Will I end up like one of these?
Or smoke trees overseas and rock wimbley
Bring back a black bentley full of Henessey
And earl grey tea sippin' it with naomi - and they on me!
I wonder how it happened so fast
To from 33b to 1st class laughin'
And all you hatas' are hurt bad...Imagine
(Hook)
Before I go to sleep at night
I say a prayer to the Lord above
And I'm hopin' that he shows me luv
Cause my shit be hot enough
To have the world dancin'
Smokin weed on the beach in the sand and
All my ladies look well in Chanel and Donna
If I trip they got my bail so farewell your honor
Ain't got no time for drama
Too busy chillin' with the mamas in the Bahamas
And everybody got they own bag of ganja
And you can go and roll a bleezie if you wanna
Ain't got to worry 'bout nobody al up on ya!

Give me a house in Fayetteville and a blue five hundred
Next door to Evander in the tub with Michelle and Samantha
And a black pet panther, you ring the doorbell
I don't answer and you can't stand it
And you askin' TQ why you act this way
Cause it's too many hatas' with somethin' to say
I'm too busy blowin' up with my homeboy J!
