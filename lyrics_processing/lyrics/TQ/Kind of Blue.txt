Every time I think about you
It makes me so damn frustrated
Make me do sh!t I don't wanna do (get over it)
If somebody told me that we wouldn't make it
I would of quickly told them just what they can do
But I'm realising lately that this bond is breaking
And it's got me kind of blue
Every time I think about you
All I see is blue
Every night I dream about you
I wake up kind of blue
Got me kind of blue
I'm kind of blue
Got me kind of blue
I ain't no punk I won't let let it be the death of me
But it's driving me crazy like I'm driving miss daisy
So I guess ima keep the rest to me
Forbenefit that I can go better with it
I wishthat somebody told me
That we wasn't forever
I would of left you alone and let you do you
You'd probably be married I probably would too
And It's got me kind of blue

Never say never
Never say always
And nothing gold can stay
All's fair in loveand war
That's what they say
I'm over it
It's just the nature of things
I know it's kind of strange
Might just think your wife might not peep change
We got something old I guess we need something new
All our time was borrowed and now we kind of blue
Every time I think about you
All I see is blue
Every night I dream about you
I wake up kind of blue
Got me kind of blue
I'm kind of blue
