Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Ow, ooh, ooh, yeah

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you (oh)
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see
Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me
From the first moment I saw you
Ooh, I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you
I was rapping till the sun came up
Telling you how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you were afraid
Were you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
That's why

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you (I adore you baby)
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see
Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me
You might also likeWhen we be making love
I only hear the sounds
Of heavenly angels scream
Tears of joy pouring down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix (I know)
And I know and/that you know I ain't joking baby
They know this is serious
I ain't f**king just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby, please
You can tear my house up
Burn up all my clothes (you can burn up my clothes)
Smash up my ride (you can smash up my ride)
Maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face all over the place (Do you think?)
Do you think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
Nothing dares, nothing dares to compare (Nothing could compare)
To your lovely face (to your lovely face)
Do you hear what I'm trying to tell you this evening?
Trying, trying to say
Just trying to say
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
Adore you
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wonder
Gave you my heart
Beauty I still see
Adore you
Beauty I still see
All the time I am with you
Aww baby
Until the end of time, I'll be there for you (until the end of time)
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see (still see, yeah)
Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me

Until the end of time
You own my heart and mind, I truly, truly, truly adore you, baby
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see (still see, yeah)
Love's too weak to define, til the end of all time

Until the end of time, I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind
You own my heart and mind, I'll give you my body, yeah, I'll give you my time
