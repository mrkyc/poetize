I'm 'bout to take this back
Way back

Keep on rollin' on
You wanna rollin' on and on
Keep on rollin' on
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Keep on rollin' on
Roll on, keep on

Hey Marvin
How is it lookin' man?
Can you ask that question again?
What's goin' on, what's goin' on?
And Jackie, hey
Will you teach me how to glide across the stage?
You look like a pimp, my man
(Like a pimp, like a pimp, my man)
On my mama's video tape
Oh, in my band I got Jemi and Kurt Cobain
Roger is bangin' the drums
I got all of the temps singin' backgrounds, baby
And Jay's on the ones, yes he is
In my garage, just doin' it for the soul
On a well put together beat melody the story is told
You might also like
You just keep on rollin' on
You might be gone, yeah, but not forgotten, no
Keep on singin' on
'Cos I can hear it, all in my soul
Keep on rappin' on

I know you're gone yeah, but not forgotten no
Keep on livin' on
'Cos every night all alone in my studio
Every time that I write a new song
Roll on
Miss Billie
I ain't never heard a voice like yours
Sounds so beautiful to me
Kinda like the birds in the trees
Aaliyah, I wish we could a did a song
But baby girl, when I get my wings
I wanna sing your precious love
Your precious love
In a lil' juke joint down in New Orleans
Can you hear miles blowin' his horn?
I wanna hear it
I got the Mike, he about to join in
(All eyes on me)
As soon as he finish his blunt
And easy and left eye
And Frank and Sammy at the bar
Believe me
(Believe me)
We miss ya
(We miss ya)
We never let you go too far

Keep on rollin' on
You might be gone, yeah, but not forgotten, no
Keep on singin' on, 'cos I can hear it
All in my soul
Keep on rappin' on

I know you're gone yeah, but not forgotten no
Keep on livin' on
'Cos every night all alone in my studio
Every time that I write a new song
Roll on
It's kinda like a letter, if you will
A lil' somethin' just to get it off my mind
I've been gone for a minute
But I'm back on the block
Just in the nick of time
(Just in the nick of time)
A couple of bars just to warm up you insides
Ghetto, holla and make you feel like
Every thing's gonna be alright
Every thing's gonna keep alright
(You just keep on rollin' on)
You might be gone, yeah, but not forgotten, no
Keep on singin' on
'Cos I can hear it
All in my soul
(All in my soul)
Keep on rappin' on
