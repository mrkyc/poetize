That remember what they used to
Used to be the one I looked up to (A lot of people these days)
Tell me what the hell done happened to you (Given opportunities take them for granted)
And now you can't even come around (So this one right here)
I bet you think about it on your way down (Just exposure homeboy)
We was nothin but little boys
But you was about 2 years older
Spending most of our time in trouble and
Listening to my mama straight scold us
Be in the house before 7: 30
Go take a bath cause you're dirty
And put some more greens on your plate
We walked to school every morning
Scrappin with the niggas on the corner
And still we're never late
Used to write rhymes in the classroom
Rock shows in the bathroom (I charge a dollar)
You wanted to be like Ice Cube
I wanted to be like Iceberg Slim
Remember how we made them holler
Being a rap singer is all you talked about
You got a record deal I got kicked out
I saw your video couldn't believe
You was the same nigga did bang with me
And didn't look like you used to ride like we used to
You might also like
Used to be the one I looked up to
Used to be the one I wanted to be like
Tell me what the hell done happened to you
Used to know you when you slanged in the street life
And now you can't even come around
Used to be my homie now you act like you don't know me
I bet you think about it on your way down
Remember the things you're used to
Had the nerve to come back to the neighborhood
After all these years (I had to keep the homies off of you)
Cause they sons in the school house trippin tryin to be like you
And it's costing valuable time in they lives and mine
Thinkin that the only way you hot is if you rappin about the money you got
Nigga please you didn't always have cheese
Remember me I used to be with you
Used to slang weed in the street with you
Split the G with you
And I always believed in you
But now you switched up you on channel 2
Is them grindstones glued to your shoes?
Danced around lookin like a fool with your lip pierced
Don't you ever try to come around here
You a disgrace
The real you done got misplaced
Give me your neighborhood pass
Would you wack that ass
Used to be the one I looked up to
Used to be the one I wanted to be like
Tell me what the hell done happened to you
Used to know you when you slanged in the street life
And now you can't even come around
Used to be my homie now you act like you don't know me
I bet you think about it on your way down
Remember the things you're used to
Who's to blame for the shame on what people do for fame
To have a name in the game
No love for the music
Remember Marvin used to do it
This shit meant something and you knew it
(And we knew it damn we blew it) These days we only wishing
For top position and doin anything to get them
What the hell wrong with them
Forgot about the blues and the rhythm
And that's why I keep on dissin and representing like I used to

Used to be the one I looked up to
Used to be the one I wanted to be like
Tell me what the hell done happened to you
Used to know you when you slanged in the street life
And now you can't even come around
Used to be my homie now you act like you don't know me
I bet you think about it on your way down
Remember the things you're used to
Used to be the one I looked up to
Used to be the one I wanted to be like
Tell me what the hell done happened to you
Used to know you when you slanged in the street life
And now you can't even come around
Used to be my homie now you act like you don't know me
I bet you think about it on your way down
Remember the things you're used to
Used to be the one I looked up to (Yeah for the ones who stayed real)
Tell me what the hell done happened to you (did they thing)
And now you can't even come around (And still remember what they used to)
I bet you think about it on your way down (Y'all know the ones I'm talking too)
Used to be the one I looked up to
