Ain't the same no more
Ain't the same no more
(Chorus)
It ain't the same
Waking up at night with you not there and by my side girl
It ain't the same
Riding in my 64' Chevy only if you were here beside girl
It ain't the same
Seeing your picture on the wall to me is like a broken memory
It ain't the same
Tryin not to let it get me
It ain't the same
I used to walk through this front door
It used to be the second that I waited for all day, yeah
Now there's just an echo inside this place
(It ain't the same)
And I don't know what I'm gonna do no more
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
How many nights can I drink myself to death just to not have to hear you moaning?
So many nights we filled this room with sex, it was the best
And now she's gone and...
I never missed my water till my well dried up
And now I think I'm dying of thirst
You might also like(Chorus)
It ain't the same
Waking up at night with you not there and by my side girl
It ain't the same
Riding in my 64' Chevy only if you were here beside girl
It ain't the same
Seeing your picture on the wall to me is like a broken memory
It ain't the same
And I'm tryin not to let it get me
It ain't the same
Could it be that I'm losing my entire mind right now, yeah
Or maybe i'm just jumping the gun?
You don't know what I'm going through without you
(You don't know what I'm going through with you)
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Maybe I should find a shrink or somethin
Somebody help me
Cause my resistance is droppin and that ain't healthy
I mean i'm missing you baby deep in my belly
And I'm all messed up yes
I guess I'll take a minute to find myself some good smoke
Cause my mind can't take the pain, yeah
(Chorus)
It ain't the same
Waking up at night with you not there and by my side girl
It ain't the same
Riding in my 64' Chevy only if you were here beside girl
It ain't the same
Seeing your picture on the wall to me is like a broken memory
It ain't the same
And I'm tryin not to let it get me
It ain't the same
