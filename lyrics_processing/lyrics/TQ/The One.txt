Ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gonna sing you this song
Yeah yeah, baby
I've never been that kind of nigga
To write a love song, oh no
At least a real one
(But this is the one)
I can't believe it but I thinnk I found my baby
Cuz boy she really got me goin'
And I don't understand, this wasn't in the plan
I think somebody sent me the one
1-I think about the things I shouldn't have done
I never shoulda said that I wouldn't find one
That would be everything I need, love me for me
So actually I'm feelin' kinda dumb
Cuz you are the one
Knocked down on the plane, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Couple of nights on the stage, I was singing 'bout you
Guess I shoulda never said anything
Cuz I'm eatin' my words everytime I wake up in my bed
I'm alone,and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
You might also likeWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Always put my thhoughts on paper
But I ain't got no paper
So I'ma put this on this dream of mine
To spend the rest of my life with you
I run my fingers through that long ass hair you got
We get to kissin', everybody start starin' at us
But I just act like everybody ain't there
I really don't care
Cuz you are the one
Ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
Make a nigga going that crazy
What would I do without it?
You even got me singin' about it
You aroung me, only way to be
The times the game done had me down
The only thing that pulled me up
Repeat 1 I think about.....
Can I see you sittin' in the studio?
Makes me wanna hurry and finish
So we can do explore each other
Cuz I wonder
What I can make you do before I even get there
Just wanna nibble on them earrings that you wear
All I can think about is takin' you home
So I'm about to end my song
