Steady Mobb'n
L.A. to the Bay, Atlanta GA
Yeah
That's the way we do it baby
They never saw me coming
Like a thief in the night
Haven't you heard about it?
New nigga in town, everybody listen
I got a message for you, don't want you to miss it
Gangstas make the world go round, as it was written
That's why at every show, somebody trippin'
So listen
Now I like to smoke weed & drink straight yak
And fuck wit dime pieces, because I got it like that
Make all the strippers love me, because my tips stay fat
And my 'Lac is all that
Haven't you heard about it?
1 -      Got every ghetto in the country wantin' it
Even if they playa hate, they bumpin' it
(Can't live without it)
I heard you're lookin' for that real life gangsta shit
But they never saw me coming
Haven't you heard about it?
You might also likeTo all my niggas down south, I know what you like
And all my peoples on the west, it's on tonight
(Can't live without it)
And everybody in the east, believe me
Anybody talkin' beef, can eat these
They never saw me coming
We make the front page story in every city
Couldn't believe all the niggas that was down wit me
Had all these other bustas lookin' silly
We don't ride no ponies, just roll on goldies
Nigga please
Come off that shit, this is a new era
Straighten up your sideburns, stop wearin' mascara
I hope it's for the sake of sellin' records
Either way, you need to check yourself about bein' a real nigga
So figure
My momma told me I was unexplainable
Said I was gifted, but I chose to act a fool
And in the end, it be the fool that got me through
Even back in school, I used to dream about it
To have the whole world screamin', throwin' up their dubs
Just wanna give 'em what they needin', and show 'em love
Truth is I'm a thug
But I still can blow, so what
So tell me the motha-fuckin' problem
Haven't you heard about it?
Repeat 1

??? face the fact
Never thought, never knew I would come like that
No time to make a track
Drunk off yak
Still no excuse, for Mr. Magoo
Some niggas wanna trip off Tim-buck 2
Pass me a blunt, I like to get blunted
Never saw me comin' in a black 600
Bump it like a bitch
Got a twitch in da switch
We oughtta know who major rich
Sound like my son
Better ride in this shit
Learn to love these west coast hits
Stop makin' tracks wit all the same kids
Better close the deal
Let's keep it on the real
Never understood how you managed a deal
Smashed up the town
Got money by the pound

Haven't you heard about it?
