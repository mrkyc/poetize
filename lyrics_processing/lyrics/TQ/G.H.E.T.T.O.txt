G.H.E.T.T.O
This is how u start one
Where u start it from
On a mission to check
Those that forgot that
I need a couple of minutes to bring the thought back got that
I never let another muthafucka
Tell me what to slang about
Especially when my only intention
To tell ya bout what I'm thinking now
Sang a song to tell ya bout hustlin'
Another one to tell ya bout the lord
Duty is to give 'em something funky
That the only thing I do it 4
(Bridge)
I can't tell you bout
Shit I don't know shit bout
I ain't gonna holla screamin' loud
Only thing I'm all bout
(Chorus)
I got that G.H.E.T.T.O
Take all of my niggas everywhere I go
In the green Range Rover, or the Lex to go
With my Iceburgs rollin' the flow
My people know G.H.E.T.T.O
And we don't give a fuck if everybody know
Cuz I'm (na na na) baby that's for sure
Take the bullshit back to the store
I got the G.H.E.T.T.O
Do it 4 the figures
Magazines and Videos
If u wanna find another nigga
This one do it 4 the soul
Always used to dream of getting bigga
Only 4 my people
That's why I'm always checkin' fake niggas
On forgettin' where they came from
You might also like(Bridge)
(Chorus)
Made me believe in the hustle
Told me to get my money
Weed gon' be my muscle
Well here we go now
In my neighborhood, eastside Compton California
My homies all like to spend the night under lights
Streamin' dice and fight
So this nigga just happen to write about it
Make a point to spit flames at the names who disrespect the game
I was a down ass youngster and I'm still the same
And I can see right through you niggas
Before the fame and TV, you was a real nigga just like me
On my block, I ain't never seen a nigga wear high heeled shoes
I ain't never seen a nigga dance with no groom
I ain't never seen a nigga get his hair all bleached
And if he did, he'd get his ass beat for bein' a punk nigga
