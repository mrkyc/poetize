I remember, I remember
When it just wasn't like this
I remember when we was hungry
And we wasn't riding on six
I remember when we didn't have chips
Still had to try to make the best of it
I remember, baby, I remember

I was a lonely boy had
Nothing to do but hustle up on my block
I was the only boy and
Still had it in me that I was never gon' stop
Be up on the bus stop, baby
Working for the new white Jordans
Dog, I mean I didn't have nothing
And that's the way it was, the way it was
Now a whole lot of shit different
All around the world I ball
Candy coated drop top Lexus
Hot boy for all y'all (all y'all)
Dip through my neighborhood
Still the same it's never gon' change
So much love filled with pain
And I always will remember when I

Flakes with no milk
Clothes with no silk in
And I remember when this life just used to be ugly

That's why I'm thankful for what I got
'Cause Lord knows, I'm never getting shot
Sometimes I'm wondering when I'm a pop
But if I never, then I long for what I got
That's why I'm thankful for what I got (so thankful)
'Cause Lord knows, I'm never getting shot
And I know I could be (I know)
