Big Tray Deee up in here
Layin' fools down wit the homie TQ
I gots to do this for my bread & meat
This the only way I know how to eat
Fools don't know I'm steady on the come up
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Verse 1: Tray Deee
Well, I was takin' up surveylance, tryin' to peep this lick
To get the layout raps, so I could peal his ?flip?
This outta town nigga tryin' to pose & clock
So I popped my Glock as I observed the spot
Was layin' in the cut 'til it's time to jet
7:30PM, now the sun is set
My G is in the alley, duffle bag in the trunk
Containing gloves, ski mask & my sawed off pump
Now when the shit jump, I'll be fully prepared
No time for bein' nervous, too down to be scared
About to put the plan in effect
First, I check the streets
And then I precede to creep
Chorus: TQ
You might also likePromise the Lord that if you let me do one more lick
I'mma stop slangin' & get out this shit
No more indo, no more yay
But let me keep my Benz & my crib in GA
I pray to the Lord that you do the same for all of my friends
I don't ever wanna say this prayer again
Gotta see a million and I'm through with this
And all I'm gonna need is just one more lick
Verse 2: TQ
In the morning when I wake up
Head to the bathroom, gotta shave my face up
Go pick my nigga Jay up
From Corina house, where he always laid up
Listen up, we got a busy day
My nigga Noid say 23 birds comin' our way
And they landin' at the docks at 9 o'clock
Let's go see D-Mack at the neighborhood Glock shop
(Chorus)
Verse 3: TQ
In the evening, we in the Benzo
Listenin' to 2Pac, blowin' up some indo
And my cellular is getting crossed up
I call Kellie, tell her not to wait up (wait up)
Nine o'clock on the dot, we at the dock
I got my eyes on the nigga wit the dredlocks
He the first one I'm gonna pop when the loot come out
I'm tapping Bennie so he know which on I'm talkin' about
Now shit's about to change - Nigga put ya hand up
Before you get stuck
And it's turnin' out to be a beautiful day
We got the money & the yay
Dippin' on the freeway
Next day, the Narc's raid about 6 in the morning
You know, break of fuckin' dawn
Now Kellie in the courtroom cryin' when I stand up
I guess it's one prayer the Lord didn't answer, no no no no
Damn
I done fucked up
25 wit a iz-L
Oh well
Chorus till fade
