7, 11, 6 & 4
They all score
Yeah. Mutha-fuckin' Jazzy Fae
Got me in line at 1:12
All high & shit
Huh
Thinkin' about
What if the world was mine?
It'd be on in this mutha-fucka
Check it out
I'd have Vegas as the capital
Luxor baby
Kinda feel natural
Triple lines on the craps table
7, 11, 6 & 4
They all score
And every woman is a stripper
So you can tip her
Don't let it get ya
Feel free to take her home wit ya
I'd be in all the motion pictures
And every rip i'm messin' wit
Be a ten on the real shit
And real niggas wouldn't have to try to be
Do i would never never
Actin' violently
And even if you didn't ride wit me
You could still get high wit me
If the world was mine
You might also like(Chorus)
You would never have to leave the sunshine
And everbody'd be free to smoke weed wit us
Shouldn't even have to deal wit one time
Too many whips so we ain't got time
If the world was mine
I'd roll a baby blue 64
Wit all my niggas down front wit they dubs up
All night
Call all the thugs & 'round 'em up
And tell 'em all to come to my show
If the world was mine
I take a puff so i can meditate
Bump down the street & niggas wouldn't playa hate
Season-tickets for the niners
My own recliner
What's the matter wit ya eyes?
Ain't ya high enough?
Cali weed make 'em both swell
So quit talkin'
And blaze one up
You in the middle of a world-wide mission to get paid enough
As the last nigga brave enough
His ass got ate up
His whip got laid up
She had to pay up
My mind was made up
And stayed up
I took 17 beats & laced 'em up
Wit a plot to blow the place up
If the world was mine
(Chorus)
If I ruled the world
Block parties wit the Mexicans
Dominos wit the best of dem
Black lex, purple pearl
In the city wit my next of kin
Doin' lotsa shoppin'
It's poppin'
We won't stoppin'
'Til the loot runs out
But it's my shit
So that won't happen
Guaranteed to have ya all screamin' & clappin'
On a high that lasts ya all night
If the world was mine
