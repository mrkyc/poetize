Introducing, the hard life..
As if ya'll ain't know about it..
Just another one of them ghetto things..
The hard life, living and the dieing..
Think about it...
(CHORUS)
When I think about the days gone by
All the times.. You wish that you could fly away
To clear blue skies.. Just to leave the hard life
And when I think about the times we've had
I remember good as well as the bad..
I can hear the sounds of laughter
But they laced with cries
When you live the hard life...
(In the hard life...)
Dear Mister President...
I was watchin' on the news the other day
You talked about a whole lot of issues...
But something bout my neighberhood you never did say
I took it for myself to change the channel
Figured I was better off watching videos...
Maybe try to get a litlle food for my soul
Late at night when they play to old ones, you know...
You might also like(BRIDGE)
I can't get no satisfaction...
Another live lost off quick reaction...
Only time I think about calm and relaxin...
Is when I write a new song...
(When I think about..)
(CHORUS)
I think about the days gone by
All the times.. You wish that you could fly away
To clear blue skies.. Just to leave the hard life
And when I think about the times we've had
I remember good as well as the bad..
I can hear the sounds of laughter
But they laced with cries
When you live the hard life...
(In the hard life...)
Just a little somethin' for my neigberhood
Holla if you hear me... (Put your hands up...)
Puff 'Lah in summertime, feeling good
Remenisin' about my partners that done past away...
Just like Lil' Ronnie, Me and him and Melinda
Just wanted to be somebody... But they gone now...
Ask me how I feel about it...
Well I thank the Lord who blessed 'em
So I sang about it... (And I do it like this...)
(BRIDGE)
I can't get no satisfaction...
Another live lost off quick reaction...
Only time I think about calm and relaxin...
Is when I write a new song...
(When I think about it..)
(CHORUS)
I think about the days gone by
All the times.. You wish that you could fly away
To clear blue skies.. Just to leave the hard life
And when I think about the times we've had
I remember good as well as the bad..

But they laced with cries
When you live the hard life...
(When you live the hard life...)
(E-40)
I'm so damn disobey'ish, tryin' ta' get by
Dippin' and dabbin', slick and slide
Skippin' and skappin', high as a kite
Twenty-four/Seven, day and night
The studio rappin, puttin' in work
Bloodshot..red..eye.. (Eye..)
Visine bottle, tryin' to get rid
Me and all my guys.. (Guys..)
All ten ready, ready for war
Prepare for the south, who's clique kick do? Neva' call loose
Always on my gun, youngs..
My family ain't fixin' to be cryin' over me like they usin'
If I was ever to be outnumbered, I ain't gon' run from 'em
I promise ya playa, I'ma put my back up against the wall
And try to beat the livin' shit outta one of em
Created the game, steal my slang, instead of congratulatin
Lay mass triple-platinum rush, with lack of conversation
Put all on tele-vision and try to display the words I say
Knowin' that "Pop Ya Colla" and all that lingo come out to pay
And all you game, groupie ass rapper's, eatin' steak and lobsters
Million dollar mouthpieces, we out eatin' "Cheez-N-Crackers"
You 'Ere-hustlin ass bia's better give us our just 'Jest dues
'Fore a guy fuck around and punish you...
(CHORUS 3x w/ Adlibs to Fade) (E-40)
When I think about the days gone by, (Biaaatch!)
All the times.. You wish that you could fly away
To clear blue skies.. Just to leave the hard life
And when I think about the times we've had
I remember good as well as the bad..
I can hear the sounds of laughter
But they laced with cries
When you live the hard life...
