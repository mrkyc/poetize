It's been a while, since you've come around
I missed you so, you know you broke me down
Are we ready to, give it one more try?
Play on
While you were gone, I tried to mend my heart
But I didn't know, even where to start
I'd rather be with you even when we fight

I'll take all you offer
Because it's all the same
The thorn with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain
Because it's you I gain
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I love the way, that you keep it real
You're not afraid, to tell me the deal
And, you tell me when I'm wrong, when I'm tripping out
Cause a man like me needs a woman who
Will walk the walk, and is a warrior too
But, with that comes a truth, and there is no down

I'll take all you offer
Because it's all the same
The thorn with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain
Because it's you I gain
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I think this time, we can make it through
I still be me, and you still be you
The only difference, will be within our minds

I'll take all you offer
Because it's all the same
The thorn with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain
Because it's you I gain
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain
I'll take all you offer
Because it's all the same
The thorn with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain
Because it's you I gain
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain
I'll take all you offer
Because it's all the same
The thorn with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain
Because it's you I gain
I can't live without it
