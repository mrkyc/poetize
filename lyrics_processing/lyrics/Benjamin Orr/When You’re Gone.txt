And beating with a heart awake
Even now
I can't imagine what you're doing
When you're not around
A shady thought to ask now
I need you now
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
Everything is turning me upside down
(For so long)
You gotta see that
Confusion's spinning me around
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
The feeling is that everything is lost, you see
When you're gone
Shadows reaching long across the floor
Wishing you were at the door
You know it's insanity
You always keep leaving me
Walking around one room to the next
Remembering the very best
It's starting to get to me
You always keep leaving me
You might also like(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
Everything is turning me upside down
(For so long)
You gotta see that
Confusion's spinning me around
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
The feeling is that everything is lost, you see
When you're gone
And 'cause it's so strong
It's that much harder
I'm feeling so alone
Well, I need to hold you
And feel the magic
You've been away so long
Yeah, yeah
Well, if it isn't enough
How can I make it more?
Thought we'd been through this all before
Here we go one more time
And rain keeps pounding without a break
And beating with a heart awake
I need you now
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
Everything is turning me upside down
(For so long)
You gotta see that
Confusion's spinning me around
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
The feeling is that everything is lost, you see
When you're gone
So long
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
Everything is turning me upside down
(For so long)
You gotta see that
Confusion's spinning me around
(When you're gone)
You gotta know that
The feeling is that everything is lost, you see
