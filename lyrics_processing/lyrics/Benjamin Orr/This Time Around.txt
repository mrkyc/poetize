Thrown about with the doubt
You could never see
And out of nowhere it sounded
Something is happening
Someone who happened to hear you
Listening in silence and knew
How to understand
One step ahead of a feeling
Touching with loving hands
Now I know that things are gonna be alright
(This time, this time)
This time around
Lonely days give way to warm and gentle nights
(This time)
No need to keep second guessing
Racing in circles and trying to figure out
Answers to all of the questions
You had them all along
(You had them all along)
Yes, I know that things are gonna be alright
(This time, this time)
This time around
Lonely days give way to warm and gentle nights
(This time)

'Cause there's something for you
That comes from a different place
In a different way
Straight ahead, you and me every day
You just got to be you; just believe
You know what love can give you what you need
Now I know that things are gonna be alright
(This time, this time)
This time around
Lonely days give way to warm and gentle nights
(This time)
Warm and gentle summer nights
So many times disappointed
Thrown about with the doubt
You could never see
Then out of nowhere it sounded
Straight to the heart of me
Now I know that things are gonna be alright
(This time, this time)
This time around
Lonely days give way to warm and gentle nights
