I think I've come to see some light
Come on, hold on to me
Belong to me
You know that love looks good on you
In what you say and what you do
Come on, hold on to me
It's all I need
I gotta do the perfect time that's blowing by
Not a thing to show for all the times I've tried
Now we just can't seem to wipe the smile away
And you gave it to me
Give it up, I'm feeling something beautiful
Look at this, we're starting to be suitable to me
Every day I find what you got into us
Can't seem to get enough of you
When you're away, I dream that you...
Come on and hold on to me
Belong to me
And so it never really ends
You mend the hurts that never mend
Come on, hold on to me
It's all I need

Guess ya gotta take the blinders off so you can see
Not a thought comes by that doesn't hang on you
And what did I do before?
Can't believe that this is really happening
All the hurtful days are finally vanishing
Making all the fantasies realities
We could be in for some surprises
I know it, you know it too
Before you think of compromises
Just realize it's only here for you
Yeah, you sure look good tonight
I think I've finally seen some light
Come on, hold on to me
It's all I need
And so it never really ends
You mend my hurts that never mend
Come on and hold on to me
Belong to me
Gotta make for bringing out the best to me
When the love is right, it's possible to see so clearly
All my life I wondered would it come to me
Then you brought it to me
Can't believe that this is really happening
All the hurtful days are finally vanishing
Making all your fantasies realities
Where did all what I had in my run for me
Guess ya gotta take the blinders off so you can see
Not a thought comes by that doesn't hang on you
