Tell me how you feel
Well, is it just a teaser
Or is it all too real?
You slip and I start thinking
Not a lot to say
Well, show me something different
New along the way
Just spinning me in circles
Never get the fix I need
Oh, oh, down and around in circles
It's always you and never me
First you tell me one thing
Then you tell me two
If someone here is crazy
I place the bet on you
Just spinning me in circles
Never get the fix I need
Oh, oh, down and around in circles
It's always you and never me, no, no
Why do you refuse
(Refuse)
To play it by the rules?
All the time you know
(You know)
It really drives me wild
(Drives me wild)
