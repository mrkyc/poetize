You told me what you wanted
It's about time
You showed me what goes where
There's a lot on the line
Oh, it's back to where we started
It's about time
And maybe I don't care
It's about time
Counted back to zero
There's a lot on the line
Time to clean the air
Keep it in mind
Oh, it all goes out the window
It's about time
Well, I can't see it but I know it's there
Remember
It's too hot to stop
Remember
Well, too hot to stop
It's about time
You gotta face up the factor
It's about time
'Cause it's been on my mind
There's a lot on the line
If it's left to any question
It's about time
Well, you can call it in anytime

Getting through to ya

Something new to ya
You can hang on or run away
It's about time
You start to get the picture
It's about time
You gotta take a look around
Keep it in mind
'Cause your almost over limit
It's about time
And it's all about to come down
It's about time
You gotta wake up, smell the coffee
It's about time
You gotta open up your eyes
There's a lot on the line
So tired of hearing 'sorry'
It's about time
'Cause a part of me loves surprise
