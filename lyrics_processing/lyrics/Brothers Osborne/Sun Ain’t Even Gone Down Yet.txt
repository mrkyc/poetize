Sittin' on go since Monday
Damn near ran out of runway
Down this road, there's only one way
This day can go and that's up

Gonna make the best of this weekend
I ain't even gonna sleep in
That all-day buzz came creepin' in
As fast as I could fill up my cup

The second that sun slipped out of the water
Lightin' up a Tennessee sky
We were headfirst in 'bout quarter to ten
We were already high noon high
If a cold libation's any indication
We're gonna have a hell of a night
The day's about as good as good can get
And the sun ain't even gone down yet
The sun ain't even gone down yet

We ain't hit the top, we ain't hit the bottom
It's already been one we won't forget
I'm 'bout as gone as I've ever gotten
And the sun ain't even gone down yet
