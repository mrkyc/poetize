You don't see us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's

You know the rep, we keep the flows in check

Mesmerizing, state of the art caffeine
It's over head like Omniverse screen
I'm not the average savage that curse queens
I'm somethin' from his worst dreams
First, we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen
Grab the whole planet by the purse strings
Emcees are earthlings, not built to hurt things
Speakin' the words of weaklings, nothin' but sweet things
See The Roots LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like
Man, each world, it ain't no time to recline
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine
Shine like jewels that spark, swimmin' with sharks
Never caught speakin' to narcs, that's weak in the parks
I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize
Grip it up and flee the scene with a different disguise
Take a detour, I be all that I can be, whore
Talkin' to this **** life, had to make her my wife
Live twice, got seven more lives to live
I'm all out, takin' things to the fullest extent
Help me get it down and we can split one hundred percent
Run a rapper through a maze like an experiment (Yeah)
Word up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo

The Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp
With my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for conk
Who pumps your heart? What made you wanna rhyme from the start?
You should be more alert, then you wouldn't get hurt
Get off your horse and on your P's and beware
Of images you're seein', they're deceivin', you're scared
And even more shook up than the scenes that's near, I'm Dice Raw
Sting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore
Who want a piece? Well, it's round one, let's begin
I got a gun that don't bust, it just suck niggas in
I got shit that'll have you beggin' me to shoot you
I'm the professor, you rock a dunce cap, go get a tutor
Yo, okay, computer, radioheads knock to the
Future shock like Curtis, at your service
None other than, the Fifth government playin' the cut again
Y'all clueless to what the fuck is up again
Yo, hard times and sufferin'
What? My peoples in the crevices strugglin'
'Nough of them a toy soldier thespian
But I'm from the next eon
Supreme being, that's unseen for emceein'

You don't see us, but we see you

You know the rep, we keep the flows in check
You don't see us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
'Cause you will get crept, wit' no discrept

Yo, they all around me, 'round me
On my head, they got a bounty
I'm tryna get this bail up so I can flee the county
Triple-six, come in my mix, flood it with tricks
I'm sharp than a knife, spoons for icepicks
Niggas price bricks 'til dawn, if the money is long
Cats who play strong will inhale through gold-plate bongs
You wrong, son, if you thought I wasn't droppin' a ton
Sit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum
Ayo, I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you
From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you
Dancin' all jolly as you pussy for them folly
I knock you out with one punch what mean you been Ali'd
I float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations
When my name's said out loud, you'll lose your concentration
Dice Raw, D-I-C-E R-A-W
You wanna take it? Otherwise, fuck you gon' do?
That's what I thought, nada, nothin', kaput, zero
Rough as sandpaper, but still smooth as a tiptoe
Raw's takin' over, baby, don't tell me you ain't know
A lot of kids can rap but you fuckin' with the pros
Know what I'm sayin'? Y'all know the legendary Roots Crew, it's like
