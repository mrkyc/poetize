Yo, look at all the scavengers, all wannabe contenders
Dismember wack niggas, I intend to
Y'all ain't shit but sticky shit on the bottom of Timberlands
I know you clam heads wanna surrender
Don't even act like the battlefield the place you wanna enter
Yo, niggas is hopeless, you really need to focus
On who's the fuckin' dopest or wind up hopeless
Looking for some soup, tryin' to recoup
Some fuckin' loot, only thing you get is the boot
To me, these punk emcees is nothing but fruitcakes
Shake they booty on stage and get hit
With lyrics that I kick, talkin' that bullshit
You might get lit like a front of a spliff
For runnin' off at your lips talkin' that nonsense
Raw get on stage, take your confidence
