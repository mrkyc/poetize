P-P-5-D (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
P-P-5-D, uh, yo (Clear to see)
Touch this, though, know what I'm sayin', what?
Yo, yo, yo, one hundred percent, yo

On these seventy-three keys of ivory and ebony
I swear solemnly that I'll forever rock steadily
People wanna know where Malik, he right next to me
The weaponry, the secret recipe
Hard to peep this, deep shit, shows I eat with
Contaminated thoughts I walk the street with
I bayonet cassettes and chop beats with
This olympic lyricism you can't compete with
Globe traveling, throwin' your verse like a javelin
Things Fall Apart and MC's unravelin'
Backstage whisperin' to management like
Change the order, it's no way that we can rock after them
My man sport the fro like What's Happening
From the latest hiatus, The Roots back again
Your crew practicin' to catch this natural blend
They packages read "Care when handling"
It's all soft shit, batteries not included with
Matter of fact, your whole front's a reenactment
I blow your batty ass into fragments
P5D, the new testament (What?), mic specialist, what?

M-illa-illa-tant, ten-four cocked, ready to rock
While I'm out in the cloud, chiefs out all through your block
Watch your tone, play the cut, but what? You get sheist
Got a personality named trife ready to heist
Smash and grab, snatch the ice, crush your mental device
Thought twice, should've thought once, got played for the dunce
Dialogues I moderate, cool out, we outta state
Just blend and integrate, give me room to ventilate
Most niggas is fraudulent, the rap sergeant
Bargin' through your regiment, call your president
Hittin' all targets 'cause it's a cause that's lost
Between the killers when they probably Teddy Ruxpin soft
Droppin' tears of steel, two drops up in the bucket
Facing three hots and a cot, so yo, fuck it
If I get abducted, trapped up in the belly
Whack up my celly, get known like Dawn Staley
You know the dealy on the daily and the credit up
If I sense you got a bend in your kite, then send it up
We press up on your corner with windows, they tinted up
Lay our props face down on the ground and get it up, what?
Face on the ground and get it up

While you pose for pictures, I'm the invisible enigma
Down low, scope you off the roof like the fiddler
Cage you up in the vocal booth, you're held prisoner
Watch, while I'm banging out this hot shit from Sigma
Illa-del-P-A, live without a DJ
And it's been that way since Sergio Vallente, yo
"The Roots holding it down," is all you can say
Plus the Black Thought emcee, professionally
Push pen to paper like Chinua Achebe
Thumpin', what was your assumption?
I'll lace your function, make it a Black Thought production
Word up, I'm on something
Stella, hold all calls, I'm gone blunting
Travel light and broadcast via satellite
Illa-Fifth Dynamite
Lyrically calculus in this arithmetic hip-hop metropolis
But loyal fiends coppin' this hot shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Hot shit, word up
Illa-Fifth, hot shit, yo
