Uh, uh, uh, come on, SP in the
Up north into the NYC and the
Out West and to niggas in Cali and the
Down South type dynamite
What? Yo, yo, come on, dynamite
Uh, check it out, uh, uh, uh, it's like
Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, yo

Everybody, touch this Illa-Fifth dynamite (Come on)

In-in-tro-tro-du-ducin' the sole missin' link
What could emcees who listen think?
It's Black Thought, open your eyes and don't blink
Yo, to rock this mic is like a basic instinct
But, yo, in-in-tro-tro-du-ducin'

Rehani the mic champion, more than a step beyond
Motherfuckers sweatin' me, beggin' me just to get me on
Macro-cosmic, micro-master
See The Roots LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like
Ayo, I'm all the way, way, Phil-Phil-lay-lay
People wanna see the way the Illadelph play
Yo, look in the mirror, watch what yourself say
I'm from SP, no mortal man can test me
Thought, I keep in line-ean, upper echelon-ean
Heineken, hold the rhymin' in, flows remindin' 'em
Cats that hit me up, some shit from back in the past
Your half-steppin' ass could never fathom or grasp, of course

Ayo, we got a doctorate in cold rockin' it
Bringin' this apocalypse, nigga, you mad topical
****, my raps tricks your optical
Mr. Superficial, I'm rippin' apart your heart tissue
This is your official dismissal
I don't study the artificial
Who fuckin' with the dark crystal? Yo, where are is you?
I'm movin' like a smart missile, aimed and guaranteed to hit you

Word up, but when the Fifth do get on and perform, you in for it
It ain't no way to censor it
My style metaphoric to bricks and ten-ton stacks hard to lift
The artist comin' out the Fifth darkness
'Cause we go back like ancients, while you ain't shit
Subterranean, never against the gradient
Afro-American slash half-Pleiadian
In your universe, my star's the most radiant

Ayo, it's all the way live from 2-1-5
Plus admission is denied, so just wait outside
Two extremes collide like Jekyll and Hyde
And I provide you with the swerve you need, but take heed
You travelin' at light speed, iller than adventures you might read
Official original breed, The Justice League
Yo, it's the P-5-D style fashionist
Other emcees, they actresses

Yo, Mr. High Post, you 'bout to get shot down (Get shot down)
Tryna fly above this Illa-Fifth compound
You've known since the get-go, I rock your disco
Ain't nobody badder, but yo, you get my gist, so
See? I represent, so you gotta squint
As far as how I really do it, you incognizant
We causin' nuisance and get in-decent, so save your two cent
Don't come in my district kickin' that ****
Your soft simplistic limited clique get
Lyrically lifted touchin' the Fifth shit
Trenches of the mentally twisted you enlisted
Five was the emblem on the mic you got hit with

And I stomp ya, 'til you call me conqueror
Back-slappin' all them niggas that slept
Thinkin' that Elo could ever disappear, I'm strippin' they veneer
With this non-ether reefer, quite frequent premiere
