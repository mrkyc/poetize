No baby, you are beautiful
Swing low, sweet ugly girl
Aaaaaahhhaooooowow!
The boy across the aisle has his eye on me
I open up my paper and I try to read
I scan the personals from curiosity
I wish my stop would come and it is then I see:
Who wants an ugly girl, so sweet and very sexy?
Who wants an ugly girl who wants to make you happy?
I glance up from my paper and I dread to see
The boy across the aisle with his eye on me
I'm grateful that he's bending down to tie his shoe
I go back to my paper which I'll read for you:
Who wants an ugly girl, so sweet and very sexy?
Who wants an ugly girl who wants to make you happy?
The train has stopped and it's filling up
And I close my eyes then, try to imagine
I'm walking on a beach in the moonlight
The waves are lapping gently in the night
I hear the palm leaves crisp in the calm breeze
Someone is with me. he bends to kiss me
The stars are winking. I just keep thinking:

The people in the train are packed in door to door
I'm staring at chewing gum stuck to the floor
Waking from my reverie. it's hot in here
The boy begins to smile and it's very clear:
Who wants an ugly girl, so sweet and very sexy?
Who wants an ugly girl who wants to make you happy?
The train has stopped and it's filling up
And I close my eyes then, try to imagine
I'm walking on a beach in the moonlight
The waves are lapping gently in the night
I hear the palm leaves crisp in the calm breeze
The boy is with me. he bends to kiss me
He whispers softly, kisses me hotly
