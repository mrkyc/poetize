The crazy patterns on the wall
I say : you must be so-and-so
I seen you on that tv show
Eeny meany miny moe
I'm gonna be lucky too
Have a life where I can grow
If it's the last thing that I do!
Love is here right now
Love is just around the corner
One more block to my building
Now love is coming over
As the disco ball turns
It's like the sky at night
The stars keep reeling
On my own ceiling
Now you offer me love
And I feel high, my guy!
Couldn't get much higher
Even if I tried
You're that guy whats-his-name
Please don't think that I'm insane
Would you sign my autograph book?
You're much handsomer than you look

I can't beleive it's not a dream
Life is not real. this I know
It is something in between
Love is here right now
Love is just around the corner
One more block to my building
Now love is coming over
As the disco ball turns
I feel all right tonight
It's like the sky at night
The stars keep reeling
On my own ceiling
And I'm ready to learn
What can I say today?
There was no way to know yesterday
Now you offer me love
And I feel high, my guy
Couldn't get much higher
Even if I tried
I bet you dine in restaurants
With michael jackson and savants
When you name's a household word
Nobody dare's call you a nerd

This is like an interview
Way up on a high plateau
That's a really cool tattoo
Love is here right now
Love is just around the corner
One more block to my building
Now love is coming over
As the disco ball turns
I see your name in lights
The stars keep reeling
On my own ceiling
And I'm ready to learn
What can I say today?
There was no way to know yesterday
As the disco ball turns
I get a new insight
The stars keep reeling
On my own ceiling
Now you offer me love
And I feel high, my guy!
Couldn't get much higher
Even if I tried
And if love were a drug
I could never o.d. it's true
There was no way to know
