Love is a thing that you just don't rush
Look at my boyfriend and then you'll see what I mean
I'm not gonna blow it by spoiling his dream
I can see that apple high up in a tree
I'm not going to rock it, let it fall to me
Speak of the devil and he'll walk right in
If he talks to me I'll just give him in
Take a little measure, take a little measure
Measure of my heart
Measure up
The shark could eat me
Or I could eat the shark
Measure up
Take a little measure, take a little measure
Measure of my soul
Measure up
If there's still cold water, then I'm running cool
Measure up
If you live in the mountains or down by the sea
Love is a thing to make you make your heart beat
I went for a ride, I just jumped to my feet
I smile so hard, you can see all of my teeth
The boy fills me with such energy
I'll play this hand intuitively
We'll ignore the problems that destroy the rest
Turn good to better, and better to best

Measure up
Take a little measure, take a little measure
Measure of my soul
Measure up
If there's still cold water, then I'm running cool
Measure up
If you live in the desert or among the trees
Love is a thing to take at your ease
? ? ? survive the waste
We'll serve the time for the rest of our days
We'll see all the places that we've never been
No matter where our love will begin
I know he's not the only fish in the sea
But, man-oh-man there is no other for me
Take a little measure, take a little measure
Measure of my heart
Measure up
The shark could eat me
Or I could eat the shark
Measure up
Take a little measure
Measure of my soul
If there's still cold water, then I'm running cool
