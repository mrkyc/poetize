Always true blue to the end
But you are distracting me, tempting, attracting me
Why must you be just a friend?
Why oh-oh why oh?
I'd want to hold you
I want to touch you
Why oh-oh why oh?
I must have told you
You are too much you
What to do? what to do? what to do?
I'm never going to learn
What to do? what to do? what to do?
I'm only human
What to do? what to do? what to do?
I must be crazy
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Here boy

Walking upon the high-wire
But you make me feel so good
I know that if you could
You would allay my desire
Why oh-oh why oh?
You drive me wild
With satan's child
Why oh-oh why oh?
My mouth is dried out
You make me cry out
What to do? what to do? what to do?
I tell you
What to do? what to do? what to do?
This is ? ? ?
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Please, please
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Help me now
I feel the call of the wild
Something inside me gets riled
Get me away from here before the thing I fear
Makes me for#dt for the while
Why oh-oh why oh?
I get so dizzy
I wish you'd kiss me
Why oh-oh why oh?
I know it's all wrong
The feeling's so strong
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Get out of here
What to do? what to do? what to do?
No! no! no!
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Wait a minute
What to do? what to do? what to do?
Hold on
