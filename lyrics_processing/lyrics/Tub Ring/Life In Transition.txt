There was a shift among the ranks
It wasn't subtle but the changes, they all came with a catch
And many, so many, had tried and many had failed
They lacked the vision to predict what was next
And one dream was out of the picture
One try is all that you get
One life is not much to gamble
And so your work isn't finished yet
It's not what you recognize
So now your tenure is done
You would embrace this life in transition
If only your pretense was gone
There was a vision focused through a composition
That the chemically imbalanced would know
And over and over, they said it's over and done with
And that the choices of the few made it so
And one piece of misinformation
One guess is all that it takes
One tale is passed out among us
And though untrue, it was not a mistake
It's not what you recognize
So now your tenure is done
You would embrace this life in transition
If only your pretense was gone
You might also likeForeign thoughts will infiltrate and slowly change the common man
All who walk among us are rewarded as the diligent
Rights are gained and taboos broken, build a concept once again
Close the door on those who left 'cause bitter men have bitter ends
Just 'cause you've been there, just 'cause you know
Just 'cause you're sure, it don't make you right
Just 'cause you've been there, just 'cause you know
Just 'cause you're sure, it don't make you right
It's not what you recognize
So now your tenure is done
You would embrace this life in transition
If only your pretense was gone
Just 'cause you've been there, just 'cause you know
Just 'cause you're sure, it don't make you right
Just 'cause you've been there, just 'cause you know
