Of an afterlife that's meant to be perceived
Catastrophes, calamities, catastrophe
Everyone loves a tragedy
But there's guns, there's guns, guns, guns
Pointed at our head every time we close our eyes
But what are we little folk
To do about this bakery full of lies?
We don't need no one to turn out the lights for us
When we go to sleep
Catastrophes, calamities in our dreams
When we dream we like to dream about tragedy and afterlife
A perceived reality, a tragedy, a catastrophe
Seems my life is only just pretend
And dreams are only what you make of them
And themes are reoccurring so often
If I were wise, I'd see a trend
We don't need no one to turn out the lights for us
Arguing things that have never been said
The mail was empty, the books were unread
Progress hindered by arrogance
Inquiries made in present tense
Future stars will be twice as dense as ours
Twice as dense as ours

Answers given by anecdote
Crueler sonnets were never wrote at all
Never wrote at all
And it seems my life is only just pretend
And dreams are only what you make of them
And themes are reoccurring so often
If I were wise I'd see a trend
One, two, three, four
Progress hindered by arrogance
Inquiries made in present tense
Future stars will be twice as dense as ours
Twice as dense as ours
We don't need no one to turn out the lights for us
Arguing things that have never been said
The mail was empty, the books were unread
We don't need no one to turn out the lights for us
How can you sleep at a time like this?
The answer was pointless, the question amiss
To err while conscious, the words a mistake
