Can you just sit back?
Can you survive a jury of your peers?
If I took the limelight would it rectify all that?
Would it draw the focus from your fears?
Create a pitch and target at the everyman
A demographic quite overlooked
No paper trail, no cause for conspiracy
We'll do it right and update the books
While funding comes from taking everything we can
A uniform that wears you so well
I'll pull the strings and hide in anonymity
And then they'll buy whatever you sell
So on your throne a sword is hanging overhead
Amidst the passion of your name
And if I kept all of my promises to you
Would it be possible for you to do the same?
When you lose your patience
When your sense is coming back
Entertaining thoughts of getting out
Would you be lost without it?
Would you see the need for that?
Would the cost be greater than your doubts?
You might also likeIt takes a hold and teaches new philosophies
A stubborn mouth and losing control
When you speak through tears without apology
The irony is something to behold
You isolate and tightly tie the tourniquet
Communications taper and fade
If the subject seems to be rejecting it
Then think of all the plans that we've made
A simple gesture shows that everything's intact
While keeping interest in this game
And if I kept all of my promises to you
Would it be possible for you to do the same?
Would you do the same?
You'd do the same
Can you do all that you claim to?
Can you just sit back?
Can you survive a jury of your peers?
If I took the limelight would it rectify all that?
Would it draw the focus from your fears?
Create a pitch and target at the everyman
A demographic quite overlooked
No paper trail, no cause for conspiracy
We'll do it right and update the books
While funding comes from taking everything we can
A uniform that wears you so well
I'll pull the strings and hide in anonymity
And then they'll buy whatever you sell
So on your throne a sword is hanging overhead
Amidst the passion of your name
And if I kept all of my promises to you
