That was almost oppressive
And it wouldn't stop flashing 'til the people addressed it
Now, this all preceded something more
With the greens and blues
That were blinking organic
Had given Mr. Bright there reason to panic
So I'm surprised with who I was rooting for
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
The model is set
The Luddites don't deny it
Works rather well if only they would try it
The car's in the air, the plane's on the ground
Scissors are safe 'cause the edges are round
The bells go off, we spring into action
Numbers are brilliant right down to the fraction
C'mon now, it's all realistic
I'm not dumb, I'm just optimistic
Yeah!
It's just your condition
To question it all, to be opposition
I've done the math, I've worked it all out
Everything functions despite all this doubt
One by one, and brick by brick
We'll blindside them all
'Cause it happens so quick
C'mon now, it's all realistic
I'm not dumb, I'm just optimistic

And this is possible
You'll see the molecules are dancing all around
These are the lives we lead
These are the fast machines
These are the tools we use to rob them
But I don't think that we have hit the bottom
Baby check yourself
Maybe you're the fucking problem
The walls are empty space
And we have earned our place
They said, "Evolve!" and this is how we will respond
These are the lives we lead
These are the fast machines
These are the tools we use to rob them
But I don't think that we have hit the bottom
Baby check yourself
Maybe you're the fucking problem
I don't think that we have hit the bottom
Baby check yourself
Maybe you're the fucking problem
I don't think that we have hit the bottom
Baby check yourself
Maybe you're the fucking problem
These are the lives we lead
These are the fast machines
These are the tools we used to rob them
But I don't think that we have hit the bottom
Baby check yourself
