But hey, they did it in style
Don't hold your breath for sympathy
'Cause they been at it now for quite a while
The room was lit by a television screen
And demeanors were all the same
The music wailed from places unknown
While I only had myself to blame
And those who moved so seriously
Gave distractions for us not to think
Excuse myself from conversation
While I left to get another drink
You know I know you know you're different kid
But it doesn't make the scene alright
And if you still insist on bargaining
Then we'll be here for the rest of the night
It doesn't matter that you don't see them!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
Humiliation will get you far!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You're only here 'cause there was nothing else to do!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
It doesn't matter now. It doesn't matter now
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You might also likeThe scent of guilt was drawing closer to me
A smoky haze descended on us all
While pictures of original sin
Had arranged themselves upon the walls
Some day we'll speak of the good old days
The golden stories that we all believe
I hope it makes them miserable
That their goals in life were never achieved
You know I know you know you're different kid
But it doesn't make the scene alright
And if you still insist on bargaining
Then we'll be here for the rest of the night
It doesn't matter that you don't see them!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
Humiliation will get you far!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You're only here 'cause there was nothing else to do!
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
It doesn't matter now. It doesn't matter now
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
You keep your head down
