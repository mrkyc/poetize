Save yourself, there's always time
If you prepare for another try
Make sure to bring your mirror along
I never said that I would be reasonable
I never said that I'd even try
I'll bring the words of a thousand chapters to life

Break the glass in case of emergency
Did you allow for an exit plan?
Did you watch your chances dwindle away?
I never said that I wasn't capable
I never gave you a reason why
I'll bring the words of a thousand chapters to life, my friend

You're not leaving here alone
You're not leaving here alone
My friends are enemies at most
So I choose to keep them close
You're not leaving here alone

I never said that I would be reasonable
I never said that I'd even try
Do you need to vent your frustration?
Do you need to see the sky?
So once again, you're only wasting time
And though I love to hear your views
I'm the one with purpose here
So I hate to break the news that
You might also like
You're not leaving here alone
(You're not leaving here alone)
You're not leaving here alone
(You're not leaving here alone)
My friends are enemies at most
So I choose to keep them close
You're not leaving here alone
You're not leaving here alone
You're not leaving here alone
My friends are enemies at most
So I choose to keep them close
You're not leaving here alone

There's a world that you're not a part of
With nothing to do with you
Where intuition will fail to be your guide
And if the book just appeared to you
But all the pages are a solid white
You'll find the words are apparent on the other side

You're not leaving here alone
You're not leaving here alone
My friends are enemies at most
So I choose to keep them close
