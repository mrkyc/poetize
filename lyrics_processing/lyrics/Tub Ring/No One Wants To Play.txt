Try to impress them with what you think they want
Your methods are subtle, just like an elephant
Besides all the retreads and all the arguments
You can't make decisions based on feeling

Friendships fall away from this
Adhering to your politics

So prod and pry and give your ideas
It doesn't matter 'til you get your own way
Once again your crown is tarnished
'Cause you're the winner of a game
That no one wants to play
No one wants to play
Don't celebrate just yet 'cause I think that you forget
That no one wants to play

Rules are suggestions because they aren't real
Some from the get go, and some from how you feel
You play all positions and show them how it's done
Soon you're a figurehead lost on everyone
You might also like
If there's a theory I know there's consequence
I'm sure that you've learned now, you can't stay on the fence
You've taken opinions until the words are bent
Voice of an angel, thoughts a serpent

Friendships fall away from this
Adhering to your politics

So prod and pry and give your ideas
It doesn't matter 'til you get your own way
Once again your crown is tarnished
'Cause you're the winner of a game
That no one wants to play
No one wants to play
Don't celebrate just yet 'cause I think that you forget
That no one wants to play

There was a boy who woke from a dream one day
He thought it over
He planned out everything
He wouldn't rest 'til his waking dream came true
And there were choices
That he knew must be made
The fallen silenced by all the accolades
And so he delegates the many things to do

So many things to do
So many things to do

Prod and pry and give your ideas
It doesn't matter 'til you get your own way
Once again your crown is tarnished
'Cause you're the winner of a game
That no one wants to play
No one wants to play
Don't celebrate just yet 'cause I think that you forget
