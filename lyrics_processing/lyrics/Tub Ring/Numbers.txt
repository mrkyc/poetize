And my vision grew much clearer
Then all the people and the buildings and the ground began to blend
And I saw a set of numbers
I had the dream again, the one where I was forced to take a train
From Chicago to Atlanta
And when we reached top speed, I had to give the current ETA
So I grabbed a calculator
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my cells are all dividing
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my race is multiplying
I walked into a store and bumped into a pyramid of cans
And they fell into a pattern
And when the clerk came out, he pointed at the triangle he planned
And I had to know the tangent
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my cells are all dividing
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my race is multiplying
I still think we have at least a million years to go until we reach the end
Soon we'll overthrow the sky and use it for ourselves and all we comprehend
You might also like3.1415926, a work of fiction
Ever think the circle is a trick?
Grab a pen, I'll add it to the list of comprehension
3.1415926
I still think the odds are good that you can make a bet on what will be the odds
When the numbers shape our world and we control the shape, we'll frolic like we're gods
Someone grab Fermat another drink to stop his shouting
Ask him what the other scholars think
If your margins are the missing link, I'll buy you paper
Someone grab Fermat another drink
I still think we have at least a million years to go until we reach the end
Soon we'll overthrow the sky and use it for ourselves and all we comprehend
And so the story ends without the world collapsing on itself
And my computer started flashing
And when I checked the net, I found that I accumulated wealth
So I almost started laughing
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my cells are all dividing
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my race is multiplying
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
And my cells are all dividing
Ooh, I'm a number, you're a number, can't you see?
