But I was so enticed by the air that moves around them
Another man, another woman smoking
All their toys are left alone and broken
It didn't have to end, it didn't have to clean me out
But this is what the year was all about
There's a piece of, well there's a piece of
The better parts of me in all of this stuff
And I know there's so much more to life
And time is fleeting, but it doesn't change a thing
And I still want so much more
What else is all this for?
So I'll await the things that should be coming to me
You can give the orders, you can be the captain
But I was in the vehicle when the crash happened
I didn't think of it 'til the lights were flashing
I was in the front seat when the car was crashing
It could be avoided, and it doesn't change the fact
That I was well aware of this as we made impact
You give the orders, you are the captain
But I was in the vehicle when the crash happened
I was in there when it happened
It was abrupt but I saw it first
I was in there when it happened
And I was hoping for so much worse
You might also likeI had a bunch to say, but let's be realistic
A book about yourself is a tad narcissistic
I think it's good, a healthy obsession
Whoa, it's so healthy
Calculate the value of the things you have acquired
You're not impressing me 'cause you're preaching to the choir
You've given up, you've left it all to fate
Now just wait a God damn second here, wait
And I know there's so much more to life
And time is fleeting, but it doesn't change a thing
And I still want so much more
What else is all this for?
So I'll await the things that should be coming to me
You can give the orders, you can be the captain
But I was in the vehicle when the crash happened
I didn't think of it 'til the lights were flashing
I was in the front seat when the car was crashing
It could be avoided, and it doesn't change the fact
That I was well aware of this as we made impact
You give the orders, you are the captain
But I was in the vehicle when the crash happened
I was in there when it happened
It was abrupt but I saw it first
I was in there when it happened
And I was hoping for so much worse
I was in there when it happened
It was abrupt but I saw it first
I was in there when it happened
