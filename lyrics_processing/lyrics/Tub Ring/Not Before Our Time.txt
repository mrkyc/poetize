Clock says that it's time to go
But it'll be another hour 'til we're out the door
And I'm okay with just sitting here growing old, yeah
The place is fire when we arrive
And the early morning hours saw us survive

Now limits stretched as far as we could take them
Learning all the rules so we could break them
'Til we're on to something new

But we started something here
Among the ice cube wine
And pretentious beer
We're aware of what we've become
So we join the ranks of everyone
Eye to eye and skin to skin
Another evening out, another evening in
Reminisce of things
Not before our time

Friends of friends we have to meet
You see, the social scene was a necessity
But the conversation was dull
And growing old, yeah
If it counts, we're listening
The more minutes passed
The more embarrassing
You might also like
But we would read each other
Through our faces
Sometimes esoteric in our phrases
'Til we're on to something new

But we've finished something here
Among the ones who cared and the cavalier
Our talking points were wearing thin
To an argument we had no business in
Representing not just me
And whatever you say, I'll agree
We're leaving now and it's
Not before our time
Not before our time

A state of mind doesn't answer the riddle
If the place is packed
Why do we head to the middle?
And we'll do it again and again and I'm told
We'll do it again
And now we're growing old
We made the choices
It's our decision
And it's go, go, go
To hell with opposition
And we'll do it again and again and I'm told
We'll do it again
And now we're growing old
A state of mind doesn't answer the riddle
And the place is packed, why do we head to the middle
And we'll do it again and again and I'm told
We'll do it again now
We're growing old
We made the choices
It's our decision
It's go, go, go
To hell with opposition
And we'll do it again and again and I'm told
We'll do it again
We're growing old but
She's a happy ball of chaos
And I'm wrapped up in super-string
As fairy tales will often bring
And she's out dancing in the cosmos
And floating in the solar wind
Until the end

Not before our time
Not before our time
Not before our time
Not before our time
Not before our time
