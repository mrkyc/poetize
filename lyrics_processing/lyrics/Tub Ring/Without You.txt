So once again I will begin at the end
It's the best way for you to comprehend
That I won't go quietly into the night
Won't adhere to our fate without a fight
So I read their words
And I questioned all
They're frankly more prepared
For that curtain call

And the charlatans offered all of their hope
On the promise of places that would be a joke
Without you
Without you
Our faith an affront to all of their lies
And I doubt that the truth will materialize
Without you
Without you

And now they're coding data on our DNA
And the ones and zeroes have so much to say
And we'll get to the point where time doesn't lapse
When they figure out how to read the synapse
(The synapse)
The well known truths
Are now coming up falses
When they break us down to
Our electrical pulses
You might also like
Our ancestors tried and would find themselves proud
That we all exist in a place called the cloud
Those who went first, I'll soon find myself with them
A place for all, a social solipsism
What's it gonna mean?
We're part of the machine
Call it a singularity
A singularity

Why examine the knowledge that I've kept within
And return to the places that I've never been
Without you
Without you
And I guess what I've learned is what's passed through my eyes
But then why would I bother to internalize
Without you
Without you

If we all become
Just a single voice
I will seek you out
If I have a choice
Now the shift has come closer and closer to us
It's a question of faith, it's a question of trust
And the things that we've done are the things I've done best
Curiously await whatever's coming next
Now the time is approaching, they're plugging us in
And wherever we're going, I'm not joining in
Without you
Without you
When the moment has come to energize
I won't take the next step, won't ascend to the skies
Without you
