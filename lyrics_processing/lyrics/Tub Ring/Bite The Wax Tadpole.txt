And, quickly, I grabbed hold of pen and paper
To write down, so in the morning I wouldn't forget
Next day, I looked over what was written
And, oddly, it was only ones and zeroes
But perfect in the fact that it completed my set
Product of life, I've been told
Theories are stagnant and old
Time to demystify something new
Necessity leads us to change
What we discover is strange
Solely depending on point of view
Tonight, tonight, I turn out my light
And dream of carbon and protein which increase my might
Research avoids some regret
Predicting what we will get
Error accepted and therefore gone
Physics just hinder the dream
Bite the wax tadpole, it seems
Progress continues and marches on
Tonight, tonight, I turn out my light
And dream of vitamins and haircuts and genetic delight

Predicting what we will get
Error accepted and therefore gone
Physics just hinder the dream
Bite the wax tadpole, it seems
Progress continues and marches on
Tonight, tonight, I turn out my light
And dream of carbon and protein which increase my might
I dreamt I was swimming in the ocean
And came face to face with a blue whale
It frightened me the size that it would grow
And I found my purpose, I must prevent this
Before he hurts us
Bite the wax tadpole
Last night I awoke with all the answers
And, quickly, I grabbed hold of pen and paper
To write down, so in the morning I wouldn't forget
Then on the next day, I looked over what was written
And, oddly, there was only ones and zeroes
