Oh-ohie-ohie-oh, oh-ohie-ohie-oh
Ay-yayie-yayie-yay, ay-yayie-yayie-yay
Oh-ohie-ohie-oh, oh-ohie-ohie-oh
Well, step back, 'cause I don't know what I'm doin'
And I think I'm gonna do it some more
A bit strange, all the things you got me tryin'
But I'm dancin' like I've done it before
Well, step back, 'cause I don't know what I'm doin'
And I think I'm gonna do it some more
A bit strange, all the things you got me tryin'
But I'm dancin' like I've done it before
It's an honor that this great big world
Is accessible right in my hands
Foolish thoughts lead to foolish ends
But I only learn from doing
So it looks like I'll be tryin' again
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
Tr-tr-tryin'
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
Tr-tr-tryin'
You might also likeIt's been so long since I've felt I was wrong
It's a pleasure, I wish I knew friends
What would it mean if I changed my routine?
If it doesn't pan out, then it looks like I'll be tryin' again
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
Tr-tr-tryin'
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
Tr-tr-tryin'
Fewer sides that have gone unseen
And cultures that all seem to fit
Foolish thoughts lead to foolish ends
But the reason for denyin' and it looks like I'll be tryin'
Doesn't mean much and I know who to trust
But I'm playing it close to the chest
Helluva shame that I've mastered this game
So it's time to move on
Time to move onto the next
Well, step back, 'cause I don't know what I'm doin'
And I think I'm gonna do it some more
A bit strange
All the things you got me tryin'
But I'm dancin' like I've done it before
It's an honor that this great big world
Is accessible right from my hands
Foolish thoughts lead to foolish ends
But there is no point denyin' and it looks like I'll be tryin'
Doesn't mean much and I know who to trust
But I'm playing it close to the chest
Helluva shame that I've mastered this game
So it's time to move onto the next
It's been so long since I've felt I was wrong
It's a pleasure, I wish I knew friends
What would it mean if I changed my routine?
If it doesn't pan out then it looks like I'll be tryin' again
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
Tr-tr-tryin'
Looks like I'll be tryin' again
