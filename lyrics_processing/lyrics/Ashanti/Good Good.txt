When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at
I got that good good, I got that good good
I put it on him right, I do it every night
I leave him sitting mouth open like whew
So I don't worry 'bout nobody taking mine
'Cause I know just the right thing to do (I got that good good)

I ain't never had a problem with the one (No)
Never been worried bout him ever cheating on me
Cause when I say I got that pop lock and drop it believe me
If I'm with you, it's gon' kill you on the days you don't see me
See the things I possess, a lot of women don't (Don't)
And the things Ima do for mine, most won't (Won't)
I hear 'em talking bout it when I'm up in the salon
Crying cause they man ain't come home, I try to tell 'em

When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at
I got that good good, I got that good good
I put it on him right, I do it every night
I leave him sitting mouth open like whew
So I don't worry 'bout nobody taking mine
'Cause I know just the right thing to do (I got that good good)
