Ma, what's goin' on?
We sitting here, man, digging on each other
I'm feeling the shit out of you, you feeling the shit out of me
What, you scared?
Don't be scared

It was around 11:30 when I realized I miss you
Sittin' at home all alone, thinking "What did I just do?"
Feeling was strong coming on and I knew I wanted you
Something inside me held me back, boy, you got me scared of you

Got me afraid to let my love go
Is it my heart that I should follow? (I should follow)
Got me afraid to let myself go (Let it go, let it go)
Got me scared of you
Got me afraid to let my love go
Is it my heart that I should follow? (I should follow)
Got me afraid to let myself go (Let it go, let it go)
Got me scared of you

You see, what it, what it's like is, like
We gotta get over this hump, ma
Until we get over this hump
It's gonna be fucked up

If I let go, I don't know if my heart will remain strong
'Cause you're the type that just might give it right and get me strong
I couldn't be just a girl that you're seeing once a month
'Cause if it goes down, better believe I'm gonna be your only one

Got me afraid to let my love go
Is it my heart that I should follow? (I should follow)
Got me afraid to let myself go (Let it go, let it go)
Got me scared of you
Got me afraid to let my love go
Is it my heart that I should follow? (I should follow)
Got me afraid to let myself go (Let it go, let it go)
Got me scared of you

What's the problem, ma?

But you still scared

I'd be scared too
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, I'd be scared, too
It's aight, though
I'ma wait on you
