I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind, while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me
I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind, while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me

Looking in the mirror, I can see myself, standing in your arms
Holding me, and kissing me, and loving me
Ooh! You just can't get enough of me
Now I'm on the phone, telling you I'm all alone, so come on over
I'm out the shower now, about to oil down
I can't wait 'till you get here

With your hand in mine (Hand in mine!)
We don't have to worry about the time
(We don't have to worry about the time)
And what the future brings (What it brings), we can just let it be
(we can let it be!)
The way you smile at me (You smile at me), I already see (I already see)
You don't wanna leave (Don't wanna leave!)
So we can just sit back, relax and let it move naturally

I'm almost ready to accept the truth
I'm in love with you and I wanna tell you
I'm glad that you're here, uhh
And now we're face to face, in the candlelight
I'm watching your eyes watching mine
Layin' here with you-oooh-oooh, feels so good, feels so good...

We don't have to worry about the time
