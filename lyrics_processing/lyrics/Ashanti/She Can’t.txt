First off I'mma say it like this
I don't care what she doing 'cause I'm that bitch
I know I got what it takes
Ain't never been the average chick, I'm a particular make
And I ain't trying to be cocky with it
You gotta know how possess your confidence
You gotta let him know what he got on his hands
And if he tend to forget better remind his ass

Yeah, yeah, you told me you loved me, you told me you cared
You said there'll be no more mistakes
Yeah, you said, you said you was sorry
It won't happen again and you came running back
Cause you know I got that oh
She can't love you, she can't touch you like oh
She won't kiss you, won't fuck you like oh
She ain't got a body like mine
Face like mine, her brain not like mine, oh no

See, we done been through this a million times
Been through thick and thin and everything between it twice
Said I've been holding it down
You ain't gonna find nobody built like me around
I don't care about all the respect in the world
Long as you keep me on a pedestal
And nobody ever made you feel like I make you feel
Let's keep it real
