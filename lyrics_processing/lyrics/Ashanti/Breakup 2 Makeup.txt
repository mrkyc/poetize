Saw you again for the first time
In a long time
It brought out all these feelings that I never knew I had inside seeing you with another girl, it didn't sit me with me too well
And I'm mad at myself 'cause I love you
And with or without you, I'm going through hell

I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby, can we make up?
I know that this is kinda crazy
But baby, I wanna make up
I don't think that I could shake you
So baby, can we make up?
I know that this is kinda crazy
But baby, I wanna make up

I never knew I could love you
How I love you
I thought that I was through with you
So glad that I could be single
Now I'm gone, thinking 'bout the past
And wish that we could just go back
And I'm mad at myself 'cause I love you
And I really want you to come on back

But all the pain and the heartache you gave me
That only made me
Wanna get back with you
You held her hand the way you held mine
You felt her, uh, the way you felt mine
And all that fighting that we went through
See, I was already used to it
