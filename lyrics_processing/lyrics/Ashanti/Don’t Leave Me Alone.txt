What up, Ashanti?

Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)

Boy, why don't you just lay with me, stay with me?
I would love it if you had your way with me
'Cause I just can't get enough of your touch
You do the things I need to me so much
I don't wanna let you leave, I don't wanna let you go
You're not even here with me, so don't leave me alone

Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
No, no, oh
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone, oh oh oh
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Yeah, oh

Now, if I could just be with you, breathe with you
If you were to ask me, I would leave with you
I will go around the globe, as long as I know
I would be right by your side, wherever you go
I ain't gonna let you leave, I don't wanna let you go
Oh, I need you here with me

Hey, I don't wanna leave you alone
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
I don't wanna see you go, oh, don't go

Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
'Cause I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna let you go
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)

One of the reasons that I never wanna be alone
Is that I like what happens to me when I'm in your arms
It feels like home
Where I belong
'Cause my heart smiles from inside out
Only you can do it to me, baby, you can do it to me
So I can't leave you alone

Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
I just wanna be in your arms all night long
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
I just, I just wanna be in your arms all night long
Don't leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Leave me alone (leave me alone)

Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
I just, I just wanna be in your arms, wanna stay all night long
