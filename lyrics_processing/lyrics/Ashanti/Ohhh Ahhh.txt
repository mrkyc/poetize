It was in the way you grabbed my waist
Looked into my face
And told me I was your only yours
Already knew that I had fell for you
Giving myself to you
I kinda want a little more
See, I don't know what you did
But I like it and how it is
I don't know if it's right, I don't care if it's wrong
I don't know if it's love, but I can't get enough, so...

Ohh, ahh, ohh
You're just what I need tonight
Ohh, ahh, ohh
You're just what I need tonight

I always wanna be alone with you
No matter what we do
It's something that I'm gonna love
Even when I am on the phone with you
I pretend I'm holding you
I'm fiending for you more and more
See, now I know what you did
Just one kiss with your lips
See, I know how I feel, what I'm feeling is real
And I need to you to know that you're making me go...
