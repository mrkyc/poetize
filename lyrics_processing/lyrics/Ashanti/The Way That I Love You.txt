Ooh, no no no
Oh, shame

After all of this time that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love you)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)
The way that I love (The way that I love you, yeah)

I woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same (Be the same)
It felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothin'
I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it
But there it was, it was you and her
You left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read

Every thing you did and every thing you said
Now I'm standing here looking like damn
I thought it was you and I
Now all I got to say is why

I notice now that when I'm around you be tryna lock the doors, whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute, since we been in this house you ain't never did this before
Tell me what's this about (What's this about?)
I tried to sit and say to myself
This here is too good, he don't want nothing else
But there it was, it was you and her
You left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with

Every thing you bought, every thing you spent
Now I'm standing here once again
I thought it was you and I
Now all I have to say is why
After all of this time that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same

Ohh, ohh, ohh
You lied, you lied, oh why, oh why?
Can't, why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why?

After all of this time that we tried (Why? Why? Why?)
I found out we were living a lie (You lie, you lie, you lie)
And after all of this love that we made (We made, we made, we made, oh, oh)
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)
