I just want you to know that throughout it all
It's only you that stuck by me
And for that, I thank you, I love you
Ashanti (Ashanti!)

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

Boy, you got me doing things that I would never do (Never do)
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you, I would probably go insane
'Cause..

Only you can make me feel (Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (Only you can take me there)
And only you can make me feel (Only you, only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (Only you can take me there)

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

And only you could do them things that got me comin' back
You gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself
'Cause

Only you can make me feel (Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (Only you can take me there)
