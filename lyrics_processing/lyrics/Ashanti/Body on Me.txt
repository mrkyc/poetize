The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin'
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out 'til the morning
I can already tell you want it
'Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me

Hey, boy
I think I just might wanna come see you tonight
And you can have your way, boy
I know its been a while since you made my body right
Now I've been waiting patiently, anticipating you and me
And it ain't no question 'cause boy, I love you when you put that body on me

The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin'
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out 'til the morning
I can already tell you want it
'Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me

Hey' how you doin', mama?
I need to know ur name
You givin' me the eye, eye
I'm givin' you the same
It just hit me right now
What we should do today?
Go tell you friends "Bye bye"
And let's go hop a plane
It's no mistake the attraction's ironic
I wanna make you someone more then just a bon in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
Where you wanna come hang when your man is trippin'
You say your short this month and you're late on your rent
He took your car watchin' me hold this
Hey hey, you see, ooh
You see lil mama outta control

The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin'
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out 'til the morning
I can already tell you want it
'Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Now I see you lookin' at my body babe, and now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you, could you promise me that you could make it feel like it never did
'Cause I see, and you see, now if I please, could you please?
Now I ain't the one in no relationship, and I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it

The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin'
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out 'til the morning
I can already tell you want it
'Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
