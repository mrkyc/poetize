Looking in the mirror, I can see myself
Standing in your arms, holding me
And kissing me and loving me
Ooh, you just can't get enough of me
Now I'm on the phone
Telling you I'm all alone
So come on over, I'm out the shower now
About to oil down, I can't wait 'til you get here

I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love, it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me
I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love, it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me

I'm almost ready to accept the truth
I'm in love with you and I wanna tell you
I'm glad that you're here
And now we're face to face
In the candlelight
I'm watching your eyes, watching my eyes
Laying here with you
Feels so good, feels so good
