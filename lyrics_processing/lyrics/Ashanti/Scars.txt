Yeah, He's a walkin'(walkin')
Talkin' (talkin')
Livin' Regret
I wish I never met him, Never slept with him
Never involved myself
If I would have known better
I would never stayed together with you

He wrong, so I'm gone and I ain't comin' back
Wish I could be vindictive cause I wanna hurt him back
He wrong, so I'm gone and I ain't comin' back
Wish I could inflict something cause' I just wanna hurt him back
And I'mma make sure I'm drop-dead gorgeous every time he see me so he want it more, more
And I'mma make sure everything is successful let him know he
F*cked around and left the best he had
He's stuck in his ego
He lost when he let me go
I was arguably the best thing that happened to him he know
What I gave he can't find, there ain't nothin' like mine
Thought me and you was just us, I guess you couldn't man up
So I'm gone

I gave you everything
All of me
All my heart
Now I'm leaving with scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
You could have kept the pain
My heart is slain
Nothin' remains, no more
But Scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
See Ashanti LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like
Now I can barely make a standing
Here lookin' in your face
Such a disgrace To who we were and what we had
Thought we was on it like Usher and both had it bad
Everything I thought that you stood for I'm takin' all back

He wrong so I'm gone, And I ain't comin' back
So tired tryna figure out why this just didn't last
He wrong so I'm gone, and I ain't comin' back
My heart is hurtin' but my mind is sayin' leave his ass
And I'mma make sure I'm drop-dead gorgeous every time he see me so he want it more, more
And I'mma make sure everything is successful let him know he
F*cked around and left the best he had
He stuck in his ego
He lost when he let me go
I was arguably the best thing that happened to him he know
What I gave he can't find, there ain't nothin' like mine
Thought me and you was just us, I guess you couldn't man up
So I'm gone

I gave you everything
All of me
All my heart
Now I'm leaving with scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
You could have kept the pain
My heart is slain
Nothin' remains, no more
But Scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
Thought we was gonna build
Thought what we had was real
Thought me and you was gonna have a house in the hills
Maybe 3 or 4 kids
Bently's and drop Benz's
We was supposed to ride out and be best friends
But NO, it all came to an end (came to an end)
Cause I refuse to go through the same sh*t again
Ain't no more questionin'
Ain't no more arguin'
Ain't no more cryin', lyin', tryin' to put up wit him

I gave you everything
All of me
All my heart
Now I'm leaving with scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
You could have kept the pain
My heart is slain
Nothin' remains, no more
But Scars
With scars, with scars, with scars
Ugh
We all go through it
So, everyone always wants to know
Like what goes on personally in my life and where I get all my inspiration
I mean, I've gone through a lot, you know?
People that I loved betrayed me and, and I never saw it comin'
It was crazy and it's like, it leaves a lil' scar
You know what I mean? But these scars are like little reminders that you got through it and not to look back
"I'm leavin' with scars"
It's like a double entendre I guess
Cause you're leavin', your scarred
But you're also healed and you don't have to worry about bleeding anymore
You know, a scar, it's like it symbolizes healing
So, it's good that you got the scars and you leave cause your healed up
I'm leaving with scars, I'm leaving with scars, I'm leaving with scars I'm leaving with scars
