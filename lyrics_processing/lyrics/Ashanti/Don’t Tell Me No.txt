I know it's really over, but I had to tell you something that I forgot to tell you
And if you want me, you know that if you want me, you can call me, bbm me, hit me, hit me however you want to

I know I do and say a lot of things I don't mean
I've been a lot to handle, made mistakes between you and me
Yeah, I'm a headache, spoiled, but I'm ready
To turn everything around cause I don't wanna see you leave me, baby
I know it's crazy, you love me and you hated that I got your heart
You can't stop loving me, loving me
You'll say it's over, but I don't think you mean it
Cause I see it in your eyes, you still be wanting me, wanting me

Remember how you used to love me? And how I used to love you?
Every time you'll remind me, baby, I just want that old thing back
I still look in your eyes and I can tell that you want it
Baby, don't tell me no, you be what I'm looking for
(Don't leave, don't go
Don't leave, baby, don't tell me no
Don't leave, don't go
Don't leave, baby, don't tell me no)

I know it's crazy
I know it's really crazy that I'm still calling you baby
After everything that we been through
But you're amazing when it comes to lovemaking
Tell me what you want me to do
Hands down, you are the greatest
If anybody ask you're my favorite, my favorite
You should be my one and only
Still nobody know me like you know me
