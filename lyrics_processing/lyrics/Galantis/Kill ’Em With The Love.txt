It's in the whispers of biology
It's in my heart, it's in my soul
(Woo!)
It's in the make-believe of geometry
It's in the stories I've been told

When you've tried it all but it ain't enough
When you can't give up cause you love beyond belief
I've got a message for y'all

Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep our hearts in jail now
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep our hearts in jail now!
Kill 'em with the love
Kill 'em with the love
Kill 'em with the love
Kill 'em with the love

It's all we know, it's all we care about
The common sense is left at home
It's all we see, it's all we hearing now
A hungry heart is to be whole

When you've tried it all but it ain't enough
When you can't give up cause you love beyond belief
I've got a message for y'al

Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep our hearts in jail now
Kill 'em with the love, strobe lights above
They can't keep our hearts in jail now
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep, can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep, can't keep
Can't keep our hearts in jail now!
