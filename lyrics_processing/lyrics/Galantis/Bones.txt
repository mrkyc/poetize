Woah, woah

You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches through my core
Feels like, as far as you and me, I've never had a choice
You feel like home, hmm
You're like the opposite of all of my mistakes (Hey)
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know, that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home, hmm

So if you're asking me
Say, "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones (Hey)
