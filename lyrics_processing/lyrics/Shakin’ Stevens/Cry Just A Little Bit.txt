Well
I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
I know it's crazy and I don't know why
But I die just a little bit
Die just a little bit
I need to be the one that's by your side
You are the beat in my heart
My love for you is something I can't hide
And I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Every night before I'm fallin' asleep
Well
I pray just a little bit
Pray just a little bit
I pray nobody wants your loving to keep
And you stray just a little bit
Stray just a little bit
Don't let temptation fill your heart with dreams
You might also likeDon't let your mind run away
Forbidden love is never what it seems
And you cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
You're the light that brightens all of my days
Yes
The sun shines above you and I would die
If someone took you away
'cause I love you
Love you
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
I want forever to be you and I
That's's the way it should be
I live for you and
Baby
That is why I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Every night we have to whisper good-bye
I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
I know it's crazy and I don't know why
But I die just a little bit
Die just a little bit
Cry
Cry
Cry
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry
Cry
Cry
Cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
