In the fountains of the universe
Set time in accord
Sits the boychild Solomon
Ever-turning round and round (and round)
In the cities of the southern sky
Set points universe
Dreams he of glory
Pulsating round and round (and round)

Future times will stand and clearly see, oh! (Highest dancing)
Of the course of innocence (Drifting drifting)

See it all
See it all
'Till tomorrow
See it all
See it all
'Till tomorrow

Future times will stand and clearly smile
Of the course of innocence
You might also like

Dantalion will ride again
Raging forth underland
The course of evils standing straight
Grind to grind to grind
Hot metal will abound the land
Churning out shout
As the form regards our blazing hand

Future times will stand and clearly see, oh!
Of the course of innocence

(One) One the word will enter all our hearts
(Two) Two the duel will alter them
(Three) Three jewels countenance divine away delight away
(Four) Four the fight to free the land
(Five) Five the islands of Arabia
(Six) Six the tears that separate
Six the tears that separate

Pt. 2: Rejoice

Rejoice forward out this feeling
Ten true summers long
We go round and round and round and round
Until we pick it up again

Time flies, on and on it goes
Through the setting sun
Carry round and round and round and round
Until it comes to carry you home

Rejoice forward out this feeling
The white eagle soars
He go round and round and round
Until the early winds of change

Dawn's new light conquering timeless ease
Spread the harvest breeze
Let our hour of passion
Gently hold our heads on high with you
Gently hold our heads on high!


Rejoice forward out this feeling
Ten true summers long
We go round and round and round and round
Until we pick it up again

Time flies, on and on it goes
Through the setting sun
Carry round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round
