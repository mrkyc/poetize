Hearing
Talking
Yes, I
Love you

Set your heart sail on the river (Hearing)
Look around you as you drift downstream (Talking)
Pouring souls into the ocean (Love you)
Take account of all you've seen

One people, together
Freedom for today
So easy, the future
So see the children's way

Love me
Teach me
Know me

One people, together
Freedom for today
Tomorrow, forever
So see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers, our hearts entwine

How we talk, how we teach our children
How they move, we direct our eyes
All the senses tuned discovery
As and as and when our hearts decide

Be ready now, be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

(Hearts) One heart's for love, one's for giving (Sailing down the river)
(Hearts) Two hearts are better than one (Throwing out a line)
I hearing it (Hearts)
I living it
I believe in it (Sharing out your fortunes)
(Hearts) Two hearts are better than one (In and out of time)

Who would believe you? Wise men do
Days that we knew it was clear with you
You sing the answers, question time
Now that you need me, let our hearts entwine
Let our hearts entwine

Hearts, sailing down the river
Hearts, throwing out a line
I hearing it
I living it
I believe in it
I loving it
Hearts (Two hearts will always be)
In and out of time

As we flow down life's rivers
I see the stars glow one by one
All angels of the magic constellation
