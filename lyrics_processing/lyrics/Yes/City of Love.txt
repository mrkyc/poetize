Hey!

Once bitten, twice shy
No, no regrets at all
Justice, body smooth take over
Good girls, they work the city
Good guys, they spike you hard
How they jive and jingle
When you're in their backyard

Street corner wanderlust
Beckoning the good guy
Take this, get that
Have a good time

He young and tactile
He ready for anything that is
How they jive and jingle
They've read the book that gives

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Hey! Supervise this good treatment
Alternative line by line
So the street guys so observant
Take him for a ride
Have a good time

Like a legend the man, he's sharp
His woman gladly watching
As he strides out of the dark
Better be quick, get away

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come


Oh!
Good timing has its good price
One trick and you're stuck with the dice
How they jive and jingle
When you're their sacrifice
Fast as lightning
Go, go, get high, he's looking good
Once bitten, twice shy
No woman, no cry
No woman, don't cry

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night (Yes, we will)
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
