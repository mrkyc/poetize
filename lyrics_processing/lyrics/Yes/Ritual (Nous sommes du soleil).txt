Nous sommes du soleil
Du soleil
Du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
(Nous sommes du soleil, du soleil)
We love when we play
(Nous sommes du soleil, du soleil)
(Nous sommes du soleil, du soleil) Nous sommes du soleil
We love when we play (Nous sommes du soleil, du soleil)
We love when we play

Open doors we find our way; we look, we see, we smile
Surely day-breaks cross our path and stay maybe a while
Let them run, let them chase, let them hide between
Constant doors will open eyes
You might also like
As life seems like, life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Maybe I'll just sing awhile and then give you a call
Maybe I'll just say, "hello", and say, "maybe that's all"
Hurry home, as love is true will help us through the night
'Til we're coming home again

Our life seems like, life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Catch as we look and use the passions that flow
As we try we continue
We receive all we venture to give


Maybe we'll just stand awhile and surely we can call
Dreams are said to blossom courage constant to the soul
Change we must as surely time does, changes call the course
Held inside we enter day-breaks
Asking for, asking for
The source, the source, the source, the source

Sent as we sing our music's total retain
As we try and consider
We receive all we venture to give

All we say is our soul constant sight listener
We won't tender our song clearer till we sail
Then I will be there
And I will be there
As clearer companions shall call to be near you
They move around telling me that move around surely sing
As they don't seem to matter at all
At all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all
At all, at all
At all, at all

Hold me my love, hold me today, call me round
Travel we say, wander we choose love tune
Lay upon me, hold me around lasting hours
We love when we play
We hear a sound and alter our returning
We drift the shadows and course our way back home
Flying home
Going home

Look me my love, sentences move dancing away
We join, we receive as our song memories long hope in away
Nous sommes du soleil
Hold me around lasting hours
We love when we play

Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
