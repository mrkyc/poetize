You know you've got me feelin' some kind of way
Like cupid shot his arrow right into me
And now I'm simply twisted, I can't unwind
You're stuck inside my system, blowing my mind
High up in the sky, you caught my eye
You make my heart beat
I need a doctor, cause I feel it from my head to my feet
It's like the room is spinning, each time you walk up in it
You're the talk of the town, I think it's going down

Hey! Hello, you know you're making me love sick
You like my dynamite, I'm like tick tick
I've got a beat, my heart like a hundred
What can I do, I caught a bad case of you
Oh oh oh, a bad case of you
Oh oh oh, caught a bad case of you
Oh oh oh, a bad case of you
I caught a bad case of you

Why you got me waiting, enough is enough
I've got a fascination with turning it up
You're making butterflies beat beat on my drum
I swear my heart is like ba-dum-dum-dum-dum
I'll keep it rosie thorne, the only one you adore
You're my obsession, let's face it
You got my hopes up, let's brace it
I'm losing my composure, turn up remote controller
You took my heart by the hand, and now you've got me sayin'
