You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Shoulda told you straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

You're not boyfriend material
Got your back up straight against a wall
Eyeing up the girlies from the head to the toe
Ha, they think you're serious
Alright, you're kinda sweet
Gonna knock them socks right off your feet
Ooh, boy, gotta rot the teeth
But you can't stay long, yeah, you got to breathe

Why don't you just come on and take a ride?
We're chillin' like an ice pack inside
Why don't you just come on and jump on in?
I don't care if you sink or you swim
You might also like
You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Shoulda told you straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

You're not boyfriend material
Gotta know, are you like, "really real?"
You can come and test me, you can come and try me
Ha, I think you might just like me
You know you're kinda cool
Used to mess around with all the little girlies in the school
Ooh, boy, gonna break the rules
Ooh, boy, gonna break the rules

Why don't you just come on and take a ride?
We're chillin' like an ice pack inside
Why don't you just come on and jump on in?
I don't care if you sink or you swim
You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
