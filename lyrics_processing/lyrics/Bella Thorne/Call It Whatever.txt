Everybody's askin' what I'm thinkin' of you
Wanna show and tell 'em 'bout the things that we do
I know what I'm feelin' and you're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too, you're feelin' it too
Call me up and wonder why I'm makin' a fuss
Wanna hear the little little secrets of us
I won't tell them anything they don't have a clue
About me and you, about me and you

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
And no I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want

Don't you know I'm not another typical girl
Skip the fancy dinners we go straight for dessert
I don't need the flowers, you can give me the world
Give me the world, give me the world
We are never gonna try to play by the rules
And every little thing that we should say or do
Uh Oh, Uh Oh
Is wrapped around my little finger

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
And no I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
And no I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
