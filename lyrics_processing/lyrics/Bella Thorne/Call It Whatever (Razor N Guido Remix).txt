(Hey!)

(Hey!)

(Hey!)
(Let's call it, let's call it, let's call it, let's call it)
(Hey!)
(Let's call it, let's call it, let's call it, let's call it, let's call, it, let's call it, let's call it, let's call it...)
(Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever)
(Feelin' it, feelin' in, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it)

Everybody's askin' what I'm thinkin' of you
Wanna show and tell 'em 'bout the things that we do
I know what I'm feelin' and you feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too, you're feelin' it too
Call me up and wonder why I'm makin' a fuss
Wanna hear the dirty, little secrets of us
I won't tell 'em anything, they don't have a clue
About me and you, about me and you-ou
You might also like
Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, t-t-take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We gotta thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
And, no, I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say

Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever (hey!)
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever (hey!)
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Don't you know I'm not another typical girl
Skip the fancy dinners, we go straight for dessert
I don't need the flowers, you can give me the world
Gimme the world, gimme the w-orld
We are never gonna try to play by the rules
And every little thing that we should say or do
Uh oh (uh oh)
Uh Oh (uh oh)
Is wrapped around my middle finger

Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, t-t-take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close, I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We gotta thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
And, no, I don't need a diamond ring

Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever (hey!)
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever (hey!)
Whatever we want
Let's call it whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride...

Whatever we want!
