Watch me move, watch me shake it
Watch me move, watch me shake it, watch me break it (Oh)
Watch me move while she shakin'
And she break it, and she make it, and she naked
(It's a banger)

What it do? She's a baddie
If she make it clap, make it clap
Then it's back, and it's that
And I can swing it to the side, see if you can ride
I can be all up in your insides
Wifey material, I can make you my bride (Mmm-mmm)
Oh, shit, I didn't know she was your bitch (I'm sorry)
Haha, I lied
If she want a good fuckin', I'll provide
Rockin' in the Uber, roadside
I dropped her off and I never replied
And I like all kinds of bitches, miss
Fuckin' worldwide, that's right, bitch (Ha)

She move it fast, she move it slow
Let me see how low it can go
She shake it fast, she shake it slow
Let me see how far you can go (You can go)
She move it fast, she move it slow (She move it slow)
Let me see how low it can go (Ooh, girl)
She shake it fast, she shake it slow
Let me see how far you can go (Woo)

Racks, stacks, MAC, pack it up in the bag
Ooh, she bad, she a snack

She wanna hit the studio soundtrack (Ooh)
Roasted on the Barbies' smokestack (Haha)
Ride me like a cowgirl, horseback
That's my ex's bitch, payback (Ooh)
I'ma steal your girl, ransack (Damn, bitch)
I'ma fly her out, nice, meet me at the tarmac
This my highschool bitch, throwback (Throwback, throwback)
It's all a game to me (Mmm)
Tic tac, tic tac
Move it faster like a Gemini, zodiac
