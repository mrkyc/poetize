Some say I wish upon a star
Cross your fingers as you will go far
But everybody knows, everybody knows
That it takes much more to shine
You've been very so deep
Haven't seen the sun, haven't felt it's heat
But everybody knows, everybody knows
That it takes just a little more time

All the people can see it, they don't wanna believe it
But I'll never give up, 'cuz you're a precious diamond
You can handle the pressure, it will make you better, and brighter than ever
'Cuz you're my diamond in the rough

I'm never giving up on you
I'm never giving up on you
Oh I'm never giving up on
I'm never giving up
I'm never giving up on my diamond in the rough

You don't need to belong, people will talk you can prove them wrong
'Cuz nobody knows, nobody knows, that you made a beautiful things
But I've seen the dark spark to you, that dim your light, don't know what to do
But turn out to flames, not to all the way
'Cuz I know you can handle anything
You might also like
All the people can see it, they don't wanna believe it
But I'm never giving up, cuz you're my diamond in the rough

I'm never giving up on you
You know, I'm never giving up
Never giving up, oh, oh, oh
I'm never giving up
I'm never giving up
Oh, I'm never giving up, you're my diamond

And in theses dormant situations
When the ice start to setting in
You're in your element, and you can be magnificent
So rise and stands all, 'cuz underneath a home
It's a beautiful heart, and a brand new start

I'm never giving up on
I'm never giving up on you
Oh, I'm never giving up on
I'm never giving up on you
Oh I'm never giving up on
I'm never giving up on you
I'm never giving up on, my diamond in the rough
No, no, no, no, no
I'm never giving, never giving, never giving, up on you
Yeah
