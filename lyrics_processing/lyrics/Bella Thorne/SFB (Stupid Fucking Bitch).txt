You're a stupid fucking bitch, but you already know this
And you let me see your tits, but I'm still not over it
You wanted me for clout, and I should've thrown you out
But I never resist the way you bite your lower lip

All my friends think you're a bitch
They wish I was over it
Should've left you in a ditch
But I'm not over it (That's right)
I'm not over it
'Cause I'm a stupid fucking bitch
I'm a stupid fucking bitch
(Bitch)
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)

I admit it, I'm a stupid fucking bitch
'Cause I let you run your mouth before I even run this shit
(Should've been done)

Should've hit and quit it
But I let you check in for extended visits
(Should've been done)
Should've hit and quit it
Don't you know I run this town? Now you're making me lit it
(I burned it down)
And all the bridges in it
Let me break it down, let me get specific
(I burned it down)
Let me get specific
You might be slick, but I'm the slickest
You copy my shit, yeah, you tried to mimic
Let me keep going 'cause I ain't finished
You might also like
All my friends think you're a bitch
They wish I was over it
Should've left you in a ditch
(Why can't you move on?)
But I'm not over it
(I just wanna move on)
I'm not over it
(I just wanna move on)
'Cause I'm a stupid fucking bitch

I admit it, I'm a stupid fucking bitch
'Cause I let you run your mouth before I even run this shit
(Should've been done)

Yeah, I reached my limit
Took a lotta shit and now I'm out to get it
(Should've been done)
Remove with a Clorox finish
You're a dirty bitch, now you're staining my image
(I burned it down)
For all your shit, ran my car keys all across your whip
(I burned it down)
Done and finished, on my period, end of sentence
