Cause you got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight

I sat inside that restaurant
All by myself, I thought you'd come
I couldn't hide behind my darkest shades
And all the people walkin' by
Were starin' at the lonely one
And wonderin' who made it cry that way

My heart is black and blue
I don't want no one but you
No one but you (you)
Oh, no one but you (you)
Oh, gets me like you do (you do)
Oh, gets me like you do (you do)
Oh...

Cause you got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
And I'm a fool, I love the one
The one that I should hate
You got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
You might also like
I really thought that your goodbye
Was only just goodbye for now
But you're not here, I guess the joke's on me
Tried so hard to walk away
But I can barely turn around
This sidewalk feels like quicksand underneath my feet

My heart is black and blue
I don't want no one but you
No one but you (you)
Oh, no one, but you (you)
Oh, gets me like you do (you do)
Oh, gets me like you do (you do)
Oh...

Cause you got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
And I'm a fool, I love the one
The one that I should hate
You got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
Why can't I let me let go-oh-oh? (gets me like you do)
Why can't I let me let go-oh-oh-oh-oh?
Why can't I let me let go? (gets me like you do)
Why can't I let me let go?

Cause you got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
And I'm a fool, I love the one
The one that I should hate
Got my heart weighted down
Like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight
Li-like a paperweight

(No one, but you)
You got my heart weighted down (oh)
Like a paperweight
(No one, but you)
And I'm a fool, I love the one (oh)
The one that I should hate
(Gets me like you do, you do)
You got my heart weighted down (oh)
Like a paperweight
(Gets me like you do, you do)
Li-like a paperweight
