Hey girls, hey girls
Hey girls, hey girls

Hey girls, we're rolling out
There's something in the air
The world's a disco ball
The party is everywhere

Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
When the beat drops down, we drop down too
Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
What it do? What it do?

Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep singing it, ooh
Step, step it out on the floor
Right, left, two, three and four
One love, there's room for more
'Cause when we get together
Dancing 'til two-thousand and forever
Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep screaming it, oh
Hey girls, hey girls

Hey girls, hey girls
Hey girls, hey girls

Hey girls, let's turn it up
So they can hear the sound
The crowd's a megaphone
Ready to get loud

Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
When the beat drops down, we drop down too
Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
What it do? What it do?

Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep singing it, ooh
Step, step it out on the floor
Right, left, two, three and four
One love, there's room for more
'Cause when we get together
Dancing 'til two-thousand and forever
Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep screaming it, oh
Hey girls, hey girls
Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
When the beat drops down, we drop down too
Drop the beat down, one, two, one, two
What it do? What it do?

Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep singing it it, ooh
Hey girls
Step, step it out on the floor
Right, left, two, three and four
One love, there's room for more
'Cause when we get together
Dancing 'til two-thousand and forever
Ring, ring, calling my girls
Bring, bringing it to the whole world
Keep screaming it, oh
Hey girls, hey girls
