I was walking up and down in drunken pride
When my knees began to flutter, and I sank down in the gutter
And a pig came up and lay down by my side
As I lay there in the gutter, thinking thoughts I could not utter
I thought I heard a passing lady say
You can tell the man who boozes by the company that he chooses
And with that the pig got up and walked away
You've heard of General Wellington who won at Waterloo
But there's a good old Irishman I'll mention unto you
He comes from dear old Dublin, he's a man we all applaud
For he always finds a corkscrew far more handy than a sword
He's good old General Guinness, he's a soldier strong and stout
He's found on every bottle front, and he can't be done without
His noble name, his worldwide fame, deserve three hearty cheers
Hurrah for General Guinness of the Dublin Boozileers
This hale and hearty warrior is worshipped in the ranks
For he does his task inside the cask, as well as in the tanks
And he bears the brunt on every front, North, South, East, and West
And he wears about ten million canteen medals on his chest
He's good old General Guinness, he has won the world's applause
'Twas him who kept our spirits up in the midst of all our wars
Who was the first to flirt with Mademoiselle from Armentiers?
Why, good old General Guinness of the Dublin Boozileers
You might also likeAll over bonny Scotland, too, the General is seen
They've given him the freedom of the toon of Aberdeen
From Inverness to Galloshiles he keeps them warm and bright
And they love to gather round him, och, on every moonlit night
He's good old General Guinness, he's as good as Scottish broth
'Twas him who turned the Firth of Forth into the Firth of Froth
All Scotsmen dance the highland fling, and shout when he appears
