You're tempting me
To all of life and all its pleasure
Take me to the dream
To the heights and the depths of my soul

Here we free
Thoughts inside
Giving up for giving time
But a world without end
Where no souls can descend
There will be no Sumertime
How lost life's been
Afraid of waking up
So afraid...
To take the dream...

Take the dream
Take it!
(I will find her)
Take the dream
(I will forever)
You might also like
Shapes of angels
The night casts
Lie dead but dreaming
In my past, and they're here
They want to meet you
They want to play with you
So take the dream...

(I will find her)
Take the dream
(I will forever)
Can't break free
(I will find her)
Can't break free
(I will forever)

And I hear them call
They want to plague you
And they're here once more
They want to lay with you
They want to take you
To the shame of your past
Take the dream...
Take me
Lead me far away
Take me there
There I'll fade away

But I can't hide
(But I can't hide)
But I can't hide
And I cannot die
And I can't hide
And I cannot die

I take the dream
(I will find her)
Take the dream
(I will forever)

We're but fools of our fate
On this earth I shall wait
By the roots of my soul
I am losing control
Take the dream...

The sleepers in you
Shapes of angels
So deep within you
Feel your soul
Drowning
Unloosen your soul
Drowning
Drowning
Drowning

What is reality?
Tell me
What is reality?
Tell me
What is reality?
Tell me

Tell me thoughts of God
Do dreams fall from God?
Tell me what dreams may come
Break free thoughts all gone
We've all come down!


Take me here
Thoughts of God
Take me here
Fall from God
Take me here
What dreams may come
Take me here
Thoughts of God
Fall from God
Fall from God
Take me away
Take me away
You're my ticket here (Take me)
Take me out of here (Take me)
Take me
Take me out of here
Take me
Take me away
Take me
Take me
