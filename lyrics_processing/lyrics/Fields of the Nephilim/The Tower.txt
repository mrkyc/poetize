Summer's fouled now winter flocks
She lifts her veil to the morning rain
Wipes her eyes to the summer again
Pearls of dew shimmer on her face
Cut inside she would dream to taste
She knocks her flowers from the window side
They fall to the ground they fall to the ground
Hide away from the raging sun
You hide your love from the fire beyond
Now the woman in an aging form
She's tangled in the bushes tall
Cowering down with head in hands
She cries out loud, she cries out loud
"Seems so cold, it seems so cold tonight
Seems so cold, seems so cold tonight"
Hide away from the raging sun
You hide your love from the fire beyond
She can't see visions of this force below
Freezes her life through (garbled "in a joke" ???)
She heads to the voice of this rainy day
And it cries like a choir in her mind to stay
It's "Sister hold now, hold now, hold your head
Dream a cloud put out the fire which is your bed!"
She then danced through the kitchen through the force below
And it cries "How fun! But oh so slow..."

Just living, like a dreamless child with hatred
She's never been quite as cut by life before
Never been cut by way of life before
Hide away from the raging sun
You hide your love from the fire beyond
She can't see visions of this force below
Freezes her life through... (garbled "in a joke" ???)
She heads to the voice of this rainy day
It cries like a choir in her mind "Just stay!"
"Sister hold now, hold now, hold your head
Dream a cloud put out the fire which is your bed"
