Just a quiet country house I had to call home
Live with some other folks and rich millionaires
Just sat on their money lord, it seemed they didn't care
Finally we moved out and found our own place
Where I could walk around with a smile on my face
But I knew in order to become a man
I'd have to pull up my roots and move on in this land
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I came to school in the big city
Looked around at the lights and I thought they were pretty
Told me they'd teach me to live by their rules
So I wouldn't be nobody's fool
I found out, 'fore too long
Those rules didn't allow me to sing my song
But I knew in order to become a man
I have to pull up my roots and move on in this land
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there

They told me they'd teach me how to think
Gave me books to read and papers to write
But they didn't know about this boy's coming fight
I found out after a while
Reading those books was not helping my smile
But I knew in order to not conceal
I'd have to play my music and express what I feel
I've gotta move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here yeah
