Just a taste and you want it
No questions, no drama
There's a chink in your armor
Think you cannot be broken
You're a drop in the ocean
Now the wheels are in motion
'Cause you just can't help yourself
It's gotten in every cell
You've fallen under the spell
It's all, all that you wanted and more
Glittering out till it falls
Walking its way to your call

Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
You might also like
Can you taste in on your lips like liquorice
Do you want some more, so bittersweet
Did you think that you were innocent
When you're really not that different?
Can you taste in on your lips like liquorice
Do you want some more, so bittersweet
Did you think that you were innocent
When you're really not that different?

Ha ha
La la la la la la la la la la

They know the things that make you tick
And help to push you to the brink
I'm off the chain and you're the link
They've got your heart between their teeth
Too good to be true, it's a dream
Wake up and smell the saccharin

Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
Can you taste in on your lips like liquorice
Do you want some more, so bittersweet
Did you think that you were innocent
When you're really not that different?
Can you taste in on your lips like liquorice
Do you want some more, so bittersweet
Did you think that you were innocent
When you're really not that different?

Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
La la la la la la la la la la
Can you taste it, taste it?
Can you taste it, taste it?
