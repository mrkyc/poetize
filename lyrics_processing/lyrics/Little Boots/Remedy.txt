I can see you stalking like a predator, I've been here before
Temptation calls like Adam to the apple, but I will not be caught
'Cause I can read those velvet eyes and all I see is lies

No more poison killing my emotion
I will not be frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh
Stop, stop praying cause I'm not, not playing
I'm not frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh

Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh
Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh

Spin me faster like a kaleidoscope, all I've got's the floor
Yeah, you can try, but I've found the antidote, music is the cure
So you can try to paralyse, but I know best this time

No more poison killing my emotion
I will not be frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh
Stop, stop praying cause I'm not, not playing
I'm not frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh

Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh
Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh

And when the music fades away, I know I'll be okay
Contagious rhythms in my brain, let it play

No more poison killing my emotion
I will not be frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh
Stop, stop praying 'cause I'm not, not playing
I'm not frozen, dancing is my remedy, remedy, oh

Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh
Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh

Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy oh, uh, oh, uh, oh
Move while you're watching me, dance with the enemy
