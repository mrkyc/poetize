You're the night to my day and the left to my right
The blood to my veins and the dark to my light
The stop to my start and the constant beat to my heart
The sun to my moon and the stars in my sky
The hot to my cold and the black to my white
The rain to my thunderclouds and the truth in my lies

So tell me what you want to see
'Cause everything I want to be
Is there in your reflection
Shining out right back at me

So love me in perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete
In perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete

So tell me your dreams and I'll tell you all my fears
So ask me your questions, I'll tell you what you want to hear
You might also like
You're the high to my low and the give to my take
The shadow I cast and the echo I make
The calm to my storm and the lesson in my mistakes

So tell me what you want to see
You're everything I want to be

So love me in perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete
In perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete

So tell me your dreams and I'll tell you my fears
So ask me your questions, what you want to hear?

So love me in perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete
In perfect symmetry, be my everything
If you just love me in perfect symmetry
Only you can make me feel complete
So tell me your dreams and I'll tell you all my fears
