I'm not a fantasy
I'm not some kind of Holy Ghost
I'm not a memory
You turn to when you need it most
I didn't promise I'd be perfect
Didn't promise that I'd play the game
So let's be honest, is this working
Is this working, would you hesitate
If I was to tell you

All I really need
Is not a happy ending
Yeah, all I really need
I wanna stop pretending
If you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for?
If you treat me like a real girl
Won't you tell me that I'm worth more?
If you treat me like a real girl

It's not a mystery
How long until you realize (I'm a real girl)
When you stand in front of me
It's something that you can't deny (I'm a real girl)
Were you hoping I'd be flawless?
Were you wishing I'm a movie star?
Let's be open, do you want it
Do you want it, would I get the part
If I was to tell you
You might also like
All I really need
Is not a happy ending
Yeah, all I really need
I wanna stop pretending
If you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for?
If you treat me like a real girl
Won't you tell me that I'm worth more?
If you treat me like a real girl

I won't stop you if you choose
That this color's not for you
If I'm still not getting proof
Then there is nothing I can do

Cause all I really need
Is not a happy ending
Yeah, all I really need
I wanna stop pretending
If you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for?
If you treat me like a real girl
Won't you tell me that I'm worth more?
