The city treats you like a stranger
Though you've been here a hundred times before
Playing the game you need a changer
Closing the window, need an open door

And I don't like where I am
And my friends don't understand
Was it all part of the plan? For me?

So I try to be strong
As I turned the TV on
But the static plays too long, in my head....

No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
Cause there's a silver lining on the way
No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
Cause there's a silver lining on the way
You might also like
Yeah, I could go about my business
I drink my coffee, yeah I need the hit
Craving a little more attention
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm like this

So I try to be strong
As I turned the TV on
But the static plays too long, in my head....

No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
Cause there's a silver lining on the way
No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
Cause there's a silver lining on the way

Am I feeling a million miles away
You make it sound so easy when you say
No pressure
No pressure!
No pressure
No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
Cause there's a silver lining on the way
No pressure, no pressure
Anything is possible
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure
Everything could change
