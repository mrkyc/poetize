I thought we had a connection, I thought we had a good thing
I thought I knew direction that we were heading in
And I know it is not healthy to sit and fantasize
But I thought we were complete at least on the outside

I know promises fade away
Have you forgotten yesterday?
I love you anyway you know

I thought we clicked like two parts of a puzzle, now I'm all in a muddle
Click like the flick of a switch and now the pieces don't seem to fit
Click like a second in time like you were reading my mind
Think how we were from the start
And now our halves are falling, falling apart

I thought you were my religion, you had faith in me
I thought you were a condition that no one else could treat
And I know all your friends say as she's out of her mind
And you're best staying away, you just don't know what she'll try

And now my conscience fades away
A 100 years becomes a day
I love you anyway you know
You might also like
I thought we clicked like two parts of a puzzle, now I'm all in a muddle
Click like the flick of a switch and now the pieces don't seem to fit
Click like a second in time like you were reading my mind
Think how we were from the start
And now our halves are falling, falling apart

I thought we had a connection but now I just feel rejection
Thought that was love perfection, things look different in reflection
Thought you were my religion, worshiped everything that you do
Tell me a part of it was true, tell me

We clicked like two parts of a puzzle, now I'm all in a muddle
Click like the flick of a switch and now the pieces don't seem to fit
Click like a second in time like you were reading my mind
Think how we were from the start
