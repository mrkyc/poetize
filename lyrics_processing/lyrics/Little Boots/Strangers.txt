We see ourselves like stars
At once so close and yet so far
Bodies so familiar
We both would know them in the dark
The only constant thing is change
Even the strongest wall can shake
Don't want it all to go to waste
But feels like we're about to break

You raise your voice, I slam a door
Somewhere were we ever over - pause
I sit alone and feel regret
You go out drinking to forget
And when we meet by accident
A subconscious coincidence
There's an uncomfortable suspense
A thousand words hanging unsaid

I know you so well
But we dance like strangers tonight
No one could ever tell
We used to hold our bodies tight
Trying to have a real good time
But something just doesn't feel right
The music's playing but we never hear
Cause we dance like strangers
We dance like strangers tonight
You might also like
You're surrounded by your friends
Feeding them stories with no end
They all agree and nod their heads
But they can never comprehend
'Cause they don't know you like I do
There's no one else that we include
I've seen you act like such a fool
But you held my hand when I was blue

I know you so well
But we dance like strangers tonight
No one could ever tell
We used to hold our bodies tight
Trying to have a real good time
But something just doesn't feel right
The music's playing but we never hear
Cause we dance like strangers
We dance like strangers tonight

I wanna meet you for the very first time again, again
I wanna start anew with a stranger like you again, again
I wanna meet you for the very first time again, again
I wanna start anew with a stranger like you again, again
I know you so well
But we dance like strangers tonight
No one could ever tell
We used to hold our bodies tight
Trying to have a real good time
But something just doesn't feel right
The music's playing but we never hear
Cause we dance like strangers
