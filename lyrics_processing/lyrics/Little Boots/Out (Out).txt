I don't wanna go out (Go out, go out)
I wanna go out-out (Out-out)
Mmm-yeah, I don't wanna go out (Go out)
I wanna go out-out

Working by myself, I haven't seen nobody else
Somebody help me
Living on my own, I never felt so alone
In an empty street
When the sky's so grey and cold
You don't even want to know about tomorrow
So get some chinese food to go
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
The night's still early

We're going out-out, please don't show me up
'Cause I've been down so long, ah-ah
Going out-out, we can't get enough
Yeah, we don't turn it off, ah-ah

Lately, I haven't been myself
These days I feel like someone else
Don't check the mirror (Don't check)
And my hair is so astray
Even my clothes are drab and grey
Tell me who is she
Oh, I've been making friends
Talk to anyone who'll lend me their ear (Lend the their ear)
And I'm so tired of the news
It's so constant and so cruel
Give me a movie star
You might also like
But when this is over
Meet me at our old spot
Dressing up to the nines and the tens and elevens
Turn up the music and I am in heaven

We're going out-out, please don't show me up
'Cause I've been down so long, ah-ah
Going out-out, we can't get enough
Yeah, we don't turn it off, ah-ah
Going out-out, don't keep me waiting
Out-out, under the lights
Out-out, anticipating
Out-out, wondering what it'll be like tonight

I don't wanna go out (Go out, go out)
I wanna go out-out (Out-out)
Mmm-yeah, I don't wanna go out (Go out)
I wanna go out-out
Out-out-out-out-out
Hey-hey, let's do it
Out-out-out-out-out, let's do it
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Dressing up to the nines and the tens and elevens
Turn up the music and I am in heaven

We're going out-out, please don't show me up
'Cause I've been down so long, ah-ah
Going out-out, we can't get enough
Yeah, we don't turn it off, ah-ah
Going out-out, don't keep me waiting
Out-out, under the lights
Out-out, anticipating
