Well I was driving lonely
No passenger to hold me
Ambition drove the appeal
Keeping up with the burning
Race the world as it's turning
Stay focused behind the wheel

I would say I'm okay
I would say yeah I'm fine
Wear my tears on the inside
But just when I believed
That I'd lost all my need
You crashed right into my life

And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
No brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
You might also like
Some people spend life yearning
On a never ending journey
They always seek never find
I couldn't keep improving
Traveling without moving
My heart was losing its drive

I would say it's okay
I would say yeah it's fine
Ignore what's missing inside
But just when I believed
There's nothing left to me
You crashed right into my life

And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
No brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
No brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes

Sometimes you don't know what's missing
Until it overtakes you
And it overtakes everything
And from that moment
You don't quite know how you ever got along without it

No brakes
No heart breaks
No heart breaks

I would say I'm okay
I would say yeah I'm fine
Wear my tears on the inside
But just when I believed
That I'd lost all my need
You crashed right into my life
And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes
No brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love over takes
Love over takes

And there's no brakes
Love over takes
Love over takes
No brakes
Love over takes
