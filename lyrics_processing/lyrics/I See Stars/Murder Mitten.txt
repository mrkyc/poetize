You won't see me die here

You always say I need to get as far away as I can
While I've got time to play with and any risk, I'll take it
Or fade away in this suburban wasteland
And watch all your plans sink right under your feet
Sink right under your feet

Watch all your plans sink right under your feet
Under your feet is the ground to break
You only get what you take
So don't just sit and watch the atrophy of it
I have stood back for way too long
You are broken
You are so broken

I can see that we may be running out of time
The curtain's falling in slow motion
I can feel that the sense has left your mind
The curtain's falling in slow motion
Why did you go? I can't watch
So quiet and peaceful, where did I go wrong?
Say you can stay, I can't look away
You won't see me die here, you won't see me die here

(Now, now) Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
(Now, now) Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
(Why, why?) Ask me, "Why?"
Go ahead and act like you don't know why
(Why, why?) Ask me, "Why?"
I'll scream it, you blow me away
You blow me away
You blow me away

Well, can you give me my breath back?
Can you give me my breath back? (You blow me away)
Can you give me my breath back?
Can you give me my breath back?

Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
(Do you hear me now?)
