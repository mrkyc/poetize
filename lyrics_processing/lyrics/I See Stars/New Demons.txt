I'm not your true love or your knight in shining armor
All of these games you play and all this bullshit drama
I'll be free to be me and find my path in life
You think I'll die alone? Well, I'm not alone tonight
Our love was a waste, this much is true
I pray I'd forget you

Yeah
Fuck you
You're no better than anyone
You want respect? You have to earn it
Your jealousy won't grow on me
Why are you so heartless?

Open up your eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be

Open up your eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be
'Cause I know you're worth it
These new demons are changing me inside
Changing me inside
You might also like
Knock me down to pick yourself back up
Because you hit the depths
In your heart you're still lost
And always sinking down
I bet you put yourself through hell
You did this to yourself
I can't believe I wished you well
I wished you well
Knock me down to pick yourself back up
Because you hit the depths
In your heart you're still lost
And always sinking down

Open up your eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be
'Cause I know you're worth it
These new demons are changing me inside
Changing me inside

These new demons, they're eating me alive
Pushing and pulling the heart out from inside
If I can't have you
Then nobody else can, no
Just the thought of you
Walking hand in hand with somebody else
Reinventing things we do
But they'll never match to the love thrown down the well
If I can't have you, then nobody else can
Then nobody else can
Nobody else can
Then nobody else can
