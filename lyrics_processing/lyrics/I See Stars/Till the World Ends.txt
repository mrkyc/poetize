This kitten got my tongue tied in knots, you see
Spit it out cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To room next level, baby
I knew I want this bad bitch
This is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
You might also like
Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing
I notice that you're staring
You know that I can take it
To room next level, baby
Harder than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing 'till the world ends
Keep on dancing 'till the world ends
Keep on dancing 'till the world ends

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh

Sniff, sniff, cry!
I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
Oh oh, you got some Epson Salt
I done balled all day you ain't touch the court
What, what you tired, you need a break
You was hot when? Ricki Lake! Yeah!

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing 'till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing 'till the world ends
