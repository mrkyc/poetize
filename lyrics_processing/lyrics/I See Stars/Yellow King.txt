I've had this dream before, it's just the ghost of the once was
A fool just like before, the same exact sad outcome
I've meant my enemy and it seems we tried to work it out
You're just the ghost of the once was

But the stars aren't far enough for you to grab them
Right out of the sky, there ain't no doubt about it
You ain't no child trying to drive a fast car, no
You ain't no friend of mine
Nobody seems to fear the truth more than me
It seems I have a darkness
But I can leave it all behind if you let me
Only if you let me, only if you let me

So lay it on me, so lay it on me
It seems you're so scared of taking chances, I'm not
So lay it on me, so lay it on
I feel the rain

Reoccuring dreams, pulling out my teeth
In a crowded white room
I try to run or yell, this is my hell
My legs won't move
You might also like
I've had this dream before, it's just the ghost of the once was
A fool just like before, the same exact sad outcome
I've had this dream before
You're just the ghost of the once was

But the stars aren't far enough for you to grab them
Right out of the sky, there ain't no doubt about it
You ain't no child trying to drive a fast car, no
You ain't no friend of mine
Nobody seems to fear the truth more than me
It seems I have a darkness
But I can leave it all behind if you let me
Only if you let me, only if you let me

All this time, I've been waiting to let you go
All this time, I've been waiting to let you go
All this time, I've been waiting to let you go
All this time, I've been waiting to let you go

So lay it on me, so lay it on me
It seems you're so scared of taking chances, I'm not
So lay it on me, so lay it on
