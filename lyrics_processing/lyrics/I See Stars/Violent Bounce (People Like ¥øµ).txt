People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are, so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
I see right through you

How many people do you plan to burn?
And all the damage left at every turn
You watched us struggle
And now you're parched with a thirst for attention
To fuel the fire of your self-obsession
We'll watch you crumble
You are the scum of the world
And we'll watch you fall

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are, so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
And we intend to let the world know the truth
Let the world know the truth

You sit there and smile, so smug in your skin
Second and third chances gone in the wind
I lied and I begged and I swore I would change
What do you expect of me?
Fuck (Fuck, fuck, fuck)
You'll never know true unity
You might also like
Look around you, look around you
Everyone is terrified
One wrong move, one wrong move
And their dream won't survive

You said, "You better keep your fucking mouth shut
I got a closed mind and no time to lose"
Bow to the stronger element
The truth will outweigh you
All it took was a spark, right?

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
I see right through you
People like you are
People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
Good so close

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
And we intend to let the world know the truth
Let the world know the truth
Watch your back when you're out on the town tonight
At every corner I lurk in the dark
Like the shadow on these very walls
Put the man on trial
I bet he turn colors that he's never shown
Put the man on trial
I bet he turns colors that he's never shown
Watch your back when you're out on the town tonight
At every corner I lurk in the dark
Like the shadow on these very walls
Put the man on trial
I bet he turn colors that he's never shown
Put the man on trial
