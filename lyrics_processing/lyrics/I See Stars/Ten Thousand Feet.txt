I swear this plane is going down

Brace yourself, this is not a drill
This is the way that I dream of going out
And in this moment, I see my life flash before my eyes
(Before my eyes)
And at best I'll be damned to the sea
Let the waves bury me

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thoughts of you begin
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thought of you begins, whoa
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thought of you begins
I wish there was a way to let you know
A way to let you know
I wish there was a way to let you know

I am the living dead
I see my fate and it's just my luck
I know you think the answer's upon us
I got news for you: We're so fucked
(I am the living dead) I am the living dead
(I am the living dead) We are the living dead

I'm writing you a letter, I hope it falls right down in your hands
At least you'll know exactly what I feel if all goes to plan
I see you know the better tear in every single bell of lies
No delusion of safety or senseless hope in disguise
Why can't you see, that I fear for the worst
This is what I gave, I'm on your side
Yeah

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thoughts of you begin
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thought of you begins, whoa

Brace yourself, this is not a drill
This is the way that I dream of going out
And in this moment, I see my life flash before my eyes
(Before my eyes)
And at best I'll be damned to the sea
Let the waves bury me

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster the thought of you begins
I wish there was a way to let you know
I wish there was a way to let you know
Ten thousand feet in the air
