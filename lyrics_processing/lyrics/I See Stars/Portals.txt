Say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
(Oh, Oh)

I'm just trying to breathe fire
The news took the wind right out of me
There's no relief in the silent
Ways we grieve

One reason for the pain you caused
Two words to mend the damage done
Three left in the chamber of your gun
Four seconds to run

You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
I can feel
Me centered and the world comes with it
I can feel
Centered and the world comes with it

I just want the world to know it's real
I just want the world to know it's real

It's the color they see, fire
Never knowing the face behind the name
It's always easy staying quiet
But red's the color we bleed

One reason for the pain you caused
Two words to mend the damage done
Three left in the chamber of your gun
Four seconds to run

You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
I can feel
Me centered and the world comes with it
I can feel
Centered and the world comes with it
(Pinch yourself, shed a tear
Remind yourself the world is real)
Pinch yourself
Shed a tear
Remind yourself the world is real
That the world is real
That the world is real (Woah)
It's always easy staying quiet
(Pinch yourself, shed a tear)
But red's the colour we bleed
(Remind yourself the world is real)
Pinch yourself
Shed a tear
Remind yourself the world is real
I just want the world to know it's real (Woah)
I just want the world to know it's real
So say you don't believe

You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
I can feel
Me centered and the world comes with it
I can feel
