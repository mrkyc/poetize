Hands on my face 'cause I'm all in
Double zeros I am all in
I'm just a kid come from nothing
I see your family got something
Dragging your feet like it's nothing
All cross the board, yeah I'm all in
All cross the states, yeah you fallin'
We takin' risks, yeah we all in

We disappeared from all the lights
There was nothing left, so we went right
Remember the days we were callin'
No word when we needed you all in
Mobbin' the house that we all in
We takin' risks, yeah we all in

You say the water's under bridges but you know the bridge is burning
The clock is ticking by the second, I know that time is turning
I see the people you fuck with they holdin' a knife to your back
Hands in the air cause they all in, we takin' risks yeah we all in

I can tell that everybody in this room is really scared
No one 'round me giving feelings like they really care
I know my people at home, yeah they be really there
I know my people at home

Breathing in, I'm having trouble trying to bite my tongue again
Breathing in, don't think that I can just bite my tongue again
Who are you at heart?
Who are you at all? We'll see

You say the water's under bridges but you know the bridge is burning

Double zeros, I am all in
All cross the board, yeah we all in
