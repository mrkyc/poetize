Just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all your time

So sick of playing this game of follow the leader
And it seems the world is held together
By the same strings that tug our hearts
And they twist and they pull and get tangled up
And it seems we're all so stuck in this
Normal way of living
You aren't taught to follow your dreams
American standard
The future's as bright as it seems

There's evil in this world
Even if you don't see it
You have to look a little closer, closer
You have to lend me your ears

And just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all my time
Obsessed and terrified
We're the ones who control our lives
You might also like
So sick of playing this game, fuck
So sick of playing this game

You want truth? I can't tell you what is real
On that shining box you call a life
I refuse, I resist to live this way
Solve or be solved, walk the walk
Follow the leader, follow your leader
I refuse, I resist to live this way
Will you find your own way?
Follow the leader, follow your leader
I refuse, I resist to live this way
Will you find your own way?

Just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all your time
Just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all your time

And just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all my time
Obsessed and terrified
We're the ones who control our lives
Just try to keep in mind
Life is too short to be wasting all my time
We're the ones who control our lives
