You can be mad at me, tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
Or you could just freak with me
Said it again, let the numbers roll
I hear that about you, baby (Hear that about you)
It's back when the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that (Don't ever look)
It's just in the daylight, no
It's just in the daylight, no

(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)
(I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)
You might also like
Why are you mad at me? Tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
You should just freak with me, freak with me
And let the numbers roll
I'm here by the fire, I'm waitin' (Hear that about you)
Back where the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that (Don't ever look)
It's just in the days I've known
It's just in the days I've known

(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Yo, new black king, New York dream
Tell these motherfuckers everything I'm seeing
My world's darker than the young black dream
Of the first black prince of a new white king (Oh, oh)
I just wanna play, have it my way
Make a bunch of fucking rules, then tell 'em obey (Ooh)
They can't fuck with me, yeah, yeah, Ojay (Yeah)
First name, government? No, him, I slay (Slay)
New black king, oh
New black king, yeah
New black king, oh
Uh, obey, obey, obey

(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)
(Mirror)
I'm a broken screen
(I am a mirror)
And I'm over it
