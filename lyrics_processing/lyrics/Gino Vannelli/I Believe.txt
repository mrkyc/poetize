Keep hanging on to where I belong
(cause) I believe the world is one
Behind this masquerade
(just) Reach out of the darkness
And bring in the light of day
Here I am a man with a old fascination
(just an old fascination)
Still holding the line of my time
'Cause I believe the day will come
When things will work out right
(just) Reach out to your brothers
And save every mother and child
Well I want you to know
I believe that a love can find a way
And I believe that a heart of stone can break
I believe that a wise man hears the call
And the writing's on the wall
And it's shining so bright and clear
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I believe what's done is done
And what will be will be
(just) Reach out to each other
A moment is all you need
