The table's set, baby
Wooo, ahh
Here we go
My oven is hot
Come on
Get some in Martika's kitchen, baby
You bring the noise
And I'll bring the smile
It's been so long
Since you've been down in the kitchen, baby
My desire's running longer than a country mile
So true
You can make all my wishes
So real
You can make all my dreams
And if you're good, baby
I'll even let you break the dishes
Come on
Get some, get some, get some
In Martika's kitchen, baby
Ooh
We're talking about the kitchen
