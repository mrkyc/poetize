When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
When all seems lost, you've got to try
To never let your spirit die
An angel came to greet me
It happened in a dream
He spoke of my reality
Not being what it seems
Within us lives a new world
This world, he calmly said
Will only be when evil and
All its sorrows are truly dead, whoa
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Never let your spirit die)
You cannot accept deception
And real love will never lie
We must try to be the chosen few
And keep that love alive
(Keep that love alive)
You might also likeYeah, we will never be unfulfilled, no
And your deck will be full of aces
'Cause, whenever the spirit wills
You can go to higher places (oh-oh)
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
(Spirit)
(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
(Spirit)
(Rap)
You got to view this world
Through kaleidoscopic eyes
You got to see every color
If you want to see the reasons why
An angel came to greet me
It happened in a dream
He spoke of my reality
Not being what it seems
Within us lives the new world
This world, he calmly said
Will only be when evil and
All it's sorrows are truly dead
Spirit, spirit, spirit, spirit, yeah!
When the time is running out
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
To never let your spirit die
Never, never, never, never
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Spirit)
