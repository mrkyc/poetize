Ow!
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
You know, I've been thinking

What if I was your lover?
Could I make you shiver every time you look at me?
Does your heart beat like thunder?
Just like mine (Just like mine), do you feel the energy?

My fantasy is you and me
Locked inside a lovers' groove
So don't be shy
No other guy can get to me (Can get to me)
The way you do

So touch me (Touch me), see if I care
Hold me (Hold me), see if I care for you
Kiss me (Kiss me), see if I care
'Cause I betcha I do (I betcha I do)
Care about you (Care about you)

Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh, see if I care
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
You might also like
And if we were together (And if we were together)
Would you put your arms around me, hold me oh so tight?
Would you love me forever?
Come on, boy (Come on, boy)
Only you can make it right

You're so cool, you won't break the rules
But you don't have to keep your hands to yourself
'Cause love is blind, but if you read my mind
Then you would know (Then you would know)
The way I've always felt

So touch me (Touch me), see if I care
Hold me (Hold me), see if I care for you
Kiss me (Kiss me), see if I care
'Cause I betcha I do (I betcha I do)
Care about you (Care about you)

Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh, see if I care
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh

Don't you know what you do to me? (What you do to me)
You're every girl's fantasy (Fantasy-y-y)
Move a little bit closer now
Do I have to show you how?
Touch me, hold me, kiss me
You're driving me crazy, ow!
See if I care, huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
Oh, touch me (Touch me), see if I care
Hold me (Hold me), see if I care for you
Kiss me (Kiss me), see if I care
'Cause I betcha I do (I betcha I do)
Care about you (Care about you)
Touch me (Touch me), see if I care
(Come a little bit closer now)
Hold me (Hold me), see if I care for you (Oh)
Kiss me (Kiss me), see if I care
'Cause I betcha I do (I betcha I do)
Care about you (Care about you)
Touch me (Touch me), see if I care
(Do I have to show you how?)
Hold me (Hold me), see if I care for you
(I care for you)
Kiss me (Kiss me), see if I care
'Cause I betcha I do (I betcha I do)
Care about you (Care about you)
Touch me (Touch me), see if I care
(Come a little bit closer now)
