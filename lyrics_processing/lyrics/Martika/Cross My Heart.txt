Oh (Oh, oh)

Hypnotized
With just one look at you, I'm paralyzed
Can't explain
Why just one touch from you drives me insane

You've got me head over heels
Better believe it, baby
And I love how it feels

Cross my heart, hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart, I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true

Believe me when I say
Oh (Oh, oh)

Heavenly (Ah-ah)
Something happens when you're next to me
I get chills (Ah-ah)
You can ask me anything and babe, I will
You might also like
You've got me out of control
Better believe it, baby
From my head to my toes

Cross my heart, hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart, I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true

You're my valentine every month of the year
Baby, rain or shine, I'm so happy when you're here
I want you all the time, am I making myself clear?
My love's gonna last forever
Cross my heart

Cross my heart
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart (Cross my heart), hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie (If I'm telling a lie)
Cross my heart, I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Cross my heart, hope to die (Hope to die)
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie (Ah-ah, if I'm telling a lie)
Cross my heart, I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart (Cross my heart), hope to die (Hope to die)
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie (If I'm, if I'm telling a lie)
Cross my heart, I swear it's true
