Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Hey!

If there's a fire in my eyes
It should come as no surprise to you, ah-ah
If I've shown you once or twice how I feel
It's because it's the truth
You know that it's true

Wanted to tell you so many times
How I feel when you're with me, ah
Now that I've found you
I know that you are my destiny

I-I-I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't wanna blow it (Blow it)
I love you more than you know
Aha, aha
You might also like
You know you've got me hypnotized
But that's something I should hide from you, ah-ah
If I feel so mesmerized
It's because of the things that you do
The things that you do

I only wish I could read your mind
So I'd know just how you feel, ah (Just how you feel)
Send me a signal
Tell me your feelings are just as real (Just as real)

I-I-I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't wanna blow it (Blow it)
I love you more than you know

I don't mean to put you under pressure
But it's something that I can't control (I can't control)
And though I'd give you the world if I could
I'm afraid to let you know
'Cause I don't wanna lose your love
(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
Wanted to tell you so many times
How I feel when you're with me, ah (When you're with me)
Now that I've found you
I know that you are my destiny (Destiny)

I-I-I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't wanna blow it, no, no
I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't wanna blow it (Blow it)
I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't wanna blow it (Blow it)
I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go, oh
I'm afraid to show it
