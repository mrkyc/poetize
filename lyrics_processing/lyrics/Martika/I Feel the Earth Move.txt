I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around

Oh baby oh baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth earth move move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down tumblin' down

Whenever you're around

Oh darlin' oh darlin', when I'm near you
And you tenderly call my name

Are something I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
