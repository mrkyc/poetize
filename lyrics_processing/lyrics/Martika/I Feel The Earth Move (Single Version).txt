I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Oh baby (oh baby), when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down (tumblin' down)
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Oh darlin' (oh darlin'), when I'm near you
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are something I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh, uh uh uh, yeah yeah
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down (tumblin' down)
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Oh! Yeah!
Oh baby (oh baby), when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Woah darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way
I've just got to have you, baby
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh, uh uh uh, yeah yeah
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down
I just-a lose control
Down to my very soul
Yeah, I get a hot and cold
All over, all over, all over, all over
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, uh tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, uh tumblin' down
Uh tumblin' down, down, down, down, down, down
Earth move, bud-a bud-a bum bum, bud-a bum bum
Earth move, earth move, earth move, earth move
I, yeah!
I feel it rock (rock)
I feel it roll (roll)
I feel it shake (shake)
Bud-a bud-a bum bum, bud-a bum bum
Tumblin' down, down, down, down, down
