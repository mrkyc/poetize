(Bounce back)
Ha-ha! Ooh yeah

Everybody has heard the word "goodbye"
So what's the matter? You're not the first to cry

You just need a love that's strong
Need someone who can hold on
Better face your feelings, never hide your heart
It's time to make another start

Bounce back into love, once is not enough
Bounce back, be tough when the going's getting rough
Bounce back into love, don't be giving up
Bounce back 'cause it feels so good
You better bounce back, bounce back
(Bounce back)

Life's a jungle at night, hearts are on the loose
Face to face, eye to eye, who will make the first move?
You might also like
Once you've felt that magic touch
You can never get too much
Get back on your feet 'cause this is not the end
If you wanna feel that way again

Bounce back into love, once is not enough
Bounce back, be tough when the going's getting rough
Bounce back into love, don't be giving up
Bounce back 'cause it feels so good
You better bounce back, bounce back


Get back on your feet 'cause this is not the end
If you wanna feel that way again

Bounce back into love, once is not enough
Bounce back, be tough when the going's getting rough
Bounce back into love, don't be giving up
Bounce back 'cause it feels so good
You better bounce back
Bounce back into love, once is not enough
Bounce back, be tough when the going's getting rough
Bounce back into love, don't be giving up
Bounce back 'cause it feels so good (bounce back)

Ooh, bounce back (bounce back)
Oh, you better bounce back, baby (bounce back)
Into love, don't be giving up (bounce back)
Get tough, get rough (bounce back)
