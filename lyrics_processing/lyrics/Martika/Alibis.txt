This has got to stop
I am not gonna put up with this any more
So tell me, what's your excuse this time?
No, never mind, I don't wanna hear it

So many times, you pushed me aside
I'm getting sick and tired of your alibis
All alone, sleepless nights
Trying to pretend our love would be alright

I could've changed my mind
If you cared enough to just apologize
But now it's much too late
Your license to my heart has met its expiration date

Alibis, tell me no lies (tell me no lies)
I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
Alibis, don't act surprised (don't act surprised)
When I walk away from you and all your alibis

You gave to me a little teddy bear
To keep me company the nights you were not there
Wanting to say (say)
"Baby, please stay" (please stay)
Now I don't wanna deal with all the games you play
You might also like
I gave you all I had
But now I know that loving me was just a fad
There's nothing more to take
If love is just a test then you're my big mistake

Alibis, tell me no lies (tell me no lies)
I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
Alibis, don't act surprised (don't act surprised)
When I walk away from you and all your alibis

I gave you all I had
But now I know that loving me was just a fad
There's nothing more to take (oh, there's nothing more to take)
If love is just a test then you're my big mistake

Alibis, tell me no lies (tell me no lies)
I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
Alibis, don't act surprised (don't act surprised)
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from you

Alibis, tell me no lies (tell me no lies)
I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
Alibis, don't act surprised (don't act surprised)
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from you
(When I walk away from you, oh) Alibis, tell me no lies
(No, no, alibis) I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
(No alibis, no alibis, no alibis, no alibis, oh-oh)
Alibis, don't act surprised (don't act surprised, oh-oh)
When I walk away from you and all your alibis
Alibis, tell me no lies (tell me no lies)
