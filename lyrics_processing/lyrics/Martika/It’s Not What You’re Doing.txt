Why do you touch me then turn away?
Is there something you're afraid to feel?
Boy, if you want me, it's getting late
Come and show me if your love is real

'Cause I heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another friend
About the good things you do for me
I don't believe it 'cause I've never seen it
Now's the right time, prove it to me

I don't know what you've been told
But love has gotta come from the heart
You better shape up

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby

You've got emotions like everyone else
But you've gotta learn to let 'em show
I can't be in love all by myself
It takes two to make love grow
You might also like
Make your move, I'm waiting for you
Actions speak louder than words
Woah-woah-woah

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
Come on, baby, show me your love is real
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
Woah-woah-woah, oh-oh
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
Come on

Candlelight and a dance or two
That's all I need from you tonight
Softly whispering I love you
Can only make me feel so ri-i-ight

Make your move, I'm waiting for you
Actions speak louder than words
Yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
Show me, show me
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
Come on, I know you can do it
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
I know that you can do it
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
Come on, baby, prove it to me
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby (Show me real love)
Prove it to me

It's not what you're doin', oh (Show me real love)
Show me there
It's not what you're doin', oh (Show me real love)
Show me real love
