Tonight (Tonight), I'll believe every word that you say
I'm (I'm) trusting the roll of the dice
The chance (The chance) to win everything takes a sacrifice

And I want you now, I want you so bad
Tell me what to do

If you're Mister Right, I'm your claim to fame
If you're Tarzan (Tarzan), I'm Jane
I'm Jane, I'm Jane (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)

I'm (I'm) wrapped in emotional fire
You (You) are the answer to every desire
I (I), I wanna swing on your vine
Tonight (Tonight), I've got a primitive appetite

And I want you now, I need you so bad
Tell me what to do
