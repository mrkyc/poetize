The, red, blue, yellow, green
Black and white, all the colors unite
Red, the fire that burns my heart
When you're near, it wraps me up
Now, I find the space to feel blue
Like the water it fills me with peace
When you leave me again
I still breathe within
Knowing you're at my side
Your soul in mine
But I long for your touch
It's hurting so much
You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
'Cause all I want is more and more
Colored kisses from you
Colored kisses
You might also likeYellow is the sun that shines on me
Like your smile it sets me free
Seasons change to blacken my mood
When I falter my heart goes astray
I remember the nights when you'd take me away
Because when I'm at your arms
I'm safe and warm
But I'm never alone
Because my heart is your home
You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder, I pray
That no one can take me from you
And no one can break us in two
So lift me up in the clouds, set me free
And let your rainbow of love shine on me
Colored kisses
Colored kisses, that's right
Come back, come back, come back
You, you give me
Colored, colored kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
