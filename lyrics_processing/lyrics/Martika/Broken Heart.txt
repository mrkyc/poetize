I didn't know where to turn, I was so in doubt
I had to find someone to hold, and I met my man
I loved him but I hated him too, his habit's so out of hand
I said, hey, can't you see what you're doing to me?
I gave you my heart, but you can set me free
Because I'm not in the mood to be apologized to
There's more to this life than your drugs and your booze
He said, please don't cry
Wipe those tears from your eyes
I will survive
I will see you through
He promised me he'd change
And then one day, a baby came
For the past nine months or so, I ain't feeling so sweet
They told me I had to behave myself, so I'd be healthy
I thought I did everything right, now everything's gone wrong
Our baby's got a broken heart, he ain't feeling so strong
My God, what did I do to deserve this from you
I don't think I've ever been so confused
I still feel the pain, even after the bruise
What should I do, tell me what should I do
You might also likeHe said, mama, don't cry
Wipe those tears from your eyes
I will survive
I will see my life through
Please understand
It was not in your hands
You do the best that you can
And I know your love is true
I'm not surprised that I feel so old
Sometimes existence can be so cold
I'll find the strength just to carry on
Am I destined to pay for my every mistake?
Will somebody tell me for how long?
Please understand
It was not in your hands
You do the best that you can
And I know your love is true
Please, don't cry
Wipe those tears from your eyes
I will survive
