Like water, you see into me
You reach into me and I ripple 'round in circles
Reflections of my dreams in yours
Bring me to the shores of desire

I have been like a desert creature
Wandering on this earth so cracked and dry
(How did you survive?)
But now your love is bringing me alive

Like water, how could I do without you?
My body heat will not cool down
Like water, I could not live without you
I want to dive so deep into you I might drown

Tu eres como el agua

You know me, an invisible line connects us in time
And now there is no distance between us
You see what I feel and all I am feeling is you
You might also like
Like water, how could I do without you?
My body heat will not cool down
Like water, I could not live without you
I want to dive so deep into you I might drown

Tu eres como el agua (Oh, ey-oh, ey-oh)
No se que haria sin ti mi amor (Na-na-na-na-na)
Yo no pudiera vivir sin ti (Oh, ey-oh, ey-oh)
(Na-na-na-na-na)
Quiero ahogarme en ti y nunca regresar


Como el agua me ves tan clara
Siempre puedes tu llegar a mi
(Me siento tan feliz)
Tu amor me da razon para vivir

Like water, how could I do without you?
My body heat will not cool down
Like water, I could not live without you
I want to dive so deep into you, I might drown
Like water (Ey-oh), like water (Ey-oh)
Like water, na-na-na-na-na
Like water (Oh, ey-oh), like water (Ey-oh)
Dive so deep into you I might drown
(Oh, ey-oh) Ey-oh, (Ey-oh) Ey-oh
Na-na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Oh, ey-oh) Ey-oh, (Ey-oh) Ey-oh
Na-na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na-na)
Like water, like water
(Woah, oh)
(Woah, oh)
(Woah, oh)
