Come over here
Right now, yeah

Just you and me
The image of the way it's gonna be
Close by my side
Livin' in the luxury of paradise

Did you ever want something so bad you'd risk it all
No matter what the the consequences are?
You've lost control of something deep inside your soul
And now it's gone a little bit too far

Temptation (temptation)
Tappin' on the back of my neck (ooh)
Up and down my spine, workin' on my mind
I haven't got rid of it yet
Temptation (temptation)
Every day it's holding me back (ooh)
Scratchin' on my brain, drivin' me insane
I can't seem to get on track
You might also like
I know (I know) you've got (you've got)
Ooh, someone in your life, but I can't stop
Oh, we've tried (we've tried) to be just friends
But you feel it just like I do, so don't pretend

'Cause you know you want it so bad that you'd risk it all
No matter what the consequences are
You've lost control of something deep inside your soul
And now it's gone a little bit too far

Temptation (temptation)
Tappin' on the back of my neck (ooh)
Up and down my spine, workin' on my mind
I haven't got rid of it yet
Temptation (temptation)
Every day it's holding me back (ooh)
Scratchin' on my brain, drivin' me insane
I can't seem to get on track

Afraid you've lost a part of yourself (of yourself)
All your thoughts go to someone else (someone else)
Bit by bit 'till there's nothing inside (nothing inside)
Temptation is the question, but you can't decide
(Question, but you can't decide)
'Cause you know you want it so bad that you'd risk it all
No matter what the consequences are
You've lost control of something deep inside your soul
And now it's gone a little bit too far

Temptation (temptation)
Tappin' on the back of my neck (ooh)
Up and down my spine, workin' on my mind
I haven't got rid of it yet
Temptation (temptation)
Every day it's holding me back (ooh)
Scratchin' on my brain, drivin' me insane
I can't seem to get on track
Temptation (temptation)
Tappin' on the back of my neck (ooh)
Up and down my spine, workin' on my mind
I haven't got rid of it yet
Temptation (temptation)
Every day it's holding me back (ooh)
Scratchin' on my brain, drivin' me insane
I can't seem to get on track

You can't control this feelin' that you're feelin'
And everyday life seems less than real
And your body and mind don't connect to your soul
You try everything, but there's no place to go
Admit to yourself that you have an addiction
The love in your life has caused you affliction
The deeper you go, the harder you search
But before it gets better it's gonna get worse, kick it in!
Temptation that you can't live without
Givin' you something to think about
Temptation that you can't live without
Givin' you something to think about
Temptation that you can't live without
