When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
When all seems lost, you've got to try
To never let your spirit die
An angel came to greet me
It happened in a dream
He spoke of my reality
Not being what it seems
Within us lives a new world
This world, he calmly said
Will only be when evil and
All its sorrows are truly dead, whoa
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Never let your spirit die)
You cannot accept deception
And real love will never lie
We must try to be the chosen few
And keep that love alive
(Keep that love alive)

You can go to higher places (oh-oh)
