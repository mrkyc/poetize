I'm a plunging horror, lunatic who would jump the border
Just to take a dump toward a fucking trump supporter
And I stay blunt, like I'm a weeded aura
And I don't mean inner peace, I meant I need a Rita Ora on weed
I'll boggle your mind gravelled, wanna know why I'm throttled
To leave your mind dazzled, blind rage piercing eye goggles?
I'd date a fine model if I was capable of insulting her
Not even taking it back if I time travelled
Ain't nobody growing up, seeming time's stuck
Like a black hole appearin' cause your fuckin' rhymes suck
Your crappy raps would be better if you shut it and mimed up
Like a dick stuck in your ear, buddy I'm a mind fuck
Ain't no stopping nothing when I'm copping trophies
Only stop I'm doing is when I'm fossil cozy and my coffin closes
All these rappers that claim they shot are phoney
You hungry for blood? I prepared
Bullets for meals cause I'm serving ya glockamoli
You clown's are shit, suck my brown dick
Go catch a cold on a track, cause it's the only way you'll sound sick
Break all your teeth in, it's the only way you crown king
You don't wanna square up, I'm no one to fuck a-round with
I'm instigating a riot, and I'll be staying so bias
These rappers needa shhh, so I'm mixtaping em quiet
Someone's gotta take the throne I guess cause Jason's retired
That's when mayham comes in with lighters and he blazes the fire
I'm the personality not even madonna induces
Mayham for president, cause fuckin' donald is useless
Listening to rap today, you can't be callin' it music
Now I'm a sober dope that'll smoke all of you losers
Stick a knife in ya gut till it reaches ya spinal cord
Pick a fight with a slut and tell her that she's the kind of whore
I'd like to dance with her panties down on my asylum floor
And I'm an animal, the fuck you think they call me psycho for
They call me ham, cause I'm a pig on the track
So you chickens won't be beefin' with the this and the that
And my words will pierce your skin, like a stick, like attack!
Bitches it's flu season, so get back I'm sick on the track
And if I'm a snake, then all you homos are vermin
I'll have an atheist praying to god that I don't hurt him
Allergic to certain garbage so these wastes shouldn't breathe
If you front with your back up, then beware when I sneeze
You might also like
I need to chill out, before my feelings spill out
Like when I out kill to show you who's real now
I'm not a real rapper, I just got an ill mouth
A real Outlaw, living life like I'm still wild
I spit anger, bitch strangler
Throw you down a mountain with a rope around like
Cliffhangers
Hoe you sound like a bitch stammering anxious
And you can't anticipate a manic's language
And I spit satanic shit to confuse you with
And Mayham produces it like he's used to it
The only approval which I'm cool with is his
I'm cruel with this shit like Abdul's neurosis is
The truth of it is, my rhymes in the vault
Got 'em climbing the walls like the roof of this bitch
Exciting them all like the lines that I've drawn;
Bruise your face and replace the ice with the salt!

Sick as fuck and I'm in the cut
Last a new year, hope I'm not out of luck
Hateful ass niggas out here ruining livelihoods
Shit making me wonder if there's any good left
Then I realize, I am so blessed
Young nigga with the tools to impact society
Change lives, and make some moves
Therefore I do not feel like I got nothing to lose
Maybe I got some shit to prove to the competition
Call me Bobby Brown cause this a new edition
New rendition of this rap game
Starve myself cause I'm hungry for this rap fame
Being at the top's probably full of fakes but
Make no mistake, I just do it to prove it
You know the coolest, doing it for sport
Like I'm hunting in this bitch
Do it with no assist, be revered like an MVP
Just so all of these niggas can't envy me
This is the illest verse in all of 2017
