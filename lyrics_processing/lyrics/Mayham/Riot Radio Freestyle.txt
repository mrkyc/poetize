Who's as dedicated, do your say with Mayham
Cruelest ever spraying no inkling that's as crazy
Music makes me crazy, music is my therapy
You could say I'm aching, thinking's overrated
Humans hating humans, doing what they're doing
What's the point of being human, what the hell they spewing
Not even these motherfuckers know what the fuck these motherfuckers be doing
"this guy's doing better, this guy's thoughts are better
She's a freakin' poet, she's a doctor"
Never seen a breathing artist that ain't freakin' severed
It's just for the money, passion ain't a letter
Motherfuckers just love name drops, cause
Everybody's freakin' judge game strong
Everybody be tellin' you what to do
But nobody even knows what they want
She said "you're a touch overrated, a lush and I hate it"
It must've been fate but I just couldn't take it
It just ain't the same way, fuck it I'm crazy"
It's what relationships be stuck in, cause lately
They say they're one of a kind but got two faces
Three sides to a story, they don't forfeit with
Fifth time they lying, damn right I'm sick of it
Deeper with words, I think I'm becoming
A desperado. desperado. desperado

I hide nothing from you I'll be speaking it all
Mouth open in shock is how I'm leaving your jaw
'cause once you see me rap, then you know you're leaving in awe
'cause I'm a fighter to the last bone, I'm Ian McCall
And I'm a creature to stop that's hidden deep in the fog
When I murder the lyrics, we're never equal at all
Don't teach peace to my thoughts, the only piece that I got
Is the one putting five shots while you leak from the spot
All the details of the crime scene I'm tweeting it raw
Police be seeing the evidence, I leave 'em appalled
So many pieces to the puzzle, good luck piecing it, dawg
Your boyfriend's all talk 'til he gets beat in a brawl
He tried to fight me with his hands and now he's in a sprawl
Angry cause I called him weak and said his penis is small
It's all 'cause of me, see that he wasn't even at fault
I hate seeing so many chickens beefing with dawgs
Man there's so many rappers, rap's starting to reek
I scare and target the weak, here they are on the beats
All these verses of who's hard, ain't smart when you speak
And you claim to eat pussy, well you are what you eat
Awful isn't it? I'ma bomb you with this phenomenal stuff
*censor* I'm a bomb that's ticking, I'm an ominous kid that outshines competition
And I'm back to stop this shit and stomp your shit in
I'm the best rebel for the job, like an awkward version of Steve Jobs
And I'll slice the neck of all you virgins
When the beat stops, the mic is wrecked, y'all can't fight the best
Not popular, still fucks your mom and your wife is next
:
Oh, sick transitioning, Ham's killing the syllables
You mans listening?
I flip the script, so the director dies
If you're fly, then I'm pesticides
Ain't nobody being rejuvenate when Ham's jabbing
It's going down like Satan if he had his pants sagging
The villain of the story, homie, I'm the antagonist
Nothing's close to my orbit, not even this damn planet
If you're on a roll, better hop on this bandwagon
Scorching tracks with hot lyrics, fly like a damn dragon
Even your showcase is gonna get Rob'd
Van Dammit
Effin' your mind up like a handful of bad aspirins
:
What do you do to the person that's clowning you
Or all the people that they say they down with you
What's the solution I'm resounding to?
The sound of you drowning and then I'm pounding you
And he ain't stopping with he severs a stage
Next to wine; getting better with age
Once I'm done with beats, homie
Best believe that they're never the same
I'm forever so clever, you better? let's settle it
Murder the flow with you fuckers as evidence
Fuck it I'm credited, you fuckers ain't evident
