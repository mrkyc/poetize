Pacing and pacing and pacing
Trying to figure out how you got jaded
It's been 6 months and my love still hasn't faded
Your image is lurking my mind and girl I hate it
I'm still wondering why you've been acting shady
You made it a bigger issue than what was initially created
It's too much and now my heart can't take it
I hope you have fun with that new guy you hang with

But at the end of the day I know I'd put you right through the same shit
This whole situation is ape shit
I'm pissed and so freakin complacent
I'd set fire to this whole place, chick now
Like 9/10th of my time's been shit-faced
But you're a headache I'd get a place with
The same medication I shake with
Cause if I get an inkling of tryna replace you
I'm thinkin I'd get no replacement

If only you could see things from my perspective
You would understand (x2)
Baby girl, it's just my reflections
I hope you understand (x2)
You might also like
I've been callin' and callin' and callin'
And I still can't hear a voice
Maybe your sound was just blocked out
By all of the noise
You left when you felt you had the choice
Was it me or was it you?
:
I don't know, maybe the clock ran out and

We lost our youth
You're the light of my day, and the darkness too
You're the sun of my life, I'd foster you (get it)
No feelin as soft as you
They say love is blind and you blocked the view
I see nothin else, you're the one for me
I hurt you but comfort you to some degree
As in the lengths I'd go, I'd get some degrees
I'm hot for you, I got the same love for me, but

I reflect on my sins
I run from my thoughts
I've come to repent
But somewhat forgot
Cause the trouble I'm in
All I've done is just squat
But I've come to forgive
All the ones that I've fought
Maybe it was too much of a roller coaster
And you couldn't enjoy the ride
I kept asking you questions, but...
All I ever heard were the lies
A part of me died
The final time, I looked in your eyes
And I can tell that your love for us didn't survive
 x2
If only you could see things from my perspective
You would understand (x2)
Baby girl, it's just my reflections
I hope you understand (x2)
