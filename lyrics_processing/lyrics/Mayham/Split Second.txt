My name is outlaw, and I'm stomping your pride
Making you anxious so you fucking don't write
Made you memorize this day for life, you apes
Summarized in ways: "you grew your size of brain"
Its size and shape - when you exercise with weights
But I'm afraid that it's too late for you animals
And mammal brain glands and with a twist of fate
I graduate rap and contacted mayham
:
You've got rights, the right to remain silent
They call me mayham, faggot; I fight to remain violent
So don't bother therapists, homie I strike away guidance
They say I'm going in, yeah - inside insane asylums
I'm riled up with violence, and fight you with strikes
I bite like I'm tyson, I take lines from my simons
So simon says violence ain't nice just stand against it
While I attempt to flex my biceps to slice your neck, bitch
 (x2)
(In a split second!)
You better run for the hills
(In a split second!)
Cause I'm comin' to kill
(In a split second!)
Prepare to die, cause
(cause in a split second!)
There'll be nowhere to hide
You might also like
I either spit philosophy or biology
They probably shocked in awe as they're watching me
Not only does it not bother me; but I'm glad
Cause I'd rather not show modesty out my ass!
And so just like that, I shift in the moment
And shit on my opponents, the more foes I have;
The more my proponents, neither short of a laugh
Nor of a gram of weed, I even have the seeds
Either that or I'll be high on crack and speed
When I spit with the accuracy of a damn machine
I'd rather be that than a damn pussy, those damn bullies
Have pushed me to a new strategy!
So it has to be this way, you may pray
But I'm throwing haymakers like the good ol' days
And I may break my fucking face in the process
But at least I'll kick your ass - that's progress!


Roses are red, I'm a little crazy
Wouldn't write you a poem if I was pushing up daisies
I'll sleep on a fuckin rock just to cushion my hatred
And you pussies ain't shit, you're a tush in the matrix
If these rappers are dope, homie your kush is just tasteless
Your girlfriend set precedents, cause that bush is so famous
I'm the hook of this apex, the book you mistook for some basics
Now it's leaving you ridiculed cause you ain't look at the pages
Man I pick at my haters, and I give you the dopest
I'm the mix of a potion that's a feel of sniffin some coke
Like a fix up of a spliff when you lit up and smoke it
And I ain't stopping even if I get as big as my nose is
I make you cranky, don't I? you pansy low-lifes
You couldn't make it rain if you were dancing for it!
I did study a greek psycho a bit like stanley porter
Til her fuckin' menstrual cycle ran me over


In a split-split
In a split-split
In a split-split-split
