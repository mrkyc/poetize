Can anybody save me yet
I put my hours in this and it's getting scary here
Maybe it's for me to show you this
If any one feels the loneliness
Take my hand if you're alone and we can be over this

Tell me I'm not fake with this, tell me Mayham ain't in this
Tell me my patience, my passion ain't about to go to waste with this
Tell me the fire started in my heart ain't get extinguished yet
Maybe I could make it then, cause I'm no longer afraid of it
Cause I intended for a different hunting, I pictured that I was inches from it
So many sins committed, my brain's exhausted from thinking of it
So many psychiatrists seen that my head seems to be shrinking from it
Pen represents my emotions, you really don't wanna see an inkling of em
Moulded in ways that I torture for days
And I spoke in a way you want more of my name
Cause I go and take rap in a whole different way
And I spit fire, make my flow into flames
So I put my life into it, hoping to make it
Til they produce me and know what my name is
They're looking for talent and showing you fakers
They go and complain when you show 'em your reign
Spoiling your veins with the flowing of hatred
I'm pointing it out cause you're going insane
To a point that there's barely a point in escaping
You're crazy enough to be going again
The pain of the past is making it back
It would never let you get away with the fact
You been through the struggle, the hurt and the misery
You're still standing, it ain't that bad

Can anybody save me yet
I put my hours in this and it's getting scary here
Maybe it's for me to show you this
If any one feels the loneliness
Take my hand if you're alone and we can be over this

Maybe it's cause we're different. we're ignorant
We're the effect of rage, I expect it too, tell me that I ain't shit to you
But you got respect for me. and there's no regret with me
Then go ahead and you confess your hate, cause everything in life's subject to change
Maybe later we'll cross roads and, you'll be stopped hoping
I could be taking you back again, like when we talked before then
Girl you better stop hoping, cause you left me shambled
Heart broken, and you expect me to sit here and welcome you back with my arms open?
And don't think this song's about you, cause the world ain't revolve around you
But this verse is cause I was wrong about you, and all of my freakin' thoughts about you
My heart raced every time you touched me, and whenever you were dying to hug me
I always thought that you were fly. now the thought of you surprisingly bugs me
So how do you think it feels when the Bonnie to your Clyde leaves
And every single time it felt like she wanted to fight me
Don't get me wrong, I'm over her, she's awful but yes
I talk obsessed, I'm topped with stress, but I want to get this shit off of my chest
Can anybody save me yet
I put my hours in this and it's getting scary here
Maybe it's for me to show you this
If any one feels the loneliness
Take my hand if you're alone and we can be over this

I found a start, hear the pound of my heart
It's a thumping sound it jumps around, cause I'm down to earth from the ground and up
Told myself I was bound to spark, I won't allow a stop
Cause I reach my goal with every word, every verb, every letter, every noun I drop
All of a sudden adrenaline's rushing, becoming unstoppable's probably nothing
All of these obstacles, bound to be crushed, and all of these bars that I'm dropping are buzzing
But they're falling and seem to be stalling potential, so I'm calling for help
Cause I need motivation to show my patience to mow this place and roll the stages

Can anybody save me yet
I put my hours in this and it's getting scary here
Maybe it's for me to show you this
If any one feels the loneliness
