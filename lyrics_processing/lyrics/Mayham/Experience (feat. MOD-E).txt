I've been with a few girls, I never knew hoes
Maybe they were too cold, maybe they're rude, but who knows
I do go by my word, I do know how hurt feels
I've known how it feels to be the motherfucking third wheel
I do know rock bottom, and I know what it's like to have nothing
And if I say my life's perfect, know that I am bluffing
I do know pain of past loving to the point of mad suffering
And I do know what it's like to go to work and come back busing
And it's about time I lace up, and I know how to play tough
And if I ain't got a tough act then fuck it I'll fake one
Cause I know what it's like to be pulling the same stunt
Straight up I do take drugs, excuse the pun, I stay blunt
I think it's been a little while since I've felt alive
It's cause all of the other days, homie all I felt was high
I don't feel like trying, it feels like I've failed and died
Cause it feels like I failed to bail from jail this time
As you're laying in bed, you feel it play in your head
And every day is a mess replaying as you wake in stress
With this dull ass mood staying as gray as it gets
And you're taking a step but you're so afraid of the edge
Man she's doing things to you, she knew the ways that you could've hurt
Fucking right you said it several times that it would've worked
They say love is a one way street, well it took a turn
Thought you'd be with other girls but no one was as good as her
And you're too mindless to be, that's not the mindset of you
Cause this person, you're stuck to em, as if I would've knew
But what the hell do you do when you're too blinded and glued
She a gem that you would die for, guess it's a die-mond, you fool
You might also like
Every hint of your scent is an exposure to ambrosia
Every brush with your skin only yearns to be closer
Every view of you is a high, ecstasy to the eyes
I can't deny you've been running miles in my mind
Siphoning my sense to a space so sublime
You're a drug I'm an addict
You shift my paradigm
I take the doses but you commit the crime
A thief you stole my heart, and high jacked my brain
I was cruising along now I'm in the fast lane
Lately driven insane, just to hear my name
Namely from your lips, lips crack and they sound like whips
Life as I knew it is over, you've taken the reigns
I feel dead when I'm sober, your craving flowing through my veins
I'd do anything for you no matter the cost
'Cause it's a meaningless life without you I'm lost
Soon you locked another victim but there's only one supply
And I was too hooked I couldn't say ever goodbye
So I went crazy I went out of my mind
And lost myself in places I could never find
It's a tragic story I wish I could deny
But somewhere deep within me you still reside
So no matter how much time that ticks by
My heart still pumps blood with bits of you inside
But the truth is I never suspected you to be like
People are fake as fuck out there so I just smile and nod
As I began to trust you and this is what I got
Even though I'm getting burnt I'm holding tight to a melting pot
All my nerves are burnt out I wouldn't feel if I got shot
But I could die today and I think it would matter not
It would simplify your life, save you the burned of my love
My love was all I had but it was never enough
But as you put knives in my chest I held you closer
So silently you sink a stab straight into my spine
But there was nothing I could I say so I acted I was fine
So you kept on going, acted if I was blind
And my words were blindly labeled jealousy disguised
But you knew what you were doing there was never a surprise
I stayed loyal through it all yet what was my prize
A broken heart turned poet yet there was never compromise
