Words they're using make the chicks go crazy

Cause baby I can tell you're needing whatever those ways be

Girl you're the talk of the group, I wanna talk to you truthfully
But blowing my chance is something I'm not gonna do
I wanna be talking to you, I wanna call you tonight
Cause you're always in my mind, but I'm always in feuds
I got a problem with you, seems like it's math;
Me plus you, but this chemistry we have is a topic dispute
Cause she's so flawless and cute and even all of these dudes
Tryna get a spark with her, she'll be popping the fuse
Can't be facing that smile, pair of dangerous eyes
The fact that I'm crazy for her, always chasing these highs
Eyes making me do things, she's just taking my mind
Seems like she's the freakin' devil in an angel's disguise
Hoping, that you could see what a fella would do
Ok, not the type to cuff but I've been felon for you
And I could grab some coke, maybe I can sell it to you
But I got a crush, so how am I supposed to tell it to you
So can...

She's not an addict but she's still fuckin' smokin
I'm gulping a lot cause I'm still fuckin' choking
Now I muster up the courage, and I just have it
But what if she has a boyfriend, ah fuck damnit
I'm about to explode seeing she is the bomb
Maybe use a pick up line, cause that's a secretive thought
Cause right now, yo all I'm seeing's a goddess
She's out of this world, Houston, we have a problem
So I walk over to her and try introducing, I shrunk
Where the fuck is the arrow, aw my cupid is drunk
And my confidence blurs, when I start talking to her
Maybe use a pickup line, and do a comedy surf
I said "hi, excuse me, would you like to do me?
Argh shit, I mean let's go see a movie
I think you're pretty, so we should go and bang now"
"I'm sorry, what?" "uh I said we should go and hang out!"
(Fuck. GENTLEMEN!)
