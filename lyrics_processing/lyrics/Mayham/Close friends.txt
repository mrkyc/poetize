Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous

It's the same thing, another day
Same shit, nothing changed
Another way to sugarcoat cause it ain't
The way that our mother raised us
Ain't an excuse, we're troubling
Gotta double take to see the the present cause we ain't
In the present, nothing gifted about it
So I'm thinking about it and what a waste
Cause we hit it off like a spark, concussion grenade
Had your back, and whatever the angle
Do whatever it takes, going to whatever the lengths
But I'm on the edge and motherfucker I'm hanging by a thread
Had enough of this game, it's like you're a fuckin' puppet to anger
And the string is dangling, I got something to say
Cause saying nothing is saying something I ain't
I put one on the table, til there's no blood in my veins
And if you think you're leaving without as much of a trace
Cause it'll shove us astray, you think you're nothing to the world
But you're everything to me and the others
You're a brother, I hate that
Well...
You might also like
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous

At times I'm worn, every line you wrote
Every rhyme I quote excited on the mic you're dope
A dinosaur, kinda know it and you had my back
Cause if some type of whore crossed us you'd grab em by the throat
And I'm covert but it's attack of the boss
You had my back when my back's at the wall
I'm sad that it's falling, I'd catch it I'm all in
To put a patch on this qualm, of the fist that I'm balling
And if ever I'm small, no biggie, cause your ass is christopher wallace
But this is an apparition, a vision I had it's different than
Wishing I had a twin who switches to happy and switches right back I'm
Thinking I'll have redemption, to smack some sense right back into you
Like incentive, damnit I'm missing the badass sibling I've had and I'm prudent
Cause this dude is a classy dude that's a savage, a brute and a beautiful aspect
And assuming he's had shit in his life, I'm thinking it twice to protect this dude and his back
...man I just want this dude to be back... cause
Well, you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
