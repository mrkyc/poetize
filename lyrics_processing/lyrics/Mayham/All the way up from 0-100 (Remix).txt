I was born different, y'all know what the Lord gifted?
To me, rhymes, for instance, gore bitches with deformed scissors
Til they orange-ish
Be careful who you're dissing
YOLO? I don't flirt with death, bitches I blow kisses
I'd smack you with a tractors back tire, you wack liars
All that smack you talked out your ass just backfired
And got back stabbed like I might've jacked myers
And jack-knifed off course into a sack of tack wires
I'm like a swirly, leavin you birdies down the drain
Surely you won't be around to reign when y'all sound the same
Girly I know that you're down to play, I'll come around again
You know I can't slow down, now who sounds insane
I'm a grizzly on a track murder words with my bare hands
So I'ma tell you truths cause nobody gon' dare, man
Give ya goosebumps making all of your hair stand
No pun intended, better step if you gon' stare man
I've seen a plane crash, you'll be amazed, fam
Psychotic to the core, I'm talking my DNA strands
Emmy to the VMAs, push me I push back
Push a pussy rapper man I pop the lid to a can of whoopass
The hell are these fellas thinkin they heaven sent
Never been evident so level and settle in, the vendettas are meddling
You hella bent for thinkin you swellin' so tell a friend
Hell is sent double sluggers and fuckin' pellet guns
Ain't sellin' it
And I talk sickening, when I said I'm all ridiculous
All wicked, it was meant, I spit venom, and toxic and
My thoughts itching to find another beat to be off killing
And won't stop kicking, all crippled till y'all witness it
I'm cold as one of them weather days, can't ever say
Why I'm ice cold, but best believe I burn like I'm pepper spray
I drop heavy rhymes, while y'all remain featherweight
And I only take straight bills, other words I'll never change
Some call me dumb, others Hamza Farooqi
My last name's legit homie, I'm far from rookie
It's hard to look me in the eye
Cause you'll start to push me
And the rest call me a dick cause I'm so hard to pussies
I playfully stay witty to fakes in a hate comity
Ain't quittin til I die whenever they kill me
So grab aks, barettas, fetti and whatever into may's city
And if I die, bitches it's you that I'll take with me
I settle scores crunch em like a packet of sealed chips
So tell a foe frontin' I'm gunning it with real clips
And I'm in a zone that you never nearing or running deals with
Can't front with your backup it's zero to a hundred real quick
You might also like:
I'm not a gangster, I don't act like I'm the shit
But that won't stop me from rippin' and then smashing you to bits
You get massacred quick if you ask for a battle
Cause battle raps I'm sick, something I'm cancerous with
Spell my name backwards azmah, I'm leaving you breathless
Rappers are pussies, I beat em and I'm eating you next, bitch
Feebles and wenches don't ever get to the point
