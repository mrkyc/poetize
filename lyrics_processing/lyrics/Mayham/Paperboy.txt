Hold up, what's my name?
Back with a track I can't explain
Back with a rap, that's back to the crap
Til I'm back to the back to the back again
Like I'm back to the core, back to the plain
Back to the back when I'm rapping as Mayham
I'm acting, I'm faking, I'm back to the basic
The fact is I'm actually insane
I'm goin' hard to leave a mark, til you hear me when the needle drops
Til the DJ cuts the record, and you hear me when the beat has stopped
Til my music's all up in your head, all my s-h-i-t won't stop
Look how I maneuver, I can basically just feed your crops
I've got the talent, got the skill, I'm mad and I just got to kill
Got a lot of dollars lot of bills, no stopping til I cop a mil
I'm all about the money girl, I wanna see that cash flow
Barely know her name or face but recognize that ass though, I'm a

Girl I can picture us together, you can call me polaroid
Who's got that flow sizzling like a roti on a frying pan
You can hear the siren wail, I'll show you how to fire, man
I'm the rawest in the building and you're sealed in til it's over
And I feel like I am kosher but you dyin' if you tryin' ham
See her eying me for lunch when I'm swiping on my visa card
So I play it cool, better make a move, I tell her she's a piece of art
Truth is I got 40 cents, she's making sure I'm chasing her
She's wasted, paycheck got a raise so baby face it, I'm the fuckin'

Girl, you foxy... swiper gets to swipe
But tinder knows that I'm no match for you, but you swiped right
But we're a perfect pair, like I grew it nice and ripe
Straight up, you're left handed and I'm out my right mind
They got that drive to drive you crazy til you jack knife off a road
Til you stranded like your hair, then bitches gon be dyeing slow
They want the money, want the dollars, know that they gon' ask you once
And if you ain't give her hundred bucks, her ass gonna pack a punch
I'm craving for a hundred mils I'm hungry til my wallet shines
Munchies for the money, cause my pupils turned to dollar signs
Her friends ain't ever gonna change, I do see a lot of dimes
I ain't talkin ladies, man, I'm talking all the dollars like I'm her
