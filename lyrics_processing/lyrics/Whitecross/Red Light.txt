Punch the card, now it's time to play
Flip of the card, cast your dice
Looking good now, but the end ain't nice
You're shouting, but you're deaf to all
You don't listen and you don't heed the call
Feelin high and feeling tall
It's so easy to fall
Look out for the stop light
A warning in the night
Listen to the Spirit, he'll stop your plight
Red light, he'll show you who's right
You'll see who's right
That's right!
Slip of the lip, back to the wall
Best laid plans, get ready to fall
Easy come, easier go
But the voice of God wants you to know
Breaking down, disaster around
Mud on your collar, got your face in the ground
When you're mind is blown, you can't hear the sound
You're going down
You might also likeLook out for the stop light
A warning in the night
Listen to the Spirit, he'll stop your plight
Red light, we'll show you who's right
Time to surrendur and stop your fight
Stop light, a warning in the night
Give it a listen, and he'll stop your plight
Red light, we'll show you who's right
You'll see who's right
It'll take you from wrong to right
From black to white
Slip of the lip, back to the wall
Best laid plans, get ready to fall
Easy come, easier go
The Holy Spirit wants you to know...
He's talking to you inside
He's telling you, you don't have to hide
You can be on a brand new side
Don't you know that the Devil lied?
Stop light, a warning in the night
Give it a listen and he'll stop your plight
Red light, we'll show you who's right
The Devil's wrong. The Holy Spirit is right
Stop light, a warning in the night
Sin is the disease
Red light, we'll show you who's right
The cure's gonna bring you to your knees
Stop light, it will never hold you back
Red light, it'll always keep you on track
Stop light, the warning in the night
