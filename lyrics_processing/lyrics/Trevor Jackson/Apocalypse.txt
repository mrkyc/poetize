If we were on Mars
And there are no more stars
Only flying cars, girl I never would leave you
If the world blew up
There's only dust
And only us, don't you know I would reach you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah
Can you try somethin' new for me tonight?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah,ah
You can get closer girl
You know I don't bite

The more I know, and the less you don't
About the things I do
Think that's how we should keep it
Cause the way I move
You just ain't use to
I don't wanna confuse you
I just know that I need you, you
I just know that I need you, you
You might also like'Cause I don't know
Which way the time gon' go
When the sky gon' fall
I just know that I need you
If you gotta know the one who's in control
I just hope that you know
Hope you know that I need you, you, you
Hallelujah
You, you, you

Girl I think you're needed like a Gatorade
After playing hoops all night and day
Think I'm tryna see you in the candle light light
Lick your body up and down
I told the baddest chick
I'm not the average type of nigga
I'm just tryna be the fly that's on your zipper
I'm sorry I'm not Instagram, I've got no filter
Never met someone who made me wanna leave the party
Know you see me on screen don't be proud
I might not be Drake, but girl know that I'm somebody
'Cause when I see you, you screamin' out loud

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah
Can you try somethin' new for me tonight?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah,ah
You can get closer girl you know that I don't bite
The more I know, and the less you don't
About the things I do
Think that's how we should keep it
Cause the way I move
You just ain't use to
I don't wanna confuse you
I just know that I need you, you
I just know that I need you, you
'Cause I don't know
Which way the time gon' go
When the sky gon' fall
I just know that I need you
If the god I know the one who's in control
I just hope that he knows
Hope he know that I need you, you, you
Hallelujah
You, you, you
Hope he knows that I need you

If we were on Mars
And there are no more stars
Only flying cars, girl i never would leave you
If the world blew up
There's only dust
