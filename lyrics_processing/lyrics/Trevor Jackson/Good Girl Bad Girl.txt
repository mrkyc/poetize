I want a bad girl tonight
Mischievous and clever
Showed up in my fave
Tryna capitalize, on our time together
Acting like she bigger than she is
Looking seductive
Wanting me to sweat her
Playing hard to get
Knowing damn well
She gon get in here and do whatever I tell her
And she wanted me to save her life
So I had to break it to her
It was only right
Let me clear the air

Bad girls get tonight
Good girls get forever
One night for sho
Lifetime never
No disrespect but this would go better
If I make you understand me
Bad girls get tonight
Good girls get forever
One night for sure
Lifetime never
My hearts reserved for somebody better
I hope you understand
Hope you understand me
(bad girls, only for tonight, bad girls, only for too)

I want a good girl for life
The one that they call wifey, yeah
Put her up in whatever she likes
Keep her fly and keep her icy
Now she a lady in the street
And she always keep it trill
The kind to hold ya down
And support you in what ya do
She crazy, sexy, cool
Superwoman
She the kind you wanna wake up to every mornin'
Better than all ya past lovers, place no one above ya
Girl we'll be a team for life
She's the one I call my wife, yeah keep it tight
The reason why

(good girls, girl you are my life, good girls, girl you are my, you're mine, you're mine..
Bad girls only for tonight, bad girl only for too!)

Now don't get me wrong
Simple and plain I love both of y'all
But it ain't the same
When good girls try to play bad girl games
And bad girls try to be what they just ain't
Thats when the problem starts, thats when the problem starts
Use ya head and ya heart
