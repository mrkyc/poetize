Girl, I can heat it up
By the fireplace, we'll be safe in the snow
Baby, we've waited long enough
And I hate to see you alone
Cause December is the time to cuddle up
Everybody needs someone, cause one is only half the fun
Santa knew what you wanted all along
He come and told me, 'Go and write this song'
It'll bright your thoughts, babe
Cause it's been too long
Since your heart's been mine to hold on to
Right now so cold
Girl, if you let me, this Christmas I'll be
Who you love, who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be, I promise I'll be who you love
I knew that Mr. Talking will only do so much
Cause my baby needs everything
And I'm willing to give her that much
If she's ready, God, I'm ready
No can't nobody do Christmas like this
And I know your body is the greatest gift
You might also likeSanta knew what you wanted all along
He come and told me, 'Go and write this song'
It'll bright your thoughts, babe
Cause it's been too long
Since your heart's been mine to hold on to
Right now so cold
Girl, if you let me, this Christmas I'll be
Who you love, who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be, I promise I'll be who you love
All I want for Christmas is her
All she wants for Christmas is me
All we want for Christmas is us
Baby girl, it's all we gon need
Cause it's been too long
Since your heart's been mine to hold on to
Right now so cold
Girl, if you let me, this Christmas I'll be
Who you love, who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be who you love, who you love
This Christmas I'll be, I promise I'll be who you love
All I want for Christmas is her
All she wants for Christmas is me
All  we want for Christmas is us
