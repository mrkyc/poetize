She don't wanna go to sleep
She don't know why
The party never ends when she's around
She don't wanna go to sleep
She wanna go out
The party never ends when she's around
She loves to get high then deny that she feel it
Says she's got a guy but she single tonight
And we don't wanna go to sleep
We don't know how
I guess the party never ends when she's around

Got an image I gotta protect (Need them shits like, right now)
Got a few checks I gotta collect (Gotta collect, gotta collect)
Act right, I got my shoes to the left (To the left)
Rags to bitches, real life
That's why you gotta live your life with no regrets
Re-direct and come correct when it's God's plan
Had to fall down just a few times 'fore I got it right
You better eat or you get ate in this lunch line
I'm at the top of the ladder, she said she ready to climb

She don't wanna go to sleep
She don't get tired
The party never ends when she's around
She don't wanna go to sleep
She wanna go out
The party never ends when she's around
She loves to get high then deny that she feel it
Says she's got a guy but she single tonight
And we don't wanna go to sleep
We don't know how
I guess the party never ends when she's around

I said my party days are over
They turnin' up and I'm sober
But she look good and I need that
For her I just might relapse
Oops, I did it again
Ooh shit, I'm drinking again
Ooh I'm fuckin' with her and a friend
Damn, when is the night gonna end
I don't even know
I don't think it matters now
I can't feel my hands now
She said, "Don't worry, boy, you're trippin'"
Ain't it night, you cold?
Then she said, "Relax, this, you don't want to fight"
Told her, "Girl, I've never been this high before"
She said, "Keep your eyes on me, you'll be alright"

She don't wanna go to sleep
She don't know how
The party never ends when she's around
She don't wanna go to sleep
She wanna go out
The party never ends when she's around
She loves to get high then deny that she feel it
Says she's got a guy but she single tonight
And we don't wanna go to sleep
We don't know how
I guess the party never ends when she's around
She stay up all night on a school day
I'll try anything, that's the real way
Turnt up, sippin', ooh, ayy
