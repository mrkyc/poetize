(Hol' up)

I've been going to the club, way too much
IG story going crazy, that's all it was
In my feelings every time I'm faded
I've been capping in the finest places, oh, oh-oh, oh
Capture a moment with some pretty faces
Hope you see it and get irritated

Cause I only do this shit to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, ah-ah
You, ooh-ooh, ooh
Only do this shit to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, ah-ah
Is it working? 'Cause, baby, I'm hurting
I'ma be honest, I got some bad intentions
Hope you've been seeing what the fuck you've been missing
Only do this shit to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh
To get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been really acting up (Acting up)
Doing way too much (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I wonder how you're holding up (Holding up)
After we fell off, yeah
Reminisce when we were good, I loved how you rolled them Backwoods (Rolled them Backwoods)
Yeah, the sex was always crazy, yes, I think about it daily
And I miss you that's a fact, think I kinda want it back
So when you see me in my bag
You might also like
Just know I'm doing it to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, ah-ah
You, ooh-ooh, ooh
Only do this shit to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh, ah-ah
Is it working? 'Cause, baby, I'm hurting
I'ma be honest, I got some bad intentions
Hope you've been seeing what the fuck you've been missing
Only do this shit to get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, oh woah
To get to you, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tell me do I ever cross your mind, baby?
Any time, baby (Yeah, yeah)
You're the only way I wanna spend my time, baby
Just you and I, baby (Yeah, yeah-yeah)
I know what you do, how you move when I kiss that spot
I know what you do when I kiss that spot
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
