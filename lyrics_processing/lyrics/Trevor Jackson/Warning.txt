Yung Shad, you killed this track

Look at my chain (Uh), look at my wrist (Ooh)
Look at my gang (Gang), look at my clique (Clique, clique)
We go insane ('Sane), on asylum shit (We so crazy)
And we make a mess (Woo), on some childish shit (Yeah, ooh)
And we'll never change (We'll never change)
When we walk in the party, hold on to your shawty, that's a warning (Ooh-ooh)
We gon' break all the hundreds and throw it
'Cause she love to dance (She love to dance)
If you're not careful, she might wake up with me in the morning (Me in the morning)
That's just a warning (Ooh)
'Cause we run the game

If you don't have no baby
Girl, I'm tryna have your baby
Know I'm too young for a kid
But still, I'ma have your baby
I'm on the way to your crib, I pulled up in overalls
She take me straight to the head, I'm just like a Tylenol
Before we go further, can you put away your camera?
Then later that night, I put that ass on camera, yeah
317 with this shit, yeah
Trappin' with the Chevy, I'm the man, ooh
God did really have a plan
That's why I'm cooking these niggas like spam in the can
