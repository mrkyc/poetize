In the night time
I find
We start to lose control
Cause in the night time
The moon is so bright
Animals we turn into
But it only happens when I'm with you baby
You be scratching, biting
Got you howling at me when I get it
In the night time
I know you feel it, babe
All this sinning
There ain't no forgiveness when I'm in it babe
In the night time, yeah

Said she wanna see me in the night time, yeah
She know I'm a beast in the night time, yeah
Call me anytime like a lifeline, yeah
Say less; The whip now I'm in it
I be on my way in a minute
I just gotta pull up, park the car
By the corner store
Apartment 304's where I'm headed to
I opened up the door, already on the floor
And she's on all fours, she know I transform
When she do it in the night time

The curse fall upon me at night
And girl you got nowhere to hide
I start bursting outta my clothes
Now there's no more white in my eyes
Now I got claws for my hands
I am no longer a man
Thought you know what happens this hour
So why didn't you tie me down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe

You better get ready, babe
You better stop running, babe
Cuz I'm about to tear that ass up tonight
