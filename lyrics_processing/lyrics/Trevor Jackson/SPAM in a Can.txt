The word I often hear is legend
But I'm just tryna chill with my family
People that I used to know don't really
Call me, but they call me they bestie

Tell me what they want from me
Would they want me if I wasn't famous?
Tell me why they hide they faces
Tell me what they want from me
Why are all my exes always mad at me?
Why everything I live for is a tragedy?

I'm a single actor turned rapper
'Cause ain't nobody come forth with it
Ain't nobody grab the torch with it
Feeling like the fountain of youth and everybody's absorbing it
Been giving more than I'm getting, I swear this industry's disproportionate
But I'm a show em the rebirth of a king, a new kind of metamorphosis
I'm bout to power up in the range on some mighty morphin' shit
I worked hard for the life I'm living, worked hard to make my mama proud
Makes me want to make me work even harder every time I see her smile
I've been feeling like I've been living life on a cloud
High above the rest of you niggas
You niggas acting so reckless
So you know I gots to wear the necklace
That holds the cross, yeah, always listen to the reverend
Well at least I try to
I just been here, though
Yeah, most people see me and they like, "Hey, weirdo."
I'm like, "Yo, I don't mean no harm"
I'm just tryna show you what it means to feel from ya heart
I'm just tryna show you what it means to kill form the start
Kill every enemy
Kill every demon that tried to enter into me
I'm a slice they fucking head off in the name of peace
When I turn around they heads grow back, I must be Hercules
People saying that they been there, like they kin to me
Everybody got they mask on, too many frenemies
They see me all over the spreadsheets, now I'm on the billboards
Now they wanna say, "Please, can I have a picture? Say cheese"
Now they wanna reach hands out, I used to be a man
Now they call me the man, all I can say is amen
Cause I worked too hard to hear anything less than
They boy cleaned up like Sham Wow
Yeah, you know I gets wild
Yeah, you know I done drugs I shouldn't've done
Laying in the bed with girl I love, can't even get it up
Guess I've been falling into so much love that I've been feeling numb
You knew the time and date that my show was on and you still didn't come
But I ain't never, been no one to fall off of my shit
I, been no one to fall off no, no, no
I, claim no one, I'm not a Blood nor a Crip
I'm just, a young nigga who just tryna get rich
I'm tryna be inside the VIP
And I'm tryna take my clique with me
And even though my mom and dad might have bad history
They raised me right, I understand why they was strict on me
So I plan on making sure they never need no bill money, yeah
I'm here to eat, I'm bout to take ya dead carcass
And bring it back to the family cause I never forget where I started
God kept the real ones around me and everyone else has departed
Still living for Mark Cotten, yeah you know he's never forgotten
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
