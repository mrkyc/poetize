She's aging like that wine
She says,  "Boy, you're too young and dumb"
Let me put in enough time
I said it's about how much you've lived girl
Not how long you've been alive see
We can ride slow, it's been a while I know
Let me control ya
Looking like she wanna ride
Thinking bout crossing the line
Doing what she never tried, she just might

Baby don't you think 'bout my age, it's just a number
I'll have you wonder
How a youngin' got your ass singing
Curiosity, to get up on me
I'll have you like

Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? What is he doing?
I want him to do it again
Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? What is he doing
I want him to do it again

She says she know it ain't right
But it feels so good, it feels so good
Yeah, she told me to take my time (ha, are you serious?)
I'm hoping she got nine lives
Cause she gon' need them, ain't no stopping when I speed up
She hit a break like what
I'm a genius
When it comes to that body test me
I ace it every time
Turn on point that I can find, but I did everything right
And I left her somewhere I'll come nice
She said you was right

Baby don't you think 'bout my age its just a number
I'll have you wonder
How a youngin' got your ass singing
Curiosity, to get up on me
I'll have you like

Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? What is he doing?
I want him to do it again
Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? What is he doing?
I want him to do it
Let me love you babe
I just, I just, love that
I just, I just wanna love ya
Lemme love you girl
All over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over babe
Just wanna love you

Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? Why does he do it?
Woah, here he come
(Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes)
How does he do it? What is he doing?
I want him to do it again
I know just how
How to make you feel right
I may be young but I know, I know
