If nobody's told you that they're proud
If the applause doesn't seem that loud
If you don't have a shoulder to lean on, nothin' to keep you warm
And it feels like the world has let you down

Then I will be your everything
I said, I will be your everything
If you don't have a shoulder to lean on, nothin' to keep you warm
Said, I will be your everything
And that's on everything, oh-oh

Go, baby, go, baby, go
They try to copy, but they can't fuck with us
You said you wanted it
Ready? Here I come
Can you handle it? All of it at once?

I wanna be your best friend (Oh)
I'll be your mama, I'll be your daddy, baby (I'll be your daddy)
Yeah, I'll be your brother, sister, and your auntie, baby (Oh, yeah)
I'll be anything if it make you happy, baby, yeah
I'll even jump in front of moving traffic, baby (Oh, yeah)

Let you down, babe

I told you that I would be your everything
I said, I will be your everything
If you don't have a shoulder to lean on
I'll be your sun, your moon, your rain
Said, I will be your everything
And that's on everything, oh-oh

Go, baby, go, baby, go (Go, baby)
They try to copy, but they can't fuck with us (They can't fuck with us)
