She said she's only texting you
That she only has eyes for you
That you're the reason she's feelin' brand new, she said
It's what you said that she said, yeah
She said she love you to your face
And you believed it like kids believe in the Easter Bunny
I'm sorry, I know this shit ain't really funny, but, ah

To tell you the truth, she been lyin'
Lyin' like the doormat
To tell you the truth, she been lyin' to you
Bodies on the floor
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
I know where she hide at
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
That's what she was tryin' to do

Don't you believe everything that she makes up
There's more to what lies underneath that makeup
Ooh, she's been lyin' (How you know?)
'Cause I'm the one that she's been lying next to
Sorry, my dude

Long hair, she got it (She got it)
She love my wallet (My wallet)
She know my number
That's why she callin' (She callin')
She been here four days (Cuatro)
Said she was on vacay (No)
For her homegirl's birthday
And the flight got delayed
But she suck me, tongue me, swallow like a sherbet
That girl lie to you so much, I know her nerves hurt
I'm sorry, I know that your feelings hurt, hurt
That shit's the worst

But if I'm telling the truth, she been lyin'
Lyin' like the doormat
To tell you the truth, she been lyin' to you
Bodies on the floor
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
I know where she hide at
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
That's what she was tryin' to do

Don't you believe everything that she makes up
There's more to what lies underneath that makeup
Ooh, she's been lyin' (How you know?)
'cause I'm the one that she's been lying next to
Sorry, my dude
She be at my crib with no blouse
Hate this the way that you found out, but
She made me spill like a water spout
When she looked me dead in my face and said
"Happy anniversary, baby"
I felt that shit in my bones
(Somethin' ain't right)
So I went through her phone
Just to double check
Saw what you two had goin' on
Come to find out this bitch has been lyin'

Lyin' like the doormat
To tell you the truth, she been lyin' to you
Bodies on the floor
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
I know where she hide at
To tell you the truth, she been hidin'
That's what she was tryin' to do

Don't you believe everything that she makes up
There's more to what lies underneath that makeup
Can't believe she been lyin' (How I know?)
'cause you the one that she's been lying next to
