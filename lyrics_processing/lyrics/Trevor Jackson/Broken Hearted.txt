I see the better sides of you
Cause you pick me up
If I ever fall down on you
You take it all
You take it all, all
Girl I shoulda told you I was broken hearted
Now you stuck with all my scars and all my problems
I shoulda kept you more informed for that I'm sorry
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

But you bear all my scars and all my pain with honor
You justify my love  just like your name Madonna
You love all my crazy cool, my flaws and all babe
You got me yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm sorry that my heart don't always beat on the right tempo
I'm sorry that I always try to fight cause it's easy
Yeah you do anything that you could
Love me the way that you do
So good, so good, so good

Hut one, hut two when I'm in it
Hut three when I'm all up in the middle
And I know you kinda little so I'm hitting your appendix
Sorry but I gotta let the world know you a gymnast
Oh yeah both legs in the air
Oh yeah how you doing down there?
Pretty good, I mean really good but
It ain't the way you fuck but they way you care
