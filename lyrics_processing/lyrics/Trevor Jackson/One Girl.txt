I ain't worried bout being cool
You're my girl so I'll show you off
We might be young and foolish
But that's the only way
We know how to do it
It's not a time off a day for love
You never know when it's gon come
But I bet if you stick around
I'll steal your heart

Cuz You are, you are
You ain't too hard to find
It's like I been runnin' for miles
Just searching for nothing but
One Girl

You and me would be perfect
This love thing I'm learning
I could have two or three
But I'd rather have you with me
Just One Girl
Whoa

Could you be that one girl for me
