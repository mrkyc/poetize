First things first I'm a real one
I should've known that you would try to play me
I should've known that you would leave in silence
Like a thief in the night with no surveillance

You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet (Yeah)
You took my Benz and my wallet, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
You took my Benz and my wallet
She put the nails in my coffin
She took my Benz and my wallet

There goes my love
And all my trust
Should've never gave it up
Now I'm sipping off a double cup
She was everything to me; my identity
Can't believe she really got me
I was Batman, didn't know she was Robbin

You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet (Yeah)
She drove my Benz, took my wallet, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Don't believe her when she says she's sorry, yeah
You might also like
She took my Benz and my wallet
In love is what we used to be
I used to poke
She dropped it low
Now she's just my enemy
She did the most
I got too close
Won't let it happen again
All for the show
Fall down it slow
Swear it won't happen again

How could you take all my love?
How could you take all my love, baby?
How could you take all my trust? (My trust)
She took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
Now I'm just sitting in my apartment

There goes my love
And all my trust
Should've never gave it up
Now I'm sipping off a double cup
She was everything to me; my identity
Can't believe she really got me
I was Batman, didn't know she was Robbin
You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet
You took my Benz and my wallet (Yeah)
She drove my Benz, took my wallet, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Don't believe her when she says she's sorry, yeah

She took my Benz and my wallet
In love is what we used to be
I used to poke
She dropped it low
Now she's just my enemy
She did the most
I got too close
Won't let it happen again
All for the show
Fall down it slow
Swear it won't happen again

How could you take all my love?
How could you take all my love, baby?
How could you take all my trust? (My trust)
But she took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
I'm all alone in my apartment
I didn't know I was a target
I should've known she did the 
She was at the pillows talkin'
Sleepy Hallow, she Christopher Walken
I was a dead man walkin'
Dead man walkin'
Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet
She took my Benz and my wallet

How could you take all my love?
How could you?
