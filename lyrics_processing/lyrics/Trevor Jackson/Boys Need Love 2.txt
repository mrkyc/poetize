I know that you tryna' stay focused
Honestly, I've been on the same shit too
But I don't think that I can wait
I'm just saying we should spend some time together
We ain't gotta call it a date

'Cause you just need some dick
I know it's been a few months
Since somebody hit it right babe
Let me fill you up
I just got one question
What happens if we start asking questions?
Girl

'Cause boys can never say they love you
Boys they ain't allowed to cry
Boys can't never catch no feelings
Boys can't never ask why
Boys can't never show their weakness
Boys can't never back down
Boys can't never say they in love
Even if they're in it right now
Baby can you teach me how
You might also like
