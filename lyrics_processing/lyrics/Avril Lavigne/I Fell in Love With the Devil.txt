Shotguns and roses make a deadly potion
Heartbreak explosions in reckless motion
Teddy bears and "I'm sorry" letters
Don't seem to make things better
Don't bury me alive
Sweet talkin' alibi

But I-I-I-I-I can't stop the rush
And I-I-I-I-I can't give you up
No, I-I-I-I-I know you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the Devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the Devil
I'm underneath his spell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the Devil
Please, save me from this hell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Got me playin' with fire (Playin' with fire)
Baby, hand me the lighter (Hand me the lighter)
Tastes just like danger (Tastes just like danger)
Chaotic anger

But I-I-I-I-I can't stop the rush
And I-I-I-I-I can't give you up
No, I-I-I-I-I know you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the Devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the Devil
I'm underneath his spell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the Devil
Please, save me from this hell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Angels and Devils always fight over me (Fight over me)
Take me to heaven, wake me up from this dream
Even in sunlight, clouds shadow over me (Shadow on me)
It's now or never, wake me up from this dream

I fell in love with the Devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the Devil
I'm underneath his spell
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the Devil
Please, save me from this hell (This hell)
Dig deep, six feet (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
