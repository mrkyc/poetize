(Step up, step up) Step up
(Step up, step up) Step up
(Step up, step up)
(Step up)

Fall back, take a look at me and you'll see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you, let me know
And I'll go, 'cause I flow better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be, honestly
'Cause creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie
So don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone, I got a backbone stronger than yours

(Step up) La-la-la-la-la-la (Step up, step up)
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la) (Step up)
La-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down, go ahead and try
Go ahead and try

You don't know, you think you know me like yourself
But I fear that you're only tellin' me what I wanna hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand that I can't not be what I am
I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon
It's not a simple "Here we go," not so soon
I might've fallen for that
When I was fourteen and a little more green
But it's amazing what a couple of years can mean

(Step up) La-la-la-la-la-la (Oh) (Step up, step up)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Step up, step up) (Yeah, yeah)

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down, go ahead and try
Go ahead and try
Oh
Go ahead and try, try to look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize, realize
Things are tryin' to settle down
Just tryin' to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need your doubt in me

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool (Not nobody's fool)
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and (Try) try, try
