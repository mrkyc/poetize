You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss
It was somethin' like this and made me go, "Oh, oh"
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you
That I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away, yeah, oh

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do
And cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass to make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop
I thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset (Really upset)
So get outta my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

That I'm not like that girl?
The one who throws it all away

Did you think that I was gonna to give it up to you
This time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do
And cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

This guilt trip that you put me on
Won't mess me up, I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do
And cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah
Better off that way
