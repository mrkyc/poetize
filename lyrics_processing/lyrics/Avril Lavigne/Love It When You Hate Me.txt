I'm a lush
And I'm drunk again off another crush
Don't rush
Just take your time, don't feel too much
And how 'bout you just take some blame?
I always take all the pain
You should just forget my name

And I (I)
Ignore all the warning signs (All the warning signs)
Fall for you every time

Don't call me "baby" (Baby)
I love it when you hate me
I know it's crazy (Crazy)
I love it when you hate me
The highs, the lows, the yes, the no's (The no's)
You're so hot when you get cold
Don't call me "baby" (Baby)
I love it when you hate me

Yeah, I love it when you hate me, wish you could erase me
I been so depressed, I don't think anyone could save me
Look at what you did, girl, look at how you changed me
Funny how you twistin' up the truth and then you blamed me
Runnin' out of fucks that I could give to you
But you could still be pretty on the inside, too
Your heart's so cold, but I love the way you lie
Shoulda seen the red flags, but for you, I'm fuckin' blind
