You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control, oh-oh
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it
'Cause you're fuckin' crazy rock 'n' roll
You-ou said, "Hey
What's your name?"
It took one look and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said, "Hey"
And since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything
Has felt this right and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why-y-y-y I smi-i-ile

Last night, I blacked out, I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember makin' out and then, oh-oh
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again
