Dark times, hard times
I didn't know who I was for a minute
I didn't know where I was, I was in it
I was lost 'til you found me
Days passed, weeks flashed
I didn't know anyone who would get it
I thought I knew about love, had to admit it
I was lost 'til you found me

You're what I was hoping for
All I dreamed of and more
You're what I'm looking for

He treats me like a goddess, goddess
He thinks I'm sexy in my pajamas
The more I am a hot mess, the more he goes bananas
He treats me like I'm a goddess
To be honest, honest
I didn't know how bad that I want this
Hard to keep it modest, thinks my body's flawless
He treats me like I'm a goddess

I was wait, I was wait, I was waitin'
Every day, every night, I would stay in
Now I'm safe and awake and I say
He treats me like I'm a goddess

Good times, bad times
By my side, he's so sweet, he's so giving
I thought I'd lived, but you can't call that living
I was lost 'til you found me

You're what I was hoping for
All I dreamed of and more (All I dreamed of)
You're what I'm looking for

He treats me like a goddess, goddess
He thinks I'm sexy in my pajamas
The more I am a hot mess, the more he goes bananas (Oh)
He treats me like I'm a goddess
To be honest, honest
I didn't know how bad that I want this
It's hard to keep it modest, thinks my body's flawless
He treats me like I'm a goddess

I was wait, I was wait, I was waitin'
Every day, every night, I would stay in
Now I'm safe and awake and I say
He treats me like I'm a goddess
I was wait, I was wait, I was waitin'
Every day, every night, I would stay in
Now I'm safe and awake and I say
He treats me like I'm a goddess
Like I'm a goddess, oh
Ah, ah, ah, like I'm a goddess, oh, ooh
He treats me like a goddess

I was wait, I was wait, I was waitin'
Every day, every night, I would stay in
Now I'm safe and awake and I say
He treats me like I'm a goddess
I was wait, I was wait, I was waitin'
Every day, every night, I would stay in
Now I'm safe and awake and I say
He treats me like I'm a goddess
