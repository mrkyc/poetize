Eh-oh
You shoulda known better, better to fuck with someone like me
Eh-oh
Forever and ever, you're gonna wish I was your wifey

Don't act so innocent, this was no accident
You planned this in the end and now it's over
Say what you wanna say, you lied and I got played
You threw it all away and now it's over

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew, can you taste it?

Eh-oh
You shoulda known better, better to fuck with someone like me
Eh-oh
Forever and ever, you're gonna wish I was your wifey
Shoulda held on, shoulda treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh-oh
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

Don't hold your breath 'cause you're still chokin' on your words
Those things you said might be the last ones that I heard
So come pick up your clothes from the front yard
Sprinklers on, burn the rest in the backyard
Shoulda had the guts just to say goodbye
Now you're gonna have regrets for the rest of your life

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew, can you taste it?

Eh-oh

Eh-oh
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I shoulda run
Know I shoulda run, know I shoulda run
I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I shoulda run
Know I shoulda run, know I shoulda run
