I don't care about my makeup
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say, "So what?" (What?)
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfuckin' princess
You still love it (Yeah)

Some, somehow it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes (Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Some, someway we'll be gettin' outta this town one day
You're the only one that I want with me
You know how the story goes (Oh, oh, oh)

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock and roll
