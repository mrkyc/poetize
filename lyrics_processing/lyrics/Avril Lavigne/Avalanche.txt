I keep tryin' just to make it
To the end of the day, you know I hate it
Been lyin', my body's achin'
What do you do when the hero needs savin'?

Honestly, I can't shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, honestly, I can't take it

I say that I'm just fine, but I don't feel alright on the inside
I say that I'm okay, but I don't feel okay right now, no
I've been slippin' and slidin', my world's getting colder
I'm tired of lookin' over my shoulder
Tonight, I don't feel alright on the inside
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
And I'm not okay, I'm not okay, no

I feel too much, my blood is rushin'
Ask about me, I'm quick to change the subject
I tell the truth but get interrupted
I wish my life woulda came with instructions

Tonight, I don't feel alright on the inside
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
It's like I'm runnin' from an avalanche
I'm not okay, I'm not okay, no

Whoa-oh-oh
My heart is racin'
Su-su-suffocatin'
I'm slowly fadin'
Su-su-suffocatin'

I say that I'm just fine, but I don't feel alright on the inside
I say that I'm okay, but I don't feel okay right now, no
