Your first love, your first kiss
Guy that crossed you off of his list
I'm not the red taillights that left you behind
Again and again
I'm not your Tennessee pre-med big man
Promised you a ring and took another girl's hand
What's it gonna take to make you understand
I'm not that man
This is me now
Baby, don't doubt
The love I can give to you
You gotta know
I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now
Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
I've been your late night call
Your shoulder to cry on
Out on the highway, listening to sad songs
Talk all night 'bout stupid things, makin' you smile
You might also likeI've been right here
All of these years
I am your man
By now you ought to know
I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now
Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
No more lonely nights
Starin' at your cell phone
No more clinging to a love so cold
With me you'll never have to be alone
I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now
Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
Goodbyes made you mine
I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now
Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
