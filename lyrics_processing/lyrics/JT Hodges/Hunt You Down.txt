She was standing on the cobblestones in a pair of cut-off jeans
I asked what she was doin', she said "Sugar, I'm killin' time"
Then I handed her my wallet and said, "Baby, so am I"
{*Whistling*}
She said "You might need these" and then handed me her shades
Took me to a barroom darker than the ace of spades
I asked "What's this we're drinkin'?" She said "Call it smokey Blues"
I couldn't tell you what it tasted like, but I know I had a few...
And we danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town"
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
Na na-na-na na na nah, na na na na nah na, hunt you down
She asked where I was comin' from
I said "I'm just comin' round, how 'bout you?"
Then she drove me to the highest hill in Germantown
"My daddy's money bought the mansion, they threw in the plane for free"
She said, "I can drop you off anywhere or you can stay with me"
And we danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town'
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
Ooh ooh ooh

And I thought about that girl in Germantown
I've gotta hunt her down
We danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town"
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
I'm gonna hunt you down...
Oh oh oh
Na na-na-na na na nah, na na na na nah na, hunt you down
