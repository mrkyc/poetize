I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down drink you down)
(Drink you down, drink you down drink you down)

It's the light on your skin, the dress that you're in
The way you pull your hair back
It's the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Girl, I want you so bad

Wanna break that bottle open, sip you nice and slow
And keep this party rollin', right now

I wanna drink you down, I wanna get lit up
Forget about this crowd, it's just the two of us
Here on a night like this, lost in a champagne kiss
Spinnin' round and round, I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)

It's the way your body moves, the smell of your perfume
It's got me all hazy, and every time we touch
Girl, I feel the rush, I'm buzzin' on ya baby, yeah
You might also like
I wanna drink you down, I wanna get lit up
Forget about this crowd, it's just the two of us
Here on a night like this, lost in a champagne kiss
Spinnin' round and round, I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)

Wanna break that bottle open, sip you nice and slow
And keep this party rollin', right now

I wanna drink you down, I wanna get lit up
Forget about this crowd, it's just the two of us
Here on a night like this, lost in a champagne kiss
Spinnin' round and round, I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
I wanna drink you down
(Drink you down, drink you down, drink you down)
