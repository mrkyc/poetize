Well, he searched and searched for nights and days
'Til he found the one he loved
And he wrapped her in his arms again
And then he thanked the stars above
That he found who he'd been looking for
And he stared her in the eyes

He said "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
He said "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I do)
(Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you)

She stared him right back in the eyes
With a look of disbelief
Then she gazed off into somewhere else
Was it real or just a dream?
And she pulled him oh so close to her
And she whispered in his ear

She said "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
She said "I love you too"
(I love you, I love you, I do)
(Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you)
You might also like
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky

They said "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
Yes, I really do
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
They said "I love you, yes, I do"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
(I do, I do, I do, I do)


So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky
So if you find someone you love a lot
You must never let them go
You just hold on tight with all your might
And you say three little words
You say "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
You say "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
You say "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
You say "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
You say "I love you"
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do)
You say "I love you"
