I wanna have dinner with Gershwin
I wanna watch Rembrandt sketch
I wanna talk theory with Curie
Impossible, I guess
I wanna talk moods with Picasso
On a rendezvous
I wanna fly double with Earhart
I wanna get next to you
Ooh, next to you

So close, just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry can't affect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch of your greatness is what I need
My circle of fantasy would be complete
Whoa-oh

I wanna sing hymns with Mahalia
And when the day is through
I wanna tell you about it
I wanna get next to you
Oh, next to you
You might also like
So close, just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry can't affect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch of your greatness is what I need
My circle of fantasy would be complete
Whoa-oh


So close, just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry can't affect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch of your greatness is what I need
My circle of fantasy would be complete
Whoa-oh

I wanna have dinner with Gershwin
I wanna watch Rembrandt sketch
I wanna talk theory with Curie
Ooh, I wanna get next to you, next to you
Woo, whoa-oh
(Dinner with Gershwin)
Yeah, wanna get next to you, next to you
(Dinner with Gershwin)
Wine and dine you, baby
(I wanna get next to you)
By the candlelight
(Dinner with Gershwin)
You make me lose my speech
(Next to you, next to you)
Speak to me, baby
(I wanna get next to you)
Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Dinner with Gershwin)
Baby, let's talk about my heart
It's far gone now
(I wanna get) Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Getting next to you, I couldn't take it
Gimme a chance, we'll talk about it
(Dinner with Gershwin)
Oh babe, wanna get, yeah
Wanna get, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Dinner with Gershwin)
