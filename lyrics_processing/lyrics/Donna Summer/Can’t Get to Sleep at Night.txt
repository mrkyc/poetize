Can't get to sleep tonight
Can't get to sleep tonight

Can't get sleep tonight
No matter how I try
Got to get you off my mind
Can't get to sleep tonight

Spoke to you today
Called you on the telephone
You sounded very far away
But baby I love you, I still love you, oh I

Can't get to sleep tonight
No matter what I do
Just can't get you off of my mind
You know I'm stuck on you, stuck like glue

We both live separately
I've found somebody new
And he's real, real good to me
But baby, I love you, I still love you, yeah

Can't get to sleep at night

Don't want to believe that it's over
I keep telling myself one more time
So I lie awake with a heartache
You're always on my mind
Haunting my memory
Think about you all the time, whoa-oh

Can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how I try
Just can't get you off of my mind
Can't get to sleep tonight

Spoke to you today
Called you on the telephone
You sounded very far away
But I love you, I still love, yeah

Can't get to sleep tonight
No matter what I do, what I do
It all keeps coming back to you
Can't get you off of my mind
Can't get to sleep tonight
Can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how I try, what I do
It all keeps coming back to you
Can't get you off of my mind
You know I'm stuck like glue, stuck like glue
Stuck like glue to you
Can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how I try
Got to get you off of my mind
Can't get to sleep tonight
No, I can't get to sleep tonight, baby
Can't get to sleep tonight, honey
