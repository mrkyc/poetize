My baby wears his heart on his sleeve
And with a look on his face
He says
Please, please, please
Love it
Everything he wants
Love it
Everything he wants
I just can't hesitate
When he wants what he wants

Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
And I say
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka

Last night
He calls on the telephone
And only two in the morning
I just want to sleep on
But he's got a way with words
And he got a way with charm
And at three in the morning
He's back into my arms
You might also like
And I say
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
And I say
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka

He looks so good that girls
Stop and stare
But I'll zoom on the mob
With a double long dare
I'm not gonna let him go
I'm not taking any chance
It's a one in million mad romance
And I say
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
And I say
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
Oh, chucka
