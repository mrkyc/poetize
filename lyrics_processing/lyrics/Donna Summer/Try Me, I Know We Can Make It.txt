You got an easy way to make me cry
Cryin' out for you
And I can tell by the hungry way you look
That you know just what to do
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, touch the sky
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, get on high
I wanna come up there with you right now
And reach the stormy top
I wanna hold on tight with all my might
And pray you'll never stop
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, touch the sky
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, get on high
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, touch the sky
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, touch the sky
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, get on high
We can make it, if we try
We can make it, touch the sky
Try me, I know we can make it
