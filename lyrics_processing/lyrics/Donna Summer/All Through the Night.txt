You know, boy
You're so busy reaching for a dream
That doesn't even exist
You can't even see someone
Who's standing right here
Who loves you so much
And I've tried
Oh I've tried
But I want you to still know this
That all you got to do is reach out for me
And I'll be there
Anytime you want me

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid

Quit searchin', anticipatin'
Stop reachin' for that distant star
I been waiting, boy don't pass the moment
The light's before your very eyes
You might also like
All through the night
If you lay your head on my shoulder (all through the night)
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid

Stop searchin'

Quit dreamin'
You're so mistaken
The perfect stranger will never call
Stop wishin', if you won't let good me
Me waiting at your door

All through the night
If you lay your head on my shoulder (all through the night)
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid

All through the night
If you lay your head on my shoulder (all through the night)
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid
Stop searchin' boy
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin', yeah
Stop searchin', oh yeah
Why don't you stop it?

Quit searchin', anticipatin'
Stop reachin' for that distant star
I've been waitin', boy don't pass the moment
The light's before your very eyes, oh

All through the night
If you lay your head on my shoulder (all through the night)
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid

All through the night
Feel my head on my shoulder
And make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic, don't be afraid

Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
