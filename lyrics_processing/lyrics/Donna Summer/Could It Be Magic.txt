Oh, baby
It's been so long
I've waited so long
And now that I have you
I want you to come
Come
Come
Come into my arms
Oh baby, I need you, I need you
Come
Come
Come into my arms again

Spirits move me
Every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby, I love you, come, come
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now
Now, and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

High up where the stallion meets the sun

Never leave you 'til my life is done
