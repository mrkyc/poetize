We're born to die, so I'm gonna fight for how I wanna live
Spark up the riots, guess I'm a criminal and a futurist
With the charges I've caught, won't stand your trial
You can take it out on me, yeah
I've been to hell, but I've learned to keep my cool
Holdin' on to the devil, got him by the throat 'cause I refuse
Yeah, I won't take my last breath in denial
But you can't take it from me, yeah

I've seen peaks, been released into the prisons below
My days here disappear, there's things that I can't ignore
The sweetest release might take a while

So take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style, oh
If you're gonna take me out, take me out in style

We're in the lion's den, consumption is our medicine
And so I'm high again, you can say I'm a true American
Well, the sweetest revenge is being set free
But you can't take it from me, yeah
You might also like
It begins at my end, my death will never survive
I've been cleared of my crimes, don't need no alibi
The sweetest release might take a while

Just take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style, oh
If you're gonna take me out, take me out, take me out in style
Yeah, baby, you
Well, the sweetest release might take a while
Just take me out, take me out in style
Woo

(You'll never take me alive)
(That's all you got?)

Just take me out in style (If you're gonna take me)
Take me in style
If you're gonna love me, love me in style
The sweetest release might take a while
Take me out, take me out in style
If you're gonna fight me, fight me in style
If you're gonna hate me, hate me in style
If you're gonna love me, do it in style
