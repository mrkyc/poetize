I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free

I hear you through the wire, the words all sound like noise
What happened to the fire in your voice?
Don't try to hide the distance, it's just too big to ignore
We work it out like business, it won't work anymore

I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
Ah-ah, I'll set you free

Still sometimes late at night
Moonlight comes into my window
I can make believe it's how it used to be
We made it look so easy, you never tried to resist
Somehow you stopped believing
Somehow we've come to this

I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free
I remember words that fell like coins into a wishing well
This was never meant to be, so I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
Ah-ah, I'll set you free
You might also like
So now I must go on, what more can I do?
What good is being strong when all I ever really want is you?

I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free
I remember words that fell like coins into a wishing well
This was never meant to be, so I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
Ah-ah, I'll set you free

(I remember eyes that shined)
(As they looked so hard back into mine) I remember
(All I want is you) All I want is you
I remember, ah (I remember words that fell like coins into a wishing well)
(All I want is you) 'Cause you want what I want
'Cause you want what I want, ay-ooh, oh
(I remember eyes that shined)
(As they looked so hard back into mine)
