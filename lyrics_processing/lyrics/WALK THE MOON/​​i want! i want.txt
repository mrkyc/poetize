I walk through the fog
And kiss her through the fence
Oh, how strange and difficult
Feigning innocence

But show me
I'm 17 and you don't know (oh, you want me)
I'm drinking wine with all the girls (show me)
They tuck me in, their bedtime stories (oh, you want me)
Just before we "oh oh ohh"
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
Ohh
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
You might also like
I'll come to her house
She'll lay me down
Oh, how strange and beautiful
My lover sounds
I tr- tr- tr- try
To be qui- qui- quiet
Your da- da- da- daddy's down the hall
But I- I- I don't care at all

Show me
I'm 17 and you don't know (oh, you want me)
I'm drinking wine with all of the girls (show me)
If she's your baby, I can't be bothered (oh, you want me)
When she hollers "oh oh ohh"

Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
I tr- tr- tr- try
To be qui- qui- quiet
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
Oh
Oh Oh Oh Ohh
I'm 17, though you don't know me
You can own me for tonight
You tuck me in, your bedtimes stories
Just before we "oh oh ohh"

Show me
I'm 17 and you don't know (oh, you want me)
I'm drinking wine with all of the girls (show me)
They tuck me in, their bedtime stories (oh, you want me)
Just before we "oh oh ohh"
Show me
I'm 17 and she don't know me (oh, you want me)
She can own me for tonight (show me)
If she's your baby, I can't be bothered (oh, you want me)
When she hollers "oh oh ohh"
