Sometimes I need to forget where I came from
Just to remember that I'm here at all
Well I believe that it takes one to know one
Guessing the fire by the shapes on the wall

There ain't no running away
Ain't no fire escape
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA
It's in your DNA, you already know

Release yourself
There's no one else
Until you free yourself
You can't help nobody else
Nobody else, you got the keys
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA, got the keys
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA, got the keys

Are you in a cage?
Vertical lines throwing stripes on the floor
Are you in chains?
Long helpless nights with your eyes on the door
You might also like
There ain't no running away
Ain't no fire escape
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA
It's in your DNA, you already know

Release yourself
There's no one else
Until you free yourself
You can't help nobody else
Nobody else, you got the keys
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA, got the keys
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA, got the keys

(There's no one else, release yourself)
(DNA, release your...)
Well sometimes I need to forget where I came from
Just to remember I got somewhere to go
Do you believe that it takes one to know one?
You already know
Release yourself (Release yourself)
There's no one else (There's no one else)
Until you free yourself (You free yourself)
You can't help nobody else
Nobody else, you got the keys
There ain't no running away (There's no one else)
It's in your DNA, got the keys (Release yourself)
There ain't no running away (DNA)
It's in your DNA, got the keys (Release your...)

(There's no one else, release yourself)
(DNA, release your...)
