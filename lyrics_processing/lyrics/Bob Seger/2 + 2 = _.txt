Yes, it's true I am a young man
But I'm old enough to kill
I don't wanna kill nobody
But I must if you so will
And if I raise my hand in question
You just say that I'm a fool
'Cause I got the gall to ask you
Can you maybe change the rule?
And you stand and call me upstart
Ask what answer can I find
I ain't sayin' I'm a genius

Two plus two is on my mind
Two plus two is on my mind

Well, I knew a guy in high school
Just an average friendly guy
And he had himself a girlfriend
And you made them say goodbye
Now he's buried in the mud
Of a foreign jungle land
And his girl just sits and cries
She just doesn't understand
So you say he died for freedom
Well, if he died to save your lies
Go ahead and call me yellow
