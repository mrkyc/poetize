About the time my Daddy left to fight the big war
Saw my first pistol in a general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up, she didn't understand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It will get you into trouble but it can't get you out
'Bout a year later got a Colt 45
Called a Peacemaker but I never knew why
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

Got into a card game in a Cumberland town
Caught a miner cheatin', so I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the man fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
Trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the pistol but the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

Oh yeah
Oh
Devil's right hand
