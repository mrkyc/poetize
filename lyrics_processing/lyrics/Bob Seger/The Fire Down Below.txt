Here comes old Rosie, she's looking mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy, she's steppin' right on time
There go the street lights bringin' on the night
Here come the men, faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows, ah they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

Here come the rich man in his big long limousine
Here come the poor man all you got to have is green
Here come the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and they go (They go)
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

Yeah, it happens out in Vegas, and it happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right

And he's looking out for Rosie, she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
And when the street lights flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness, slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go (Oh, go)
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Oh burning down below

Yeah, it happens out in Vegas, happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right

And he's looking out for Rosie, she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
And when the street lights flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness, slipping out of sight
All through the shadows
We'll watch 'em come and watch 'em go (Oh, they go)
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Oh, they got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Only got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
