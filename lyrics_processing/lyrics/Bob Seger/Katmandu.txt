I think I'm goin' to Katmandu
That's really, really where I'm goin' to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
I think it's really where I'm goin' to
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Katmandu

I got no kick against the West Coast
Warner Brothers are such good hosts
I raise my whiskey glass and give 'em a toast
I'm sure they know it's true
I got no rap against the southern states
Every time I been there it's been great
But now I'm leavin' and I can't be late
And to myself be true

That's why I'm goin' to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm goin' to
Hey, if I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
Oh, K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Really, really where I'm goin' to
Oh, if I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Kathmandu
You might also like
I got no quarrel with the Midwest
The folks out there have given me their best
I've lived there all my life, I've been their guest
I sure have loved it too
I'm tired of lookin' at the TV news
I'm tired of drivin' hard and payin' dues
I figure, baby, I got nothing to lose
I'm tired of bein' blue

Oh, that's why I'm goin' to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm goin' to
Oh, if I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
Oh, K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Take me baby 'cause I'm goin' with you
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Katmandu
{Bridge}
Oh, take it away

I ain't got nothin' 'gainst the East Coast
You want some people, well, they got the most
And New York City's like a friendly ghost
You seem to pass right through
I know I'm gonna miss the USA
I guess I'll miss it every single day
But no one loves me here anyway
I know my plane is due
The one that's goin' to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm goin' to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Really, really, really goin' to
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Katmandu

Oh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, yeah yeah
