Something was calling you
I could read it in your eyes
You told me that someday we'd meet again
But deep inside i always knew
This was the end
I remember those words you claimed
As I stood in the pouring rain
When i showed my heart would never be the same
You told me time will always heal the pain
Bring the sun and dry the rain
We need time to solve and think our problems through
You told me time is always on my side
To turn the season, change the tide
Things work out with time if you want them to
Why can time makes me stop
Loving you
It wasn't very easy when you left
Every mention of your name would get me so upset
I trapped my emotions deep inside
I acted like I didn't care
With hopes this would subside
You might also likeI remember those words you claimed
As I stood in the pouring rain
When i showed my heart would never be the same
You told me time will always heal the pain
Bring the sun and dry the rain
We need time to solve and think our problems through
You told me time is always on my side
To turn the season, change the tide
Things work out with time if you want them to
Why can time makes me stop
Loving you
I try to get you off my mind
I live my life just wasting time
Hoping that someday
I can say the same
Time will always heal the pain
Bring the sun and dry the rain
Things work out with time
If you want them too
Time will always heal the pain
Bring the sun and dry the rain
We need time to solve and think our problems through
You told me time is always on my side
To turn the season changes the tide
Things work out with time
If you want them too
Why can time makes me stop
