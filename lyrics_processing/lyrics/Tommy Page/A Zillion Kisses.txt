I've been saving all my love
For somebody like you
It's building up inside of me
This feeling's so brand new
Nothing can stop it
Nothing can hold it
Look in my eyes
I'm sending them through

I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
(You just can't count my love)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above
(Endless numbers of)

I've never been to paradise
With anyone before
But now I just can't wait to go
So open up the door
And I will take you
I will make you feel
Happier than you ever been
You might also like
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
(You just can't count my love)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above
(Endless numbers of)

You just can't count
You just can't count
You just can't count, you just can't count
You just can't count, you just can't count
My love

I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above

I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
(You just can't count my love)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above
(Endless numbers of)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
(You just can't count my love)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above
(Endless numbers of)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more you
Just can't count my love
(You just can't count my love)
I've got a zillion kisses for ya
More and more and more than
All the stars above
