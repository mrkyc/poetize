Wolf
Ow

Wolfpac is back causin' a mass destruction
Guess who's here? The bad boys of wrestling
Just some competition in the war destination
Not and no mercy see the ring is like the street
If you don't know you better find out the Wolfpac
Here to prove a point number one best believe
That you don't wanna mess with them
I be on a roll and I'm come in the ring
And you're never walking out again

Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
You might wind up in a body bag

You take your chances
Now it's time to show you the rope
In the ring this is poor
All you sucks aren't strong
Day in day out the Wolfpac for life
Tell the boy with guts to come to the ring at night
We care about the reppin' 'cause we make it our own rules
You don't wanna feel what it's like to be in their shoes
See it's just a crowd pleasure running underneath
You a person who would be running from soldiers
You might also like
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
You might wind up in a body bag

Wolfpac is back causin' a mass destruction
Guess who's here? The bad boys of wrestling
Just some competition in the war destination
Not and no mercy see the ring is like the street
If you don't know you better find out the Wolfpac
Here to prove a point number one best believe
That you don't wanna mess with them
I be on a roll and I'm come in the ring
And your never walking out again

Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
Don't turn your back on the Wolfpac
