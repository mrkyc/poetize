C-Murder B.G. bout' to do this thing ya'll heard us
Straight gutter ya' know?
New Orleans ha ha

Now all y'all done heard of me
Now I'm C-Murder
I done things y'all ain't never heard of
Now I'm a fool boy, call me a fool it's on
I'm willing to die for mine, I'm willing to die for mine
Now all y'all done heard of me
I'm B. Gizzle
I've done things you bitch niggas scared of
I smacked bitches, shot niggas
Sold coke, caught cases, I've done it all
I ain't talking I don't stunt at all

You don't wanna mess with that Glock, boy
Test me with that Glock you get popped, boy
On the spot money bustin' out my socks, boy
It's hot and now these cops on my jock, boy
I breaks bread with these baseheads
I show them love until they slip and I trip son
It's bigger than drugs; they wanna label me a killer
So don't push me life is hard
I'm trying to fill my own graveyard the 3rd Ward
A menace to society, like I'm a threat
Y'all ain't met the real C yet I'mma rep
Ask Bumby, Wayne and Rich about me it's realer than real
I was josin' when Slim got killed, you know how I feels
It's a shame the reaper came who should I blame
Mytaius told me to be cool you know I'm a fool
Messing with you gorillaz will get your head bust
Me and my homies we about that paper
It's money we after, straight money makers
Cut boyz could never be no fakers
I spit that gangsta rap; I kick that hip-hop
I bought them gangsta-ass beats that make your head bop
Then make that iron cock and then that show stops
Cause it's murda murda murda murda
The 187 cause I don't give a.. but they don't heard me though

This lil nigga will steal ya even when ya payin attention
I'mma uptown gangsta, V.L. gone
When I die bury me wit Girbauds and a t-shirt on
I'm a fool like that I be walkin' through the hood
With all my jewelry on, bitch niggas wonder how I do it
I'm real, that's how I could, it gets no realer
I got killas like jarnel just waitin for me to spend 'em
I was raised with gorillas and gangsters
Killers and thugs straight hustlers that'll touch you up
These choppers sendin niggas all true to the game
