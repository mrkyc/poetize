Or in an ivory tower
And looking out that life I looked from deep within
I walked along the street
And never saw a face
I stayed away from truth because the truth was very
Hard to take
All the loneliness, all the torture
I would tell myself "there but for fortune"
But I have loved and lost
I have cried alone
I am every man and I know
We are all the same
The walls are falling down
We feel the wind of change
We try to stay divided
The world gets in the way
And those who have too much
Maybe they don't have enough
If they are so apart from life
That they're too scared to open up

They will tell themselves "there but fate go I"
They may never know
They are part of us
They may tell each other they are not the same
But as the rivers rise
They will realise
We are all the same
We are the same
When we sing and cry, when we live and die
I am you, they are us, we are all the same
In south Africa, Amazonia
When we hope, when we dream
We are all the same
Look across the earth and see a stranger
Look again and he will call your name
Cause sooner or later in this little world
We are all the same
I cannot understand: when we are all the same
Why do we see the differences, why do we separate?
We don't know who we are
And so we are afraid
Believing we are masters but suspecting we are slaves
(But) sure as the rivers rise we will realise
We are all the same
We are the same
When we sing and cry, when we live and die
I am you, they are us, we are all the same
In south Africa, Amazonia
When we hope, when we dream
We are all the same
We are the same
