Ti amo - in the air
Ti amo - heads up it means that it's over
We're leaving each other
Ti amo - I'm a man
Ti amo - and I love you
Ti amo - there is no cold in my heart
Just the fire you started
I lose my breath
When you reveal yourself
Is love so far from hate?
Love is a question - a butterfly changing it's shape
And I need you as I need the sun
You are forever the one
So I return in my sorrow
Will you give me - your tomorrow
Ti amo - how could I hurt you so
Now I am here again
Open the door to a man who is hollow with pain
And forgive me and fill me with wine
Put me to bed like a child
Wrap me in sheets of white linen
Let me dream of - the beginning

Running beside the sea
Making love endlessly
Singing like birds in the dawn when the moonlight
Is gone
And I'll look for your face in my mirror
Always be wanting you nearer
To tease you and hold you and kiss you
You don't know how - much I'm missing you
Ti amo - how could I fall so low
I couldn't love you more
Ti amo, ti amo, ti amo, ti amo, ti amo
Touch me and fill me with wine
Put me to bed like a child
Wrap me in sheets of white linen
Let me dream of - the beginning
Of you and me
Wild horses running free
Love is a room on fire
Love is the eagle that dives and goes circling higher
I need you as I need the sun
You are forever the one
I'll tease you and hold you and kiss you
You don't know how - much I'm missing you
Ti amo - i love you
Ti amo - I need you
Ti amo
