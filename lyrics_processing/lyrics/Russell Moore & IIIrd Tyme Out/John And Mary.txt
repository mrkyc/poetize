Where the cypress trees grow
There lived a man named John looking for a wife
So to town, he did go
It was there he found sweet Mary
And they made their wedding plans
The next Sunday morning when the church bells rang
They were standing hand in hand
And the preacher said
John do you take Mary for your wife
And he said
Oh yes Lord for the rest of my life
And the preacher said
Mary do you love this man in front of you
And she said
Oh yes Lord forever I'll be true
Now when the sun comes up in the morning
They look into each other's eyes
And the love and the faith that they see in each other
No one can deny
And the little baby boy she holds in her arms
With the power when you pray
And every night on their knees they thank the Lord above
For giving them that day
