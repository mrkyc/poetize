Uh-huh, uh
Ooh, damn, baby
Shit, huh
How you get all that in them jeans?
Never mind that, you hear this?
Uh-huh, it's that Star Trak
Clipse (Get down)
So So Def

Question, ask any nigga
Rapper or a hustler, who rocks is bigger?
(The rapper) Nah, dawg, go figure
With the B-12, I make that straight killa
I flood the block, I hug the Glock
I have a whole neighborhood asking a thug to stop (Stop)
'Cause I show 'em what Waco see
Then hit the district, pay a visit to Jac-O-B
I like my diamonds colored, watch is smothered (Me too)
Show off at the place of jewels, let the white man love it (hahaha)
I'm too much, got bitches out for me
Bring 'em home, give 'em they choice of balcony
She said, "We can have more fun", I said, "How can we?"
Then she brought her girl in and ate her out for me
Wow (Wow), all night sexin'
Just think, this all came from one question

Now as the game rotates and my chrome gets bigger
More and more girls wanna fuck this nigga
It's hard for a chick not to stick around
When I come through town layin' my dick down
They can tell a true playa by the clothes that I wear
Game that I spit and the length of my hair (Okay)
The more I come, the more I cum, get it?
What you see now, I been done did it
Every girl around, I been done hit it
Cars been kitted since I was sixteen
And yes, I'm still spendin' that Kris Kross cream (Haha)
Big boy moves, big boy shine
Big boy watch tell big boy time
Everybody know I got the recipe

It ain't too many things that exceed my reach
Speedboat, glass floor, let you see underneath
But never mind that, though, I'm just showing off
As I do in the Porsche with the top lost
I ain't change the game hash, you know the name as
Malice in my wrist like shattered stain glass
I generate them Franklins and Grants
Each ear look like a halogen lamp
I'm high beamin', at the same time leanin'
In the butter soft seat that keep a street thug schemin'
'Fore we compare paper, get your weight up
I need more points than that, don't you play with me, Jacob
You see me on my back or you see me live
I'm every color of the spectrum like Roy G. Biv
Look, doll, get a load of how daddy ball
Wanna talk about cash? Well, I done said it all
