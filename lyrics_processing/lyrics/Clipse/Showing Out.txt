Yuugh!

Hoe I'm major, that shit nothing
Young nigga, old money, Benjamin Button
Seeing through your poker face, that nigga bluffing
Ladies going gaga for a nigga tryna fuck 'em
Nickel plate tuck it, hesitate nothing
And I got the AR, why I like to bust it?
Why I need counseling? Why I won't discuss it?
Why I spend Donkey Kong knots in the mall like fuck it?
Pull up at the stop light, looking at this cop like
Yeah I drive big shit, naw my license ain't right
Still let the top drop back when it's sunny
Cause life ain't nothing but bitches and money

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealing your bitch, I'm stealing your grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy

UK money, 150 thousand pounds
All-white Lamb sitting low to the ground
I just joined the game, the Millionaire Boys Club
Gave me a box of baking soda and a skateboard
I'm in the kitchen putting the work on steroids
Peeking out the blinds for the Feds, I'm paranoid
Naw I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four-door, so how it ain't no ceiling there?
Showing off little mama, going hard little daddy
Yo Gotti homeboy and I'm a walking dope package

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealing your bitch, I'm stealing your grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy

I'm from the era of letter to the better
They tell me rap changed, well I'ma have to let her
Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothing left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say, "Nigga, where them dollars at?"
Here they go right here, tell them niggas holla back
Hit it then I quit it then I step like a welcome mat
That 2010 got me feeling like I'm all of that
Re-Up Gang trinity, Liva, me and Pusha T
Got my money right, them haters tight like virginity
They don't understand how I feed off the energy
My table is prepared in the presence of my enemies

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealing your bitch, I'm stealing your grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
