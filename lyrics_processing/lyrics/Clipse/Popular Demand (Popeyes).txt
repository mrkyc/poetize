Uh

Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Huh, you should call me uncle
I understand
I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holler at your uncle
I understand
I'm back by popular demand

You are now listening to the all-time phenomenal
Used to bag work in VA at the Econo Lo'
Now I'm laying out at the Delano though
But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing, "Geronimo"
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C., ayy, P, let 'em know
(Yeah, that bitch was hot, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, but it was time to go
Them hoes come in eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Yugh

Huh, you should call me uncle
I understand
I'm back by popular demand (Niggas come 'round here, know what I'm sayin')
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries (Know that we ending that shit quick, nigga)
Yeah, come holler at your uncle (Know you should know yourself in the street, right?)
I understand (Haha)
I'm back by popular demand (Ah)

Why wouldn't I be? Look at shorty, damn
Uh, mami good down to the cuticles, I'm Cam (Killa)
What's your name, beautiful? Like, man (Miss)
I could get used to you, woulda ran
If you knew what I used to do
But call me uncle, yeah, Uncle Cam
I tax 'em (Like who?) Like Uncle Sam (Uh)
From the jungle, fam, where niggas bundle grams
Fumble or you crumble, get murked on the humble and
The gat on the belt on the hip
And I keep it for real with the clips
Drive a hard bargain (Bargain)
I'm Harlem's only Gagarin, car foreign
The other man stood-stood stutter-fied
I know your moms well, tell your mother, "Hi"
I'm the other guy that got your mother high
Coke like a caterpillar, I make butter fly
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you? (This shit is crazy out here, nigga, don't you?)
Huh, you should call me uncle (Uncle)

I understand (Haha)
I'm back by popular demand (Ah)

Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like Saturday Night Fever
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation, but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, uh
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you? (This shit is crazy out here, nigga)
Huh, you should call me uncle
