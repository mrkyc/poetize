Mm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin' 'bout
(You're out of line)
When I was a young boy
(You're out of line)
My mama always told me, "Don't take no shit"
(You're out of line)
"Motherfucker hit you, yeah, you better hit 'em back"
(You're out of line)
So when I hit the nigga, it go, "Blam," uh
A nigga out of line, uh (You're out of line)

Back when I was 'bout Big Wheels and race tracks (You're out of line)
Pop pushed a Tornado and rolled to eight-tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back (You're out of line)
Lying to the baby, saying it's Ajax
I was 'bout four when I walked past that door (You're out of line)
That should've been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See, in my household, it was quite unique (You're out of line)
Playing hide-and-seek, you might find a ki'
Caught glimpse accidental, it branded my mental (You're out of line)
Pals, my role model, in that Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends Icees, it was 'bout six (You're out of line)
And when he pulled off, I was like, "See, told you we was rich"
How I turned out, let it be no surprise (You're out of line)
When they speak of cousin Ricky, it brings tears to their eyes
See, my family got a history of hustlers (You're out of line)
Lil' brother, big brother, mother to grandmother, it's tradition

A nigga out of line, uh (You're out of line)
I said, motherfuckers out of line (You're out of line)

My mama didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam
With the gun in palm of each hand
What couldn't I demand?
See, thirteen, studied the gangsta's lean (You're out of line)
Low brim, no smile, lot of cash, meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrysler Fifth Ave-y (You're out of line)
Hustlers on the block's cars were aero-dynam-y
With ghetto paint jobs, mango M3s (You're out of line)
On seventeen-inch BBs ridin' tough
The bike was Huffy, attention was froze (You're out of line)
In a twenty-five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold (You're out of line)
Since fourteen, holdin', Pusha T was chosen
Rebel like Che Guevara (You're out of line)
RC Tyco versus Carreras, P

I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in "Hoodlum"
Spoiled the grandkids, each one, she would treasure (You're out of line)
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure
A cigarette dangle, forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady, but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved (You're out of line)
Youngins hustlin' in the Creek, me, John-John, and Jamal

Age fifteen
Walking through the hallway, played the new Jordans, first ones on the scene
See, I could afford 'em, livin' out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied
Slid past youngins, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers askin' how and why (You're out of line)
Bitches passing by, "Oh, my, he's so gangsta"
Mm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin' 'bout
(You're out of line)
