From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand your vision
Even adored by Norwegian woman
Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten

I'm sorry, grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
'Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain showerhead
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
