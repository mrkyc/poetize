Yes, sir

Don't let your ego trick yo' ass
'Cause this motherfuckin' TEC will get yo' ass
Yes, this semi-automatic TEC is known to jam
But if it don't, that's yo' ass, my man

I got guns 'cause they got guns (Uh-huh)
I get cash, they get none (Come on)
So I'm sure you see where that leaves me
In the streets with two heats, both well within my reach
I speak slow, let 'em understand my speech
When I say, "Get low, these hold ten shots each (Uh)
Please (Please), don't move too fast
I'm scared of y'all niggas and my nerves is bad"
So sad, but I won't think twice
We rich, we get the best judicial advice (The best)
Threaten my life with them words that they utterin'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start a-flutterin'
Continuous dump, that TEC gets to stutterin'
Left in the slump, mother and sister cuddlin'
And for what? 'Cause you ego-trippin'
If that thing jam, it's divine intervention, click (Come on)

Even if his talk cheap (Say what?), you know I can't sleep
On his word, had to show him that I heard (Let's go)
All that duct tape tie up talk put in reverse
Now it's him who's in a bind on the account of his words (Yeah, you know it)
Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that
I respond with four words, "Rat-tat-tat-tat" (In yo' ass)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop)
Some say Pusha's the coldest
Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zero-less and O-less
Carry that shit that blow your arm out your shoulders (Blaow!)
TECs don't come with holsters
I'm a menace, boy (Don't forget, motherfucker)
