Ugh, big shout out Lupe
First nigga to rock Play Cloths on stage, besides myself
Come to my city, sold-out crowds and shit
Showing respect, we love that shit
Ugh, Trendsetter, nigga
Okay

Feel this, I'm fearless, now hear this
Tackled it after Lupe killed it
Push-Ton, the last son of Mildred
Stumbled upon the rock like a pilgrim
Made money, money made power
Unstepped on as it came off the Mayflower
I come from graffiti'd halls
Now the X marks the spot on my graffiti walls
Statuettes- X'd eyes on those graffiti dolls
Ghetto Bitches ask why- I say it's just because
The double entendres remind you of Andre 3K
Make you spin it back like a DJ
This track feeling like it's D-day
Fucking with P it might be D-day
My heroin lines like checking out at BJ's
Uh, yeah, uh-huh

Dumb It Down
Street nigga version of (C'mon, ugh)
Numb It Down (Ugh, let's go)

Way before my first mil'
Hustler's etiquette been instilled since a young'un
Been a rider since the Big Wheel
Count my dollars in big bills
You can't touch me, I'm sick like leprosy
I'm that ill
Check my legacy, catch me out in Beverly
Hills on Rodeo, with Ocean Drive checkin' for my J-Lo
The chain like a pot of gold
I pied piper them hoes, follow the rainbow
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, we hustle hard
Re-up gang CEO, must be a god
From no business, to 50-50 deals
Joint ventures got the fans screaming "Clipse, we missed you"
So I could never diss you
Download or not, nothing stops Malice from ordering a drop
Nothing stops Malice from driving off the lot
The eyes on high, the water's boiling in the pot

Numb it down (uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Numb it down
Big shout out to Curren$y
Repping those Play Cloths hard
You know
My nigga Wale, what up
Sound like some morphine shit right here
Numb it down
Fade that shit out, uh
Yuugh!
