You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
'Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup
