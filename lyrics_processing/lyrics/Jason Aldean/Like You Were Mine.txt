I blew right past that city limit sign
Into that little town we used to own
The co-op and the quick stop were all boarded up
And those yellow lines faded on the road

Man I swear I can still hear you singing
Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
You're everywhere we used to go

I still look for your car
I still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown
I'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us
Keeps me up like we're still going down
Still feeling you like you never said goodbye
Like you were mine

Sometimes this take-me-back truck
Talks me into burning gas
Past your house
A little south where the gravel runs out
But it never brings you back

I still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown
I'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us
Keeps me up like we're still going down
Still feeling you like you never said goodbye
Baby, like you were mine

Oh yeah, still feels you're mine
Man I swear I can still hear you singing
Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
You're everywhere we used to go

Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
