I ain't gonna lie, girl
I know sometimes I can be crazy
But I can see it in your eyes
I'm the only guy that's driving you wild, so wild
Call it what you wanna but you know I wanna call you my lady
All this on and off and on again
And I wish you would make up your mind
'Cause it's time

And I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

I could keep your little red dress that you left on the floor, girl
Hang it in the closet 'cause I know you're gonna want it next time, next time
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl, or not anymore
