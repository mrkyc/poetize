I need a red
To smoke that long week straight out of my head
Until there's nothing left
A shot of patron
To kick this good time off
Get it going strong
Baby pour it on

Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust

Yeah, I need you baby, right there with me
Love that way you make me wanna lose it, go crazy
You know it gets me girl, when you dance like that
You know it kills me girl, with your hands like that
Thinking 'bout it, don't wanna go another minute without it

Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust
