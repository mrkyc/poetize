You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away

But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

Something about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

Something about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

Something about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby
You look good at party
Good at the bar
Something bout underneath these stars
You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're looking so good anywhere you are
Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
