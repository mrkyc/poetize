Little Jimmy Jackson is jackinl up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road
You know, you know

Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
