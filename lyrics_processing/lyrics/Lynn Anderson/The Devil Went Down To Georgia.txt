Well the Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was way behind and he was in a bind and he was looking to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what."
"I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare, well I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."
Now the boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

Well the Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up that bow
And he dragged the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, that's pretty good ol' son
But just sit down there in that easy chair and let me show you how it's done, you bloody fu-"

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no


Well the Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
And he said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
And I've told you once, you son of a gun, I'm the best there's ever been."

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
