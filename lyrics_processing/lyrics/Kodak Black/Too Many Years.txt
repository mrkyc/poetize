I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
'Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I told my mama we gon' be fine
So I'm up all night way after sleep time
I'm just thinkin' 'bout Lil Kuda, gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga behind
No daddy, so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I'ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin' all night, I'm going senile
With two niggas toting three four-fives
I seen a nigga play gangster, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I'm on XXL, I'm in New York now

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I keep thinkin' 'bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
Why we keep on falling victim?
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers, love my sister
Damn, I miss my lil' one
I know sometimes I be trippin'
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I'm too street for the industry
But I think that's where I need to be
'Cause verbally, mentally, and physically, I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smokin' one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But low-key, they be easin' me
You bitches don't mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin posted on the street, gon' call it Sesame
1K 'til the death of me, don't put your life in jeopardy
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
