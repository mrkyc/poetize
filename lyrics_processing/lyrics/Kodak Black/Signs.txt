I asked the Lord to send me a sign
I thought that I was blind
'Cause I ain't ever see the sign but the sign showed after time
And when I finally realized, it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign
So I got up and went out on my grind
'Cause I used to cry 'cause ain't no food in the house
Seein' all the older niggas, man, they used to shine
Used to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine (Mm-mm)
Hypnotized, I was just nine
Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed time, the years flew by
'Til I got old enough to run up on you with the .9
The light man, we became friends
I see him so much, he cuttin' off the light again? (Mm-mm)
I know his name, co-workers and his kid
He ain't comin' in the work truck, he comin' in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down
Take yo' shit and make 'em cry
Mama got robbed in July, I watched her cry
So I don't care about yours 'cause they ain't care about mine
But look at me now, they told me, "Settle down"
PBL charges got me waiting on trial (Mm-mm)
Oh, so you know now?
The sign read "Never know until you find out"
The things I found out
But they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if you broke
'Cause if you're broke, they treat you like a bad joke
They don't even wanna laugh wit' you
When you shittin' on 'em, you can make 'em do anything
They'll even wipe your ass for you
In this world full of fame and pretty girls
It can make your mind swirl
But you just gotta think, the devil, he gon' play
Get in your brain, have you runnin' in them banks
But now, I just want the world to scream my name
Don't even club, I'm the reason why they came (Mm-mm)
Takin' people shit, I'm the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses, goin' crazy 'bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
It's deep, the sign, I couldn't see
Man, look at me now, I'm gettin' weak
Damn, look at me now, I can't sleep
Oh, look at your boy, I can't eat
I'on think, ain't never think
All for some money, I might blow it all in a week (Mm-mm)
But it's Kodak, you niggas know that
I'm 'bout whatever and I'll hit a nigga like a road rat
But fuck that, right now, I'm chilling
Slow money 'cause fast money will get me sentenced
I was in it, they say I'm a menace
Say I'm sleepin', and when I wake up I'll be in prison (mm-mm)
I'm chilling, this how I'm feeling
Give me a deal, give me mill' so I'm finished
Forget it, I'm still willing
To mask up and hit yo' granny for a penny
They say I'm stupid, say I'm foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school, everybody on the campus
I did it so I'm ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga, do I know you?
They hate lil' Kolyon, so paranoid, might have to blow you
Fuck a friend, family too, I'on know you
Bastard child, hey daddy, I'on know you (Mm-mm)
You might also like
Mm-mm (Mm-mm), mm-mm
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain (Mm-mm)
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
