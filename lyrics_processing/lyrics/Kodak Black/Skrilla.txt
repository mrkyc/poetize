Rrrah, rrrah, uh
Sniper Gang, 1800

In the club boppin' with my niggas (Kodak bop)
All of us rockin' on 'em jiggas (On them Mollys)
You ain't talking money, I don't hear ya (Shhh, I don't hear ya)
You ain't gotta touch me, I don't feel ya (Nigga, I don't feel ya)
That skrilla, that skrilla, boy, I'm 'bout my skrilla (I'm 'bout my skrilla)
All my niggas monkeys, we gorillas (We gorillas)
All my niggas clutchin', we some hittas (Hittas)
Birds on my timeline, call it Twitter (Tweet, tweet, tweet)

We ain't fuckin' with you niggas (Uh-uh)

I'm comin' through, me and all my boys smokin' loud
I ain't hearin' you, Kodak bring the noise
Every year, Christmas day, I ain't wanna play with toys
Project baby, came from Hot Wheels to ridin' in a foreign
And my diamonds come from Tokyo, yoin, yoin, yoin
Power high come from Tokyo, I call 'em ching choing
Money grow on trees, can you show me where they grew that, bitch?
You could have a fine-ass girl, you'll switch-a-roo that bitch
Boy, you know that, it's Lil Kodak, you already knew that shit
I'm bout my cheese, cheddar chip, that codeine my medicine
From the Noya, 1800 block, yeah, I represent
I got lots of guap, thats why I'm arrogant (Ten toes down)

I'm pullin' up on yo ass, you owe me somethin'
Early mornin', ridin' round, gettin' that money
I ask them for a plate, they left me hungry
So I'm out here wildin' out with my youngins
I need that skrilla, this lil' nigga love that fetti
I be smokin' broccoli, mama told me eat my veggies
Polo down, got me in here flexin', call me Ralph Lauren
I was in the projects stressin', I was still riding foreign
And I wrapped my wrist with VVS, and now I'm in here pourin'
You know the kid finessin', he's a savage young boy
I took so much of losses, man, it's sad (That's so sad)
My mama used to dig all in my stash (In my stash)
