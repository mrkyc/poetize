Cause I got it by myself
Skrrt, skrrt, ayy, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt, skrrt)
Free lil' Kodak man, free lil' tap boy, yee

Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (Ayy, ayy)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?

Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (Ayy, ayy)

I'm from the No, my lil' bitch from the Dale
I like my money fast, you movin' like a snail
All I smoke is L's, on that paper trail
Can't you tell? I got clientele on my Nextel
I don't need your help, got it on my own
This a million dollar phone, but I ain't got no ring tone (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Kodak, why you keep that thing on you? (Ayy, ayy)
Cause I ain't got no time to play with you
All I do is win, I hate to lose

I'm smokin' broccoli, counting green
I'm on molly, I'm on lean (I put molly in my lean, nigga)
