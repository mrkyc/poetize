Yeah, Project Baby
These streets took my conscience (Project Baby)
(DY Krazy)
Glee
Sniper Gang
These streets took my conscience, ayy

Yeah, everybody with me on that same thang
I don't gang-bang but I bang-bang
I pull up to the club, I got on eight chains
Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things, she wanted to be my main

Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked, it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk, 150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang
Chris Johnson, I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth, he put a potato on a barrel
I kicked her dumbass out my crib, she say want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor-ass ho an Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starvin'
Monisha, Tamica, they vouchin'
Before I had anything, I was saucy
'Fore I had that Bentley truck, I was saucy
All these hitters, yeah, I pray you never cross me

She say she pregnant, I swear I think I wanna off her
Eighteen hunnid, I got more stories than an author
I'm credit card swipin' at the Chase Bank (Ayy)
Me and Future gang, gang, same thang
I check your temperature, nigga, is you hot or cold?
Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash for gold
These streets made me lose my conscience, took a nigga soul

These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they fillin' up they nose
I know my lil' bitch got love for me
She just want everybody to know
I know my niggas, they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money, then they switch lanes
I ran it back up and then I switch lanes
In a brand new Range, diamond colored candy cane
I bought a brand new 'K and I can't wait to let it spray
I'm sorry, mom, I ain't mean to bring you through so much pain
I said, I'm sorry, mom, I ain't mean for it to be this way
Ayy, but fuck it, bitch, I'm here, I got diamond rings
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid

These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid
