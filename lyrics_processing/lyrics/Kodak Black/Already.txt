My name is Kodak but you know that already (My name Kodak)
I don't want the wap, baby, I just want the fetty (Boy, you know that)
Polo to the socks, homie, this ain't Perry Ellis (Perry Ellis)
Let me get the raw, I'ma ball like spaghetti (Like spaghetti)
It's getting hot in here, the block be hot, no not Nelly (No not Nelly)
You can keep the 'Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy (I bought Chevy)
I don't want no head, lately I've been getting becky (They give me beck)
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly (Keep that shit)

She walked up to me, I was by the bar, she like hello
She rolled up on me, I was rollin' up my cigarillo
No, I don't fuck with Grabba leaf, I'm breaking down the elpo
I'm always smoking loud, I can't keep it on the L-O
Girl, I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans, remember wearing Ecko
She say she just came to chill, look, bitch, this ain't a Getty
I told that bitch get outta here, act like you never met me
I'm up the road, I'm lurking for them books, no library
Lil' niggas state-to-state, I get more cake than lil' Debbie
No, I can't save a ho, I'm no neighborhood hero
Keep that shit 1K, I can't be fuckin' with a zero

Boy, I need that green, bought my green, no asparagus
Lord forgive me please, cut the money, I just cherished it
Hit a mean lick, I took that money and I buried it
She get on her knees, O-M-G, that's embarrassing
I don't need no record deal but you gon' hear my record still
Me and DJ on the pill, we spinning like a ferris wheel
Oh, that's Kodak Black, who they be talking 'bout, that's the nigga
First I had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar
Once that jit was old enough to thug it, he was thuggin'
He just found a strap now he clutch it like it's nothing
I use to pour fours, now I pour a whole dozen
Bumped into Lil Wally in the hood, hey, cousin
