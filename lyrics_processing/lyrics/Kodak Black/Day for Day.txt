You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block, boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free

Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, I had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga, locked up doin' day for day

They gave Lil' Marcus twenty-five, that's my man (Ayy)
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands (Ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen (Ayy)
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. (Ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police (Ayy)
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets (Ayy, ayy)
He gon' go to trial right there where he stands (Ayy)
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge (Ayy, ayy)

Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
