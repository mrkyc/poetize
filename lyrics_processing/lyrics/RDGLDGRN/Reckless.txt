Gone but mean no disrespect
Either way I just deflect
Let me 
Feelin' up on the screen, on the set
Actin' crazy on the chat
Lookin' everything I get
Take the law from my many places
No stress, don't give a fuck if you test it
On the road, hope you get the message
I ain't get it all for free
Label told me "Sell it"
Now I have fishes in the sea lookin' at the 
I'ma make a wave, all you chickens
I don't need to rate  all the women
Lookin' at the stage as I hang on the ceiling
Sit the bidding phase then I raid on the building
Tryna tell you that I'm reckless

Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Ain't nothing here can stop me
Ain't no telling where I'm headed
Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Zig-zagging through the freeway
Ain't no telling where I'm headed

Start 'em with the truth
Start with what everyone- everyone's thinkin'
Start there
Put some dope **** with it

Live with no fear
Ain't nothin' to it
Stage-diving billings when I should be bare shooting
Walk up to your headquarters strappin' to a bomb
Give a platinum record, I just want it for my mom
Money I don't need it like a college education
Living revolution, give a damn what you sayin'
Quoting Fight Club as I'm entering the Matrix
Industry corrupted by the greedy and impatient
Tryna tell you that I'm reckless

Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Ain't nothing here can stop me
Ain't no telling where I'm headed
Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Zig-zagging through the freeway
Ain't no telling where I'm headed

Tryna tell you that I'm reckless
Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Ain't nothing here can stop me
Ain't no telling where I'm headed
Out here being reckless
Can't stop me from being reckless
Zig-zagging through the freeway
