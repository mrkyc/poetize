Another day living in a nigga's shoes
My only path to fame is a jumper and a booth
They getting dumber as they do more interviews
And we're the ones who suffer
From their lessons and their cues, hey
I'm not a victim here of any human law
I'm proud of where I come from
There's no better place to start
And a bullet in my head and the fear in my heart
Even Jesus was afraid of being a god

Stranger, I don't know what I'm turning into (I don't know what I'm turning into)
Stranger, I can't be living with no excuse (I can't be living with no excuse)
Stranger, What if I'm never the same? (What if I'm never the same?)
Oh stranger, I'm letting go of my name (I'm letting go of my name)

You see them DC kids
They wear their hearts on they arm
They call their home the DMV
Cause they been waitin' so long
I see them strangers unite in need of a culture
Fighting for they dreams but they never getting closer
Show me anything creative like this go-go
That's like try'na meet Obama on the metro
Georgetown roads looking native to SoHo
Stay in Chinatown we belong in a dojo
Reston boy all I know is what they let me know
I'm Boston-born everybody here has other homes
I'm a stranger to myself and others
I wear a green shirt only picking up my color
Cause it's real life and my only ever option
Georgetown punk in the government office
I ain't ever hearing ya when you be talking
Armed exterior call me colossus
