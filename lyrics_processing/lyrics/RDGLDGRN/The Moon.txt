I feel like I'm the moon, not on the moon
Cause I been making waves every time I move
They be looking cool, they look be cool
But everything they do ain't nothing new

I feel like I'm the moon, not on the moon (Yeah)
Cause I been making waves every time I move (Yeah, yeah)
They be looking cool, they look be cool (That shit be cool)
But everything they do ain't nothing new

Cause I been making waves every time I move (Yeah, yeah)
They be looking cool, they look be cool (That shit be cool)
But everything they do ain't nothing new (Ain't nothing new)

I don't need your steez, I don't need your rep
We the new 'fugees, I'm the new Mos Def
I lyrically kill those who literally kill
I don't talk to A&Rs, I don't need they deals
Flow harder than my otter getting swallowed by Medusa
Steady getting Clinton when I'm sitting in an Uber
I am not the type to make a song about a shooter
I'm the type to go and steal yo princess, Koopa
