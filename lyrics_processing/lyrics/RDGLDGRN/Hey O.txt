Yeah
So I'm majoring in music, a minor here in broke
I'm sittin' through these lessons that I already know
Don't know when I'mma use this, the work is just for show
When I get out I will surely make some dough
Graduation comes and I'm lookin' for a job
Twelve months pass, yeah I'm livin' with my mom
And these private student loans costin' me a leg and arm
Now I'm stuck here working for a golden arch
I'm just a ringer
I'm just a ringer
American ringer
I'm just a ringer

Hey O
I know my presence is a day old
But I did everything you say, so
I want my office on a skateboard
I am an occupant of rail
I know my presence is a day old
But I did everything you say, so
I want my office on a skateboard
I am an occupant of rail

There's no way to go, man
HR, DC, it's my right to attend
I don't mean to offend
Your fight there has no end
You ain't got no options when they out there selling dope, man
Keep the students in a prison
Take the power back though
Influence of proven system lies and counter acts growth
Nothing learned is ever given
We should never ask so
If I ain't got a pot to piss I'm pissin' on your back 'cause

I'm just a ringer
I'm just a ringer
American ringer
I'm just a ringer
