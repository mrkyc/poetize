Chill at the crib we do this here all night
I'm a gentleman of intelligence
House is filled with leather-bound books and my
Flow can kill as well as my looks so I'm
Down for playing in any basement
I ain't got a girl but here's an application
I could conjure up any little situation
We could call your friends- open invitation
We could use the Netflix on my Playstation
Or my iPhone if you hate waiting
Aim to please, I never been a novice
I am Green, a mutant and an artist
We could share the shelter on my single bed
If you give it up and top it off with head
Ain't nothing that I ever wanna do instead
I'm chilling in the house with a group of friends
Ain't nothing that I ever wanna do instead
I'm being in my house with a group of friends
You know what I'm saying
True
Tell me that you love this party
I'm calling out to everybody
They say your friends are 
But we gonna have some fun
We gonna have some fun
You might also likeWe all sitting in my garage without a care
Playing spades all night, pull up a chair
Yeah, I'm feeling myself cause everybody's here
Cards on the main floor, Halo's up the stairs
Hear a knock on the door, it's a cold chick
Her name's Monica Moore, her body's so thick
She says she probably won't stay, but I know this
She turned off her phone as she walked in
She walks into the kitchen, says "I love your home"
Greets my friend with kisses, what a comfort zone
I just wanna chill mama, let's bill
Sit and talk about the world or your next thrill
So we talk about her school how she almost finished
Just a couple of years and she'll be a dentist
Told her I had a class, I was never in it
I was busy writing songs and being a menace
But I'm glad, cause this is where I am
Travelling the country with my whole band
She says "I have to confess I really love your music
Every chance I get, I YouTube it"
Tell me that you love this party
I'm calling out to everybody
They say your friends are 
But we gonna have some fun
