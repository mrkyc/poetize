Television and radio, inventions more than time
With no scenario, we all will be derived
Talk is here to dawn the future wedding day
Is real as the sun burning Earth away

Anything you want
Everything you are
Everyone you love won't last for long
But we can believe that it lasts forever
Anything you want (won't last for long)
Everything you are (won't last for long)
Everyone you love (won't last for long)
But we can believe that it lasts forever

I go hard like rainbow road
I'm Super Mario Kart 64
I'll show you forever if you with me so
Get on my level girl, tippy toes
Admire your taste and the way you laugh
The way that you talk and you wear no mask
Mama where you at, I'm not your son
But what I'm tryna say let's make us one
Is love forever? Of course it is
I show more love than an orphanage
Filled with underprivileged homeless kids
Getting adopted by the fortunate
But that's a long way just to say that this
Is more than a moment if you stay in it
'cause everything you see will soon erode
It's all built to last if you're not alone
You might also like
Anything you want
Everything you are
Everyone you love won't last for long
But we can believe that it lasts forever
Anything you want (won't last for long)
Everything you are (won't last for long)
Everyone you love (won't last for long)
But we can believe that it lasts forever

We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
If you believe that we'll last forever


Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)

We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
