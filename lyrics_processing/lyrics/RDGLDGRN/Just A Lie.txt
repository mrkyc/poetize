Yeah, alk about it for some decades
Twenty-three years, I've been working on the flow
Nigga, I've been making beats since Netscape
Last year all my frickin' dreams came true, but look at that
 boy in my phantom
Jewels on his neck, yeah, thought that I would get 'em
Never really thought about the problems that I deal with
Now I'm getting caught yeah I'm all up in my feelings
Niggas in the band every year like tradition
But I write a song that will keep 'em out of prison
You don't understand, well, this is my position
I wanna make it big so I really make a difference
I ain't building churches, but I am on a mission
Sick and tired of working 'cause I am just too gifted
Am I just a fool for the dreams in my mind
Waking in the bedroom singing its a lie

Just like a missile floating through the sky
, just a hole inside
Like photosynthesis, you stole my lie
Took out the best of me and let it die
Your dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
My dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
My dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
Maybe you and I are just a lie

Who care about the righteous brother at a party
They all about Mali, before  Mali
Married to the music, the best is my dowry
Caught up to the , just  Mike Lowry
Any little  can never not wow me
So now I'm making music to make it up to county
Really love rap, but the song ain't about me
Made a video, now the majors wanna scout me
Signed a record deal, made a song with Pharrell
He went triple platinum, but our album didn't sell
Went out on the row when they put us on the shelf
Sold my only soul now, I'm working outta Hell
Tryna get a dollar, baby, can you tell?
I ain't got no money left, zero is my bank roll
I worked my dream at every single angle
So im doing something else cause it's a handful

Just like a missile floating through the sky
, just a hole inside
Like photosynthesis you stole my lie
Took out the best of me and let it die
Your dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
My dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
My dream's a lie, no, no, no lie
Maybe you and I are just a lie

Just like a missile floating through the sky
, just a hole inside
Like photosynthesis you stole my lie
Took out the best of me
And let it die
