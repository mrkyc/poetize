Now I live a good life
Livin' for the good times (Yeah)
I've been dreamin' 'bout the good life
But now I live that good life
This is what it look like
Don't have the words to say
Don't care if I'm broke today
'Cause everything good
I follow my path
The money's a look away
I don't be talkin', I'm boasting
I'm with my mans and we toasting
'Cause we got a movement in motion
From Denver to D.C to Oakland
I need a crib by the ocean
Been repping my color since '06
I still be skating and coastin'
'Cause I am a fan of the door necks
My girl got a booty that poke out
I write you a check and it won't bounce
I ain't got a thing to be mad 'bout
I hope that you see and you know now
I'm 'bout the-
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life, good life
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life
I'm 'bout the-
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life, good life
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life
You might also likeFell out of school, took a detour
Maybe I thought I could be more
Traveling need on a 3 cores
'Cause mine needs a hell of a resource
We can't be focused on wages
I just be turnin' my pages
Writin' down all of the stages
Of all of the goals I be makin'
We make a song in the basement
And turn it to all of these placements
I don't need credit for dope lines
I got the greatest of co-signs
Pushin' the feeling of Motown
Mixed with the Beatles in SoCal
All of you people just slowdown
And look at the sky 'cause we on now
I'm 'bout the-
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life, good life
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life
I'm 'bout the-
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life, good life
I've been dreaming 'bout the good life, good life
I've been dreamin' 'bout the good life
Now I live a good life
Livin' for the good times (Yeah)
I've been dreamin' 'bout the good life
But now I live that good life
This is what it look like (Yeah, yeah)
