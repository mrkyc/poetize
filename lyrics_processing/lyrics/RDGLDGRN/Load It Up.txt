Movin' with a purpose
Never feelin' nervous
Tell you all the love that they be gettin' in the survey
Feelin' like a genius
I am not conceited
If I don't think these things about myself, who will believe me?
Jumpin' at the gym like I never saw the ceiling
Flow so sick, think I need some penicillin
If I'm rappin' then they feel it from the trappers to the children
No Smalls in this zumba class say they fuckin' wit it but I'm chill
My label got a Rockefeller feel
'Cause we never really focused on the mill
Focused on the art we throwin' up
Then we waitin' for the comments, load it up

Load it up
Load it up (Load it up)
Pass anything to me just throw it up (Throw it up)
Borrowin' everything that's ever meant for us (Hell yeah)
I got a bag full of pins, load it up (Load it up)

Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now

Movin' with a purpose
Workin' till it's worth it
Everybody know me but they only see the surface
Stylin' on 'em crazy, can never be the same
One thing they know my work before they even know my name
Been around the game for a minute now
There's only seventeen that started showin' now
You only see the hair when I'm goin' out
But the struggle in the head, they don't know about
But I'm chill
I always had a Rockefeller feel
Never really focused on the mill
Focus on the art we throwin' up
Then we waitin' for the comments, load it up

Load it up
Load it up (Load it up)
Pass anything to me just throw it up (Throw it up)
Borrowin' everything that's ever meant for us (Hell yeah)
I got a bag full of pins, load it up (Load it up)

Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
Gotta load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit now
Load it, gotta load it, gotta load that shit
