Against your society
School was propriety
Used to raise my hand but the teacher kept ignoring me
More concerned with the fifth level than the fifth grade
Street Fighter, Mario Kart, and Streets of Rage became the only place I learned to communicate
Now I'm all about these gold coins selling all these power ups
Surviving off of mushrooms and only trying to level up, yeah, heh
Now I walk in the malls and I appear honest
But they don't really know that my Metal Gear Solid
Hit "A" be a robber, hit "X", go to college
Points all the same as long as you beat the game
Life may suck but nothing stays the same
Deuced for life, flip a token, make a change
I'm deranged to people that see things the same
I see in full color, I just choose to be green

Hey, everything gets better
Whatever happened way back when, now it just don't matter
Hey, everything gets better
Whatever happened way back when, now it just don't matter

I'm feeling like a color everywhere I go
To find us somebody be bitching on my soul
Addicted to the form, possessed by the glow
Never see the road I'm already at my coe
I wish you were like me I wish you could know
And if you would like me you'd never be alone
Restricted by my pain pleasure comes in fortunes
Lonely are the brave who's heart is in the corset
I am just a portion of a living whole
That's why I devote this to every living soul
I don't need to brag 'cause I am in control
Of every single fiber and every little bone
You're just a biter, a copy, a drone
This is just an artpiece, you make the song
Need no opinion, I'm thinking on my own
Heck this is simple, revalulion
I'm gone
