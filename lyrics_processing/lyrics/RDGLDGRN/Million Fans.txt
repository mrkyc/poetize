Uh, crispy

Who can make a million fans off of one track
A backpackin' pop star with some skater pass
Girls love it when I sing, but I love to rap
They got their eyes on this money like they wear a patch
I don't tell 'em that I'm broke, where's the fun in that?
We at college, playing shows, get a ton of ass
Doomsday, I make songs for the culo
Girls ask me "what the hell they mad at you for?"
Same reason they was mad at menudo
I get girls, and rap nerds watch Naruto
These girls are pretty fast, no kissin'
Still can Magic Johnson if you only get some Clinton
Music's a dream, no pinchin'
Or it's back to workin' here with no pension

What's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Hey, what's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I makin' me a million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Hey, what's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I make a mega million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now
You might also like
I'm a color, not another Black Rob
Stack gold bars till they turn to Steve Jobs
I gotta make a million to make a difference
Hate if you want (True), long as you listen
Flow colder than convenience store refreshments
Head of my class on beatin' on a freshman
I use money, but I am not the next man
Attracted to this metal like I'm try'na kill an X-Man
Emo lyrics are feeding off depression
Caused by the last decade of recession
School loans are starting to be a bitch, so I just quit school
Now I'm starting to get rich, or
Die trying, turn into a giant
Here to add value to this music that I'm buyin'

What's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Hey, what's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I makin' me a million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Hey, what's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I make a mega million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now
If anything's good, there's a rare amount
So stop giving me songs that I don't care about
Not concerned with your past or your whereabouts
Never used to claim that I rap, so I'mma try it out
Flow something new, beats borrowed
And I can guarantee a million fans follow
An outcast with rage against machines
Transform art to slave for companies
Homeboy Green been pavin' out the dream
Since I hang from trees, so scrape my dungarees
You can't change the world from writing songs
But I have civil rights because of a microphone, and
Though a million ain't fittin' in my home
I'm makin' me a million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now?

What's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Hey, what's up now?
Hey lil' diddy, what's up now?
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I makin' me a million and I'm payin' what I owe
What's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Hey, what's up now
Hey lil diddy, what's up now
Yeah
A million fans ain't livin' in my home
But I make a mega million and I'm payin' what I owe
