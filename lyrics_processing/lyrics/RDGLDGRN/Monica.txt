Stargaze
This is what I do before I'm on-stage
Thinkin' 'bout Polaris in a star day
Head is in the clouds 'cause the ground pains
Everything I own's at a friend's home
Danger, I'm presuming's in the friend zone
Monica, we over 'cause I said so
Why you comin' to my show when I left you?
She came to my show then bounce
She coulda backed me up
Snuck in the green room now
Made love on a  couch
She came to my show then bounce
She coulda backed me up
She want me to hold her now
I told her I don't know how

I was your blessing
When you were in need
I was your protection
When you were asleep
But now
You do what you say
You do what you say
You do what you say

Kinda  that we had me leanin', huh
Type of love that I had me feelin', huh
She want me back, yeah she must be dreamin', huh
'Cause I ain't carin' about her feelings, huh
She took a swing as she struck my face
She yelled that "Fuck boy, you act so fake", uh
I grab her arms 
I tell her "What do you think has changed?"
We the same fools that was glued up
Messin' with each others friends when we 
Yeah, I'm way too proud to befool us
Just a one-night thing, that's the new us
Yeah, we used to be the one with the cool drugs
Graduated till I'm burning from a nuisance
Our reconciliation would be useless
'Cause looking back that  had it too much

I was your blessing
When you were in need
I was your protection
When you were asleep
But now
You do what you say
You do what you say
You do what you say
Once was a blessing, is cursing me now
I try to forget you but I don't know how
I've learned from my lessons, stop tearing me down

Yeah
Stargaze
This is what I do before I'm on-stage
Thinkin' 'bout Polaris in a star day
Head is in the clouds 'cause the ground pains, huh
In the back of the- back of the van
Monica's a trick 'cause she still tryna spaz
To the point where I'm holdin' her hands
But suddenly she cries 'cause she feels really bad
Everything you did I'ma do with myself
That's what happens when you do someone else
Told her that we finally should end it
And before I could finish the sentence
She move her hands right around my waist
Pause for a second, then grabs my face
"I'll settle for being friends, with all the benefits" is what she says
Even though I felt wrong for it
We made love right there in the van
Baby once again
