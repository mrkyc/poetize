Although the night is long, I know the day is coming
All of the things I own, they are of no importance
I got somewhere to be every single morning
I just might just lose my job, but today I'm staying home

I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta

Growing up bad kid
Pissin on my mattress
See, daddy worked, mama too
I'm being raised by cartoons
I play the game by myself
Drawing pictures of living well
But who'd have thought this entails
Me being in a living hell
I graduated, now I work
Went to school to fold shirts
No interviews, no concerts
No private jets, no Oscars
See every kid got a dream
How we lose that option?
See I'm a kid that had a dream
Not to work so I'm stopping now

I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta

Outta work top bid
Break up get lost in
My pesos my passion
Turn payin' bills to an option
See bill collectors call my phone
Writin' rhymes up in my home
Got student and family loans
I'm makin my mama broke
Not human not viltrumite
See Green is my archetype
No this ain't no artifice
You talk big, but I'm walking it
My passport got all the stamps
From all of France to Swaziland
See I'm a kid that had a dream
Not to work so I'm stopping, now

I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
Although the night is long, I know the day is coming
All of the things I own, they are of no importance
I got somewhere to be every single morning
I just might just lose my job but today I'm staying home

I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta

I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
(Today I say that we won't go)
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
(Today I say that we won't go)
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
(Today I say that we won't go)
I, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta go, I, I, I, I, ain't gotta
