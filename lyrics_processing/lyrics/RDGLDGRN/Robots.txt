She no seedy girl
Buy she wanna live out the lie
Mama don't want her leaving cause
The baby don't need to rock the boat
Mama you don't have to worry
You think everything new is scary
See that colour kid he ain't really afraid
He just wanna take her out tonight

Hey, why don't you think a little
Why don't you think a little
Just think a little

Just think a little more
Just think a little more
Just think a little more
Just think a little more

Mama say (?) been good
Don't you bring that boy in my home
There ain't no reason you to be seein
Anybody dark as coal
He probably got no occupation
Why the hell you even wanna date him
See that colour kid he ain't really afraid
He just wanna dig you out tonight

I told you that I know that we different
But there's something that's between us thats stickin
Its really stickin
Why we actin like there's something that's missin
Is it cause the way that we are conditioned, I'm thinking so
I dont know, but maybe we could reap the things that we sow
Plant a seed up in the minds of the people we know
Either way this little lady got my stomach in knots
It kind of sucks we were raised as robots

Daddy comes from a long day
The boyfriend's in the wrong place
The bedroom's where they congregate
Now the boy's gonna lose his life
Hey, why don't you think a little
Why don't you think a little
Just think a little

Just think a little more
Just think a little more
Just think a little more
