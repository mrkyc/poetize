Made it out to Cali, chillin' on my B-Day
See them color-pillars as I'm drivin' down the freeway
Shawty wanna call me up, tell me that she anxious
Got a new apartment but she ain't got no matress
So I catch the Uber out to NoHo, quickly
Movin' in this Prius it's a four door, swiftly
Only got an hour, something I forgot to mention
But when I'm comin' over recognize my true intentions
I'm comin' out to smash, lay it down flat
Sends me a smiley face I send it right back
A pic to make me salivate, a girl that's like that
Is one that holds you down, someone you could write back
No, I'm not a novice, I'm astonished you exist
I'mma try my hardest, I don't wanna ruin this
She opened up her door wearin' nothin' but a pin
And this be the night that I never wanna end

Can we make this a tradition?
Wanna put you on every time I see your face
If we can do this everyday, I will
I wanna do it everyday, do it everyday
Can we make this a tradition?
Wanna put you on every time I see your face
If we can do this everyday, I will
I wanna do it everyday, do it everyday

You make it hard for me to function, and that's in conjunction
With the fact that you are always down for doin' somethin'
While I beat it up, you be actin' so defenseless
Thinkin' bout the time I be spending with my exes
I ain't got no exes, barely even present
In my day to day, don't you worry 'bout me textin'
Born in '93, you a baby so you different
Always want control, but you should just accept that
I am on the road baby, tryna stack cheese
Looking for a soldier, and one that's at ease
You got me backflippin' off a flyin' trapeze, when I land on my knees
I'll be giving you a ring if we do it again

Can we make this a tradition?
Wanna put you on every time I see your face
If we can do this everyday, I will
I wanna do it everyday, do it everyday

I see that you are more than meets the eye
Transformin' in the middle of the night
Submitted to the things I wanna do
Got a question for you

Can we make this a tradition?
Wanna put you on every time I see your face
If we can do this everyday, I will
I wanna do it everyday, do it everyday
Can we make this a tradition?
Wanna put you on every time I see your face
If we can do this everyday, I will
I wanna do it everyday, do it everyday

Come on (Ay) Come on (Ah)
Let's get it (Ay) Let's get it (Ah)
Come on (Ay) Come on (Ah)
