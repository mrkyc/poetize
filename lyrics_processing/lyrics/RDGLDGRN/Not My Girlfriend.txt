Maybe I was cruel for the way I left
Broke into her heart, took it for a sink
The woman that I choose didn't have a chance
Only she was my boo, now I'm on the fence
No, I don't believe in a girlfriend
Never had a title but we weren't friends
I'm tryna get this money so the world spins
And this is how I act when I know am (So smooth)
Smoother than the brand new razor
All the homies tell me don't you save her
That I be actin' like a caped crusader
Goin' too hard like the first Tomb Raider
I respond "If you only knew Danger
You'd understand she's the one too, player"
In my soul it can just be us
On the planet so it must be love

Ay
Ain't nobody else
I'm all by myself
Thinkin' bout the way I move
Ay
I been blowin' up
I been beamin' up
Only thing I want is you

Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Be my wife now)
And be my life until the world ends? (Be my wife now)
Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Be my wife now)
And be my life until the world ends?

Meditated, I never had to debate it
I'm elevated by everything that she stated
I'm on the way to the crib, hopin' she waited
Now I made it and at the door I'm just thinkin'
Somethin' in me tellin' me to hold back
I tour 'cross the world, how you gon' ask
This woman just to deal with your whole past
Excuse me, you really mean your whole past
But things change
And finally I'm on the same page
I'm starin' at her door with more faith
She opens up the door and I say
My life is just an open allegory
Tomorrow I'll be in holy matrimony
You're excellent in every category
I know there ain't no other woman for me

Ay
Ain't nobody else
I'm all by myself
Thinkin' bout the way I move
Ay
I been blowin' up
I been beamin' up
Only thing I want is you
Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Be my wife now)
And be my life until the world ends? (Be my wife now)
Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Be my wife now)
And be my life until the world ends?

(Be my wife now)
(Be my wife now)
(Be my wife now)
(Be my wife now)

Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Wife and not my girlfriend)
And be my life until the world ends? (Life until the world ends)
Will you be my wife and not my girlfriend (Wife and not my girlfriend)
And be my life until the world ends? (Life until the world ends)

Be my wife now
Be my wife now
