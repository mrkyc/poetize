You see, I have a pain that's in my side
And it's coming from my pocket all the time
Catch me if you can, I'm messaging a friend
Before I even send, you say I'm out of line

You should do less, cause you're doing the most
You should do less, now, cause you're doing the most
You should do less

Is there something wrong with saying "Hi"? (Woah)
Cause you caught me sending artificial smiles (Woah)
Catch me if you can, I'm messaging a friend
Before I even send, you say I'm out of line

You should do less, cause you're doing the most
You should do less, now, cause you're doing the most

Okay, okay, I know you have a little story for Green
'bout how you need some more attention, it's annoying to me
Because you saying that you're cool, but you're sort of a geek
I see you study all these women that be calling on me
Okay now, this is how (?) be
I'm on my hands-free, trying to say hi to my mom, and you gettin' all antsy
Saying "Isn't that Francine? I saw you glancing
At these pictures on your phone, don't you act like it's family."
