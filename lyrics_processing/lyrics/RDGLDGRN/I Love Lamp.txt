It's just a day, a day, a terrible day
Things don't really seem like they are going my way
I got a girlfriend in Virginia, I'm in Californiay
She said "I know you probably cheatin', I got somethin' to say"
"I got a new guy" that's what she said
I never knew I'd feel like I'm dead
'Cause I lost my bottom lady for a one night stand
She said I thought that you should know that I don't wanna be friends

She said I don't wanna be your friend
She said I don't wanna be your friend
She said I don't wanna be your friend
Well baby, I don't ever want to see you again
(Hey)

Now little lady
Come on (Oh)
Come on (Oh)
(Yeah) Come on (Yeah) (Oh)
(Oh come on) Come on (Oh)

I send a text a dozen times but you don't read it no more
You always said what's on your mind so why don't you pick up your phone
I play the game, you changed the rules, is that the status you write?
I live in pain, you are my happiness, I post and reply
You see, know this your type, I cheat and know it ain't right
You want revenge with no forgiveness, butI don't think it's fair
I see you out with other niggas and I know you don't care
I just hope I still can get it since you won't be my friend, okay?
