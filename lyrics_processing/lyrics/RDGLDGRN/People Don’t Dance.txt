Give me the floor, let me introduce you
To all my sauce, yeah I got the juice, true
Turnin' a backyard into a dancehall
Girl, I ain't a rap star hangin' on back walls
They follow the bro code, lookin' like bozos
I'm groovin' bicoastal, Berlin to NoHo
Yah, hittin' the dance floor, letting my soul glow
Just put down the media, I'm tryna be social

I'm tryna hit the dance floor
But the people don't dance no more
I'm tryna hit the dance floor
But the people don't dance no more

I don't care
If they don't wanna move
People don't dance now
But I'm gon' dance with you
We right here
Ready to act a fool
People don't dance but
I'm bringin' it back with you
So let's get it

People they all gettin' busy faded, mhm
Gettin' involved must be underrated, lookit
Nobody's leavin' if you got a weave in
You sweatin' it out, gonna move till you sleepin'
Take a little rest groove again in the evening
Do a little dance, baby girl and repeat it
This is the way that we do
I'm just bumpin' and swayin'
Bumpin' swayin' with you

I'm tryna hit the dance floor
But the people don't dance no more
I'm tryna hit the dance floor
But the people don't dance no more

I don't care
If they don't wanna move
People don't dance now
But I'm gon' dance with you
We right here
Ready to act a fool
People don't dance but
I'm bringin' it back with you

I don't care
If they don't wanna move
People don't dance now
But I'm gon' dance with you
We right here
Ready to act a fool
