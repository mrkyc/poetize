Hear the click clack that's a clapback
Hear the click clack that's a clapback
Hear the click clack that's a clapback
Hear the click clack

Clappin' back at the blogs
Bought a jag with my bars
Got a passion for art
More everlastin' than Bart
Barely visit my mom
I travel more than LeBron
You purchase Porsches n' prawns
I'm sellin' sources of songs
I'll rap and flatten your ego
And put you back in the fetal
My passion's passin' you negros
That mastered matching the Migos
We goin' after the Eagles
Prince, Michael Jackson and Beatles
So if you blastin' at me
I'm clappin' back at you people

Hear the click clack that's a clapback
Hear the click clack that's a clapback
That's a clapback
That's a clapback
That's a clapback
That's a clapback

My brown mother says she really loves the way I get
A crowd jumpin'
Like the plumber tryna break a brick
I found somethin'
Now these labels tryna pay for it
My sounds bumpin'
And the people demonstrate to it
Passive as a pastor is
And more then just an activist
I'll sleep and make a massive hit
I'm winning off an accident
Learned from those who mastered this
I fortified and plastered it
They built a wall to block me out
And now I'm clappin' back at it
