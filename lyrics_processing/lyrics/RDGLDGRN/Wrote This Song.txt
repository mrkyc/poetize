I wrote this song
So we can be together
Won't change the world forever
But I know I'll change you with this song
To tell you how I'm feeling
I'm looking toward the ceiling
Tryna lift you up without my arms
So we can be together
Won't change the world forever
But I know I'll change you with this song
To tell you how I'm feeling
I'm looking toward the ceiling
Tryna lift you up with just a song
Tryna lift you up with just a song
Tryna lift you up with just a song

I can't strengthen economies
Or make sure the water that we drink is clean
Can't stop fights in the Middle East
Can never make sure that the whole world eats
Military unit will never retreat
Chicago crews gonna still have beef
Palestinians and the Israel kids
Gonna stay fighting for the Gaza strip
I could put my words all together like this
The words that I say just won't change shit
Hospital rooms still gonna have patients
Blacks in the womb still gonna deal with racists
Ain't no bomb did I ever defuse
Doing no harm that terrorists choose
Only thing that I know I can do
Is write this song that's gonna change you
You might also like

So we can be together
Won't change the world forever
But I know I'll change you with this song
To tell you how I'm feeling

Tryna lift you up without my arms
So we can be together
Won't change the world forever
But I know I'll change you with this song
To tell you how I'm feeling
I'm looking toward the ceiling
Tryna lift you up with just a song
Tryna lift you up with just a song
Tryna lift you up with just a song

Just to lift you up (Lift up)

Wanna lift you up (Lift up)
I want to lift you up (Lift up)
Lift you up (Lift up)
Lift you up (Lift up)
Wanna lift you up (Lift up)
Lift up with just a song
Tryna lift you up with just a song
