You
Need to get like me (Hey)
Forget about the world
And it's tragedies
You
Need to get like me (Hey)
Working's only hard
When it ain't what you need

And I don't get stressed out, stressed out
'cause this is how I break down, break down
I don't get stressed out, stressed out
'cause this is how I break down, break down
Pick it up

Up up and down, let's see some elevators
Break up and down, let's see some elevators
Up up and down, let's see some elevators
Break up and down, let's see some elevators
Up up and down, let's see some elevators
Break up and down, let's see some elevators
Up up and down, let's see some elevators
Break up and down, let's see some elevators
(Up up and down, break up and down
Up up and down, break up and down)

Oh, gettin' it, gettin' it down
Reppin' retreiving these rounds
Mama you feelin' my style
That's cause you're gettin' in now
I'm gettin' butter with all my color brothers
I'm tryna be on the cover of every magazine ever
You try to do it but homie we do it better
Take guitars, 808s, and mix 'em in all together
Vini mal vini bon sa pa sote kem
Elevatin' everybody with the creole slang, mang

And I don't get stressed out, stressed out
'cause this is how I break down, break down
I don't get stressed out, stressed out
'cause this is how I break down, break down
Pick it up
