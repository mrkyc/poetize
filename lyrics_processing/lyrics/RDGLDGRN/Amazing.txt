I'm feelin' good, feelin' amazing
I seen my life go through some changin'
My mama told me don't you stop it
Just keep on goin' till you poppin'
I'm feelin' good, feelin' amazing
I see my life go through some changin'
My mama told me don't you stop it
Just keep on goin' till you poppin'

Underground like Leonardo
Rep my state like Petey Pablo
Seventeen and I was on some dumb shit
Me and my homies broke into a Lexus
Just livin' too fast
Drivin' the whip and they crash
Into a ditch so they ran
But ended up caught by the feds
I'm telling you all of my friends
Did about seven or ten
My homie had drugs in his hand
And ended up shot in the head
Lennon could never imagine
All of the things that have happened
Could've been me with the casket
Could've been me with the ratchet
Mama she gave me the assets
To follow my goals with a passion
I drive to her house and I'm asking
"How you feel good through the bad shit?"

Pull up our pull-up to mama's
Talkin' to mama's subconscious
We talk as I'm cleaning the saucers
I say I got ninety-nine problems
Two of them women, I'm nauseous
Danger no longer an option
Monica left for my partner
And then we had sex at my concert
Plus there was felony drama
I got held up by the coppers
Almost got caught with the llamas
Luckily I wasn't locked up
She tell me stop chasin' the boppers
And all of my homies ain't partners
The friends that we keepin' can stop us
When we try to reach to be prosperous
She tells me to chill, the things that I want
Will certainly come to me, come to me
Part of my permanent recipe
Focus on workin' eventually
All that I work toward my destiny
Only one thing you should get from me
Don't focus on all o' your obstacles
Stick to your goal till you poppin' dough
I'm feelin' good, feelin' amazing
I see my life go through some changin'
My mama told me don't you stop it
Just keep on goin' till you poppin'
I'm feelin' good, feelin' amazing
I see my life go through some changin'
My mama told me don't you stop it
Just keep on goin' till you poppin'

Just keep on goin'till you poppin'
Just keep on goin' till you poppin'
