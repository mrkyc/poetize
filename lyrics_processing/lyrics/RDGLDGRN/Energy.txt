I really need your energy
Really need someone like you
Always been a friend to me
With everything I ever been through
I really need your-

Energy
I need you plugging into my memory
Can you charge me up like a battery
So the power that you give lasts a century?
I really need a purpose, yuh
Something that I know I could do
I really need a person, yuh
Lately I just really need you

Always been a friend to me

Now I just want your magic
Presence of your action
Something I can feel, yuh
Something everlasting
Curry with the tre ball
Serena with the backspin
No we ain't connected but your energy be lasting
Music was a passion
Put you onto go-go
Listened to my album
Told me it was so-so
Wish you had a GoPro
So I could see where souls go
I just want your energy, can heaven send a boatload?
