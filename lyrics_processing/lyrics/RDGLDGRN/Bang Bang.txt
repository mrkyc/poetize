Our voted president is sweet
There is no stopping all this heat
Government is selling weed, it's so cray
How can you give us anything
When we have nowhere to live
There's no way that you can spin, there's no blame
Our house is buried under blocks
From these quakes and aftershocks
Making dimes and eating slop with no faith
In any other type of way
For my life to make a change
I think I'm ending it today, bang bang

Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Rest your little heart here for a while
Bang Bang
Bang Ba-ang
Rest your little heart here for a while

Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang ba-ang
Rest your little heart here for a while

We got more swag up in our thumbs
Than you hooligans and bums
Stand and fight we never run, it's okay
In your favela or your hood
Homie you can get it good
They wanna talk we wish they would, there's no way
For you to see what's going on
Holding bricks like they were stock
Turning tricks here for a (?) we don't play
Up on the street or on the block
Hustle right in front of cops
Won't hesitate to pull the gun, bang bang

Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Rest your little heart here for a while
Bang Bang
Bang Ba-ang
Rest your little heart here for a while

Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang ba-ang
Rest your little heart here for a while
From the softest limbs that you can feel
The smile of the morning still
That rests upon your thighs and chest
To keep you warm so your heart can rest
It's the softest limbs that you can feel
The smile of the morning still
That rests upon your thighs and chest
To keep you warm so your heart can rest

Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang ba-ang
Rest your little heart here for a while
Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang bang
Rest your little heart here, bang ba-ang
