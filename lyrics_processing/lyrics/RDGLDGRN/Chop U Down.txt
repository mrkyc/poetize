Right away
My intentions are to slide away
To a private place that I arranged
Where me and you can work it out
Know one thing
I didn't never drink or smoke a thing
You acting petrified if you're a tree
I know this axe will chop you down

I'll chop you down
And there's no place that you could go
I'll chop you down
I'll cut you up, I'll make you go
I'll chop you down
I know I'm getting through your head
I'll chop you down
Keep me around
I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down

Hey ma, what you waitin' on?
I got a whole day to be layin' up
Oh no can't do this at my crib
'cause if I get caught that's some shit
You say that it ain't even like that
Let's see where you at when the night ends
If you got a man I don't like him
'cause he got here first like the vikings
No I ain't a doctor but I know what you need
Little bit of love and some Vitamin D
My thang swing like Spider-Man, weave
In and out of buildings in the NYC
I'm a street rat tryna get that cheese
Don't try to fake on Prince Ali
Fit and thick like 
Follow you home as I follow my dreams
You might also like
I'll chop you down
And there's no place that you could go
I'll chop you down
I'll cut you up, I'll make you go
I'll chop you down
I know I'm getting through your head
I'll chop you down
Keep me around
I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down

Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
And I'll chop, I'll chop you down
Keep me, keep me around
