'98, '98, livin' with my mom
Chubby lil' brother tryna grow up and play ball
Never thought that I would make it so much spittin' bars
In the Netherlands and I'm sweatin' out my drawers
Front row chickens all up on my nutsack
Bus call late and I cannot even bust that
That be the life though
Am I livin' right yo
Dollar in my pocket and I'm eatin' off my mic, ho
OK, this is the only single difference from a rapper now and the way that I was risen
Do it for the money and I do it for the love
Give a damn about you if you ain't a chick with dump
East coast music, gotta mix it up
With a little south cause you know the got that bump
The bass down low and the guitars up
And this be the sound of some Georgetown punks
Let you hear it right now

Right now, now
Who is that child
Walkin' around with such style
All them little girls gonna say I stunt
But I just actin' like where the hell I'm from
Let me tell you right now, now
Who is that child
Walkin' around with such style
All them little girls gonna say I stunt
But I just actin' like where the hell I'm from

P-P-Punk ass brother get it twisted
I'm a get you movin' while you go and start your bitchin'
Tribal drum and spittin', yellin' over singin'
Care about a critic? All I care about is feelin'
Old school brain when I'm spittin' out my rhymes
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Serve a little rock but I'm doin' no crimes
Cook it at the spot, then I push it out live
I'm a grown ass color doin' grown ass shit
You follow other brothers like a little ass bitch
I'm tryna push it forward so I kill it, that's it
I know that you can feel it cause you hear the passion
All up in my voice simply just annoyed
Everything that's pure about the game has been destroyed
Maybe we can change it now, holla at ya boy
Three whole colors and we're here to make some noise
Right now, now
Who is that child
Walkin' around with such style
All them little girls gonna say I stunt
But I just actin' like where the hell I'm from
Let me tell you right now, now
Who is that child
Walkin' around with such style
All them little girls gonna say I stunt
But I just actin' like where the hell I'm from
