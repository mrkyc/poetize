Packed my bags and kissed your cheek
Turned around so I didn't see you cry, you cry
Sometimes you just can't explain
The reasons why you have to say goodbye, goodbye

It took something, it took falling
It took distance, it took time
It took a lot of getting lost to realize

I was already home, right where I was supposed to be
You were right in front of me, I was not alone
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see
The one thing that you really need has been there all along
It took leaving you to know, I was already home

It took a long long road to see
What matters most in life to me was gone, was gone
But I thought what I was looking for
Was right here waiting at your door
I was wrong, so wrong

It took stumbling, it took falling
It took distance, it took time
It took a lot of getting lost to realize
You might also like
I was already home, right where I was supposed to be
You were right in front of me, I was not alone
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see
The one thing that you really need has been there all along
It took leaving you to know

I was so caught up in the thrill of something different, something new
It took a lot of missing you to see the truth

I was already home, right where I was supposed to be
You were right in front of me, I was not alone
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see
The one thing that you really need has been there all along
It took leaving you to know (it took leaving you to know)

I was already home
