We got highs, we got lows
Life is full of circles, that's the way it goes
Like merry-go-round, round, round, round
It goes round, round, round, round
But I got you, and you got trees
Even if it ain't forever, that's okay with me
'Cause I got you right now, now, now, now
Maybe I'll keep you around, round, round, round
Promise that I'll love you till the music stops
Everybody knows that you're the melody now to my heart

Sometimes we turn it down (Down, down)
Sometimes we play it way too loud (Too loud)
But you're the needle to my record, babe (Babe)
So kiss me while this record plays (Plays)

So when you hear this on the radio
And it turns out to be your favorite song, yeah
Hope it reminds you when they put it on
That our love is classic like vinyl
So when you're headed to the record store
And they ask you what you're lookin' for
You'd better tell 'em I'm the one you want
'Cause our love is timeless like vinyl
You might also like
So let the beat play, cuttin' just like a DJ
Like Thriller from MJ or some Marvin Gaye
You know, know, know, know
That watch will never get old, old, old, old
Promise that I'll love you till the music stops
Everybody knows that you're the melody now to my heart

Sometimes we turn it down (Down, down)
Sometimes we play it way too loud (Too loud)
But you're the needle to my record, babe (Babe)
So kiss me while this record plays (Plays)

So when you hear this on the radio
And it turns out to be your favorite song, yeah
Hope it reminds you when they put it on
That our love is classic like vinyl
So when you're headed to the record store
And they ask you what you're lookin' for
You'd better tell 'em I'm the one you want
