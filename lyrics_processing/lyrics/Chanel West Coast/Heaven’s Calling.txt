When you talkin' 'bout me, be specific
I wasn't born rich, I really had to go and get it
My city real but what's fake is the people in it
I push limits from start to finish
No gimmicks, I handle bidness
And no, you'll never find another better than me
Cut 'em off, might be a loss, but it's better for me
Bossed up, now I'm a boss, I ain't need a degree
You was blind, wishin' you saw what they was seein' in me
But you had your chance, you late now
Was hopin' that I stayed down
Came a long way now, I get it why you hate now
Before you go and lay down, you really need to pray now
Or stay outside the gate, it could happen any day now

Heaven is calling, you need the answer
Roll up your sleeves and go on, lift your pants up
Deep inside that water, just keep moving forward
Blessings keep calling, it's right around the corner
Let the kids sing (Let the kids sing), just let the kids sing (Just let the kids sing)
Let the kids sing (Let the kids sing), just let the kids sing (Just let the kids sing)
You gotta listen when the kids sing

Rather be different than the same
That's why I rarely show my face and they still know my name
I seized every opportunity before it came
And I been pushin' family boundaries before the fame
Don't hate me, just hate the game
You should pay attention and stop beggin' for that typa tension
You too worried 'bout your likes and all your mentions
Get on a mission, where your faith? It's gone missin'
You lack vision, that's why I'm socially distant
I don't get how y'all don't see the bigger picture
You stalk Twitter when the plot is just gettin' thicker
The new figures turnin' into the bullshitters
I take that back, negativity I got rid of
You might also like
Heaven is calling, you need the answer
Roll up your sleeves and go on, lift your pants up
Deep inside that water, just keep moving forward
Blessings keep calling, it's right around the corner
Let the kids sing (Let the kids sing), just let the kids sing (Just let the kids sing)
Let the kids sing (Let the kids sing), just let the kids sing (Just let the kids sing)
