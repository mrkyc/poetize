I be hoppin' out my car, did you notice?
Poppin' bottles at the bar, did you notice?
Motherfucker, I'm a star, did you notice?
Oh, did you notice? Did you notice?
I be reppin' for my hood, did you notice?
All my girls lookin' good, did you notice?
Puffin' on a backwood, did you notice?
Oh, did you notice? Did you notice?

Pool house, fuck y'all
New blouse, fuck y'all
Too loud, fuck y'all
Still down, fuck y'all
Rock snapbacks and Louis bags
Givenchy, who want it?
Your throwbacks get no likes
Cause homie, you ugly
Be up in the damn club
These whack chicks be muggin'
I might spend 300
I might spend 300
I'm the shit now, like a pooper scooper
My hips spinnin' round, like a hula hoop
Hit the weed now, feelin' super doop
Feelin' super doop, super doop

Come back, my next verse, I'm workin'
I'm 'bout these, bad bitches be twerkin'
I'm fine cause my new purse a Birkin
My new purse a Birkin, my new purse a Birkin
Speakin' of some cash, where the waiter at?
Need some drinks fast, where the waiter at?
Clubs tryna book me like a paper bag
Like a paper bag, paper bag

Go big, fuck home
You sit, go home
Stay drip, cyclone
Won't nap catch me sleepin', I stay sippin'
I got checks to earn and things to learn
These motherfuckers, they gon' learn
They wanna hate behind your back
Then next second, play your track
Fuck that love, hold them dubs
Drinkin' bub' 'til the sun come up
On the scene, they know let's see
I'm for my team, livin' the dream, yup

Hoppin' out my car, did you notice?
Bottles at the bar, did you notice?
Motherfucker, I'm a star, did you notice?
