I woke up today and chose violence
If you need to know my age, I'm timeless
I'm only looking at myself for the guidance
And maybe smoke a little loud in the silence

Help me find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way
Find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way

Eh, yeah
Can you blame me for bein' tired?
All of this bullshit that I been took in stride
Maybe I'm foolish for thinkin' this my time
Maybe I'm stupid for wantin' that good life
The good old limelight
So many days I was caught up in a haze
Took all of my sadness and wrote it on a page
Mixed up emotions through a mixtape
I thought I could kill the lows through the music that I made, eh

I gotta get ready for war if I'm ever gonna make it
These streets are painted gold, but it's overrated
To be honest, I forgot what I was celebratin'
Everything is never what it seems
If you got a dream, you gotta pay for it
You gotta be ready to love it and take the hate for it
Even when you lose your faith, you gotta pray for it
Time will slip away if you wait for it
Baby, don't wait for it

I woke up today and chose violence
If you need to know my age, I'm timeless
I'm only looking at myself for the guidance
And maybe smoke a little loud in the silence

Help me find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way
Find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way
Find my way
It's been a good life
Aimed for the top spot, and I got the spotlight
Been tryin' to take off, I took the long flight
Waitin' on my shot, I started a bar fight
But I'll be all right
Breakin' bottles, gettin' bruises
The industry, they want me actin' all clueless
They really took advantage of me, that was ruthless
Now they wanna treat me like a new sis
I just need somebody I can move wit'
I just need to follow what I feel inside my veins
Even when the road I'm walkin' turn into a maze
Sick of everybody always sayin' that I changed
I'm just goin' through a phase

I gotta get ready for war if I'm ever gonna make it
These streets are painted gold, but it's overrated
To be honest, I forgot what I was celebratin'
Everything is never what it seems

I woke up today and chose violence
If you need to know my age, I'm timeless
I'm only looking at myself for the guidance
And maybe smoke a little loud in the silence
Help me find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way
Find my way
Find my way
All I need's some time and space, I'll find my way
