Go to Balmain, YSL and cop a bag or two
But that shit won't close the hole that I've been burnin' through
Need to change these feelings now what should I do
Papa been rollin' with stones my whole life
Mama been home all day and out all night
Ooh, stuck in the middle of love and of hate (oh yeah)
Stuck in the middle of good not great (oh yeah)
Why do I keep chasin' dreams that don't chase me back
Why am I not happy with the place that I'm at
Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
Of finding my way
The sun is out but all I see is darkness around
Not lookin' in the mirror, just shadows on the ground
I'm reachin' out for someone, someone save me now
No final curtain, no I won't take a bow
Papa been rollin' with stones my whole life
Mama been home all day and out all night
Ooh, stuck in the middle of love and of hate (oh yeah)
Stuck in the middle of good not great (oh yeah)
Why do I keep chasin' dreams that don't chase me back
Why am I not happy with the place that I'm at
Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
Of finding my way
You might also likeI wish you could hear me now
Keep fallin' down
But I won't stop gettin' back up
I found a way to turn it round
On higher ground, I'm finding my way out now
Ooh, stuck in the middle of love and of hate (oh yeah)
Stuck in the middle of good not great (oh yeah)
Why do I keep chasin' dreams that don't chase me back
Why am I not happy with the place that I'm at
Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
