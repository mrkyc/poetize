I've lost the control
Addicted to the heat of the party
I just can't let go
So turn it up and turn me on
We gon' whine it up
When we hear that song
So hurry up, up
Feel it in my soul
I can't, I can't get enough 2x
Nothing else matters
But the music
DJ won't you gimme some more?
Nothing else matters
But the music
It's just me on the dancefloor
My heart is the rhythm
Anchored in your groove
In love with the feeling
Of how you make me move
So turn it up (turn it up)
And turn me on (turn me on)
We gon' whine it up (whine it up)
When we hear that song (hear that song)
So hurry up, up
Feel it in my soul
I can't, I can't get enough 2x
Nothing else matters
But the music (but the music)
DJ won't you gimme some more? (gimme some more)
Nothing else matters
But the music (but the music)
It's just me on the dancefloor
Under your spell (spell)
And I can't be free (free)
I just wanna dance (dance)
I just wanna dance dance
I can't get away (away)
Beat is gone in me
I just wanna dance (dance)
I just wanna dance dance 2x
The beats got my body
I've lost the control
Addicted to the heat of the party
I just can't let go
So turn it up (turn it up)
And turn me on (turn me on)
We gon' whine it up (whine it up)
When we hear that song (hear that song)
So hurry up, up
Feel it in my soul
I can't, I can't get enough 2x
Nothing else matters
But the music (but the music)
DJ won't you gimme some more? (gimme some more)
Nothing else matters
But the music (but the music)
It's just me on the dancefloor
Under your spell (spell)
And I can't be free (free)
I just wanna dance (dance)
I just wanna dance dance
I can't get away (away)
Beat is gone in me
I just wanna dance (dance)
