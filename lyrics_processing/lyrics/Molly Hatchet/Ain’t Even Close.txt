Well I've had my share of lovers
And I'm damn sure I had it all
If I had to count the times I've broken through
I couldn't even count 'em all
But now your telling folks you've got me
Into thinking that your the most
But if your planning on the future, honey
You ain't even close..nooo
I've learned to take the punches
And I've bet down on my chips
I've learned to shoot
Straight little darlin'
Straight from the hip
So baby save yourself some trouble
Putting your world in my hand
You know I'll never settle down
I'm just ain't that kind of man
Chorus:
No more, I've been stood up, knocked down
And had my time to boast
But if your thinkin' that you got this old boy
Honey, no you ain't even close
Oh no baby
You might also likeChorus:
No more, I've been stood up, knocked down
And had my time to boast
But if your thinkin' that you got this old boy
Honey, no you ain't even close
No you ain't even close
Oh see that light and feel the thunder, listen to it rain
You know the time
The time I wonder
If it's calling out my name
If I know anything about you baby
But this is what I've got to say
If I got to make the change with you
Then I have to be on my way
Chorus:
No more, I've been stood up, knocked down
And had my time to boast
But if your thinkin' that you got this old boy
Hell
I said no, I've been stood up, knocked down
And had my time to boast
But if your thinkin' that you got this old boy by the hammer, honey
No you ain't even close
No you ain't even close
No no no
You ain't even close
