I'm traveling down the road and I'm flirting with disaster
I got the pedal to the floor, my life is running faster
I'm out of money, out of hope, it looks like self destruction
Well, how much more can you take with all of this corruption?

We're flirtin' with disaster, ya'll know what I mean
And the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Yeah, I've tried to turn my head away
Feel about the same most every day
You know what I'm talking about

Speeding down the fast lane and honey we're playin' from town to town
The boys and I been burnin' it up, can't seem to slow it down
I got the pedal to the floor our lives are runnin' faster
We got our sights set straight ahead but I ain't sure what we're after
