Put the needle in the spoon
Hey sweet baby don't you say maybe
I know you'll need a fix real soon
Your eyes are lookin' glassy
You think you're real sassy
But you know your headed for your doom
You look a little older but you sure ain't no wiser
You're running for a stone-cold tomb
Chorus:
You've got to find out for yourself
You've got to learn it all on your own
All this messing around
Gonna put you in the ground
The needle leave you dead and gone
The needle leave you dead and gone
Start to feel the power
Hundred miles per hour
You're on the wrong side of the road
Your eyes are getting lighter
Your face is getting whiter
You're going to start feeling the load
Your hands a-start a-shaking
You'll feel your mind a-breaking
You'll wonder why it's getting so cold
Your body's feeling icy
That box will hold you nicely
You'd better say goodbye to your soul
You might also likeChorus:
You've got to find out for yourself
You've got to learn it all on your own
All this messing around
Gonna put you in the ground
The needle leave you dead and gone
The needle leave you dead and gone
Hey good lookin' what you, got cookin
Put the needle in the spoon
Hey sweet baby don't you say maybe
I know you'll need a fix real soon
Your eyes are lookin' glassy
You think you're real sassy
But you know your headed for your doom
You look a little older but you sure ain't no wiser
You're running for a stone-cold tomb
Chorus:
You've got to find out for yourself
You've got to learn it all on your own
All this messing around
Gonna put you in the ground
The needle leave you dead and gone
