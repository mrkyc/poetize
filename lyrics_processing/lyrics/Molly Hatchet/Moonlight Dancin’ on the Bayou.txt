A red silk scarf on her jet black hair with a smile and a gold capped tooth
She said her name was Mama Star, raised in New Orleans
Been around the world five times over, wish I would see half she's seen
Moonlight dancin' on the bayou
Say your prayers cause she gonna get inside you
She stooped down, cracked a vertical smile, fire came from her fingertips
With a Cheshire cat grin said what can I get you as she was licking her lips
I'd be a fool baby, if I didn't do the do
I couldn't forget it, I had to hit it, then I had to hit the bricks
Get on the next train out of town
Gotta get outta here fore the sun goes down
Gotta get outta here before she cast a spell
Save a lot of pennies for the wishing well
Get on the next train out of town
Gotta get outta here fore the sun goes down
Gotta get outta here before she cast a spell
Save a lot of pennies for the wishing well
The fire was burnin', my guts were turnin' as she swinged and danced around
A black cat crossed my path and then I got dizzy and I had to lay down
She took me round the corner baby, to a basement room
She stood in the doorway to block my path, I knew I had to get out of there soon

Moonlight dancin' on the bayou
Say your prayers cause she gonna get inside you
I hope she's doing well, yes I hope she's doing fine
My hair's grown back and I'm almost as tall as I was in ninety-nine
The woman has a power baby, from the darker side
I hope I never see her again, if I do, I'll just run and hide
