We Were Meant To Be Together
Girl We Met Such A Long Time Ago
But I Was Too Young And Scared To Let U Know
But Im Standin Right Here Right Now
Tellin You I Love You And I Ain't Gonna Back Down
In Your Life, It Has Changed But I Know
It Was A Mistake To Let You Go
The Situation Ain't The Same From The Phone
Girl Can't Be Nothin Better
Than You And Me Forever
Like Woodgrain And Leather
We Fit Good Together
We Are Good For Each Other
(But That Ain't All I Gotta Say Baby)
We Were Meant To Be Together
(Cuz We Were Meant To Be Together Lady)
We Are Good For Each Other
We Were Meant To Be Together
Girl The Old Sayin Is
"What You Love Let It Go
If It Comes Back Then It Was Yours
And If It Dont Then It Won't."
So Thats What I Did And
Girl You Came Back So
Now You're Mine That Feelin Thats Fine
Just Get Ready For My Love
Get Ready For My Touch
Cuz I Ain't Gone Never Let Nothin Come Between Us
Oh Baby Come And Be My Lady
And We Can Be Bonnie And Clide All Up In My Mercedes
