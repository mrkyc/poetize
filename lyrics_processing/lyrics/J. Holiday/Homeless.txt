She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs and steals and sells her body
Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But if it was you, what would you do?
If you didn't have a home
If you didn't have a pot to piss in, didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you
'Cause one day, yes you could be homeless
There's a man on the street
He got holes in his shoes on his feet
We be in the club spending doe
Then we'd come outside and tell him no
All he need is a couple bucks
He's got a little change but it's not enough
So we turn our backs and laugh or we stop in our tracks
And turn the other way 'cause we got it made
You might also likeSometimes he make 'em off
Just a little strong but he's on his own
But what about you, what would you do?
If you didn't have a home
If you didn't have a pot to piss in, didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you
'Cause one day, yes you could be homeless
A new day when I open my eyes
Got a black president but there's people outside
I know you've seen 'em and we all done passed 'em
Some people seen some shit last night, still got 'em laughin'
But it's not funny, it's all about money
And I bet you won't go put on them shoes
It's crazy because we're out clubbin', ain't worried 'bout nothing
