When I first saw your face, I knew that it was you
Some time has passed, and the feelings that I had before
Still are the same, cause you never changed, Noo
Even though, I don't show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I 'meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'mma love you forever, I fall for you deeper everyday
Feel it now girl more than ever, but with our type of love
Forever ain't enough
I've been searching my whole life, I'm lucky I found you
Now that I got you, you ain't leaving cause
Forever ain't enough
You see me, for who I am and not for who I'm not, No
I'm telling you that I'm sorry,if I tend to treat you the wrong way But I care you know my heart is there
Even though, I don't show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I 'meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'mma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday, feel it now girl more than ever
But with our type of love, Forever ain't enough
You might also likeI've been searching my whole life
I'm lucky I found you
Now that I got you, you ain't leaving
Forever ain't enough, Forever ain't enough
Forever ain't enough,Forever ain't enough
It ain't enough
Even though, I don't show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I 'meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'mma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday, feel it now girl more than ever
But with our type of love, Forever ain't enough
