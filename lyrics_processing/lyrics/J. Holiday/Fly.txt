Fly, ooh (Fly, fly, fly)
Oh, oh, ah

I know people change, but I hate we've changed
And it's killing me just trying to figure out where we are
'Cause it ain't the same
Girl, I'll take the blame
And I'm willing to take this chance if you feel we've traveled too far

Lord knows I wanna keep ya (Yeah)
Life without you I just can't see it (Oh yeah)
But sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me
'Cause I do believe
If I let you fly and you fly back, then it was meant to be
So fly (Fly), fly (Fly), fly (Fly, oh, oh, oh)

It was only me, taking flights overseas
But now it's you 'cause they finally realized you're a star
We're never in the same place at the same time
Now we don't feel the same way, I wanna rewind
Take it back to where things made sense
I think we've flown to far
You might also like
Lord knows I wanna keep ya (Yeah)
Life without you, damn, I just can't see it (Oh yeah)
Sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be
(Be, yeah, oh-oh, fly)

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me
(I'ma pray you come back to me)
'Cause I do believe ('Cause I believe, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I let you fly and you fly back, then it was meant to be
(Then it was meant to be, yeah)
So fly, fly, fly, fly (I'ma let you fly, oh-oh)

(Fly) Fly, fly (Fly)
And all I know to let you do is to let you
(Fly) Fly, (Fly) fly (Fly)
Hey, I wanna fly with you
(Fly) I know you (Fly)
I know you gotta see what you gotta see, yeah
(Fly), Fly, (Fly), fly, (Fly)
And I hope you fly back to me if I let ya

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me
(And I'ma pray you come back to me, oh-oh)
'Cause I do believe
If I let you fly and you fly back (And if you fly back)
Then it was meant to be (Then it was meant to be, oh)
So fly (It was meant to be, yeah), fly, fly, fly
So I'ma let you fly
(Fly), fly, (Fly), fly
And all I know to let you do is to let you
(Fly), fly, (Fly), fly, (Fly)
Hey, I wanna fly with you

I know you gotta see what you gotta see, yeah
