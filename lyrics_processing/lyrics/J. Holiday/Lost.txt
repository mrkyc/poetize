Lost
In the mirror see a stranger
I know she ain't the same, said love will never change me
My heart's wondering, I'm hopeless, faraway from home
Caught up in a maze I don't know which way to go
You got me so lost and I can't lie
I know where it is and I know my heart will never stop beating
But somehow you got it gone

Somebody give me a map
Think I need directions to navigate love
I think that I'm lost oh
You sent me on a trip
Baby now I can't find the right road
But I'm happy to be lost in you
All I see is you cuz I'm lost, lost
And I'm so confused cuz I'm lost, lost
Tryna find my way cuz I'm lost, lost
Now you got me shipwrecked on this island I'm lost

Lost
You got my heart I can't control it
Sign your name on it and let the world know it belongs to you
When I wake up in the morning
I don't know where I'm going
I just wanna spend my time next to you oh
You got me so lost and I can't lie
I know where it is and I know my heart will never stop beating
But somehow you got it gone

But I'm happy to be lost in you
All I see is you cuz I'm lost, lost
And I'm so confused cuz I'm lost, lost
Tryna find my way cuz I'm lost, lost
Now you got me shipwrecked on this island I'm lost

You're the one I choose
I just wanna please you everything I do
You're everything and everything is you
Don't want nobody to save me cuz I don't mind being lost in you
You.. you, you.. you
Don't want nobody to save me cuz I don't mind being lost in you

Somebody give me a map
Think I need directions to navigate love
I think that I'm lost oh
You sent me on a trip
Baby now I can't find the right road
But I'm happy to be lost in you
All I see is you cuz I'm lost, lost
And I'm so confused cuz I'm lost, lost
Tryna find my way cuz I'm lost, lost
Now you got me shipwrecked on this island I'm lost
