Why you tryin to walk out on me? Platinum brothers
Hey hmm
Feel good don't it?
Hmm baby
Verse 1:
You say the thrill was gone a long time ago
So why'd you stay so long
If you knew the deal shoulda let me know
Why did you keep holdin on
Girl you put so much into me & I put so much in you
I ain't gotta teach nobody I ain't gotta learn nobody new
(Hook)
And I know you gon trip when I come home late without callin
I be expectin that
Whether I'm rich or broke lovin & fussin girl you're rollin I'll take nothin less than that
{Chorus}
I know love has ups & downs
And I know way to much to go & duck out now
So why would we give this up just to go sleepin around
You know me better than the back of your hand so don't you ever turn your back on this man
Baby oooh

Without that round thing beside me
Come up stairs & let me hold you
Oh baby why would you deny me?
Girl I know you want it too
Cuz you love the things I do to you (I do to you) baby
(Hook)
And I know you gon trip when I come home late without callin
I be expectin that
Whether I'm rich or broke lovin & fussin girl you're rollin I'll take nothin less than that
{Chorus}
I know love has ups & downs
And I know way to much to go & duck out now
So why would we give this up just to go sleepin around
You know me better than the back of your hand so don't you ever turn your back on this man
