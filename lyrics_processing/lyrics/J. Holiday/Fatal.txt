Everyday you're gone
It's killin' me to be without you
Can't make it alone
Everyday you're gone
It's killin' me to be without you
Can't make it alone
Girl 'cause I'm missin' you

Its like i got a hangover
I can't get you outta my head
Just like i wrecked my new rover
Girl I can't get you out of my head
And I ain't never been low but
Its like I'm broke and I'm outta the game
So i swallow my pride if that's the only way
To make it better babe
