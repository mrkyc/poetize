Yo
Look I know we been
Been friends for a minute now
But I think it's time that we
We address the situation
I know how you feel
You know how I feel
I gotta say you're a hell of a woman
You're like a new drop in the summer
Pull me over the weather, when I'm under
Did you know you do that for me?
And I wonder sometimes, why you've been taking your time
I know this' gone be right
Girl I put that on my life
Girl you'll be giving me the coldest shoulder
You don't want you emotions taking over
Instead of talking about you looking for a solider
Are you tryna say you don't see that in me?
I know that we're friends
But taking it there won't mess it up
I... know this gone be right
Please, just trust in me, girl I got you can't you see
Babygirl it's killing me
Why you tryna act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see
You should be with me
It's your heart but before you give to someone
Someone who don't deserve it, just don't hurt 'em baby
You might also likeYou're like a scene from my favorite movie
Hard to control myself when you next to me
If it's against the law to love you then sue me
Girl this whole thing got me in disbelief
I know it takes time
To build somethin' that's worth while but
Just in case you didn't hear me I'm gonna say it again more clearly
(I need you)
Like a bed need some covers
(I need you)
Baby we need each other
(girl I need you)
Like a comedian needs a joke
(I need you)
Baby I need you the most
Baby... my hearts beatin'
Can't you hear it?
If I'm the music
You're my lyrics
Baby girl it's killin' me... girl it's killing me...
Why you tryna act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see (oh oh oh)
(you should be with)
You should be with me
It's your heart but, before you give it to someone
Someone who don't deserve it, just don't hurt 'em baby
(you should be with me)
I know you're lookin' out for you
(but you gotta understand)
That I'm looking out for us too
(oh oh oh oh)
So baby you should just give me your heart
And I swear I won't tear it apart, no...
Baby girl it's killin' me... girl it's killin' me...
Why you tryna act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see (oh oh oh)
