1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Don't choke on that homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip all that Gin, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes out of your mouth
And never pull out your piece, unless you dumping out
Never fear no man, but know when to run
Leave no man standing till the battle is won
And when it's getting real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up (nope)
And act right if you know you can't fight (take it easy)
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a 1% chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we've been living, got one day we might fall
And the only choices we're given's got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, he's got love for us all
We've been living these thug (these thug)
These thug (these thug)
Commandments

Stop cuffing that young girl, let her breathe
Be a father to your kids, plant healthy seeds
No du-rags in the lord's house
Trust in the lord, but keep a Glock in your house
When you're talking to a man, look him dead in his eye
Never get high on your own supply (c'mon, man)
Gotta think fast, stash a little cash
Watch them snake niggas, they slither in the grass

And don't smoke what you don't roll up (nope)
And act right if you know you can't fight (take it easy)
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a 1% chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we've been living, got one day we might fall
And the only choices we're given's got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, he's got love for us all
We've been living these thug (these thug)

Commandments

We fall down, but we get up
We sell out, and we re-up
And we keep watch from the rooftops, crooked cops
Hi snitches, tap telephone switches
We get bad, but we post bail
Right back slanging with a story to tell
It goes around and round like a revolving wheel
It never changes, it's all a game, kid
And we know the life we've been living, got one day we might fall
And the only choices we're given's got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, he's got love for us all
We've been living these thug (these thug)
These thug (these thug)
Commandments

We fall down, but we get up
We sell out, and we re-up
And we keep watch from the rooftops, crooked cops
Hi snitches, tap telephone switches
We get bad, but we post bail
Right back slanging with a story to tell
It goes around and round like a revolving wheel
