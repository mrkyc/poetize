Hey, yo, it's your boy Darkchild, the future of the classics, mane
Genesis, Music Lion and my boy, J. Holiday
We in the buildin', man

It's crazy how I'm seein' you
'Cause I just told your lil' cousin the other day
I need to speak to you
Girl, how you doin', how you been?
Let's get all of that all the way
'Cause I got some more 'ish to say, yeah
I heard you had a baby on me (Baby on me)
Is that the truth or is the block just hatin' on me? (Hatin' on me)
And I ain't trippin' if you got yourself a man
Girl, 'cause I can change that given half a chance
Feel me, yeah

First let me apologize
Anything I did that'd have made ya cry
I know you don't wanna hear this song
But I promise I won't take too long (Oh baby)
I needed you to hear the rest (And if you don't agree)
At least I got it off my chest
Don't walk away
'Cause if you do you'll miss the best part of what I gotta say
You might also like
Ooh, Baby (Baby), I want (I want) to go back (To go back) in time (In time)
To the first time (First time), get it right (Get it right)
I'm sorry
And my life is nothin' without you, baby
My life is nothing without you
My life is nothing without you

I know that it was hard for you
And I know that you were hungry for love, girl, and i was starvin' you
And it was childish, I admit
How I tried to get you back for everything you did
Girl, I would have never packed up and bounced
If you ain't feel the need to go sneakin' around
And I'm sure you wouldn't have checked my messages
If I would have been honest 'bout where I been

First let me apologize
Anything I did that'd have made ya cry (I'm sorry, babe)
I know you don't wanna hear this song
But I promise I won't take too long
I needed you to hear the rest (And if you don't agree)
At least I got it off my chest
(Baby don't) Don't walk away
'Cause if you do you'll miss the best part of what I gotta say
Baby (Baby), I want (I want) to go back (To go back) in time (In time)
To the first time (First time), get it right (Get it right)
I'm sorry
And my life is nothin' without you, baby
My life is nothin' without you, baby
(I'm nothin' without you)
(I know you hear me talkin' to you, lover)

Baby (Baby), I want (I want) to go back (To go back) in time (In time)
To the first time, get it right
To the first time and get it right
Baby (Baby), I want (I want) to go back (To go back) in time (In time)
To the first time, get it right
'Cause I'm sorry and my life is nothin' without you
Nothin' without you, baby
Nothin' without you, baby
