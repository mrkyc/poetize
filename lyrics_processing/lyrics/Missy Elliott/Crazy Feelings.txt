Hey, hey, hey
Oh, whoa
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I was in love
And that's what it was when I met you
In love
And no one could ever talk 'bout you
But it sucks
So many lies and alibis in
Our love, mmm
(Uh, say what?)

Crazy feelings (Mmm)
Made me stay (Me stay)
In love with you
(Oh, oh, oh)
Crazy feelings (Crazy, ooh)
Make me stay (Make me stay)
In love with you (Uh)

So in love
I just didn't see the wrong you did
In love
But now that I know, I can admit
It was love
That made me a fool, a silly fool
In love
Our crazy love
