What do you want, Paul?
Tell me what you desire to see
Your deepest intent, Paul
What do you see for this company?
I'm looking for someone with strong ambition
Someone to sell their specific vision
Someone to share with precise precision their thoughts
'Cause I want you to want
To want
(spoken)
So, what do you want, Paul? What's that one concrete goal that motivates all your actions?

I don't think I have one of those!

Well, then how's anyone supposed to sympathize with you, Paul?

I don't know, I want what anyone wants? Money, a partner? Kids, someday, maybe?

I want you to want, Paul
A man so vague just can't be trusted
Something you pine for
Maybe someone who keeps you lusted
I'm just a boss, I'm not an idea guy
I hire you Pauls to keep our stock high
But if you can't pin the point that's in the sky
Then I want you to want!
To want
You might also likeD'you know what I want for myself?
I've waited for so lo-ong
To tell somebody else
Carol, my wife
You're my muse, my source of light
Carol, my love
I want you to choke me out at night
I want you to choke me
I want you to choke me
I want you to choke me while I jerk off
I want you to choke me while I jerk off
(spoken)
Melissa, get my wife on the phone for me

Mr. Davidson, I think I should leave!

No, Paul, I want you to hear this, if you leave, you're fired
Carol! Yes, everything's fine, I promise. I just wanted to tell you something. I uh, I forgot what it was. Maybe someday I'll remember. Goodbye...
(sung)
Paul, now you know what it is to want
I wanna go home!

It consumes a man with a passion
To drive the primary plot
So take up yoga or improv classes
Volunteer at shelters or Twitch to the masses
There's gotta be something that'll keep my hands off you
Off you
'Cause I want you to want!

I'm gonna go get some coffee, do you want anything?

No, I need you to want!

How about an iced caramel frappe, nothing better!

And if you don't want
We're through
(spoken)
Paul? Paul?
