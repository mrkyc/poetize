Thrown in back like a burlap sack
And lord does my butt hurt
I guess it's been days or week or months
Or something worse
Everything looks the same
When you're starin at nothing but dirt
And all I hear are the wheels bucklin
Large men yelling, sounds like pouting
I really miss a more familiar sound
Mom
Cause I am lost without you
It's been a long, long time
Every time I look around me
I pray you're at my side
On the trail
Kept a journal of all the spots we passed
Just for you Dad
The Big Blue Mountains are actually grey
They look tired and really sad
There's no soda in Soda Springs
The water's way too hot
Fort Hall's just a great big wall
And we didn't even stop
You might also likeNow I am lost without you
Sometimes I barely breathe
If I ever don't think of you
It's because I can't believe
That I am on the trail without you
With miles and miles to go
Send me a sign that you're okay
A telegram or note
From the trail
I won't stop till I find you again
Even if you're a pile of ash
I'll find an east-bound caravan
And crank up its pace to fast
You won't notice I've been gone at all
You'll say "Mouthface, where you been?"
I want you to know that there's not a moment
That goes by without the thought of you
I won't be lost without you
'Cause you'll be there at my side
You and Dad'll be close together
With my brother on my right
I won't be lost... without you...
I'll see their shiny faces
Even if it's through a stone
I'll write something real nice for you
That reminds me of home
