I know a thousand tales to fill a thousand nights
But now another story comes to mind
A noble, young vizier ascends to wondrous heights
He's brilliant as he's handsome, and handsome as he's kind
He is at once familiar and unknowable
To the frightened girl he meets along the way
And to the girl's surprise, something in his eyes
Beckons her to know him and inspires her to say
I want to know your story
I want to know your past
So tell me slowly from the start
Leave out no detail
Savour every part
I want to know your story
So make the story last
I want to know each twist and turn
Tell me all I've missed
I've so much to learn
For when it comes to stories
I thought I knew them all
Now I'm face to face with one
I can't seem to recall
Ja'far:
The young vizier had come to help inspire change
But fate had planned an unexpected twist
Within the palace walls he discovered something strange
And found the missing part of him he didn't know he missed
She is at once a comfort and a mystery
To the callow man she meets that fateful day
She's beautiful and wise, and something in her eyes
Beckons him to know her and inspires him to say
I want to know your story
I want to know your past
I want to know your future too
Fill my days and nights
With the tale of you
Ja'far + Sherrezade:
I want to know your story
(I want to know your story)
So make the story last
(So make the story...)
And...
Both:
...linger over every part
Tell it till I know
Every bit by heart
Ja'far:
I never cared for stories
Until you entered mine
Both:
And now my only wish is that
Our plots may intertwine
Ja'far:
But I forget what happens next
Sherrezade:
I'm not sure I understand
Ja'far:
Remind me how she answers
When he asks her for her hand?
Sherrezade:
(Spoken) Took you long enough
(Spoken) Yes, she says yes!
Both:
A thousand and one nights with you is not enough to spend
So let's make ours a story with no end
