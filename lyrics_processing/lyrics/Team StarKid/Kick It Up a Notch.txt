Scales and exoskeletons
Why, they pale in comparison
To a body that is covered up by skin
We get rid of those antennae
Give you hair, and clothes and then I
Add two eyes and a nose and my boy, that is only
The beginning...
(spoken)
Hmm... what do you say *you* become a Starship Ranger?

Me?

Now listen to me, my confused little friend. We are friends, after all. I used to have my fair share of doubts and fears and well, they quite literally almost ate me alive. But no! I took charge! I pushed it to the limit! So you gotta be strong. Be tough! To coin a phrase, be a man.
Ahahaha!
(sung)
You've gotta kick it up a notch
If you're ever gonna reach your goal
You can't sit around and watch
Your destiny is in your control
Go ahead and kick it up a notch
If your life is at a level too low
There's no attempt that you can botch
When all you gotta do is just give it a go
But then again what do I know?
What I see right there
Is a prisoner
Who's sittin' on top of the key
So kick it up a notch
If you ever wanna be free

Wow. A real Starship Ranger. That would be the coolest thing in the whole world!

It would, wouldn't it? A bug in a human body. You could be the link between our race and theirs.

Well, do I even have what it takes-

Shh...

All you gotta do is
Kick it up a notch
To dig yourself outta this hole
You wanna have the things they got?
Then you gotta give that dice a roll
Kid, kick it up a notch
What's the point of less when there is more?

Have a cigar

A glass of scotch
When opportunity knocks at your door
You let him in and then ya

Settle the score

Life is short so
Before it's over
Take a chance to think it through
You'd better kick it up a notch
It's the human thing to do
It's a big, big, universe
So many dimensions
And unanswered questions
Not to mention
Life
What an invention
Life
There's no choice involved in what you are given
One mind, one voice, one body to live in
But...
You wanna be a Starship Ranger
Or is that a dream that you forgot?
You wanna be a Starship Ranger?
Well, this might be your one and only shot!
(spoken)
So here's the choice, Bug. You could go on leading your meaningless existence or you could take everything you've ever wanted. All I ask in return is that you befriend the humans and bring them to me.
Well, Bug? Whaddaya say?

I... I...
I think I'll kick it up a notch
I don't care about the queen or the hive

That's the spirit! Kick 'em all straight in the crotch! How about that?

Who are they to deprive us of wanting to-
Kick it up a notch
Never give yourself a reason to doubt
You gotta strike it while it's hot
'Cause that's what livin's all about
My dear Bug, it's time the
Lights went
Out!
I'm gonna be a Starship Ranger!
I'm gonna be a Starship Ranger!
I'm gonna be a Starship Ranger!
Well, see you on the other side, Pincer. I love you.

Oh, oh uhh... I love you too, Bug.
Heh heh heh heh...

I know we're suckahs, but that guy's a suckah!

Yes, yes... what a dumbass! Break out the good china, boys. Tonight we dine again!
(sung)
Kick it up a notch
Oh, my plan is all about to unfold
Let's put a twist into this plot
Bug, go forth, do everything that I've told ya

When we, kick it up a notch

It's blood for us!

And brains for me!
I'm gonna let this little snot
Be everything he's wanted to be
But only because I know he'll actually
Feed my hunger for flesh
I want it warm and fresh

Oh, Pincer you're in for a treat!

Let's kick it up a notch

Kick it up a notch

So at last
I'll have human meat!
