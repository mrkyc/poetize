We got work to do.
(Everyone groans.)
There's just not time for singing and dancing right now.
We got work to d-

I don't really wanna do the work today
I don't really wanna do the work today
(whiny voice) I don't really really wanna do the work today
I don't wanna do the work today

What? What's this?

Uh-oh!

I don't really wanna do the work today
I don't really wanna do the work today
I don't really wanna do the work today
I don't wanna do the work today

How do you guys all know this dance?
Just figured out how to move, how to sing, how to groove
And now you're tellin' me I gotta work today

Keeri, did you choreograph this and teach everyone?
Where was I?

You know that feeling
When you find the thing that blows your mind
And next thing you know
They wanna take it away

Okay, I am not trying to take anything away, I'm just.. telling you not to do something.

Yeah, but you heard what Jemilla said!
(I know, I know, I know...)
You gotta work to get ahead!
(Our people have to grow)

We gotta harness our pride
(Thank you)
And keep it up to survive
(Thank you)
Alright now listen girls, let me reiterate
I know it's hard to just work with no play
I hope we all understand the importance of what we do
And that this world is full of obstacles we gotta work through
We got so much to do already you and me have made discoveries
That have helped our kind in so many ways
I hope you're feeling proud
We're working through the shroud of mystery
And our history's growing every day

(Spoken) Aw, come on Jemilla, you know we're just messing with you!
I got the best job, 'cause I'm in charge of food
I gotta eat everything to find out what tastes good
(Spoken) Don't eat that! No one eat that!

When I'm not kicking ass
I sit and stare at the grass
And let the time pass
To find out how it grows
And?

I still don't know

Oh

I still don't know

We've been watching our shadows every day
We notice when the sky's cloudy, they go away
We're trying to explain

What could they be?
These dark spirits that follow us?
No matter how fast we run
They are trying to swallow us!

So many wondrous things here for our kind
A world of tools and knowledge left to find
And I hope to bring you there
Because you know how much I care
So we'll join each other hand in hand
And try to help ourselves to understand
This world is what we make of it, together
This is the dawn
The dawn of our time
We are mankind
With the gift of a greater mind

This is the dawn
The dawn of our time
We are womankind
With the gift of a stronger mind
Ooooh
Ooooh
