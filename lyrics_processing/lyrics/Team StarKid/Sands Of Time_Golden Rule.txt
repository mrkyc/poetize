Sands of time, take me back
Before it all went wrong
When love was but a song
And tomorrow shone as brightly as the sun
Teach me to undo what's done
Sands of time, take me back.
(spoken)
Salaam, friends, and praise Allah for this blessed day!

Oh, and praise Allah for you, Jafar!
Today's the day, isn't it? The day the palace finally gets a good and honest man on the payroll!
"Assistant Vizier to the Sultan."
You'll straighten out those crooked politicians, I'm sure of it!

Oh, now, now, be warm, I'm sure those higher-ups in the palace are doing their very best!
They just need someone with strong resolve to keep them on that straight and narrow.

Ha ha! I suppose you're right. But how do you do it Jafar?
How is it that you are so good to everyone you meet?

My secret is simple, really. Anyone could do it.
I just follow the golden rule!
And what rule is that, Jafar?

Why, it's as easy as a 1, 2, 3, 4...
(Sung)
Follow the golden rule
For life's a two-way street
Keep that in mind
And you'll be kind
To everyone you meet!
Follow the golden rule
It isn't hard to do
Always treat others like sisters and brothers
And they'll do the same for you.
Before you harm your fellow man
Ask this question first:
How would you wish that he treat you
If your fortunes were reversed?
Follow the golden rule
That's how I choose to live
Wow, simple reciprocity
Is always my philosophy
I get back what I give!
Stop, thief!

But sir, I'm starving!

Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

Stop right there, friend!
Omar, what's going on here?

This boy has robbed me!

So you take the law into your own hands?

It is my right, Jafar!

But is it right?
(Sung)
Before you harm your fellow man
Ask this question first:
How would you wish that he treat you
If your fortunes were reversed?
(Spoken)
Why take this boy's hand when you could just as easily put it to work?

Give him a job, eh?

And you, boy, don't you see that if everyone were to steal from Omar's cart, that he would be the one who was starving?

Follow the golden rule

My hunger blinded me and forced me to act like an animal.

But we're not animals.

Follow the golden rule

We're gifted with minds to reason and hearts to love!

Follow the golden rule

So what do you say? Can you two work together?
(Sung)
Follow the golden rule
For life's a two-way street

Keep that in mind

And you'll be kind

To everyone you meet!
Follow the golden rule
(Follow the golden rule)
It isn't hard to do
(It's very easy)
Always treat others like sisters and brothers
And they'll do the same for you
Follow the golden rule (they'll do it for you)
Follow the golden rule (they'll do it for you)
Follow the golden rule (they'll do it for you)
Follow the golden rule (they'll do it for you)

Well, I better be off to the palace!

Good luck, Jafar!
And remember
Follow the golden rule (follow the golden rule)
That's how we choose to live (it's very easy)
Simple reciprocity
Is always our philosophy

I get back what I give (We get what we give)
That's it

I get back what I give
Follow the golden rule (I get what I give)
Follow the golden rule (I get what I give)
Follow the golden
Follow the golden
