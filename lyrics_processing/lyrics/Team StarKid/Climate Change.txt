Ooh-oo-ooh, oh-oo-oo-ooh...

I can feel the air now (Ooh-oo-ooh...)
Getting warmer (Ooh-oo-oo-ooh...)
Flames are everywhere now (Ooh-oo-ooh...)
They're transforming me (Ooh-oo-oo-ooh...)
Everything has changed (Ooh-oo-ooh...)
And our path is being paved (Ooh-oo-oo-ooh...)
We've left behind the cave (Ooh-oo-ooh...)
No more being Jemilla's slaves (Ooh-oo-oo-ooh...)
(Ooh-oo-ooh, oh-oo-ooh...)

Woo!
Mmm...
Now we all know that Jemilla was crazy
We got Zazzy now, she lettin' us be lazy
Laying around, ain't doing shit for nobody
Barely gettin' up to go potty
Jemilla's leadership was shoddy at best

It's a new way of living
It's the gift that keeps on giving
To all...

Got all the food we desire
Just light some mammoths on fire
Watch 'em burn...

Good thing we learned how good it tastes
We don't got work to do
If we don't want to
That's a rule that Zazzy made up

Huh, that's right, just do whatever you want
There's been a change in the climate
Something's in the air
I feel the heat

No need to define it (need to define it)
We don't really care (Ahh...)
Come on, let's eat now

There's more food than we can eat in a lifetime
No need to share
No, baby, it's all mine

Ahh ooh wa bada-ba
Ahh ooh wa bada-ba
Ahh ooh wa bada-ba
Ahh ooh wa bada-ba

I knew what my people needed now
I'm a better leader
Look at how we're free

Thanks to you Zaz
Our harmonies are tight
We're singing all night

But sometimes we don't even feel like doing that either

Mmm, mmm, mmm...

Thanks to all this change (Ooh...)
Now our path is being paved (ooh wah)
My people have been saved (Ooh...)
Now we do nothing all day (Ooh...)
There's been a change in the climate (Ahh...)
Something's in the air (Ahh...)
I feel the heat (Ahh...)
No need to define it (Ahh...)
We don't really care (Ahh...)
Let's taste defeat now (Ahh...)

Change in the climate, oh...
Oh, change in the climate, oh...
Oh, change in the climate, oh...

Oh, change in the climate
(Oh, I don't really wanna do the work today)
Oh... (I don't really wanna do the work today)
Oh, change in the climate
(I don't really wanna do the work today)
Oh... (I don't wanna do the work today)
Oh, change in the climate
(I don't really wanna do the work today)
Oh... (I don't really wanna do the work today)
Oh... (I don't really wanna do the work today)
