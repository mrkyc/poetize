I'm tied up, Charlotte
Tied up with you
You understand me
Now hand me those keys
The keys to my youth
God, we were young once
Innocent and fun once
And free
Let go of this grip on me
You tied up my heart
You tied me down
Now break me open
With your love and mercy
Charlotte!
You're breaking my heart, Char
Got my feet to the fire
Just let me go
And I'll love you
Ooh!

Oh, Sam, I love you too, but I can't let you go!

Charlotte, baby! Apple of my eye! Don't you trust me?
(sung)
I've effed up, Charlotte
Effed up with you
All the booze and harlots
And all the Charlottes
But they didn't count
They couldn't break me
You're the one who caged me
In chains
Please, take away my pain
Charlotte!
Let me hold you again, Char
Just free up my arms
And I'll give
You a foot massage
Charlotte
Will you ever forgive me?
I'll crawl on my hands and knees
If you untie me, girl
And free up my heart

Heart, you tied me down
Now break me open
With your love and mercy
Oh fuck, I'm fading fast, I think you better come quick
I really don't wanna die alone in here
Time to say our goodbyes at the end of the road

Just hang on Sam, you'll be alright!

This body's not gonna last, the air is cold and thick
I'm losing my last remaining hope for us
My hands are tied in knots and I can't come home
I wanna die in your arms in the evening glow

Sam, aw, Sam! What have I done? What have I done? Oh, what have I done?

Charlotte
You brought me back from the dead, Char
My light was in red
I saw God, and he told me, girl
To free up my heart

Heart, you tied me down
Now break me open
