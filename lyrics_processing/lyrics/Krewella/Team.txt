Last night, I saw the fear and the fire burn in your eyes
The way you were looking at me like a deer in headlights
Didn't they tell you to not bring a knife to a gunfight, ah

I ain't givin' up, I ain't givin' in
(I ain't givin' up, I ain't givin' in)
I don't need a crown to know I'm king
(I don't need a crown to know I'm king)
I ain't givin' up, I ain't givin' in
I don't need your love, I don't need a thing
Go do ya, I'ma do me
Don't give a fuck if you ain't on my team

Go do ya, (I'ma do me)
Go do ya, I'ma do me
Don't give a fuck if you ain't on my team

Cloud 9
I caught a vibe and a fever you know money can't buy
Going all in no bullshit 'cause I'm here for a good time
Didn't they tell you the view ain't as good from the sidelines, ah

Don't give a fuck if you ain't on my team

I don't know about you but I'm feeling fine
'Cause all I need in this life are a few good ride or dies
