You close your eyes
And hope that nothing gets through
These walls are high
Guarded by a statue
And you've been blind
'Cause it's yourself you consume
But not this time
No, I won't let it eat you

Wait, this is not the end
It's where I began
We are up against the world, oh
You know we live for every day, until tomorrow
Hey, oh, don't lose your head
We're able to knock 'em dead
I'll save you
If you're on the edge, I said
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end

The job is through
Yeah, it is done
I own you
This war is won, won
You play your part
Yet, you hang on
Because you'd rather die in my arms
I'll give you nothing but morphine dreams
As you sleep, record back all your screams
When you wake, play 'em back
Split your seams so you're breaking until you bleed

Wait, this is not the end
It's where I began
We are up against the world, oh
You know we live for every day, until tomorrow
Hey, oh, don't lose your head
We're able to knock 'em dead
I'll save you
If you're on the edge, I said
This is not the end

This is not the end

We are up against the world, oh
You know we live for every day, until tomorrow
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
This is not the end
