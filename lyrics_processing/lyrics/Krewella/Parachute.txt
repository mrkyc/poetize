Monday morning came without a warning
You know I wish I didn't have to leave
It's temporary, yeah it's temporary
We survive on the memories
Like that sex on the beach last New Year's Eve, so high
Breaking into the pool at our old high school that night

If I could bottle up this feeling
Dancing on the ceiling
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it
If I could bottle up this feeling
Hit me like the real thing
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it

(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
Take a leap of faith no parachute
You might also like
On my pillow between byes and hellos
I breath you in and remember when
We shut the bar down, I lost count of the round
I reminisce every now and then
About that 6 A.M. drive last Fourth of July, so high
We got caught in the rain on the way to the bay that night

If I could bottle up this feeling
Dancing on the ceiling
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it
If I could bottle up this feeling
Hit me like the real thing
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it

(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my)
(Butterflies in my belly)
(Butterflies in my belly)
Take a leap of faith, no parachute
Promise you, promise you
Take a leap of faith and we'll make it through
Promise you, I promise you
Take a leap of faith, no parachute

If I could bottle up this feeling
Dancing on the ceiling
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it
If I could bottle up this feeling
Hit me like the real thing
Won't sink when I need it
Don't think just believe it
