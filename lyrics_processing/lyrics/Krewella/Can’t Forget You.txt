These days, I know I've been gone
Caught up in the gravity
Airplanes are living too fast
I let it get the best of me
I hope it's never too late
To take up your time
Cause these days, I'm running on fumes
Missing every memory

All those nights
You were on my mind
I can't forget you
I can't forget you
Don't let go
Cause I coming home
I can't forget you
I can't forget
That you held me

Down
From the day that it started
Held me
Down
When the night was the darkest
So thank you for waiting
When it took me so long
I can't forget you
I can't forget
You might also like
Daydream, the passenger's seat
Riding on the 101
Chi-Town is never too far
Closer than the setting sun
I hope it's never too late
To take up your time
Do you remember that moment
Cause I remember that moment

All those nights
You were on my mind
I can't forget you
I can't forget you
Don't let go
Cause I coming home
I can't forget you
I can't forget
That you held me

Down
From the day that it started
Held me
Down
When the night was the darkest
So thank you for waiting
When it took me so long
I can't forget you
I can't forget
We're not tied to the train tracks
Before we go, you should know that
I'm alright if you ride by my side
We could learn this the hard way
And leave our hearts on the highway
I'm alright if you ride by my side

Cause you held me
Down
From the day that it started
Held me
Down
When the night was the darkest
So thank you for waiting
When it took me so long
I can't forget you
I can't forget

I'm alright if you ride by my side
I'm alright if you ride by my side
I'm alright if you ride by my side
I can't forget you
