Thousand watts, yeah, power up your system
Non stop, yeah I'm always in position
Wide awake when they turn on the lights
On the ground, work it hard all the time
Bodyguard on an out of body mission
Battle scars only give me ammunition
Armed and ready, I don't need to flex
Pushing it to the edge

This is the goddess that open your eyes
I ain't an angel, but that shit's divine
'Cause even when I'm at my breaking point
I'ma shed no tears
Even when they throw me all that noise
I got this

Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down, drop down, drop down low
Make your body, make your body, make your body
I got
I got, I got, I got this
I got, I got, I got this
I got, I got, I got this
Bow down, yeah this body is a temple
Fear not, 'cause the fear is only mental
Show your teeth if you're ready to bite
All my dogs are a piece of the tribe
Rolling deep, with the squad on my shoulders
Got my back like a tank full of soldiers
When they try us, the gloves coming off
We stay fighting for love

Find you a goddess to open your eyes
Shit, I ain't an angel, but I feel divine
'Cause even when I'm at my breaking point
I'ma shed no tears
Even when they throw me all that noise
I got this

Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down, drop down, drop down low
Make your body, make your body, make your body
I got
I got, I got, I got this
I got, I got, I got this
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
I got, I got, I got

Find you a goddess to open your eyes (To open your eyes)
Shit, I ain't an angel, but I feel divine (Oh, divine)
'Cause even when I'm at my breaking point
I'ma shed no tears
Even when they throw me all that noise
I got this

Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down low, make your body hit the floor
Drop down, drop down, drop down low
Make your body, make your body, make your body
I got
I got, I got, I got this
