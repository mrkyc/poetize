Got all my keys don't you follow me, call on me
Ain't mood for no drama
Outta my face, didn't you read my policy
I do what I wanna
You ain't my therapist, ain't got the formula
So stay in your corner
Last thing I need is my head underwater
Didn't I warn ya

Wanna feel the good
Wanna feel the bad, feel it all
Got a human heart
I'ma let that fly and fall
When I feel insane
I'ma I rap that pain
No doubt
I'ma spell it out

Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
Kinda like the way I let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
No, I ain't afraid to let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
Don't tell me to calm down
You might also like
Don't hit me up like you want an apology
I'm too busy wylin'
Sipping on vodka 'cause you ain't my cup of tea
I put you on silent
Say one more thing and I'll take it from zero to sixty
That's good to be honesty, honestly
If you can't handle it
Get off my fuckin' dick

Wanna feel the good
Wanna feel the bad, feel it all
Got a human heart
I'ma let that fly and fall
When I feel insane
And I rap that pain
No doubt
I'ma spell it out

Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
Kinda like the way I let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
No, I ain't afraid to let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
Don't tell me to calm down
Down, down, d-d-down, down
When the red line blows
I just can't lay low
Down, down, d-d-down, down
When the red line blows
I just can't lay low

Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
Kinda like the way I let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
I'm about to tear this fuckin' place down
No, I ain't afraid to let it go
Don't tell me to calm down
