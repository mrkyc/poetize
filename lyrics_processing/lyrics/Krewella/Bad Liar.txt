I try to keep my secrets, but I must admit
Sometimes I drink my feelings, so I can let you in
Memories bleeding, when you touch my skin
Then you're back again, oh
And if I never, ever call
It's 'cause I hate goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever call
Because I didn't wanna let you go

And if I never, ever call
It's 'cause I hate goodbyes, you know
So I never, ever call

Cause I didn't wanna let you know
That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
To stop me from talking now
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar
Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

I tried to hide my emotions
But they're runnin' free
Sometimes my heart's an ocean
I feel it drownin' me
Why am I only open
When you're about to leave?
Yeah it makes no sense, oh
You might also like
And if I never, ever call
It's 'cause I hate goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever call

Cause I didn't wanna let you know
That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
To stop me from talking now
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar
Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

If I'm bein' honest, I'll just say I want it
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you
I'll fight the feelin', I'll open up
And if I'm bein' honest, I'mma already fallin'
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you

And if I never, ever call
It's 'cause I hate goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever call
Cause you know I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
To stop me from talking now
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar
Such a bad-
