Pull up on the party with an army
Our guns inked up like a Harley Hells Angel on the one
Like a bull in a china shop, steaming like buns
Coming in like a wrecking ball, you gon' need a Tylenol

Luck is going all the way up
Love is raining like paper
Rolling downtown with a couple young gods
We got everything that we could ever want
Yawk yawk yawk

Whole city on my back like Jordan
No, money can't buy this fortune
Got a squad homegrown and foreign
No, money can't buy this
Money can't buy this
Bulletproof love, you know this
Got me like a 24-karat fortress
They can keep the cash and the Porsches
'Cause money can't buy this
Money can't buy this fortune

'Cause money can't buy this
Money can't buy this
Money can't buy this fortune
Fortune

Diamonds are forever, but a girl's best friend
Is a bank full of ride-or-dies stickin' 'til the end
We stay mobbin' the party
But no, we ain't the Gotti
We come in peace from the East
Pakistan to Miami

Luck is going all the way up
Love is raining like paper
Rolling downtown with a couple young gods
We got everything that we could ever want
Yawk yawk yawk

No, money can't buy this
Money can't buy this
