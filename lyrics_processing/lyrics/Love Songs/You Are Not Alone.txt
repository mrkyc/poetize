I'm still all alone
How could this be
That you're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
You might also likeJust the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
Ohh, Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', and I
And girl you know that I'll be there!
I'll be there!
You are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
(For you are not alone) You are not alone
(For I am here with you) I am here with you
(Though you're far away) Though you're far away
(I am here to stay) You and me
(You are not alone) You are Always in my heart!
(For I am here with you)
(Though we're far apart)
(You're always in my heart)
(You are not alone) You are not alone oh!
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again, you are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, Not alone!
You just reach out for me girl in the morning in the evenin'
Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone, Oh!
Together, together
God done being alone, god done being alone
