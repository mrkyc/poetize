That's waiting around the corner
All I can see is more agony
I don't believe things are better
Want it for you - want it for me
Let's do it and keep our sanity
Always a fight - we both may be right
Too stubborn to see
It's not adversity, it's polarity
A balance that keeps the day
Can't we agree to disagree?
It just might work out this way
Want it for you - want it for me
Let's do it and keep our sanity
All in the past so save it for last
When you think of me
'Cause our finest hour is our darkest day
To admit we're human-
That there's more to life than we want to say
In our test of wills did we turn to man?
Did we look for answers-
From a higher source than we understand?
Gotta second chance if we will come clean now
Or it's all over
You might also likeI gotta keep it-
I gotta keep it going(keep it going)
Conflict in everything must be defined
Look around - see the answers-
I think you'll find
Nothing is left to chance it's all design
Deny it- pay the price? (or peace will find
Us...)
In our test of wills did we turn to man?
Did we look for answers-
From a higher source than we understand?
Gotta second chance if we will come clean now
Or it's all over
I got to keep it going got to keep it going
Going got to keep it going
Depression overwhelming me-a sign
Burning out - can't believe it
I know you feel it
Lost in transgression may be it is time
Decide if we're back together or divided
'Cause our finest hour is our darkest day
To admit we're human-
That there's more to life than we want to say
In our test of wills did we turn to man?
Did we look for answers-
From a higher source than we understand?
Gotta second chance if we will come clean now
Or it's all over
A misunderstanding unraveling
Flashing back the years
Memories hopes and fears
Calling me home at last
Now I'm taking refuge in the past
All I can do for now
If it's all the same to you...
It it's all the same to you...
I'll be there if it's all the same to you
But in the end-when everything's said and done
Facing my own excuses
And there's nowhere to run
I should have been the only one to pay
For all the times I heard you say-
I was wrong to you.....
I was wrong to you.....
I was wrong to you.....
Wake up
Wish it could be prosperity
That's waiting around the corner
All I can see is more agony
I don't believe things are better
Want it for you - want it for me
Let's do it and keep our sanity
Always a fight - we both may be right
Too stubborn to see
'Cause our finest hour is our darkest day
To admit we're human-
That there's more to life than we want to say
In our test of wills did we turn to man?
Did we look for answers-
From a higher source than we understand?
Gotta second chance if we will come clean now
