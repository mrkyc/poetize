Maximized and underrated
Overdrawn and overstated
What about the truth -what about it?
Minimized, overemphasized
Exaggerated just to dramatize
There's a whole lot more than fame here
And a whole lot more to money
Ok, I've made my point now speak up
Let's hear what you have to say
Just give it to me hard - give it to me straight
Tell me I'm wrong about everything
Overblown and sinking fast
Underfoot and overcast
Make a future with the past
What am I to do -what about it?
Overgrown, contemplated
Overloaded, captivated
In a deadly serious game
With a healthy dose of overkill
Whoever said the best things are free
Wasn't around -That never made sense to me
- 'Cause after living...
In a way, I'd have to say nothing ever came cheap
So that just can't be...
You might also likeI am not the only one that lost it
Some things just have to be said
Now I'd like to make it up to you
Pick up the pieces... if you'll let me
Ok, I've made my point now speak up
Let's hear what you have to say
Just give it to me hard - give it to me straight
Tell me I'm wrong about everything...
No time for introductions -no time at all
Listen...
Undermanned and overcharged
Understood and over farmed
Under where? Undertaker
- Bet he knows the truth, he'll tell you
"Underground, underhanded
Only so much time is granted"
I never said that I had the answers
I never said I knew the truth
But I know if you're gonna die
You might as well - you might as well
Really try and live
Well, maybe that's all there is to it
Whoever said the best things are free
Wasn't around -That never made sense to me
- 'Cause after living...
In a way, I'd have to say nothing ever came cheap
So that just can't be...
I am not the only one that lost it
Some things just have to be said
Now I'd like to make it up to you
Pick up the pieces... if you'll let me
Ok, I've made my point now speak up

Tell me I'm wrong...
I am not the only one that lost it
Some things just have to be said
Now I'd like to make it up to you
Pick up the pieces... if you'll let me try
How can we replace what we had at home?
Fame will not love you the way I do...
