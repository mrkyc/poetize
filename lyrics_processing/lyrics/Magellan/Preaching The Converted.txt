And the business man laughs all the way to the bank
And he's counting fast and he's laughing
Hard.laughing loud
And he's counting fast and he's laughing
Hard.laughing loud
Can you take it?

But I hope I'm invited for the ride
Just in case we end our test of wills
Yes I've seen much stranger things in my
Days......
Preaching still...........
Preaching the converted in our test of
