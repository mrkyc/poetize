You were so tired that you took a nap
Tied you up while you were on your back
And they told you that your name was Jack
Well, they thought you might have been the
Missing link
Make some big cash with those two big feet
A carnival crew's on the city street
Pay admission just to see the freak-
Named Jacko...
A sign of the times
Please forgive we're just human kind
People don't see
You're a child and you don't want to be
A Jacko
Big hotel on the news today
By the old fishin' hole where you used to play
It's prime real estate I would have to say
But your home will never look the same
Well, profit shares and the bottom line
Make it to Wall Street with a glass of wine
Your chemical dump I don't really mind
Now I'm bald and I'm going blind
You might also likePoor Jacko...
Humanity it speaks of all that it wants to be
And as you can see
All we dish out is hypocrisy
To Jacko
Jacko...
A sign of the times
Please forgive we're the human kind
People can't see
You're a child and you don't want to be
A Jacko.........
...Just call him Jacko
...Call him Jacko
I am not your missing link
And I am not your prize
For a hunting expedition under starry skies
Keep me in the wilderness
Where I can breath the air
Maybe one day we will meet
But hey - leave your gun there
If you must come leave your gun there
(Jack-hey-Jacko-a-hey-a-Jacko-call him-
Jack-Jacko-call him-hey-call him-hey-
Just call him Jacko)
Back in the deep wood a line in the sand
By an old oak tree - You will make your stand
If they find you back there you have had it man
They're gonna kill ya anyway they can
Poor Jacko...
A sign of the times
Please forgive we're the human kind
People can't see
You're a child and you don't want to be
To be?
Jacko....
Humanity it speaks of all that it wants to be
And as you can see
