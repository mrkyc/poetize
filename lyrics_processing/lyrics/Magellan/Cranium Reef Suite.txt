Part II. "Psych 101"
Well a bad day fishin' is better than a good day at work
But a bad day in paradise is a bad deal
Let's say goodbye before we've ever met
You're alone on the shore of cranium reef
No one gets inside my head
No one
I'm a bad part of town on a bad stretch of road
I'm a bag of tricks in a balancing act
I'm a battered heart and a bath of tears
I'm no bank and no barrel of monkeys
You're alone on the shore of cranium reef
No one gets inside my head
No one
You're a band of gypsies and a band of thieves
Now you're burning in the sun and you've washed ashore
Don't try "psych 101" on me - we've been there before
I've got a cold embrace at the cranium reef
Trust me you're all alone at the cranium reef

Heart and mind may disagree
But I'm growing old
Too far down the road to change now
'cause you speak to me but youth's on your side
You're so much more than I care to find
What is sacred? What is profane?
Your approach is near and there's something
I fear inside of you -reminding me like a mirror that shows
My past that died long ago
No closet full of skeletons
Can bring me out here
I've got a cold blank stare so don't wait
I've got a colder embrace
You're an Ivy League amateur
"I mean no one comes in here ever"
No one comes in here
No one. No one
No one passes cranium reef
Not even I can look at my grief
Don't come to me pretending you're wise
I am a man who can see what is real
And is fear what is real?
Stranded on cranium reef
Alone with your thoughts you can drink with your grief
You color your lies with a cool motif
Stranded on cranium reef
Lost at cranium reef
At my coral barrier of disbelief
You're a cold hard future with no relief
Brutal reality at cranium reef
I am a bitter pill to swallow
I am a bittersweet memory
You need me like a hole in the head
Now show me that our "body" is real
We need conversation 'cause I got a case of the blues
And I'm a burned out bridge that nothing here...nothing
Can rebuild...no, no, no, no
I am a bitter pill to swallow
I am a bittersweet memory
You need me like a hole in the head
Now show me that our "body" is real
We need conversation 'cause I got a case of the blues
And I'm a burned out bridge that nothing here...nothing
Can rebuild...no, no, no, no
Heart and mind may disagree
But I'm growing old
Too far down the road to change now
'cause you speak to me but youth's on your side
