Filthy bum (twenty plus some) with an old platitude
"mending fences or mending souls"
That was all you had to say
But fate was fair my friend
Now it's your turn to walk in my place
Tell me how's the view from down there-
Come on don't you like it?
Suddenly you are no one and you feel like a freak
Down and out you just might find out who you
Really are
Sorry I can't join you right now
I'd love to stay but can't be late for my happy hour
Now don't get caught up in your paranoia
Just accept that we both -
Lose if there's a confrontation
Well I think we've got to find
Some good excuse with a prospect of detente
But standing my ground
I have drawn the line
Past which there can be no more compromise
Somebody help me find a way out of it
I'm quite sure there must be
More than meets the eye
A matter of what's inside
Pretending my soul can hide from the outside
When everyone can see we're hiding tragedy

No diversions please
It's time to wear your gameface
It's time to wear it now.....just put it on
Now don't get caught up in your paranoia
Just accept that we both
Lose if there's a confrontation
And it's all we've got to find
A crucible can't we compromise?
