"you promised last time you wouldn't make it rain"
So he picked up the earth like a basketball
And threw it into hell just to watch it fall...
Well the big man he don't care about the
Average American - cause he don't cater to no one
There ain't no free lunch -there ain't no sense in forgiving
Some son of a bitch that won't work for a living (he says):
Why water weeds when you can mow them down?
Why water weeds? They'll just go back underground
Why water weeds? Just let 'em wither away
Why water weeds? It's the American way
I'll change history and I'll change hands and horses
Chompin' at the bit 'cause the father raised an idiot
I'll change history -I'll change hats and partners
Dazzle 'em with my wit or just baffle them with some bullshit
At the end of the world, the big man came
"you promised last time you wouldn't make it rain"

How long can I run? Don't you see what they'll do to me?
When "they" find out what I've done -how long can I run? (x2)
