We've come together in light of the magical spark
We have our pencils and colors ready to start
The turquoise music fills our hearts
There is a long way to go but the mission is clear
Get our idol in, don't mind the cost or the fear
It doesn't matter why and how often we fall
Miku-chan, we hear your call
Together, forever
Placing pixels day and night
Here, now or never
Today is the time, join our fight
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Let's hope that our dream comes true - comes true
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Because this is what we do
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Come on and join the crew
You place a pixel for me, I place a pixel for you
In red and green and blue
Now there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
Today we need anyone here by our side
Defend the artworks and colors that we placed tonight
Until we see next morning's light
You might also likeWe do the best we can, but the pressure is real
The time is halfway gone, but so much space left to fill
But all we need now is a little more speed
And Miku-chan, we will succeed
With each other, forever
Painting Mikus all day long
Here, now or never
Today is the time, sing her song:
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Let's hope that our dream comes true - comes true
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Because this is what we do
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Come on and join the crew
You place a pixel for me, I place a pixel for you
In red and green and blue
From London to Beijing
In New York at night
We color the canvas
And painting it bright
Black, pink and turquoise
Those colors are mine
Together we let them
Shine
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Let's hope that our dream comes true - comes true
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Because this is what we do
Place a pixel for me, place a pixel for you
Come on and join the crew
You place a pixel for me, I place a pixel for you
