You're gonna say I told you so
I never should have let you go
Ain't it funny that here we are
The two of us in two different bars
In separate cages dancing slow
We ain't got nobody to call our own
Now you can always go back home
Where you just might be there alone
Now I'm drunk and you're insane
And I can't quit and you won't change
Ain't no halfhearted Romeo
Why do you treat me so?
Like our love's a joke
Hurts too much to laugh

Well, can't you at least smile
When you call me that?

Now days are harder than you would believe
Ain't having luck making ends meet
If time were money then look at me
I'm richer than a poor man should be
Price of admission oh it's much too steep
For broke uneducated clowns like me
It may be true I was first to leave
But now I'm begging you please
My heart's on my sleeve
And I'm tipping my hat
You might also like
So can't you at least smile
When you call me that?

Not much is certain but this is true
My arms are useless if they don't have you
They hang around me with nothing to do
I'm hoping you and yours are lonesome too

Neon buzzing and here I am
Last one standing, last call again
While you're unfolding in a stranger's hands
I'll drink up and be somebody's man
Angels can walk I've seen it before
They turn handles and they open doors
They act like devils, now you've been warned
They'll vanish when love is war
I'm down on my knees
And you won't have me back

Well, can't you at least smile
When you call me that?
I'm down on my knees
When you won't have me back
Well, can't you at least smile
