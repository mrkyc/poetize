We'd feel much better
If we sunk this treasure
And we laid our armor down
Now, these precious metals
These captain's letters
Are no use to us now
Oh, in the day, we struggle with fatigue
Much greater than any offer was
We bow down and worship
These bandits and cowboys
Unable to hold their own guns

Now, I know that soldiers are not paid to think
But something is making us sick
Onward and steady, able and young
In the valley of the low, low sun

Oh, in the shade, we wander
Along a highway shoulder
Out into the back of beyond
Burning the daylight
Into a pastime
That's too wise to come more than once
Oh, it's boom, boom, thunder
Ain't no sleep coming out
Mining a slippery world
Of snow covered beaches
Junkyards of diesel
And bombers named after girls
You might also like
On bridges of black ice not built for the rush
There's a new kind of beast getting up
Stranger than fiction, speaking in tongue
In the valley of the low, low sun

I hold on for the slow turning
Smoke if you got 'em boys
This is bottom hiding out
Down under the stairs
Tomorrow has come like it's drunk on the blood
Of men who have dared to be there

The earth's still climbing
As it keeps on grinding
Its way up around the sun
As cool water crashes
Down to the masses
Bootlegged and bottled like rum
My dreams are humble
And lean as arrows
And streetwise ready and fair
As we bum rush the ages
Tied to the rails
On high seas not fit to be sailed
Whatever we've taken does feel like heaven
But baby, we just look like hell
Now act like you mean it, where paradise was
In the valley of a low, low sun
Act like you mean it, where paradise was
