Down from the mountain out walking the flood
I see the future in this setting sun
Unfolded gardens uncover the earth as it was
Filled with canteens and tear gas from this last voyage of us
Ain't no gentlemen here hiding wings
The devil himself would be puzzled to give
Any reasons to sink his fingers in
All this voodoo and black magic doing the work that was his

With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give 'em tears for cherry red blood
Stack 'em old, we cradle them young
World is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love

Now split this ocean set these sails
It's down to the seabed we dazzle and fail
Hereafter's bringing more funerals than fairs
And it's a book of blank maps that we're using to get us there
Now through the hilltops my daughter, my son
The rescue's too little to cover the slums
Cross this river deeper than it ever was
There's a pause in the evening when prayers are supposed to be done
You might also like
With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give 'em tears for cherry red blood
Stack 'em old, we cradle them young
World is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love

Glory, glory hallelujah, be warned
God is still marching, still raising his sword
Board these windows and guard your stretch of floor
Now something sinister's got you the minute you open the door

With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give 'em tears for cherry red blood
Stack 'em old, we cradle them young
This world is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love

This world is crazy or maybe she's holy rollers for love
