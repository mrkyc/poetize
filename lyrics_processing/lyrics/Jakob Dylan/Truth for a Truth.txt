I'm up here somewhere so high and they climb
There's too many people running loose in the mind
Now send us a king or someone else that can bring
Some order where otherwise everything is

Eye for an eye and truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
Yes you would be blind if you only knew
That it was eye for an eye and it's truth for a truth

Now pack up your wagon, girl, and button your coat
Look up and see me coming out of smoke
There's footprints of angels leaving tracks in the snow
I'm the last man, that sweetheart, you oughta know

When it's eye for an eye and truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
Yes you would be blind if you only knew
That it was eye for an eye, it's truth for a truth

Oh now it's good to be hungry
The apple of somebody's eye
Ain't nothing so pretty in this terrible light
Now all hands on deck and all men to the tower
I'm a virtue-less man in the midnight hour
You might also like
Oh now it's junk on junk, this bed that we've made
Where I sleep like a horse standing up on the clay
I've got to be ready, so much hell to pay
And I'm guilty of loving you in the worst kind of way

And it's eye for an eye, it's truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
Yes you would be blind if you only knew
That it was eye for an eye, it's truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
Where it's eye for an eye and it's truth for a truth
You'd be blind if you only knew
