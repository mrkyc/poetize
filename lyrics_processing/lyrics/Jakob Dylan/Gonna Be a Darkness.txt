There's gonna be roses and your picture in a frame
The women will be cryin' and the men they will whisper your name
Umbrellas will be open on a hillside of graves
The children will be dressed up and chase each other in the rain

And there's gonna be a darkness
It may be colder than you guessed
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
There may not be angels fillin' the air
Your mother may be there
Your father may be there
There may not be voices sent from a throne
To carry you home

Now Heaven may not get you: the Devil may see you first
He's hittin' himself in both the beast and the birth
A stranger may have found you where the angels have lulled you to sleep
They swallow you whole like a whale from your head to your feet

And there's gonna be a darkness
It may be colder than you guessed
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
There may not be angels fillin' the air
Your mother may be there
Your father may be there
There may not be voices sent from a throne
To carry you home
You might also like
Where you think there's a place
Wide open and white
Where you think you'll be safe
Where you think there's a light

There's gonna be a darkness
May be colder than you guessed
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
There may not be angels fillin' the air
Your mother may be there
Your father may be there
There may not be voices sent from a throne
To carry you home

There may not be music, there may not be stairs
There may not be angels fillin' the air
Your mother may be there
Your father may be there
There may not be voices sent from a throne
To carry you home

There's gonna be roses and your picture in a frame
