All the faces, all the voices blur
Change to one face, change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed
The light seems bright and glares on white walls
All the sounds of Charlotte Sometimes
Into the night with Charlotte Sometimes

Night after night, she lay alone in bed
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Her eyes so open to the dark, the streets all looked so strange
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
They seemed so far away, but Charlotte did not cry
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)

The people seemed so close to playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close, so many other names

Sometimes I'm dreaming, where all the other people dance
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming, Charlotte Sometimes
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Expressionless the trance, sometimes I'm dreaming
You might also like
So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming, the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world
Come to me scared princess, Charlotte sometimes

On that bleak track, see the sun has gone again
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
The tears were pouring down her face
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)

Sometimes I dream where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream, the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
There are so many different names
Sometimes I dream, sometimes I dream

Charlotte Sometimes, crying for herself (Charlotte Sometimes)
(Charlotte Sometimes)
Charlotte Sometimes dreams a wall around herself
(Charlotte Sometimes, Charlotte Sometimes)
But it's always with love, with so much love (Charlotte Sometimes)
It looks like everything else (Charlotte Sometimes)
Of Charlotte Sometimes, so far away (Charlotte Sometimes)
Glass sealed and pretty, Charlotte Sometimes
