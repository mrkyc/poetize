I'm like a double deck boom box on your shoulder
When it stops, you flip it and play it over
I'm a 7-eleven blinking open sign
A little buzz, a little fizz, a little here all night
I've got a short fuse, you got the touch
You know what to do when I'm coming unplugged

You put the neon in my halo, halo
I knew you once in a midnight kiss
It's lights out but you're blowing my breaker
With a whisper you flip my switch

Yeah, you're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric
You're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric, yeah

You're like a red Les Paul layin' on your chest
With your heart beat-beating all through my head
You say my name like it's shining in a marquee lights
Like you live-wired the stars right up in the sky
You might also like
You put the neon in my halo, halo
I knew you once in a midnight kiss
It's lights out but you're blowing my breaker
With a whisper you flip my switch

You're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric
You're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric

Oh baby, I'm electric
Sparks gonna fly like a lightning bolt
It's a shock to my heart when you get that close
Sparks gonna fly like a lightning bolt
It's a shock to my heart when you get that close

You put the neon in my halo, halo
I knew you once in a midnight kiss
It's lights out but you're blowing my breaker
With a whisper you flip my switch
You put the neon in my halo, halo
I knew you once in a midnight kiss
It's lights out but you're blowing my breaker
With a whisper you flip my switch
Yeah you're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric
You're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric
You're turning me, turning me
Turning me, turning me, turning me on
Like I'm electric
You're turning me, turning me
