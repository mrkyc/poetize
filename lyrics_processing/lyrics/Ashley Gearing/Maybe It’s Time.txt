If you had a tattoo
I think I got a thing for you
And I'm thinking that you see it too
I like it when you smile at me
In your torn blue jeans
Your sunglasses mirroring me
Mmmm and I like what I see
(Chorus)
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
On a motorcycle ride
My arms wrapped tight around you
Butterlies stuttering down deeper
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Or tell you I've been dreaming of this so long
Maybe it's time
Oh, maybe it's time, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
We'll take a lift down that old dirt road
I know a place we can go
We'll see how good you are at skipping stones
Mmmm
Where the sweet river rolls
We'll carve our names in that old oak tree
So everybody can see
Where they don't talk about you and me
Oh 'cause you know I believe
You might also likeMaybe it's time to move a little closer
On a motorcycle ride
My arms wrapped tight around you
Butterlies stuttering down deeper
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Or tell you I've been dreaming of this so long
Maybe it's time
Oh, maybe it's time, yeah
Yeah yeah
Huh, huh, huh, baby
And when you hold my hand
I don't think you understand
How my heart beats out of my chest
I can hardly catch my breath
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
On a motorcycle ride
My arms wrapped tight around you
Butterlies stuttering down deeper
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
On a motorcycle ride
My arms wrapped tight around you
Butterlies stuttering down deeper
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Maybe it's time
Oh, maybe it's time
Oh, yeah
Maybe it's time
Oh, maybe it's time
Yeah, baby
