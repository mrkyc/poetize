Call it in the air, call it anything you want
But I'm still calling it gone
Used to be a name, used to be an answer
Now I'm just a dial tone

You you should get used to, whatever this used to be
Being something that you can't have
So let me tell you where I'm at

'Cause I
Have been waiting around for you
To come runnin' me down
Can't pick me up and drive me just like that
Won't be a penny on your train track
I ain't listenin' 'cause you
You're just blowin' steam
All your lies ain't gonna leave me flat
Won't be a penny on your train track

I can hear you rollin', I can see your smoke
Callin' from a mile away
I just wanna shout and I know you're the kind
That's gonna try and make a change
I don't belong in your pocket so I'm gonna stop you
Before your start it up again
This is me slipping right out of your hands
You might also like
'Cause I
Have been waiting around for you
To come runnin' me down
Can't pick me up and drive me just like that
Won't be a penny on your train track
I ain't listenin' 'cause you
You're just blowin' steam
All your lies ain't gonna leave me flat
Won't be a penny on your train track
Penny on your train track

You, you should be used to whatever this used to be
Being something that you can't have
So let me tell you where I'm at

'Cause I
Have been waiting around for you
To come runnin' me down
Can't pick me up and drive me just like that
Won't be a penny on your train track
I ain't listening 'cause you
You're just blowin' steam
All your lies ain't gonna leave me flat
Won't be a penny on your train track
