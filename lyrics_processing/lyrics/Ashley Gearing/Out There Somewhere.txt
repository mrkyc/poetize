And I've come up empty handed
I'm lost and feeling stranded
Here without you
I feel like the world is watching
Can't breathe my heart is stopping
Sun melts and fades away to another day
Where are you?
(To feel you)
I'll be waiting
(To touch you)
I'll be praying
(To hear you)
To give you all of my heart
I know you're out there somewhere
Tell me how to get there
Every road I take
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
I can feel you thinking
That I'm out there somewhere too
You might also likeMy heart is feeling so cold
It's beating
But I'm all alone
I'm reaching out
And I can feel you getting closer
I've been deep
I've been romantic
I've been hurt and I can't stand it
I want love just like I planned it
Tell me, boy where are you?
(To find you)
I've been searching
(To see you)
I've been burning
And don't you know I've waited so long
I know you're out there somewhere
Tell me how to get there
Every road I take
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
I can feel you thinking
That I'm out there somewhere too
I want to run to you, baby
Hold you in my arms
I just want to be with you, baby
Feeling love so strong
'Cause when the sun goes down
I wanna be by your side
Like a rose to the rain
Like a mark to the flame
I'm going insane waiting for you
(I know you're out there somewhere)
Just tell me how to get there
Every road I take
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
I can feel you thinking
That I'm out there somewhere too
Out there somewhere
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
How to get there
I know you're out there
