We've been walking on a tightrope
Afraid of falling down
Well, I get so tired of this
Living life in limbo
Maybe it's time to hit the ground
Oh, baby can't you see
All that really matters
Is that we don't stop at the edge
The only way to be happy after
Is when we get out of our heads
Don't it feel good
To let yourself go?
Don't it feel nice
From your head to your toes
Don't it feel good
To set yourself free?
Don't it feel right
When love is the key?
Don't it feel good, baby?
Ah yeah
I really love it
When you wrap your arms around me
And tell me everything's alright
It's so much better
Than I ever thought it could be
Babe, the words just can't describe
You might also likeOoh
Caught up in the moment
Hypnotized by your kiss
Hey, your love really stalls me
And I can't resist
Don't it feel good
To let yourself go?
Don't it feel nice
From your head to your toes
Don't it feel good
To set yourself free?
Don't it feel right
When love is the key?
Don't it feel good, baby?
Ah, come on
Don't it feel good to let your heart be free?
And don't it feel good
When you got the room to breathe
Don't it feel nice to take it in and let it out?
Don't it feel good?
That's what it's all about
Ooh, caught up in the moment
Hypnotized by your kiss
Hey your love really stalls me
And I can't resist
Don't it feel good
To let yourself go?
Don't it feel nice
From your head to your toes
Don't it feel good
To set yourself free?
Don't it feel right
When love is the key?
Don't it feel good, baby?
Don't it feel good
To let yourself go?
Don't it feel nice
From your head to your toes
Don't it feel good
To set yourself free?
Don't it feel right
When love is the key?
Don't it feel good, baby?
Oh, don't it feel good
