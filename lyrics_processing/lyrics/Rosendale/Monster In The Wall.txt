I see a monster in the wall
He's in the air, he's in the halls
When I turn my back he creeps inside my veins
No one listens when I say
That he haunts me every day
Oh I wish that I could chase him far away

I lie awake at night
Pull up the covers tight
I see his shadows dancing 'round
A creeping silhouette
I start to shake and sweat
He's on my ceiling looking down
I beg him please just let me go
Why won't you leave me here alone
From the corners of my room he says

I'm your fear
I'm your hurt
I'm the rumors that you heard
I'm your doubt
I'm your shame
You'll forever be in pain
So I cry
In my bed
Licking wounds that never mend
Wonder if this nightmare ever ends
You might also like
I see a monster in the wall
He's in the air, he's in the halls
When I turn my back he creeps inside my veins
No one listens when I say
That he haunts me every day
Oh I wish that I could chase him far away

He's always on my mind
Nowhere to run or hide
Enough to make me scream and shout
I put the records on
Sing all my favourite songs
But I can never drown him out
I bolt the door I lock me in
Somehow he gets under my skin
And like a ghost he whispers in my head

You're a joke
You're depressed
You're a failure and a mess
You're a fool
You're unloved
You will never be enough
So I hide
In my room
'Cause no one can see my gloom
Wondering what more I have to lose
I see a monster in the wall (Monster)
He's in the air, he's in the halls (In the walls) (Oh oh)
When I turn my back he creeps inside my veins (Inside my veins, inside my veins)
No one listens when I say (I...)
That he haunts me every day (I...)
Oh I wish that I could chase him far away

I see a monster in the wall
He's in the air, he's in the halls
