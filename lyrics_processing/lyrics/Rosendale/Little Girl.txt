Once upon a time in a far away land
A little girl lived under her father's hand
She wept in silence and never talked
Her father made sure that he called the shots
He nailed the door shut so she couldn't leave
Blew out the lights so she couldn't see
But one night she broke through the window pane
Nothing could stop her great escape
'Cause this girl had plans
That he'd never understand
All the miracles she saw in her dreams
All the amazing things that she could be

So the little girl ran away from home you see
Little girl go on and write your story
Little girl rejoice 'cause you're finally free
Little girl be who you wanna be

You already know the strength inside your heart
You don't need someone to tell you who you are
Go and say the words you know you long to speak
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be
Go and say the words you know you long to speak
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be

Twenty years later through the hourglass
The little girl grew up in the time that's passed
All those late nights 'cause she worked three jobs
Started from pennies now she's her own boss
One day she opens up the door to meet
A stranger at window guess who she sees
Her father shows up with a face of red
Head down low he looks up and says
I know you can't forgive, All the things that I did
But I'm hoping that you'll understand
For you I always had a plan

So the little girl showed him all the things she achieved
The world she saw from all the highest peaks
How she moved the mountains with her fingertips
Head to toe her father finally admits

You already know the strength inside your heart
You don't need someone to tell you who you are
Go and say the words you know you long to speak
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be
Go and say the words you know you long to speak
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be
Go and say the words you know you long to speak
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be
Be who you wanna be
Little girl little girl be who you wanna be
Ah-ah-ah
