We've gotta look real hard to find a reason to cry
New York, New York is a friend of the traveling kind
And I'm coming around from years of hard times
He's chased me down through the towns and the miles
Once stilled by love he was bound to roll on by
And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there
Well I'm long gone darlin', lonesome blue
I been thinking of leavin', I been thinkin' of you
But that big city singin', man, I like the way that it shines
I was half a mile from Canada waitin' on a train
Wonderin' and wishin' I could disappear again
I been killed by love still it takes me to the end of the line
And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there
You might also likeWell I've been troubled by love untrue
He's a fool who'll drown in his fountain of youth
I can see that now as I'm walkin' and talkin' with you
Well I been blinded by the sun, washed in the rain
Scattered in America, I'm scatterin' again
But if you're goin' south darlin' I guess I'm travelin' with you
And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there
And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there
Take me with you
Oh won't you take me home
