I wouldn't do anything beautiful and transcendent
No
I'd get my finger into everything I wanted
I'd do all the beautiful things
Those things you can't do
Because nobody wants you to be able to do
The things that make you feel good
Like you can't smoke on the airplane
I remember smoking on the airplane
I used to love to smoke on the airplane
Those were the golden days of air travel
They would just open the door at the airport
And you'd walk right out the tarmac
And up those stairs and light a big cigarette
And stick it in the ashtray
And the stewardess would come along
And if she was hot, you can try to pick her up
Once I was flying
From New York to DC
I didn't have much time
And the stewardess was smoking
She was a dusky tall
American beauty
And I put down my tray table
Snorted a gram of cocaine
Till I got up my courage to say
"Can I have your phone number?"
And she gave me the number
That was the good news
The bad news was I got too stoned and I'd lost the number
The stewardess would've been better than the cocaine
I made an error in judgement
But still I remember smoking on the airplane

Smoking on the airplane, everybody did it
They'd gather at the back on the way to Australia
And all puff up at once outside the bathroom
And that's why if I had wings
That would be a bad idea, hahahahaha, I guess
According to everything I've been taught about the laws of
Ethics and karma and good behavior, hahahahaha
If I had wings, I'd go, yum, yum, yum-yum, yum-yum, yum, ow!
I'd have fun
If I had wings, I'd have fun
Smoking on the airplane
Sunlight on my wings
Sunlight on my wings
Sunlight on my wings
Sunlight on my wings
Sunlight on my wings

Teenage boys used to hijack the airplane and send it to Cuba
Castro would charge 20 grand
The airline would get your airplane back
He had a good business (You can't do that, you can't do that)
