From the box, from the box
Skin hard sails in jail
Hair always cut with a blunt tool
Muscular, but thin like springs, but not steel
For Ford men
Four Ford men
They sell it into vaporizing rulers
Each way up in his own head
Hold up in its fat flicking boxes
Piggy little, piggy little eyes
Holds and scape
Just enough to let in light
Bullet got the wrong bloke, but he don't die anyway
Its nothing mortal, but he don't move
Still half slumped up the wall in a crumpled blanket
My head's been this way for days
(Stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff, stiff)
Wrong bloke drops the gun
Old black pistol onto the bed
Shooter gets up from the other room
Deliberate and stiff
Holds a pistol to the chest of the wrong bloke and pulls the trigger
A thin jet of water hits him in the face like a circus clown
Wrong bloke looks out of big eyes now
He's straining against something he's heard
Just to see what is really happening
He reaches down into the blankets beside him
And comes up with the old black pistol, covered in scratches
Black to bare metal, like it's been kicking around the desert alone for years
Yeah, Bruce Lee
