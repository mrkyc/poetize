I scream, I scream, I scream so much
You know what I mean, this electric stream
And my tears in league with the wires and energy
And my machine, this is my beautiful dream
I'm hurting no one, hurting no one
Hurting no one, hurting no one
I wanna give you everything, I wanna give you energy
I wanna give a good thing, I wanna give you everything
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything
In one final scream of love who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful like a child
I feel tears, and I wanna scream, you know what I mean
This is hurting no one
An eraser of love

Hurt, the necessary feeling

Why don't you call me? I feel like flyin' in two
