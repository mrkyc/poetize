I signed
I signed on the dotted line
And I lost my shirt
I signed on the dotted line
He stole my shirt
I fell in love
In love I fell
She stole my shirt
I fell, I fell, I fell in love, I fell
I got, I got ripped off
I lost my shirt

Walk on
Don't try hard to be a flirt
Get your shirt
Get your hands out of the dirt
Get your shirt
Walk on
Get your shirt, get your shirt
Walk on and wait
For the music of the spheres
To move the stars
Into the right position
To reclaim my fortune
I want my shirt back
No, not a hair shirt
A fun fare shirt

Don't try hard to be a flirt
Get your shirt, get your shirt
Get your hands out of the dirt
Get your shirt, get your shirt

Don't try hard to be a flirt
Get your shirt, get your shirt
'Cause nobody loves a jerk
Get your shirt, get your shirt
It's getting harder to be free
It's getting so much harder to be me
It's getting so much harder to be
It's getting so much harder to be free


Get your ass out of the dirt
Get your shirt baby, get your shirt
Wake up, don't be a flirt, come on
Get your shirt, get your shirt
Don't try hard to be a flirt
Get your shirt, get your shirt
Get your hands out of the dirt
Get your shirt, get your shirt
Be a president or clerk
Get your shirt, get your shirt
'Cause nobody loves a jerk
Get your shirt, get your shirt
It's getting harder to feel free
It's getting so much harder just to be
Don't try hard to be a flirt
Get your shirt
Get your hands out of the dirt
Get your shirt
Be a president or clerk
Get your shirt, get your shirt
'Cause nobody loves a jerk
It's getting harder to be free
