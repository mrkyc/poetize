In the wind, dangling
Your sun, fly
Your window, shattering
Your rails, your thin
Your thin paper wings
Sugarbox, sugarboy
Riding in, riding in

Handheld candle sugarboy
Your rails, your thin

In the wind, dangling
Your sun, fly
Your window shattered in the wind
Your Coca Cola stain

Outside your window
Bootleg babies call to you
Lying among the mosquitos
That summer's fever coming
Cats are gathering outside your window
Homeless strays, bootleg babies
Calling to you, lying among
Lying among among the mosquitos

There is a sound on the other side of this wall
A burning singing on the other side of this glass
Footsteps concealed, silence is preserving the voice
Walking in the wind at the water's edge
Comes close to covering my rubber feet
Listening to the barbed wire hanging
There is a sound on the other side of this wall
A burning singing on the other side of this glass
Footsteps concealed, silence is preserving the voice
Silver chain, thrown away, broken wing
Silver and blue and blue and denim
And silver and red and silver and red
And blue and yellow and white and blue
And blue and red and grey and red and
Green and blue and yellow and black and
Black and red and green and white and blue (and blue)
And grey and blue and white and yellow
And black and white and blue (and blue)
