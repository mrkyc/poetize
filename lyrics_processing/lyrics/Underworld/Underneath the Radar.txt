We live underneath the radar
No sign on screen
We dance underneath the radar
Between the walls, well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did something fall? Well, hey
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?
See ya later, see ya later
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
See ya later, call me
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
We kiss underneath the search lights
And we live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
(So get hip)
We speak, unheard
Like ants we dance between the towers
We sleep, they move
Come sailin' over the horizon
Between the walls, well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did something fall? Well, hey
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?
See ya later, see ya later
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
See ya later, call me
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
We kiss underneath the search lights
And we live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
(So get hip)
He says I am the doctor in a B-52
I come across the horizon
Drop my love on you
I'm gonna woo ya all, watch out
I'm gonna woo ya all, see ya later
See ya later, see ya later
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
See ya later, call me
Between the walls, well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did something fall? Well, hey
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
