Come along, it is the break of day
Surely now you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me

So come along, it won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt; tomorrow we'll be free, yeah

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found

Well, it's been rough but we'll be just fine
We'll work it out, yeah, we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate

So come along, it won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt; tomorrow we'll be free, yeah

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
