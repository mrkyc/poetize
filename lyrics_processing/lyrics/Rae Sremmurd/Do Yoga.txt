Caught shawty in the rover, she said she a smoker
But the girl ain't a roller, shawty colder than a cola
She don't even want me, cause she want my nigga Bola
All she wanna do is fuck and smoke my doja
Ain't that some shit? I'm lovin' that chick
She a die hard fan of that dick, she want a pic
Stretched out in the front, stretched out in the back
Stretched out my pocket, stretched out my sack

She ain't outchea chasin' niggas, lookin' crazy, that shit overrated (That shit overrated)
