I done seen stars a million times
And they only come out at night
How come they only shine bright at night? (How come?)
Uh
Been around, seen stars all my life
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
Just like us

Woke up faded, still drunk from yesterday
Last night was crazy, last night was wavy
Came a 100 deep, we wasn't even on the list
We was in the buildin', big bottles of prometh
I'm in the moment, only thinkin' 'bout right now
You know the lifestyle, we up all night now
Come here baby, let me take you on a trip
Don't you love nights like this

I done seen stars a million times
And they only come out at night
How come they only shine bright at night?
Uh
Been around, seen stars all my life
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
Just like us, damn
You wanna scream and shout
You wanna scream and shout
It ain't no more daddy's little girl
Don't you feel like you can take on the world?
You wanna scream and shout
Ain't no turnin' down
