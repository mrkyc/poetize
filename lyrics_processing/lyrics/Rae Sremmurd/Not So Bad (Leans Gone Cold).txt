My lean's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all
Three-point-five clouds up my window, and I can't see at all

Big shot, big dog, block too hot, gotta cool off (Cool off)
CCTV runnin' 24/7, you better not move wrong (Move wrong)
I can see the wallet, chain hangin' off my shadow (Shadow)
USD's and euros, I do 'em so foul, do free-throw's (Free throw's)
Just left the jeweler, weigh my neck down with two kilo's (Kilo)
It's you, it's not me though, speed limit sixty, over
Twist up three-point-five and I smell older, I'm in the ozone

My lean's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all
Three-point-five clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could, it would all be grey, but these racks stack up too tall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad at all
