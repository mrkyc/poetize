Farmer John, I'm in love with your daughter
The one with the champagne eyes
She knows that I love her ever since she showed me those eyes

Farmer John, someday I will marry
The one with the champagne eyes
She won't accept my hand, she won't wear my wedding band

I dig the way she walks, the way she talks
She really knocks me out when she starts moving slow

Let me tell ya Farmer John, I'm in love with your daughter
The one with the champagne eyes
With the champagne eyes
With the champagne eyes
With the champagne eyes
With the champagne eyes
