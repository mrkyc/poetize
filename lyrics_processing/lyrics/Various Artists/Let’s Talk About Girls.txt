Huh, you wanna know
Why I'm not true?
You wanna know
What's wrong with you?
But nothing's wrong girl
You're feeling so tough
Just one girl for me
And that ain't enough

Ha! I've got to love 'em all babe
Not just a few
Got to love 'em all girl
That's what I've got to do!

Oh yeah!
Talk about girls
I mean yeah!
Talk about girls
Girls who beg for more!

See that baby girl there
Just walking by
Turns me on when she
Give me the eye
There goes another one
Lookin' so fine
I won't be happy
Till I make her mine
You might also like
I got to love 'em all
Not just a few
I got to love 'em all baby!
That's what I've got to do!

Oh yeah!
Talk about girls
Talk about girls
Talk about girls
Girls who beg for more!

Talk about girls
Talk about girls
Talk about girls
Talk-talk talk about girls
Talk-talk-talk-talk
Talk about girls...
Talk about women!
