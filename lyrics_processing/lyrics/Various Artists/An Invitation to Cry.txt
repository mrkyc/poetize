Everybody knows the way I feel inside
I just can't accept an invitation to cry
No, I don't wanna cry
Open up the mail and much to my surprise
I read your card and tears came to my eyes
I just can't accept an invitation to cry
No, I don't wanna cry
I can just see myself falling to pieces
When you say, "I do"
Here comes the bride and my pride is in pieces
Wish it were me walkin' with you
Cry
No, no, I don't wanna cry
I can just see myself falling to pieces
When you say, "I do"
Here comes the bride and my pride is in pieces
Wish it were me walkin' with you
I don't wanna go, 'cause I don't wanna cry
Everybody knows the way I feel inside
I just can't accept an invitation to cry
No, I don't wanna cry
