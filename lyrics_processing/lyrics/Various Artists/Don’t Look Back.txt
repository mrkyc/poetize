You're gonna have to sleep there
Old Man Blues is goin' to try
Try to find you everywhere
 oh, you better not look now
 he's coming for you
 keep on running
Running till the end of time, oh yeah
If you both have faith you'll find
A sunny day
Don't be bothered by what
Smaller minds have got to say, just
 oh, you better not look now
 he's coming after you
 you gotta keep running, yeah
Running till the end of time, yeah

 wanna say now
 oh yeah
Talk, talk, talk, talking trash
Talk, talk, talking trash
Truth is the light 
The light is the way 
The less folk know 
The more they've got to say 
And if you want me to 
Here's what I'll do for you 
I'll light a candle and I'll pray
The Lord will bless you
I hope that someday He will understand
But till they do
You might also like oh, you better not look now
 he's coming after you
 you gotta keep running, yeah
Running till the end of time, oh yeah
 oh, you better not look now
 he's coming after you
 you'd better keep running, yeah
