Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)
You are

More than a woman
More than a woman to me (Baby)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me

Shoo-doo, doo-doo
More than a woman
You might also like
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
(Let history repeat itself)
Reflecting how I feel for you
I'm thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)
You are

More than a woman (More than woman)
More than a woman to me (Yes, you are, baby)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me

Shoo-doo, doo-doo
More than a woman
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me, yeah
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Every day of my life)
More than a woman (Oh, baby)
More than a woman to me, yeah (You are, you are, you are)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (She treats me good like a lover should)
More than a woman (Yeah)
More than a woman to me (Yeah), yeah
