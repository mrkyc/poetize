Woah, yeah
Everything gonna be alright this mornin'

I got a little woman, she in the town
She said she love me, but best of all
She's my woman, my own all
She's my lover, yeah, she's my all
We run around, have a lot of fun
She whisper in my ear and say "Oh, you're the one"

Said "Oh yeah", said "Oh yeah"
Said "Oh yeah", "Oh yeah"

Picks up a telephone, called Pa at home
Said "Hey little boy, won't you my daughter alone"

Said "Oh yeah", said "Oh yeah"
Said "Oh yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, a-yeah-yeah-yeah"

I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her
Take it easy, baby
Your temperature runnin' hot
You don't know, baby
Just what 'cha got
You might also like
Said "oh yeah", said "oh yeah"
Said "oh yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, a-yeah-yeah-yeah"

Woah, yeah, I said "Oh yeah"
You know we're runnin' around, havin' a lot of fun
She whisper to me softly and say "Oh, you're the one"

Said "Oh yeah", said "oh yeah"
