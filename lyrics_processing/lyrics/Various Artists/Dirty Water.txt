I'm gonna tell you a story
I'm wanna tell you about my town
I'm gonna tell you a big fat story, baby
Ah, it's all about my town

Yeah, down by the river
Down by the banks of the river Charles
Ah, that's what's happenin', baby
That's where you'll find me
Along with lovers, muggers, and thieves
Ah, but they're cool people

Well, I love that dirty water
Oh Boston, you're my home
Ah, you're the number one place

Frustrated women, I mean they're frustrated
Have to be in by twelve o'clock
Ah, that's a shame
But I'm a-wishin' and a-hopin', oh
That just once those doors weren't locked
I like to save time for my babe to walk around
You might also like
Well, I love that dirty water
Oh Boston, you're my home, oh yeah

'Cause I love that dirty water
Oh Boston, you're my home, oh yeah

Well, I love that dirty water (I love it, baby)
I love that dirty water (I love Boston)
I love that dirty water (Have you heard about the Strangler?)
I love that dirty water (I'm the man, I'm the man)
I love that dirty water (Owww!)

I love that dirty water (A-come on, a-come on)
