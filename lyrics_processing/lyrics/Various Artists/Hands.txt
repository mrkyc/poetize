Can hold a gun and hold your heart
Can put out fires and make 'em start
Skin and bones and flesh and blood
With all this nerve, how did we get this numb?

They can hurt, they can heal
They can give back or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Oh, hands
Hands
Woah, oh, hands (Hands)
Oh, hands
They can love or they can take
They can fight up until they save
They can break the world
Or they can change it too
Oh, hands

Your hands change the world, mm
You might also like
Doesn't matter who you love
All that matters is your love (Is your love)
I've been watching news and seeing all this hate
Tell me, is it wrong to want a little change?

They can hurt, they can heal
They can give back or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Oh, hands
Hands
Woah, oh, hands
Oh, hands
'Cause they can love or they can take
They can fight up until they save
They can break the world
Or they can change it too
Oh, hands

A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down (Oh)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down (Oh)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Oh, oh
Can hold a gun and hold your heart
Can put out fires and make 'em start
I've been watching news and seeing all this hate
Tell me, is it wrong to want a little change?

Oh, hands
Hands
Woah, oh, hands (Ooh)
Hands
They can love or they can take (Yeah)
They can fight up until they save (Oh yeah)
They can break the world (Change the world)
Or they can change it too
Oh, hands

A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down (Oh)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down (Oh)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Oh, oh
Just take my hand, baby
Everybody say love
All that matters is your love (Change it or break it)
(They can take it, take it all)
(Oh, oh)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
A million hands can break it down
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
