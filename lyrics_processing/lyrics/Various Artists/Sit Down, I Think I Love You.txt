Sit down, I think I love ya
Anyway, I'd like to try
I can't stop thinkin' of ya
If you go I know I'll cry

If you want someone to love ya
Pretty baby, make it me
It's not much I'm askin' of ya
Just try me, and you'll see

Baby, can't ya see that I'm a desperate man?
I get high just a-thinkin' about ya
You know what they say about the bird in the hand?
And that's why I ain't leavin' without ya
