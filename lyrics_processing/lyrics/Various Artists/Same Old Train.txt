Well I got on in Bristol, by the old Virginia line
With a suitcase full of dreams
And a brand new spendin' dime

I had a bouquet of music, wrapped in pretty words
Singin' songs sent down from Heaven
On the wings of a speckled bird
Wings of a speckled bird

I heard a guitar and a fiddle, banjo and mandolin
An old man opened up the door and told me, "come on in"

He took my ticket, then he told me
Bring what it is you do
'Cause that's how you'll be remembered
When your travelin' days are through
When your travelin' days are through

They came from the hills and mountains
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle
And some too wild to tame
You might also like
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Just a different time

We sung songs in war, we sung songs in peace
We traveled in abundance and we traveled on relief

From the outer gates of Heaven, to hell fire's burnin' door
It don't matter where you take it
'Cause it's been there before
It's been there before

They came from the hills and mountains
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle
And some too wild to tame

A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine

It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Just a different time
Now like a precious treasure, that's immeasurable in worth
We stand before a new wave, proud children of the earth

We'll go on forever, and here's your solid proof
As long as there's a world we've gotta sing
Those folks the truth
Sing those folks the truth

They came from the neon cities
The suburbs and the towns
From Bakersfield to Baltimore
It's sacred holy ground

A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time


It's the same old train, it's just a different time
