It's a happening
Would you believe?
It's a happening
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
The sky's falling
No show's calling
The world is turning around and 'round
Would you believe?
It's a happening
Would you believe?
It's a happening
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Spray the weeds
A zephyr breathes
A mushroom hangs above the ground
Would you believe?
It's a happening
Would you believe?
It's a happening
