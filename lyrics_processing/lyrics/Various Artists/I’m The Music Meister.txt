Then it sounds to me like it's time to rumble!

Indeed, but it is you who will take the
Tumble

I'm sorry, hon', but did you just sing that?

Of course I did
Not!
Wait, yes I
Did!
I'm sounding shrill against my will
And cannot stop this singing!

And in my ears, I swear I hear a quite distinctive ringing!

This silly game is very lame, and someone's going to pay!

An unknown force, but where's the source that has us in its sway?
You might also like
Who is doing this to us? And on this, we must concur

They're dastardly, despicable
Disturbingly inexplicable

And imminently kickable!

That dirty, rotten rat is...

The Music Meister!
Put down your arms, my friends
Your arrows, guns, and swords
Your resistance to my charm now ends
When I belt these power chords!
Good guys or bad guys, it doesn't really matter
You are all just slaves to my hypnotic patter
As I regale you with my story, you'll know you have no choice
But to do my evil bidding, when you hear this booming voice!
Oh, I'm the Music Meister!
He's the Music Meister!

And everyone just fawns!

He's the Music Meister, and we are all his pawns!

And so for me, it's destiny:
'To be the maestro of villainy!'
Yes, I'm the Music Meister
And I'm here to settle the score!
(spoken)
You see, I too have plans for this satellite!
And now that I've established who's in charge...
Get to work!
(sung)
The bullies used to pick on me because I sang in choir
But something very strange occurred when I kept singing higher!
The ruffians around me quickly fell into a trance
And it was then with wicked glee I made those puppets dance!
I'm the Music Meister!
He's the Music Meister

And everyone just fawns!

He's the Music Meister!
And we are all his pawns!

I'm the Music Meister!
Crime became my path!

He's the Music Meister
And we must beware his wrath!

That voice! Beautiful!

(*Exchange of pitches until Black Canary hits her sonic scream pitch and blasts the Music Meister*)

You better tow the line you see
Because your wills belong to me
And now my friends, you have the chance
To show Batman how well you dance!
Muahahahaha!
And now that Batman's been delayed, your usefulness has passed
A distraction is what I need, so kick into that blast!
Oh, I'm the Music Meister!
I cannot help but boast!

He's the Music Meister
Under his spell we're toast!

I'm the Music Meister
I've won the day, now I must fly!
I'm the Music Meister
