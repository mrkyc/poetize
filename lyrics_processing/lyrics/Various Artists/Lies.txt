Lies, lies
You're tellin' me that you'll be true
Lies, lies
That's all I ever get from you

Tears, tears
I shed a million tears for you
Tears, tears
And now you're lovin' someone new

Someday I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know when just now
Lies, lies
Breakin' my heart

You think that you're such a smart girl
And I'll believe what you say
But who do you think you are, girl
To lead me on this way?  Hey

Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
Are gonna make you sad someday
You might also like
Someday you're gonna be lonely
But you won't find me around
Lies, lies
Breakin' my heart, ahhh, yeah!


Someday I'm gonna be happy

To lead me on this way?  Hey

Lies, (Ah!) lies (Yeah, baby!)
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
Are gonna make you sad someday
Someday you're gonna be lonely
But you won't find me around
Lies, lies
Breakin' my heart

(Ah, I said, baby, now) Breakin' my heart
(Ow, you're just breakin' my heart) Breakn' my heart
