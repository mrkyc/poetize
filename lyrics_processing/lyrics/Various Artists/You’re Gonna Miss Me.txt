Oh, yeah, oh
Yeah!

You're gonna wake up one morning
As the sun greets the dawn
You're gonna wake up one morning
As the sun greets the dawn
You're gonna look around in your mind, girl
You're gonna find that I'm gone

You didn't realize
You didn't realize
You didn't realize
You didn't realize

Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby
Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby

I gave you the warning
But you never heeded it
How can you say you miss my lovin'
When you never needed it?
Yeah, yeah, ow!
