Hehehehehehe
Hahahahahaha

All you hoes wanna know who I am (Uh huh)
Well, good, 'cause I'm steppin' on your toes again (Let's do it)
I'm a weirdo (Let's go), I'm a weirdo (Let's go)
I'm a weirdo (Let's go), I'm a weirdo (Let's go)
You heard me right when I talk my shit (Uh huh)
Y'all basic motherfuckers can't handle it (Uh)
I'm a weirdo (Let's go), I'm a weirdo (Let's go)
I'm a weirdo (Let's go), I'm a weirdo (Let's go)

You're mayonnaise, I'm Miracle Whip
You're mayonnaise, I'm Miracle Whip
You're mayonnaise, I'm Miracle Whip
You're a bland ass ho and I'm a spicy dip

I write my own shit, yeah, I admit that
But you are four bars, that's a Kit Kat
I'm the one that put gay rap on the map
And that is not a read, that is just a fact
I rep New York on the West Coast
And I put hot sauce on my french toast
I'm the big boss, giving them big shows
And I never take selfies with my bank roll

I'm a feisty bitch with a dicey quip
Freeze the room when I throw shade, I got my ice equipped
And I'm givin' basic hoes a hella mighty tip
You ain't ever toppin' me, it just ain't likely, bitch
I'm a weirdo, made it clear, though
You see the headlights on my car and you like deer, so
I swerve the left straight out the gate and switch the gear, go
Then mow you down, you my lawn, John Deere, ho

All you hoes wanna know who I am
Well, good, 'cause I'm steppin' on your toes again
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
You heard me right when I talk my shit
Y'all basic motherfuckers can't handle it
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Let's go, 2-3-4
All the weirdos droppin' hard on the floor
Don't wanna see the same dusty couture
Wanna stir it up? Bitch, what you think I came for?

 I'm freaky, digitally creepy
 my concepts are fleek-y
I come through like Kim P., can tell 'em to beep me
Callin' hoes out 'cause I don't do repeats
Yvie, let me rewind for the kids in the back
Thinkin' they done made ack, now they just maniacs
I make a brick house out of all of my racks
Gotta cut 'em at the wrist when they read for the back
(Back, back, back, back)

All you hoes wanna know who I am
Well, good, 'cause I'm steppin' on your toes again
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo

I'm a weirdo, I'm a weirdo
