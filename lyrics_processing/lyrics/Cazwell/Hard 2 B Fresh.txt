(Ain't nobody fresher than)

It's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
Baby, it's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best

It doesn't matter if I get your number
I'll lose it before you get hit the covers
It doesn't matter if I get your name
I won't forget your face
If it's a blaze I came
It doesn't matter if your friends hate on me
They're looking at me like a flushing is on me
You might also like
You might think I'm egotistical
But I'm capital "I", Irresistible
You might think I'm outta my mind
(And I just might be, I just might be)
Got a mind like mine, so hard to find
It don't have to be brain surgery
So much to choose, it's t-shirt time
Is it this way T, or is it this way T?
If being this fresh is some kind of a crime
(Somebody betta call the NYPD)

It's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
Baby, it's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best

If you haven't seen this song
Craigslist or FaceBook, take a look
Imma flip this switch
I'm like the big boss
In my helicopter, like-Iana Ross
I'm on the hot sauce in the V.I.P.s
You so sprung, so I speak in chinese
(B-b-bitch, please!)
Now, you do the math
I'm busy in full loops in my bubble bath
Exfoliate, moisturise, SPF 45 if I go outside
Gimme the details, I'll give you the cost
On mark, pills in a box, party, lunchbox
I don't care if you're straight or been
You rub my dick so much you should be payin' rent
I eat my haters with a knife and fork
My name is Cazwell, from the planet New York

It's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
Baby, it's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
Baby, it's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
Baby, it's so hard being fresh, being fresh
Baby, don't you forget
You're the best, you're the best
You're the best (best best best...)
