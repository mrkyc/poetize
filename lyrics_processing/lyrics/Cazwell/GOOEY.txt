Gooey

I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me
Get me gassed up, messed up, stick it to me
I love it when you slide on my back, dance for me
I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me (Eh!)
I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me (Uh!)
Get me gassed up, messed up, stick it to me
I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me
Do me
Do me
Do me
(Do me)
Gooey

Is this the cocksucker residence?
I'm in the right place
He got a big fat dick but I'm about face
Got him lined up, attention about face
My man don't sniff the glue but he lick the paste
Daddy, can you spread me like peanut butter?
Break my back then change the covers
Crack that nut then bust another
Head held high, mind in the gutter

I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me
Gooey when you do me
Gooey when you do me

Keypads on the celtics
Seems like a sweet guy
So I gave him the bustin' creampie
Sits in the sling every time he swings by
I'ma hook him up with a high protein diet
I'ma fuck you like a zillionaire
Put that dick in intensive care
Upside down, hanging on the stairs
Rip off your clothes, fuck up your hair

I love it when you get me all gooey when you do me
Get me gassed up, messed up, stick it to me
