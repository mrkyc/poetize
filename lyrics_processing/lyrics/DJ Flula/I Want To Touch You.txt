My love
You are so far away from me right now
You are so many meters away
Let us change those meters into centimeters
I want to touch you
On your face and your body and your heart as well
I want to touch you
Will you touch me in return?

Because you are hottie
Your body, your brains, your soul make me want to
Touch your heart right now
I know there are other boys so please tell them
That I alone will enter your cerebellum
Your wishes, your dreams, please let me spell them
Touch MY HEART right now
If you are a tree, I will be your forest
If you are a rose, I will be your florist
If you are a Chuck, I will be your Norris
If you are a verse, I will be your chorus
If you are a Zack, I will be your Morris
If you are a map, I will be two explorers
If you are a Yeltsin, I will be your Boris
If you are some rhymes, I will be your rhino-saurus

On your face and your body and your heart as well
I want to touch you

Will you touch me in return?
