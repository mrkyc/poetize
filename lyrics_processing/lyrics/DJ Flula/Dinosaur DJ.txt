It is five hundred trillion BC
And the asteroid is coming for the Earth
Everyone there is happsy:
The dinosaurs, the ferns, the, uh, the fishes
But in one second
Everything is away
Everything is dead; the asteroid has kill it
And the place is silent
Only ashes are there and smoke
And silence
Except for one thing
A beat...
Coming from deep, deep in the cave...
There is one survivor
It's a dinosaur...
The Dinosaur DJ

You might also likeHello, why are you so stoic?
Have you never seen a DJ from the Mesozoic?
Before time did exist I was honing my chops
Rap battling the local Triceratops
Now with champagne, campaign, caviar, flex!
Slapping challengers like I was T-Rex!
My beats cut sharp like a Stegosaurus
Who am I?
Just listen to the chorus!
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I am a dinosaur)
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I trample everywhere)
(Everywhere)
Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I am a dinosaur)
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I'm scaly; I don't have no hair)
(Have no hair)
Cutting Billboard hits with my dino focus
Other DJs are dumb like a Diplodocus
Challenge me?
Oh that's classic
I'll kick you quick back to the Jurassic
No private jets, no, they are too fragile
When I fly to shows I fly Pterodactyl
My ancient sounds
Cannot be destroyed!
I survive all things, even asteroids!
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I am a dinosaur)
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I trample everywhere)
(Everywhere)
Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I am a dinosaur)
I'm a Dinosaur D-D-DJ
(I'm scaly; I don't have no hair)
(Have no hair)
Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch my beats
Mm-mm

My beats are hot, so hot they will burn
I don't need no money I get paid in ferns
In a staring contest, oh yes, I will win
Because you will blink
And I have no eyelids
My beats are hot
Are hot
Are hot
Are hot
My beats are hot
Are hot
Pay my money -- no, pay me a fern!
I want a large cactus
I'm a dinosaur I can eat anything
I just ate Chlorophyll!
