If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am
If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby

I'm just a man, who comes around at night
And to leave you, girl, baby, that ain't right (Right)
You call me over and give me sexy talk
After things are over, you tell me take a walk, girl

If you think, I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one who's loving you the most, girl
Material things don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend (Yeah)
Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am
If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am

Since this conversation, I'm so confused
Tell me, baby, am I being used?
Dedication is what I want
You being complicated, you know it's just a front, girl

If you think, I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one, who's loving you the most, girl
(Tell me!)
Material things don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am
(Just what I am!)

If I'm not your
If I'm not your
Just tell me what I am (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
If I'm not your (Ah)
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend
Just tell me, baby, just tell me what I am

Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am
