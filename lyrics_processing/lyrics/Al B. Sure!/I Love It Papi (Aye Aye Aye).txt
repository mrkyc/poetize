I like when you receive me
You keep me safe and warm
When your body starts to tremble
It's like a quiet storm
Girl, I love it when you wait for me
And hold on 'til it's time
Girl, then we reach the peak and the explosion hits
Girl, you blow my mind

I love it when you talk to me and say
(Aye, aye, aye)
And I love it when you're close to me it
(Feels so right) Feels so right
I love it when you creep with me
(Creep that way) Ooh, when you creep with me
And I love it when we moan 'til three, feels right
(Ooh, feels right)

All you want from me is just to love you right
And never do you wrong
I love playing in your box when it's late at night
To our favorite song
(When I get this feeling)
I watch your body in the shower
Step into the beauty light
Before you dry off, step into the room
Damn, girl, your body's so right

Mami, I don't think tonight I can abstain

Lady, you should feel free tonight to scream my name, ooh

I love it when you talk to me and say
(Aye, aye, aye)
And I love it when you're close to me it
(Feels so right) Girl, it feels so right
I love it when you creep with me
(Creep that way) Creep with me that way
And I love it when we moan 'til three, feels right
(Ooh, feels right) Feels so right
