There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine (Lighting the light)
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise (Now is the time)

Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me feel you in my dreams
I can make it feel so right
And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life, now, woo

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
You might also like
And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make it feel so right, woo
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day now
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life now

Mmm, yes, you will
Stay with me, stay with me
I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go nowhere
Ooh girl, let me keep you warm
(I'm gonna keep you warm)
You are the lady in my life
Fill you with the sweetest love
Always the lady in my life
(I wanna touch you, baby)
Lay back in my tenderness
You are the lady in my life
Feel me with your sweet caress
Always the lady
(You're my lady, and I love you, girl)
Ooh girl, let me keep you warm
You are the lady in my life

Fill you with the sweetest love
(I love you, I love you)
Always the lady in my life
(I need you, I want you, baby)
Lay back in my tenderness

Always the lady
Ooh babe, you're my lady
Don't you go nowhere

All through the night
Ooh girl, let me keep you warm

Fill you with the sweetest love
