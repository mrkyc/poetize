I know she's gonna be surprised
*Door opens*
Al, what are you doing here? Honey, close the door, it's cold
Mmm, I just missed you, honey. And I came to watch you take a bath
Come in. Wanna join me? I thought you were going to LA?
I had to see that birthmark again. I love you so much. Mmm, this feels good. Here, let me wash your back
Mmm, Al B. (Yeah) I'm glad you came back to play
Ah yeah, I love the way you move
You got me watch you, wanting you
And I know you know
You know they say honesty is the best policy
So I'd like to know, are you free tonight?

I'd like to know if you're free tonight
If so, Natalie
Let it rain, let it rain

I've sailed a thousand seas
All seas of pain
For a woman that's true to me
And it's only right
That I play the game
Can't you tell me what's on your mind?
Is it me and you tonight?
'Cause I can't bare rejection, baby
Please tell me what it's gonna be

It's like that hurting pain
That same old pain
When she gets used to me
And it just ain't right
But it's all a game
I've been afraid to take a chance
With someone new again
'Cause I'm tired of all the games
Until I find you Natalie

I'd like to know if you're free tonight
