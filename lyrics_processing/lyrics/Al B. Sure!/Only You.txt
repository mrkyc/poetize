Listen

All our friends are breaking up
'Cause they don't never talk things through
All they ever do is making love
Being without you just ain't cool
You're my baby and I'm feeling you
There's no place I'd rather be, yeah
Than wrapped up in your arms tonight
Just you and me

Only you could love me the way you do
Only you would put up with the things I do
(Yes you would, know you would)
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (Ah-ha, ha)
Only you can love me the way do
(Yes you do, I know you do, I know you want it, ooh)

Girl, I like it when you're in the mood
So I play like I'm a drink and you're the food
I'll turn the phone off so no one disturbs our groove
(Don't you dare disturb our groove)
Call in sick so we can spend the day
If you don't mind I want the needle in the hay, yeah
And if I get it, lady, I will stay around
'Cause baby I love you
You might also like
Only you can love me the way you do
(Only you can love me the way you do)
Only you would put up with the things I do
(Woo, sometimes I'm so out of control)
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (Ah-ha, ha)
Only you (You) could love me the way do
(Take it to the bridge now)

Girl, there will be no more lonely nights
(Woo, girl, there will be no more lonely nights)
We'll make love instead of always fighting
So don't disturb our groove
(Girl, you're the only lips, you're the only lips)
The only lips I want to kiss
And I will grant your every wish tonight

Only you can love me the way you do
(Only you can love me, so girl won't you lay your body down)
Only you would put up with the things I do
(I know you would, I know I could, I'll do your body right)
