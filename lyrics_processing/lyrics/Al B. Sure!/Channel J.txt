'Ya know I always see the lady
She drives me crazy all night
Except my baby doesn't know
I need to have that special lady
Channel J might break her heart
If I ever left my baby I'd never be the same
Ya' know
Excuse me if I stop to stare at your body
So fly I don't understand
How could one woman be blessed with so much?
Are you single my lady? I'll be your man!
Girl don't make me promises you can't keep
Promises are conferred to fools
Come straight ahead you know the time
It's you on my mind (that one day you'd know)

Dinner for two, no one else me and you
Candlelight makes it right, romance all night
Please let your hair down, take off your heels
I'll massage you...how does it feel?
You might also likeGirl don't make me waste my time
I won't stop 'til you're mine
I'm trying to see the night when we get it right

Now here comes the man, the man that had the plan
That in one year he would gain a million fans
And if you mapped out how he did
Accomplish and astonish and ground the hearts
Of every kid
Yes I've created a realistic mirage in my garage
That one day Chubb would be large
Not large in the sense that I would be immense
But my financial status and my pockets
Would be the fattest around
With a booming sound which bounds
To give Al B. Sure! a royal crown
On his head or his noggin
I don't know how you be loggin' em
Or the simple sound inside your walkman
When jogging
Or toboggan down the hill with a few minutes
To kill
You flip in the tape and just barely escape
The tree in your way and just realize that
Hey you have to be very careful
Of the tape that you play
If it's one of mine you have to sit
And relax and max
And prepare to hear funky tracks
