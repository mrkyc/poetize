Ah, can you feel it, baby?

Oooh, this love is so
That I won't let you go
Oooh, this love is so
That I won't let you go

Taking the time to show my love for you, no
Do you love me, too, girl?
Oooh, don't tell me, let it show
When you're with me I know for real
That our love can grow (Can grow)
Because the passion you bring to me, my lady
Oooh, I won't go
I see a rose in the sky
I'll reach for you, my love, no, no (No no)
And if a petal should fall
I'll catch your heart for you, oh, no
Whisper to me so that I can see you closer to me
I'm wanting you more and more each day
That's why I'll say

Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go (I won't)
Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go, ooh
You might also like
You're lying there waiting for me to make love to you (To you)
I'll take all the time I need for you to be sure of my love (My love)
Don't be afraid to yell my name
When the love feels this way (Way)
And maybe soon you'll see that I'm sincere
Oooh, you'll say

Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go (I wanna know)
Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go
(Kyle West, break it down)

Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is blind and I don't know what to do
(When you're)
With me you see that I have no fears
But when you leave me all I can say is

Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go (I won't, I won't let you go, no)
Oooh, this love is so, girl
That I won't let you go
Oooh...oh, go (Go go, go go)
