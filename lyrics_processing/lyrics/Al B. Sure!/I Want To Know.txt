Ooh, my baby, can I hold you close to me?
Always thinking about you, and I know you know that
That's why I can't get you off of my mind
Oh, when I was a little boy (Little, little boy)
I thought grown men were not supposed to cry
But now I'm all man, all man now
I can't hold back the tears and I don't know why
