I'm just a man
Who comes around at night
And to leave you, girl
Baby, that ain't right
You call me over and give me sexy talk
After things are over
You tell me take a walk, girl

If you think
I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one
Who's loving you the most, girl
Material things
Don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl
