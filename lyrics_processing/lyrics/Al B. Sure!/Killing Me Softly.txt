I heard she sang a good song
I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
To listen for a while
And there she was, this young girl
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with her fingers
(She was) Singing my life with her words
(Singing my life with her words)
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt she found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that she would finish
But she just kept right on

Strumming my pain with her fingers
(She was) Singing my life with her words
(Singing my life with her words)
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
You might also like
Hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh

She sang as if she knew me, yeah
In all my dark despair
And then she looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
But she just kept on singing strong
Singing clear and

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song (Oh)
Strumming my pain with her fingers
(She was) Singing my life with her words
(She was, she was) (Singing my life with her words)
Killing me softly with her song (Ow)
Killing me softly with her song (Softly)
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song (Oh)
Strumming my pain with her fingers
(She was) Singing my life with her words
(She was, she was) (Singing my life with her words)
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Strumming my pain with her fingers
(She was) Singing my life with her words
(She was, she was, she was) (Singing my life with her words)
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
