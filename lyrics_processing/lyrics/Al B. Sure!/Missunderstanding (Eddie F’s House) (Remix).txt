Missunderstanding, I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding, I don't know what you're planning
Never will you tear me apart

I know I must be dreaming, all these brand new friends
And I've never seen such clever ways to make amends
You never know who's scheming - is she out for self?
Nowadays you've gotta be protective and it's not for health
Don't you know she drives me crazy? Does she like my walk?
Or maybe all she knows is that the money talks
(Money, money, money, money)
It's a shame the way it is I really like her smile
I'd like to get to know her 'cause she drives me wild

(Can you tell me why) You need diamonds, you need pearls
(Don't you know) Don't you know
(To be my lady) To be my lady
(Drive my Mercedes) Drive my Mercedes
(Start giving me your lovin') Hey

I grew up doing right and I won't throw it out
