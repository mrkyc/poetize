Can you feel it, baby?
I know that when I first saw you
I knew you were that special lady
Yeah

All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl
All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl

Ooh, the way you touch my body I get a chill
Every time I see your face, I know
I know I love you still (Still)
Hold my body, hold it tight, and I, and I just might
Take you places you've neer been before
All through the night

All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl
All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl
You might also like
When you're not here with me, I can still taste your lips
Oh, I can feel that heart beat right through me
With just one simple kiss
I'll never leave you
See, we were friends before we were lovers
Oh, and we started out right
Now we've known each other for a little while
Let's make love all through the night

All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl
All the love you give to me
Oh, is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl

Two hearts as one, your hand in mine
Ooh, let's make love like the first time, oh
Two hearts as one, your hand in mine
Keep your eyes on me, as we climb
Higher (Oh Father)
And higher (Can you help me)
And higher (Understand this lady?)
And higher (Oh oh)
Morning, noon, and night, hold my body, hold it tight
Special girl, you're my special lady
Can I take you higher?

All the love you give to me is so special
Special, girl
Special, girl
All the love you give to me is so special
Special, girl (Special, girl)
Special, girl (You're my girl)

Special, girl
