Say lady, remember
(Let me love your body down)
That night, in the garden
I didn't touch you then
But I want to touch you now

Touch you, oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
Touch you touch you right now, Tonight
Touch you, yeah, Tonight
Touch you, touch you right now

Can my love for you stand the test of time?
We'll see if it's just pleasures of the mind
(Pleasures of the mind)
Is it physical? I'm so young
So naive girl
These are new waters
And I hope they're not too deep for me

Touch you, oh baby, baby let me touch you, Tonight
Touch you touch me right now, oh, oh Tonight
Touch you, oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
Touch you, touch you right now
You might also like
If I taste your love I hope you'll understand
(Hope you'll understand)
That my consciousness of life is more than just a man
In my secret place of love we can make so much love
And no one is the wiser but our hearts
Believe, that when I touch

Touch you, oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
Touch you touch you right now, Tonight
Touch you, yeah, oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
Touch you, touch you right now, yeah

You're more than just a flower and you'll grow into a tree
It's more than making love it's sweet harmony
And the way that I touch you, run my tongure down your spine
Ooh you'll never want another lover, you'll always be mine

And you'll treasure when I touch you, won't you?
Break it down, ooh ooh ooh
Can you feel it? 'Cause I can, yeah
Let us climb together so slow, so slow
Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me (Touch you)
Let me touch you baby all night long
Oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
(Touch you), touch me right now, Tonight
Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me (Touch you)
Let me touch you baby all night long
Oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
(Touch you), touch me right now, Tonight
Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me (Touch you)
Let me touch you baby all night long
Oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
(Touch you), touch me right now, Tonight
Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me (Touch you)
Let me touch you baby (Oh) all night long
Oh baby let me touch you, Tonight
(Touch you), Tonight

Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me
Let me touch you baby all night long
(Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you
Don't you tease me
