Can I talk to you?
I think you need to hear what I've got to say
So please listen

I've prayed for better days, days when you and I'd be closer
My mind focused on treating you right, and not searching for wrong
But wrong love would be the final words and suffering draw the curtain
And the show would last 'til life was gone
And we'd exchange these simple words

I wanna open up to you (Open up) and tell you what I've been through
Want you to open up to me and share with me your dream
I'm gonna live my life for you and make your dreams come true
So I dedicate my all to you
Listen

I pray that we don't change and get caught up in the current
Of people who don't mean us well or wish us ending thoughts
Living life in a big city and all of its distraction
Premiers, fake tears and falsely offered shoulders separately

I wanna open up to you (Open up) and tell you what I've been through
Want you to open up to me and share with me your dream
I'm gonna live my life for you and make your dreams come true
So I dedicate my all to you
Listen
You might also like
We solemnly swear to remain a pair (The two of us)
With truth and honestly from me (From me) to you (To you)
Leaving behind the liars and the fools
Lady, I promise I will always open up to you, ooh
Ah yeah, can you feel it, baby? I can
Oh yeah, I like this
Let me sing it for you

I wanna open up to you and tell you what I've been through
Want you to open up to me and share with me your dream
I'm gonna live my life for you and make your dreams come true
