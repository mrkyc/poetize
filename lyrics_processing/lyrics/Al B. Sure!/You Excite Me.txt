But I bet you don't know it
Ah, drop it

You excite me (Yes, you do)
You excite me (All the time)
You excite me (Every day)
You excite me, baby (Oh)

Excite me, invite me to your house tonight (Yeah)
Caress me (Uh-huh), undress me (Yeah), then bless me tonight

If we take the time tonight to feel the pleasures
All of your treasures, girl
Girl, I'll hold you oh so strong
A love to last forever, oh so long, girl
You and me

You excite me (Yes, you do)
You excite me (All the time)
You excite me (Every day)
You excite me, baby (Oh)
You might also like
It's such a pleasure, we've found the treasure
We have no secrets tonight
Just feel my power (Feel it, baby)
By the hour (Check the clock)
Take a shower (You bring the soap) tonight

If we take the time tonight to feel the pleasures
All of your treasures, girl
Girl, I'll hold you oh so strong (Strong)
A love to last forever, oh so long
Don't come too quick - I mean to my house

You excite me (Yes, you do)
You excite me (All the time)
You excite me (Every day)
You excite me, baby (Oh)

Just let me peep it, don't wanna keep it
Go slow, don't speed it tonight (Slow down)
This set is hectic, what I expected
Hope I can wreck it (Wreck it), wreck it tonight
How much? Oh boy! You and me all night?
Break it down? Okay
You asked for it, you got it
You excite me, you excite me, you excite me, ah yeah
You excite me, you excite me, you excite me
We can go on and on
You excite me (Yes, you do)
You excite me (All the time)
You excite me
You excite me, baby (Oh)
