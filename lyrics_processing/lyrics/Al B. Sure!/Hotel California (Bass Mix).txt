On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
(I thought I heard them say) Oh

"Welcome to the Hotel California
(Welcome to the hotel)
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
(Plenty of room)
Any time of year
(Any time of year)
You can find it here"

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Bright Red Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends, yeah
How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
You might also like
"Welcome to the Hotel California
(Oh, welcome to the hotel)
It's such a lovely place (It's such a lovely)
It's such a lovely face, and
They're living it up at the Hotel California
(They're living, they're living it up, ow)
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We're all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for their feast
They stab it with their steely knives
(But they just can't kill the beast) Oh
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man, "We're programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"

Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, all night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hoo, hoo-woo-woo-hoo
