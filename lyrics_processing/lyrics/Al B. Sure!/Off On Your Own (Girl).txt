Woo, don't hit me too hard
Oh yeah
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
To me, to me, woo

All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl

Don't you leave me standing here
What is it? You feel no fear
Let me make it up to you, my dear
I'm all alone
Sitting right here by the phone
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl, ooh
Wait, wait, you'll see (You'll see)
You'll get used to me
I know you'll love me, girl
(If you give me a chance)
I'm all alone (Alone)
Sitting right here by the phone
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl, ooh
You might also like
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own (Woo)
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl

I wanna know what's on your mind
You're back here running the same old line
You love me and you care (Whatever)
I'm all alone
Sitting right here by the phone
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl
Please come home

What?
Is there something wrong with you
Or is there something wrong with me?
Tell me something
Do I not look good enough for you?
Or maybe, baby, you just look too good for me
Don't sweat yourself
On the strength
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
(I can love you better)
Girl, girl, girl
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl

You make me so mad that you want to be on your own
I waited for so long
I waited by the phone
All of a sudden you want me back
Ha ha, what's up with that?
You got me on hold
What do you think you dope on a rope? Nope
What, I'm supposed to sweat you?
You're supposed to just run all over me?
Zero! On the strength
Ayo, Scott, it ain't hard to tell, right? Ha (Sure)
All the brothers grab a girl and now get out your seat
And rock to the rhythm of this funky beat
My name is Al B. Sure
Rock to the rhythm, the rhythm
The rhythm of the funky beat
All alone, my girl
Oh, hey, no, no
No, no, no, no

All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl
All alone you get off on your own, girl
All alone you get off on your own
All alone you get off on your own, girl
