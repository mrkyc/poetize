Why? Why you?

Saw children playing on the swings today
It took me back to an innocent place
Always wanted the children running round me
Life interrupted, crying eyes, I can't see

All I ever wanted was to share my days
At least until the sun went down
Or at least until we both turned gray
Girl, I never had a clue that you'd be taken away
No one to conquer life with

You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
It makes me wanna take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
Dreams of marriage put a hole in my heart, I'm missing you
Girl, you're gone too soon

It's been so hard not to think about us
Just holding hands and all the plans was like a deep cut
That'll never heal with time, it's sad to say
I lost my friend, not looking forward to those lonely days

All I ever wanted was to share my days
At least until the sun went down
Or at least until we both turned gray
Girl, I never had a clue that you'd be taken away
No one to conquer life with, woo

You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
It makes me wanna take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
Dreams of marriage put a hole in my heart, I'm missing you
Girl, you're gone too soon

Woo, my love, mhm
Play that thing
You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Never stop loving you)
It makes me wanna take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
Dreams of marriage put a hole in my heart, I'm missing you
Girl, you're gone too soon
You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
It makes me wanna take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
Dreams of marriage put a hole in my heart, I'm missing you
