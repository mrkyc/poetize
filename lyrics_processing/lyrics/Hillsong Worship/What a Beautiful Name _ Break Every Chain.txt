Are you ready
Are you ready for Him?
I wore a suit 'cause I came here to do business with Jesus tonight
And I think you did too
So let's do it

You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ

What a beautiful name it is
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus

You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus You brought heaven down
My sin was great Your love was greater
What could separate us now?

Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names

What a powerful name it is

Nothing can stand against

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, to break every chain, break every chain

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
(Cancer, hopelessness, discouragement, sickness, weakness...)
To break
To break every chain, to break every chain, break every chain
(Divorce, prodigals)
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain

And I hear the chains falling, wooh, wooh
And I hear the chains falling
Come on if you can hear it tonight, sing it out
I hear the chains falling
Every sickness and disease
I hear the chains falling
Would you believe, lift your voice right now, yeah
I hear the chains falling
Every chain, every sickness
I hear the chains falling
Every broken heart, every broken heart
I hear the chains falling
Every broken relationship, I hear it
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
And I hear the chains falling
Yes, I do, I believe it, Lord
And I hear the chains falling
Lift the roof up tonight, it is done
I hear the chains falling
Hallelujah
And I hear the chains falling
'Cause there is power in the name of Jesus
'Cause there is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
