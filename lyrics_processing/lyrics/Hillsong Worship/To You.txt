Here I stand, forever in Your mighty hand
Living with Your promise
Written on my heart

I am Yours, surrendered wholly to You
You set me in Your family
Calling me Your own

Now I, I belong to You
Lord, I need Your Spirit, Your word, Your truth
Hear my cry, my deep desire to know You more
In Your Name, I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring, Heaven knows
I long to love You with all I am
I belong to You

Here I stand, forever in Your mighty hand
Living with Your promise
Written on my heart

I am Yours, surrendered wholly to You
You set me in Your family
Calling me Your own

Now I, I belong to You
Lord, I need Your Spirit, Your word, Your truth
Hear my cry, my deep desire to know You more
In Your Name, I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring, Heaven knows
I long to love You with all I am
I belong to You, to You


I belong (I belong, I belong to You)
I belong (I belong to You)
I belong (I belong to You)
