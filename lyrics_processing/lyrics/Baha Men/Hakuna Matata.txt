When I was a cool young one
(When he was a cool young one)
I worked in the colony payin' my dues
Accepting without question the prevailing views
That a young man's life was one long grind
Diggin' holes standing guard till it crossed my mind
I was wrong, all along
All that I needed
Was to have heeded
