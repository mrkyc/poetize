I can't stop, i can't stop... thinking about you
I can't stop, i can't stop... thinking about you
It felt good to hold you in my arms
To keep you safe and warm
And never let anything come between us
It felt good
To know i drove u crazy
But i let you go for all the wrong reasons
But i dont know why
Why do i get nervous around you
I dont have a clue...
How am i supposed to carry on...
(how am i supposed to carry on)
Without you
Oooooooo
Can't stop thinking about you baby
No way my baby
Cause i left you crying
Ooooo oooo baby
Can't stop thinking about you baby
Caus i left you crying
It so wrong
To know you felt something for me
But i took advantage of the love that meant everything to you
Its so wrong
To know its where i belong
And to turn away what meant so much to me...
Caus i could deal with the truth
Why do i get nervous around you
Cause what i felt was all so real
Yeh yeh yehhh
How am i supposed to carry on without you
Whooaaa nothing
I wanna know why i can't stop thinking about you baby
Thinking about you babe
Cause i left you crying
Baby forgive me (oh sugar... oh baby) can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you cause i left you crying
Wish i could hold you
Wish i could come back
And recapture the things that meant alot baby
Wish i could hold you
Wish i could come back
And tell you everything would be alright
(alright alrightttt)
Whoa whoa whoaaa
Mmmmmm
Ooooo no no no
Didn't mean to leave you crying the way i did
Wish i coudl love you baby
I can't stop thinking about you baby
