Bow-wow-wow, Scooby yo and Scooby say
You know, Scooby and Shaggy in tha house
Bow-wow-wow, Scooby yo and Scooby say

In the van mission, making dog history
Pulling drop the tweeny so
You better not diss me
Kinda find the car, and ice that chain
When I'm rolling down the black
You'll say my name
Scooby-Doo yo, Scooby-Dooby-Doo yo
Scooby-Doo yo, Scooby-Dooby... Doo
I said: check one, two, one, two
Upon my Scooby mic, you never knew
What a dog on mic would sound so tight

"Ruff" to mah left, "ruff" to mah right
You never knew dog and a mic would sound so tight

Gimmie a Scooby Snacks and I'll be rapping all night

Light on my paws, that's in my jaws
In my paw drop, this a known cat's claws
Break it down on paws, runnin' all on bounds
Hypnotize a Mosby, with this Scooby-Scooby Snacks
Scooby is a dog that saves me
Scooby Snacks out of raid that pays me
Which drugs are chests so crazy
And Shaggy is so so lazy
I'm diggin' "dog yo" you're on phone yo
I'm breakin' bay may Shaggy is in the tone yo
I'm givin' Scooby coin, no, had my bowl yo
Never fall, yo
