When the party was nice, the party was bumpin'
(Hey, yippie yi yo)
And everybody havin' a ball
(Hah, ho, yippie yi yo)
I tell the fellas, ?Start the name callin'?
(Yippie yi yo)
And the girls respond to the call

Get back scruffy, get back scruffy
Get back you flea infested mongrel
Gonna tell myself, "Hey, man, no get angry"
(Hey, yippie yi yo)
To any girls calling them canine
(Hey, yippie yi yo)
But they tell me, "Hey, man, it's part of the party?

Wait for y'all my dogs, the party is on
I gotta get my girl I got my mind on
Do you see the rays comin' from my eye
What could you be friend
That Benji man that's breakin' them down?
Me and my white short shorts
And I can't seek a lot, any canine will do
I'm figurin' that's why they call me faithful
'Cause I'm the man of the land
When they see me they say, ?Ooo!?
