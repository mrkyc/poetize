Grab the fellas hit it fast on the highway
Song is bumpin' in the car get the dance on
Lookin' for a dance club, gotta get my sound
Hit this spot where the beat is feeling kinda right
Shake it up shake it down, move it left and right
Now you're doin' it movin' it to the beat you and me
All N-I-G-H-T
Let the rhythm take control
You can do it, nothing to it
Now you know you grooving when you
Put your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
Put your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
I feel it, I know you feel it too
And if your doin' it right let me hear you say, oooh
Don't stop, hit it, get it, hop hop, hit it hit it
Get up on your feet and get rubbin'
You might also likeMake sure the DJ puts rubbin' on
And everybody in the house just sing along
And if you didn't bring a friend make a new one
Just start the rubbin' it's a lot of fun
Let the rhythm take control
You can do it, nothing to it
Now you know you grooving when you
Put your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
Put your hands way up high (we rubbin')
Wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake
When the body is dead, we got to get it jumpin'
Baby never be scared to get down (get down)
Now we're losing our heads
Can't keep our feet from dancing
Music's over our heads-- so come on, come on, come on
You got it down keep the dance going all night
And it's so easy, even grandma can do it right
We let her dance all night, you know what's comin' next
Now new dance, new thrill, givin' you the best
First there was a twist and everybody got jiggy
Now everybody do the rubbin', it's for really
So pack up your group, get a grip, come equipped
Hit the dance floor and just shake your hips
You've got to
Throw your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
Put your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
Throw your hands way up high (we rubbin')
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin')
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin')
And shake shake shake, we rubbin'
