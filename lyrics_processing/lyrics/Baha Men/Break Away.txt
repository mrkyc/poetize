It doesn't matter where we go as long as I'm with you
Loving and holding you close
So take my hand and leave your worries and your cares behind
Let's fly away to paradise
'Cause you, you are a city girl and I am an island man
I'll help you understand oh

You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away

Our tomorrows and our yesterdays are passing by
And you know the time has finally come
For us to get away from everything that brings us down
See baby it's time to have some fun
Cause you, you are a city girl and I am an island man
I'll help you understand oh

You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away
You might also like
See you and me baby we can can get away
Explore the islands and put our footprints, deep in the sand yeah
That's how we do, you are my sweetheart so let me call you boo
That's true
I can see us cruising to the Bahamas
Why don't you flow with me, and you will truly see
Hanging with family
Is what everything's all about
It's as good as it gets that's without a doubt (ha ha)
We've waited for so long I just can't believe
We're standing here, my love

You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Love it when we, we can break away
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
