(Hey, ho, say yeah but don't say no)
I can't stand rejection but I got to know to
(Hey, ho , I just know what I know)
You and me could be so good together we could love beyond forever
I don't wanna
Steel a kiss, but I can't resist I never felt like this
I don't wanna
Try to make you hang with me
I don't wanna
Tell a lie I'm in love with you and I can't deny
I just wanna fool around
I'll take you to the movies or I'll take you to the stars
(Hey, ho, say yeah But don't say no)
Please don't get me wrong I'll never go to far
(Hey, ho, I just know what I know)

Steel a kiss, but I can't resist I never felt like this

Tell a lie I'm in love with you and I can't deny
