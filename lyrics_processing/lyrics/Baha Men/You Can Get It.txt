When your down and out
And you can't go on
When the road you walk
And the tears you cry
Start to sink too much
Look inside yourself (Look inside yourself)
For the strength to pull through (For the strength to pull through)
Gotta set your sights
It will be alright
Coz it all comes down to you
You can get it, you can get it
You can have it all
You can win it
Never have to fall
If the fire's in your eyes (If the fire's in your eyes)
Everyday is a brand new start
You can get it, you can get it
You can take the prize
You can own it
If hope is in your eyes
All you got to do is fight (All you got to do is fight)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it tonight

And you can't breathe free
And the friends you made don't return the calls
And pretend you don't exist
Look into my eyes (Look into my eyes)
Coz you can always count one me
You can get it, you can get it
You can have it all
You can win it
Never have to fall
If the fire's in your eyes (If the fire's in your eyes)
Everyday is a brand new start
You can get it, you can get it
You can take the prize
You can own it
If hope is in your eyes
All you got to do is fight (All you got to do is fight)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it tonight
Reach for the highest, brightest star
You'll be sure to catch the moon
All your dreams are possible
And you'll get there soon (yeah, you'll get there)
You can get it, you can get it
You can have it all
You can win it
Never have to fall
If the fire's in your eyes (If the fire's in your eyes)
Everyday is a brand new start
You can get it, you can get it
You can take the prize
You can own it
If hope is in your eyes
All you got to do is fight (All you got to do is fight)
