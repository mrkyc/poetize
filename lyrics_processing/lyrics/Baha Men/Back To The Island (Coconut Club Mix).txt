Gotta Do it
Go Back to the Island Boy
Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go
Wake up early one mornin
Kiss my mama good-bye
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I'll be leaving on the hou'r's label
I sure hope that she's still able
Sow the seed around 5 o'clock
I'll stand at her bow and see the dark
Out in the field from dawn till dusk
Swimming in the blue hole is a must
That island where i was born
First thing I'll do is grow some corn
Wake up early one mornin
Kiss my mama good-bye
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
