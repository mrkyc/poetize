Every single ounce
Show me what you got, baby, move your body
Throwing harlers out
Calling mallers out
No, I'm tantalized getting it started
Ooo, Let's groove
Get your freak on my ringtones
Flipping halter tops
From bikini shops
Hitting all the spots while the sun still shining
I j-j-just want a minute of your time, baby
I j-j-just want to see what's on your mind baby
Oh, c-c-c-cuz i'm falling in love with your smile
It's driving me wild
Ya know, ya know, ya gotta
Gimme, gimme, gimme summertime girls
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Take me with ya girl
All my people know
That the girly's go crazy from the heat
And the sun keeps shining
'Til the break of dawn
Keep your bottoms on
Now the groove is on and the sun keeps shining
I j-j-just want a minute of your time, baby
I j-j-just want to see what's on your mind baby
Oh, c-c-c-cuz i'm falling in love with your smile
It's driving me wild
Ya know, ya know, ya gotta
Gimme, gimme, gimme summertime girls
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out

Gimme, gimme, gimme summertime girls

You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
