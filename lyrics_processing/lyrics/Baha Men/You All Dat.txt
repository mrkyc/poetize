I was up with the moon
And down with the stars
And the party was carryin on (PARTAY)
All the girls were outside kickin sand sippin on some sisqo (ooh ooh ooh OOH)
And all the boys were standin around nursing a cold one (hey hey hey)
And then WHOA there she was I think shes lookin right at me (no way!)
Hey I know what I see when I see it (right)

(if you want some take some go out and get it
Gotta show her you the mac of the game or just forget it)
So all the girls started laughing at me (hahahahahaha)
I had to make a quick retreat and get ready for round 2 (Bung)
Cuzmy love was like a bomb about to explode
And only she could light my fuse
So I'm walkin (NO)

Desperate men make desperate moves
So I dropped to my knees and prayed (YA)

Til I opened my eyes and to my surprise
