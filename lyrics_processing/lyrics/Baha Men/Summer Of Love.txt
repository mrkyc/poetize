Spendin' time in the summer of love
I've been waiting all year for the summer
And a chance that I'll see you again
Hanging out at one beach or another
With friends. Yeah
All the trees start to sway to the music
And the breeze starts caressing your hair
Summer love makes my heart
Sing and jump in the air
The days are getting longer
And the moon stays up all night
So, be mine in the summer of love
Spendin' time in the summer of love
Everybody sing la la la la la la la la la la la la
'Cuz everybody sing la la la la la la la la la la la la
Yeah. Mm-hm
I don't know who you are, but I'll find you
Your face must shine like rays from the sun
Then I'll know you're the one
And the summer's begun
The days are getting longer
And the moon stays out all night
So, be mine in the summer of love
Spendin' time together in the summer of love
And everybody is going to sing la la la la la la la la la la la la
Come on everybody la la la la la la la la la la la la

You and me that's how its going to be now
Come on, my baby; let me work it (work it)
And you can be mine so bring it down to me
With that shew-shew swing
The nights are getting longer
And the stars stay out all night
Everybody going to be all right
In the summer of love
