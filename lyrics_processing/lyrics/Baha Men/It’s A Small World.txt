It's a small world
It's a small world
It's a small world
It's a small world

It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all
(Everybody now!)

It's a small world after all (Whoo!)
It's a small world after all (Everybody now!)
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small, small, small world (Oh yeah)

There is just one moon, and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains be wide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all
(Come on, come on, everybody now!)

Come on everybody let's bounce to this!
Let's play some love with a little twist!
