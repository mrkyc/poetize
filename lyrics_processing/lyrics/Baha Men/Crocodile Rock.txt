I remember when I was young
Me and dad had so much fun
Climbing trees and skipping stones
I had a couple of lizards
And a snake of my own!
But the biggest kick I've ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were playing on the dock
We were jumping in the river savin' big ol' crocs
When...
Hold your rocking, something sunk
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them everytime
And I guess I always will
OH BY CRIKEY!
It's Friday night!
Just grab a croc and hold on tight, man!
Plan on rocking was the way to put things right

Sweet Terri by my side
Taking salties for a ride
Up the river to be safe and sound
Cause I know a few places
That he won't be found
I could tell you 'bout the trick we've got
When we move around a big ol' croc
Wrap the head and watch the tail!
That's the way my dad taught me
And it never fails
When...
Hold your rocking! Something sunk
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them everytime
And I guess I always will
OH BY CRIKEY!
