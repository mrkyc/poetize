I mean I used to want the fairy tale ending you know?
With everything just so perfect
And like there was no worries
No arguments
Then I realized thats what makes it worth it
If I never said I hate you I never loved you
I know its weird but you know?
Verse 1:
Sent flowers to your house today
Tust because it was Tuesday
I love you more than words can say
So if you dont understand baby its okay
But I was wondering if you feel the same way that I do
Like this gone last for 100 years plus two
Caught be cheating gave me my test back
Made an A+ didn't know how to act
Other girls get turned away at the welcome mat
And deleted from my contacts
I see love through my contacts
Words I thought I'd never say
But I found you and wanna wake up with you every day
How did you get in my head and make me so interested
In believing that this love shit true
And putting all my trust in you?
But if you scared I'll do you wrong
And wanna move on
Just tell me and I'm gone
You might also likeThis ain't perfect but if we don't argue
And everynight I call you
I won't have time to think about how much I love you
Or how lost I am without you
Hook:
I swear I love it when you tell me that you hate me
I love it when you say you wish you never dated me
All the arguments is what makes it worth it
I'm so glad that this love is not perfect (x2)
Verse 2:
Sent chocolates to your house today
Just because it was Wednesday
I just wanna see you happy
So if you don't understand baby it's okay
I miss you more than words can say
So can you pick up your phone
I take back the times I said
I hate you and things I did wrong
Got another chance and still messed up
But fell in love again when we met up
You tell me that you fed up
When I wished the make up process sped up
I just wanna settle down
Words I thought I'd never say
But I found you and you're perfect in every way
How did you get in my brain
And me see love so damn plain?
Believing that this love is true
And giving all my heart to you?
But if you scared I'll do you wrong
And wanna move on
Just tell me and I'm gone
This ain't perfect but if we don't argue
And everynight I call you
I won't have time to think about how much I love you
Or how lost I am without you
