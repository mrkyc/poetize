But there won't be a better time than now
We both know where this is going anyhow
This boyfriend, girlfriend
Thing ain't working out
Let's do what needs a-doin' tonight
And get on with the rest of our lives
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
Your finger
Let's take the plunge, let's get 'er done
C'mon, let's pull the trigger
I'll pop the question, you'll say "yes"
When I'm down on my knees
Got all we need, got you and me, and a ring
Let's do this thing
Let's do this thing
You're surprised, well, so am I
Never thought I'd be
Begging you to be the ball that's chained to me
Baby, now you're crying, can't talk, but you're trying
And you still haven't answered me yet
Now you're hugging me, I guess that's a "yes"
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Your finger
Let's take the plunge, let's get 'er done
C'mon, let's pull the trigger
I'll pop the question, you'll say "yes"
When I'm down on my knees
Got all we need, got you and me, and a ring
Let's do this thing
Something borrowed, something blue
You 'bout to make my dreams come true
Something old, something new
C'mon, baby, let's say "I do"
Let's call every friend we got
Tell 'em that we're tying the knot
The champagne's about to...
(3, 2, 1)
POP!
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
Your finger
Let's take the plunge, let's get 'er done
C'mon, little baby, let's pull that trigger
I'll pop the question, you'll say "yes"
When I'm down on my knees
Got all we need, got you and me, and the bling, the ring
And I sing
