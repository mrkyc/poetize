'Bout a boy they all call Billy, he lives up there alone
Works down in the mine where every day is black as night
By the time that Friday rolls around, he's ready for them lights
He rakes a comb back through his hair, hitches up his pants
He'll be taking on the town now, man, that town don't stand a chance
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
Come down here to get his fill
Whiskey, women, wine and thrills
Husbands here are fit to kill
And if they catch that boy, they will
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
He reaches for his wallet, throws a card down on the bar
Then he takes a drink, and mixes it with something from a jar
By 10, he's on the dance floor, tearing up some wood
Buying drinks for everybody with that card that ain't no good
By 2, he's in the alleyway with some old brother's wife
2:15 you'll hear a shotgun, see him running for his life
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
Come down here to get his fill
Of whiskey, women, wine and thrills
Husbands here are fit to kill
And if they catch that boy, they will
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
You might also likeThey followed him down Main Street, saw him tear across the bridge
Caught him sit behind the junkyard out by Hunter's Ridge
They swear they almost caught him right before the dome
He was gone, gone, gone, gone
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
Come down here, and his fill
He'll be back, oh, yes, he will
Then hillbilly Billy better run for the hills, yeah
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
Come down here to get his fill
Of whiskey, women, wine and thrills
Husbands here are fit to kill
And if they catch that boy, they will
Hillbilly Billy better run for the hills
