Tryna' get you to be kind and sweet to me
Crying down that telephone
Squeezing blood from a heart of stone
I now know what I shoulda' known
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't want to be my life
Twist your knife
I used to think that we were meant to be
Told everyone "Yeah, she was sent to me
Sent to me from above, sent to be the one I love"
I wonder what I was thinking of, 'cause
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't want to be my life
Twist your knife
It's all so weird, it's tearing me apart
I want you near, but I hate you when you are
I know that we're dysfunctional
'Cause I won't say a word, you'll never go
I'll never leave, you'll never know
You might also likeI love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
It's all so weird, it's tearing me apart
I want you near, god, I hate you when you are
I know that we're dysfunctional
'Cause I won't say a word, you'll never go
I'll never leave, you'll never know
But I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
Yeah, I love you, yes I do
But I ain't in like with you
I'm gonna be fed for, gonna be true to
Every little thing that a lover should do
Onto you 'til this long love is through
Say goodbye, and adieu
Sayonara, toodle-oo
Everybody sing
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
I love you, but I don't like you
