I used to get in trouble for the things I did
And the things I'd say, and the bed I'd lay
And I'd pray for the day I'd be grown
'Cause that way I could do what I want
Never came true
'Cause everybody still tell me
This grown, ass man, what he can't do
You shouldn't oughta drink
You shouldn't oughta smoke
You shouldn't oughta tell that kind of joke
You shouldn't oughta this
You shouldn't oughta that
You shouldn't need to think it as a matter of fact
You shouldn't oughta drive this big, old truck
I shouldn't oughta tell to ya', but your rules all suck
I don't wanna, but I gotta
That's a lotta, shouldn't 'oughta
Excuse my mood, I ain't a rude dude
And I don't want my attitude misconstrued
But why you gotta tell me how I gotta behave?
It's the land of the free, and the home of the brave
At least it used to be where I come from
And freedom ain't a freedom
'Less you're freedom means you're free to be dumb
Here they come
