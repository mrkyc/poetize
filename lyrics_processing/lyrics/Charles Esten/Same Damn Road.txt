Right through the town I knew I was stuck in
Took mama to church, and me to the high school
Daddy to work, and then to a bar stool
There was a stretch, a Chevy 
Gave us a Gravol, shoulder to cry on
I found you, girl, and that I let you go
On the same damn road
The same two lanes that let me leave
Are 'bout to bring you back to me
I got out, but I want back in
A prim baby, I could be your baby again
And these four wheels that got me gone
Will turn around, drive all night long
I got lost, but I know my way back home
It's the same damn road
Flattened dust to 
One-way ticket, and this boy took it
Mama cried, daddy drank
She filled my belly, he filled my tank
Crossed my heart on the railroad track
Swore to God, I wasn't coming back
But, oh, I guess you never know
You might also like'Cause the same two lanes that let me leave
Are 'bout to bring you back to me
I got out, but I want back in
A prim baby, I could be your baby again
And these four wheels that got me gone
Will turn around, drive all night long
I got lost, but I know my way back home
It's the same damn road
I was born to run
So here I come
On the same two lanes that let me leave
Are 'bout to bring you back to me
I got out, but I want back in
A prim baby, I could be your baby again
And these four wheels that got me gone
Could turn around, drive all night long
I got lost, but I know my way back home
And there's the sign, just two more miles to go
On the same damn road
