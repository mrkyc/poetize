You're long and strong like a railway trestle
Dad's just a muscle and mama just a vessel
Meant to call, fawn over, nuzzle and nestle
But dad's just a bear you can tackle down and wrestle
Son, give me time I'm a bona fide mess'll
If mama says no, maybe dad'll say yes'll
Did you do wrong? Well, go ahead, confess'll
Dad just a muscle and mama just a vessel

You all blue and your mama like a rattle
Came out looking like a Smurf in a battle
Me in the nosebleeds, mama in the saddle
Brave like a Sioux brave going into battle
Emotion going like a stampede of cattle
Real like rain and coffee in Seattle
Anesthesiologist fiddle and faddle
You all blue and your mama like a rattle

Oh, life so clear like a Rivera mural
Lucifer's teeth introduce the epidural
Doctor Jones, do you need a heaven referral?
God sent you down to me and my girl
She's long and tall and healthy as hell
But the plan went to hell when the little fella fell
Boy went headfirst into her pelvis
1956, shakin' like Elvis

Yesterday-born and already thinkin'
Body like a Ford and a mind like a Lincoln
Mama and papa in love and sinkin'
Into a brand new situation drinkin' up
Coffee like a fish on the second and third shift
Loving every single ever-loving minute of this
Standing ovation for the OR specialist
Let me get close, wanna give my son one kiss
On his head

Planning for the future; health and dental
Picking up my baby boy easy and gentle
Soup for the family, sausage and lentil
Beans and greens, arugula and fentel
Don't never sleep, I'm about to go mental
But nothing so far has been accidental
Can't keep my life, so it's gotta be a rental
Picking up my baby boy, easy and gentle

Oh, you're long and strong like a railway trestle
Dad just a muscle and mama just a vessel
Meant to call, fawn over, cuddle and nestle
But dad's just a bear you can tackle down and wrestle
You can have a pop-tent or you can have a castle
Try to change people but it's gonna be a hassle
Don't have to be an astronaut for NASA
But it's always good to get a gown and a tassel
Son, have fun with your life it's a drama
Just one period and all kinds of commas
Now you got a onesie but then you get pajamas
You know you've got me
And you know you've got your mama
