I'm a-high steppin', high bettin'
Love givin', I'm a-love gettin'
I'm a stranger, I love stretchin' out my wheels
Overnightin' on the desert strip
Makin' time and losin' grip
Drivin' circles in the canyons of my mind

I'm an outsider lookin' in
I got a perfect square for a circle of friends
It's the four of us against the rest of you
But really I am all alone
I'd sell 'em out to save my own
I told them that but they don't buy the truth

I'm a-high steppin', high bettin'
Love givin', I'm a-love gettin'
I'm a stranger, I love stretchin' out my wheels
Overnightin' on the desert strip
Makin' time and losin' grip
Drivin' circles in the canyons of my mind

Well, it's warfare out there, folks
You're either working for success
Or to be rich or, God help us, famous
Or you're working against the clock just to stay afloat
Got your nose all scraped up from the grindstone
You're digging for diamonds and only finding rhinestones
Meanwhile, it's August and the tax man has never heard of summer vacation
You're either working on yourself or you're lookin' after babies
Takin' care of your old man or your old lady
And the direct line to the hospital just says "Leave a message"
See, you can only live one day at a time
Only drive one hot rod at a time
Only say one word at a time
And only think one thought at a time
And every soul is alone when the day becomes night
And there in the dark if you can try to see the light
In the most pitch black shape of the loneliest shadow
Well, then you ought to sleep well
'Cause there's hope for sure
Well, I don't know about all that being true, but
I do know this

The best lovers ain't never been loved
And first place ain't easy
The hardest part is believing
The very last word is love

I'm a-high steppin', high bettin'
Love givin', I'm a-love gettin'
I'm a stranger, I love stretchin' out my wheels
