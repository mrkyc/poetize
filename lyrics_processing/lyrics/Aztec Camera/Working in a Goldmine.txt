Our love's the sound
Of broken skies
Too blind to see
What lies inside
We love what shines
Before our eyes
Why can't we learn
What hides?

Waiting on the last train
Flicking through the highlights
Living in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'Cause I believe in your heart of gold
Automatically sunshine
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And we believe that there's a heart beats on
In the dark of the closedown
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine

And time not tied
Is time to feed
We lose our pride
We spill our seed
The worst of us
Escape so slow
The best of us
Just goes

Waiting on the last train
Flicking through the highlights
Living in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'Cause I believe in your heart of gold
Automatically sunshine
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And we believe that there's a heart beats on
In the dark of the closedown
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
They'll make you work for everything
Never let it roll
Never let it swing
Take control and let your heart sing


Baby, everything's gonna be alright
Positively uptight
Baby, everything's gonna be just fine
And everything's gonna be just fine

Waiting on the last train
(Baby, everything's gonna be alright)
Flicking through the highlights
Living in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
(Baby, everything's gonna be just fine)
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'Cause I believe in your heart of gold
(Baby, everything's gonna be alright)
Automatically sunshine
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And we believe that there's a heart beats on
(Baby, everything's gonna be just fine)
In the dark of the closedown
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
Waiting on the last train
(Baby, everything's gonna be alright)
Flicking through the highlights
Living in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
(Baby, everything's gonna be just fine)
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'Cause I believe in your heart of gold
(Baby, everything's gonna be alright)
Automatically sunshine
Yeah, glitter, glitter everywhere
