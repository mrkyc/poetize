When days are just a trail of clothes
Slung over poetry and prose
A red reminder of the things I owe
A songbird silenced in the settling snow

I'm left here looking at the bone
I'm stranded in a sea of stepping stones
I stood inside of something I'd outgrown
A simple sadness in the great unknown
I think again and thank the earth and kiss the stone

I saw the anger in your eyes
Neutralise
Made hollow
Faith and healing met the wide-eyed child
Redemption smiled
I followed
It's like the numbness when your heart gets sick
Then the summer and your heart gets fixed
And I say

Sister Ann says
"There's no need to be down, there's something you can do"
It all follows
Sister Ann says
"There's no need to find solace in anything
If you don't want to"
It's like the light is gonna find you then
Then the beauty in your eyes
The stillness of the night
And the beating in your breast
Is gonna put you there again
You might also like
The single silence of a kiss
Two voices merged and gone amiss
Belief that bends and so beyond that bliss
Finds deeper darkness and relies on this
Then wide awake it wonders why and says resist

I saw the anger in your eyes
Neutralise
Made hollow
Faith and healing met the wide-eyed child
Redemption smiled
I followed
It's like the numbness when your heart gets sick
Then the summer and your heart gets fixed
And I say

Sister Ann says
"There's no need to be down, there's something you can do"
It all follows
Sister Ann says
"There's no need to find solace in anything if you don't want to"
It's like the light is gonna find you then
Then the beauty in your eyes
The stillness of the night
The beating in your breast
And the logic of the right
Is gonna put you there again
(Searching for something special, looking for love)
It's gonna put you there again
(Searching for something special, looking for love)
It's gonna put you there again
(Searching for something special, looking for love)
It's gonna put you there again
(Searching for something special, looking for love)
