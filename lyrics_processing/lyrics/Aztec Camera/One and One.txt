One and one (One and one)
One and one (One and one)
One and one (One and one)
One and one (One and one)

One and one is one I hear
But it breaks my heart to come so near
And find division standing in our way
As London burns I lie awake
And wrestle with this passive state
But a broken heart is useless in these days

When I close my eyes to trouble
Baby, I see you
And now I have the need to double
Everything I do
So I close my eyes and make a wish
Yeah, dream a dream for me
That one and one will someday be free

Oh boy I know
The crucial blow
They deal us every day
I feel it too
But need for you
To chase your blues away
But if my heart
Should come apart
My love should turn inside
I'll understand
You're just a man
I'll still be on your side
You might also like
When I close my eyes to trouble
Baby, I see you (Baby, I see you)
And now I have the need to double
Everything I do (Everything I do)
So I close my eyes and make a wish
Yeah, dream a dream for me
That one and one will someday be free

One and, and one
And one
And one
And one

When I close my eyes to trouble
Baby, I see you (Baby, I see you)
And now I have the need to double
Everything I do (Everything I do)
So I close my eyes and make a wish
Yeah, dream a dream for me
One and one will someday be free

One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one and one (One)
One and one (One, one and one)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one, one and one)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one and)
One and one (One and one and)
