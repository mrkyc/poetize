Welcome to our tropical hideaway, you lucky people you
If we weren't in the show starting right away
We'd be in the audience, too
The boys in the back are kamikaze
Because of their claws?
No, because they're macaws
And our fine feathered friend is a jolly toucan
And two can sound better than one toucan can

The bird of paradise is an elegant bird
It likes to be seen and it likes to be heard
Most little birdies will fly away
But the Tiki Room birds are here every day
Our show is delightful we hope you'll agree
We hope that it fills you with pleasure and glee
Because if we don't make you feel like that
We're gonna wind up on a lady's hat
