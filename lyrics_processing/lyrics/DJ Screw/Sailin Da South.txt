Damn, 3 in the morning, still going down
What's up, H-Town? South side?
Know what I'm sayin'?
It's the Screw in here, hollerin' at my G's and players, know what I'm sayin'?
Parlayin', drinkin' syrup, what's up?
Aw, yeah
It's that nigga E-S-motherfucking-Gizzy
And it's going down once again in this bitch
We still swangin' and bangin' on them mark-ass busters
But they don't know what time it is
Damn, man, nigga so motherfucking high in this bitch, I might can't even rap, man
Damn, a nigga gonna stutter or something, man, fuck this shit, but um
All the, um, real motherfucking G's
Just come on and take a lil' trip with the E to the S to the motherfucking G
'Cause we gon' do it like this, bitches

Come take a trip with E as I glide and I slide
Boun-boun-boun-bounce as I flip in my ride
Now, the blunts get bust open as I break down that skunk
Bump-bump-bump-bump is the sound in my trunk
I got you all feeling good, you bobbing your head
Rat-tat-tat-tat, duck, nigga, or you're dead
'Cause it's one for the money, two for the hoes
And you got to be real to feel the fucking flow
So, bitches, bend over, now raise up your skirt
Scr-scr-scr-scream if that dick hurt
Now, I gots to hit it good, you know I can't stop
Pop-pop-pop-pop goes the sound of that twat
As I walked outside, just stood up on the curb and
Chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp goes the alarm in my Suburban
Now I hops in, the Glocks in, it's time for me to flip
When I st-st-st-stutter, I'm high on that dip
But you know what? I makes that mill' with my mouth
Come on as we sail through the South
Really though, nigga, see I'm a pimp, ho
But y'all just chiz-ill, it ain't nothing but the intro
Fool
