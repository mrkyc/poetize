13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8
PSK has got a way to seal yo fate
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
The countdown is done
So I gotta get my gun, ho
When I was young
Yo I knew that one day
I would jump at the chance
For some gun play
I could tell what the future seen
On Selinsky and Martin Luther King
It don't stop cuz the murderin' continues
And Imma put a bullet up in you
Then choke yo neck til you gag
Then Imma stuff yo corpse in a bag
You fuckin' fairy you
Then Imma bury you
Somewhere between
Houston and Prairie View
Ayo it's 13 ways
For yo ass to get clicked on
When I got a lick goin'
You might also like
PSK will show em 13 ways
To show ya devilish clique that crime pays
You suffer bloodshed
For 13 days
And when we rise up
Allah gets the praise

I thought ya knew
About the underhanded bandit
I got ya shook
Cuz that left hook landed
Then imma choke yo ass
Until ya vomit
Then drop ya off
In the back of the summit
Another nigga left dead in the dark
Got em up from Southpark
Smooth in Lamont
Check it
Ya know they expected this
In Texas
Me and my man
Got the whole clan wreckless
My nigga G got the 380
Just in case
One of you niggas wanna fade me
And y'all can kick that step to me shit
To the curb cuz its 13 ways
For yo ass to get served
PSK him the proud son of kings
When you say 13, 13
PSK him the proud son of kings
When you say 13, 13

PSK will show em 13 ways
To show ya devilish clique that crime pays
You suffer bloodshed
For 13 days
And when we rise up
Allah gets the praise
K-Rino the ice cream and milk type
Me carve em up with revolutionary knife
Cuz Southpark is revolutionary life
K-Rino and PSK fuck the president's wife

Nowadays mo' and mo' niggas loccin'
So all the time
Got my nine millimeter smokin'
Prayin' for the day that you run up
I'm always one up
So fool get gunned up
I'm on the come up
But used all my funds up
Time to jack because black gave me thumbs up
I'm comin' up like a fat dick
That quick
Like that
Niggas made big fat licks
Cuz PSK-13 is in the place
My twelve gauge is in yo mothafuckin' face
Ratta-tat get the gat boom boom
Not a nigga left in the room
Somebody better tell em
Ace-Treys dangerous
But understand it's an underhanded gang of us
And 13 ways for yo ass to get smothered
Yeah, I got ya covered

PSK will show em 13 ways
To show ya devilish clique that crime pays
You suffer bloodshed
For 13 days
And when we rise up
