"Oh, what up fool!
What's up blue baby where you been fool?"
"Man, chillin' fool, locked down."
"Oh man, fo real man? You been gone for like years man."
"Yeah, I'm just chilling boy, glad to be out there boy, tellin' ya."
"Locked down? *TCCH* Aw man, tell your boy what happened, fool."

Well I made parole, glad to get the fuck out that hole
I got my shoestring belt clothes and go
I pop in the fat track that dope made
I'm on my way to hit Mike for the tight fade
But damn South Park sure look strange
Twenty four months since a nigga caught that change
Straight lockdown in TDC
But now I'm coolin' with that SPC
Cuz uh, that black be back on them streets
Fuck selling crack I'm just straight waxing beats
I hit the bump, I drink a brew, I got faded
But niggas say that McGregor got raided
So I gotta get out and find a club that's pumpin'
Ricky Crick had said Boomerang be jumpin'
I'm glad I'm out, I did two, now I'm through
I'm back on them streets after serving a deuce
You might also like
Well, I'm back on them streets, gotta make some ends
After serving a deuce
I'm still a hustler from inside my soul
After serving a deuce
(Serving a deuce)

After twenty four months I'm back on the streets and I swear it's
Fucked up being stuffed up in Harris
County Jail where the browns don't fit tight
House hoes think I couldn't sit down and shit right
Back to doin' things like a real OG should
That nigga Woods pumpin' goods through the hood
I called my bitch a nigga answered her phone
Come to find out she's turnin' tricks while I was gone
But a bitch is a hoe it ain't no big deal
But now deez niggas rollin' parks with the 5th wheels
We chrome grillin', niggas just chillin'
A philly blunt with the chronic'd up fillin'
Crown Royal in the cup with some Coke
5-0's thinkin' I'm fallin' for the Okey-Doke
Well I'm the dick so I roll with the blunts
I'm back on them streets after twenty four months

Well, I'm back on them streets, gotta make some ends
After serving a deuce
I stayed a hustler from inside my soul
After serving a deuce (When I was serving a deuce)
(Serving a deuce)
Fresh out the clink and I'm rollin'
A '94 Explorer with the leather, low vault, not stolen
Now I'm rollin' down the ave just flippin'
Gotta take the rims to the shop to get 'em clipped in
The chrome bit so you can see your reflection
9 double M in the stash for my protection
In case a nigga wanna try to jack, black
Two year bid but I ain't scared to go back
Marvin Gaye's greatest hits on a disk
Can he fade on the chrome? I gotta piss
I'm gearing up to get it on with my niggas though
My killer hoe said before black buck a hole
Bitches lookin' as I role through the hood
Two years have passed since they seen that nigga Woods
Another hit from the blunt 'fore a brew
But I'm back on them streets after serving a deuce

Well, I'm back on them streets, gotta make some ends
After serving a deuce
(Oh oh oh) I'm still a hustler from inside my soul
They happy serving a deuce (and serving a deuce)
I got caught up, that's what it was
Happy serving a deuce
I'm still a hustler from inside my soul, yeah
Had me serving a deuce, serving a deuce
