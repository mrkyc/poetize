They squeezed the trigger on me
Cause I squeezed the trigger on his little brother yesterday
I can still remember when I shot him
Voices screaming in my head: oh, my god
Damn, it was so simple
But the very next day I caught two to the temple
I wonder what my family gonna say
Maybe they was looking for me to die anyway
You know, my feelings was hurt
I just got out the penitentiary, now they put me in the dirt
To make a long story short I was terrible
Niggas firing up weed when they came to my burial
To make a long story short I was terrible
Niggas firing up weed when they came to my burial
To make a long story short I was terrible
Niggas firing up weed when they came to my burial
Bitches cried as they put me in the ground
But sometimes I think it was meant for me to lay it down
I appreciate if you kiss me
But I ain't gonna have mothafuckas standing, crying over my body
Just let a nigga sleep
Fucking with me and shit, how the hell I suppose to rest in peace?
My son don't know about the tragedy
He just crying cause they won't let him to play in my casket
I can see my girl's face, I know she can't stand it
Looking like her mind's on another planet
Put me to sleep, Blank rest in peace
Put me to sleep, Blank rest in peace
Put me to sleep, Blank rest in peace
Put me to sleep, Blank rest in peace

I had a lot of niggas down with me
Uuuh, I just hope to God they don't forget me
Yeah, a lot of niggas hated me
And to see me in a grave is what they wanted to see
A rough brother from South Park
And I blame Illinois for making me hard
