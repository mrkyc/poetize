What? Say, no nuts no glory, know'm saing?
It's really true, if it ain't no nuts it ain't no glory, know'm saying?
You got to put it down if you really wanna crawl down
Know'm saying?
It ain't gon' fall at your front door, you gotta grind for it baby
When we put it down, yeah we do it G style
It's the P-A to the T, let me do my freestyle
Talkin' bout that grindin', bumper kit reclinin'
Yellow hoes mindin'
I'm comin' down, if it's Texas rollin' on boys
It's the Fat Pat and I'mma roll down slow
Knock her down, knock her off, slam my candy do'
In my gangsta strut
Like we (?) crooks
I'm still rollin' bumper kit, I don't give a fuck
Let me (?) down
Pop trunk surround
Young nigga throw down the pistol wooded surround
In my damn trunk
I ain't no punk
Still hangin' wit that boy, what, Corey Blount
Me and Big Moe's comin' down in the Jag
We ain't gonna brag when the punks (?) the lead
Cus we gonna wreck with (?) face for the '96
Comin' down slow on choppers in the mix
Still up in the game
Ain't nothin' changed
Got a bigger name
Now I got fame
What they wanna do?
Still fuckin' with the Screw
It's that P-A to the T, yeah nigga, I thought you knew
You can't play a G, can't see me from a long long way
In the sky, so high on cloud 9
Man, hoe, (?) a young player stayin' down
Watch me up in the corner
Blowin' marijuana
Rollin' with that Pat in the Lincoln
With they blinker turner blinking
In the turning lane
Swanged out ride cus we on 4's, mane
Roll down OST
Can you niggas see me?
Still rollin' drop-top with that boy CB
Yep they wanna fool, but we still ride red
A lot of my homies yeah they gone in the pen
But you gotta get it, yeah you gotta grind
I'mma put it down, gotta get mine
I ain't gonna trip, roll mo' shit
This time I'm comin' 19s with this grip on the grind
Crawling on boys, watch a young player cryin'
Fog lights on
Grippin' till dawn
On my mobile phone
On the way home
Got my bopper at the fuckin' crib
Fat Pat yeah you know the nigga straight (?)
Livin' in the (?)
Another fuckin' story
You know the Pat ain't never gon' worry
Ridin' niggas tryna catch me straight drinkin'
Comin' down Scotch, see that nigga now they blinking
At the damn light, lookin' so blue
Rode my Alberta Impala at the hood
Wassup Third Ward
Wassup Hiram Clarke
Wassup Third Ward
Wassup South Park
Wassup Southwest
Smokin' on the stress
Comin' down the slab, man the slab is dressed
Two a fuckin' (?) a nice big grid
Popped up with the size desk on the key
We gon' wreck the mic
We up in your sight
Don't give a damn if you hate us in the night
Why we grip down? Cus we like 6 deep
Swangas and Blades out there on the creep
Choppin' boys up
Swangin' boys up
Poppin' on the trunk and I don't give a fuck
