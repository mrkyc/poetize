He thumbed his way
From L.A. back to Knoxville
He found out those bright lights
Ain't where he belongs
From a phone booth in the rain
He called to tell me
He had a change of dreams
He's coming home
But I told him not to bother 'cause I'm gone

Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling, keeps on falling
I keep on calling, no need calling
Her name, just forget my name
Yeah, smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching, keep on searching
I can't go on hurting, I know you're hurting
Hurting this way, but you threw me away
She's somewhere in the smokey mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn right now?

Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling, keeps on falling
I keep on calling, keep on calling
Calling her name, but it ain't the same
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching, keep on searching
I can't go on hurting, I know you're hurting
Hurting this way, turn abouts, fair play
She's somewhere in the smokey mountain rain

Listen, I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
Gotta find her no matter what it takes
It's too late, 'cause I will

Oh, oh, oh
Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling, just keeps on falling
I keep on calling, no need calling
Calling her name, just forget my name
(I'll find her)
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching, there's no need searching
I can't go on hurting, I'm sorry you're hurting
Hurting this way, what can I say?
(Gonna change her life)
Smokey mountain rain
Smokey mountain rain
I keep on calling, calling, calling, calling her name
Forget my name
