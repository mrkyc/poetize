They say that you're making a fool out of me
Baby, it took me some time to come 'round
To realize you were not what you seem
Each day's passing
The clock's been my friend
Helped me get back on my feet again
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be over reacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt
And someday I will replace you
I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserve
I was down, down, down
I was down
I'm not the first
And I won't be the last
To make the mistake of believing in you
I don't intend to live in the past
Just like they say
Some you win, some you lose
You never loved me and you made it plain
Now it's my turn and I'm playing your game

Just an everyday distraction
You'd be over reacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt
And some day I will replace you
I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserve
Love and affection
You started changing directions
You threw it away
Girl, you threw it away
You never loved me and you made it plain
Now it's my turn to make you understand
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be over reacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt
And someday I will replace you
I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserved
Like the button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be over reacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt
And someday I will replace you
I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserved
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be over reacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt
