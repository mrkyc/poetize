Some you win and some you lose
Just when you think that love is true
Somebody makes a fool out of you
You like it or not, one thing for sure
All is fair in love and war
You and me, we make love all night
And we end up in a knock down, drag out fight
We kick and we cuss and we scream and shout
Until we forgot what we're fightin' about
Kiss and makeup and make love some more
Cause all is fair in love and war
And now, anything goes when it come to love
Someone's going down when push comes to shove, yeah
It's a fight to the finish with no holds barred
Someone winds up with a broken heart
That's tough, that's real tough
Now baby, you know that I sure would grieve
If you were to ever leave me
I guess I'd have to find me someone new, yeah
Someone who's a little bit prettier than you
