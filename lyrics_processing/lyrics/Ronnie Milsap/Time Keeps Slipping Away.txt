I've been lookin' at my list of achievements
Next to a list of what I'd like to someday
My "like to" list is longer by a couple of pages
And time keeps slipping away

I always tell myself I'll do it tomorrow
Then tomorrow turns into yesterday
Yeah, I've become the master of a million excuses
And time keeps slipping away

I've got the house, got the car
But I've still got the hunger
Got the job, got my friends
Who am I to complain?
Trouble is, I've got dreams
And I ain't gettin' no younger
And time keeps slipping away
Yeah, time keeps slipping away

Over forty, but I'm just gettin' started
Wanna live a little more before it gets too late
For everything I've done, there's still a hundred I want to's
And time keeps slipping away

I've got the house, got the car
But I've still got the hunger
Got the job, got my friends
Who am I to complain?
Trouble is, I've got dreams
And I ain't gettin' no younger
And time keeps slipping away
Oh, time keeps slipping away

Each day's an open door
Yeah, what am I waiting for?
I've got one life, one chance

Oh, I've got the house, got the car
But I've still got the hunger
Got the job, got my friends
Who am I to complain?
Trouble is, I've got dreams
And I ain't gettin' no younger
And time keeps slipping away
Oh, yeah

I've got the house, got the car
But I've still got the hunger
Got the job, got my friends
Who am I to complain?
Trouble is, I've got dreams
And I ain't gettin' no younger
And time keeps slipping away
Yeah, time keeps slipping away
Listen, time keeps slipping
Time keeps slipping
Time keeps slipping away
