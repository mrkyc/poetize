Dame un beso
Para siempre

Over and over, I look in your eyes
You are all I desire
You have captured me
I want to hold you
I want to be close to you
I never want to let go

I wish that this night would never end
I need to know

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever?
(Forever, ooh)
You might also like
Over and over, I've dreamed of this night
Now you're here by my side
You are next to me (You are next to me)
I want to hold you (Hold you)
And touch you and taste you (Hold you)
And make you want no one but me

I wish that this kiss could never end, oh no
Oh, baby, please (Please, please)
(Could I?)

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
(Un beso para siempre, para siempre)
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever? (Forever)
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever? (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)
Oh!

I don't want any night to go by
Without you by my side
I just want all my days
Spent being next to you
Lived for just loving you
And, baby, oh, by the way
(Could I hold you?) Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I just want to hold you?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)

Oh, forever?
(Could I have this kiss forever? Could I have this kiss forever?)
Solo, solo un beso
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Un beso para siempre (Para siempre)
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Dame un beso para siempre
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Para siempre

Could I have this kiss forever?
