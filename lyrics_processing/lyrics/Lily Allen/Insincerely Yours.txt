What's going on in the magazines?
It's the same damn thing in every one
I don't give a fuck about the Delevigne, that Rita girl, about Jourdan Dunn
I don't wanna know about your perfect life, your perfect wife and it makes me sick
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram, about your lovely house or your ugly kids

I'm not your friend and I can't pretend (I ain't being funny, funny)
Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile and can make it worthwhile (Don't touch me honey, honey)
Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
(Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money)
We're all here, we're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money)

Whatever happened to the real DJs?
'Cause the chick you've paid can't mix for shit
She's looking good with her headphones on
With her Beats by Dre, she's so legit
I see pictures of her all the time on the Mail Online, she's everywhere
Does anybody know what she does? Do you know her name?
Do you really care?

I've never been one to moan that you're doing in my head now (Doing in my head, doing in my head, doing in my head)
Won't somebody take me home?
I'm ready for my bed now
(Ready for my bed, ready for my bed, ready for my bed)
