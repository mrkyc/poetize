I've tried everything, everything, everything
To feel something
But nothing

I feel it in my gut
I'm gonna let you fuck me
I know I'm being used
I'm just another thing to do
I don't know why I do it to myself (Myself)
Giving all my worth to someone else (Someone else)
I don't know why I do it to myself (Myself)
I'll do it, yeah, and I'll do it till

I've tried everything, everything, everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?

From up and down, and down to up
Sex, alcohol, and drugs
It's a long way off amazing
But I can't ever see it changing (Standing it)
I can't tell you what I do it for (I do it)
Nothing really moves me anymore (I do it)
I can't tell you what I do it for (I do it)
Been doing this and I'll do it till

I've tried everything, everything, everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?

I'm at my worst when I'm alone
Can't take the peace
So my glass is always half-empty
Someone fill it up for me
Set me free
I don't want to fall in love
No, all I need is for someone to walk all over me
Close the door behind you please
Let me be
I've tried everything, everything, everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches?
