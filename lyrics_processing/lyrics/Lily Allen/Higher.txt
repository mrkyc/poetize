Please, you know I rate Queens
Yo, cah that's in my jeans
I don't want grief, don't want drama
I just went out for a little Chinese
Had Chinese then couldn't leave
I lost my phone and my cards and keys
Came, came home four o'clock
Walk back like I'm, walk back like I'm chief

Do me right, you're lying
It's in your eyes, don't try it
No, you can't hide, have you lost your mind?
Did I cross your mind?
It's your life, I said I'd never
Let you waste my time
I said you'd never
Hear me say that twice
You crossed that line
You crossed that line

You know what you're doing
I won't listen to another excuse
This time you blew it
The people you used are jumping through hoops
I won't let you do it
You can't seduce me, now who looks foolish?
Sorry, but I know your type
I won't be undermined
You might also like
I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes gettin' higher and higher and higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
High-higher (high-higher)

You'll be fine, stop crying
Dry your eyes, stop fighting
Rest that mind, give yourself some time
You might like what you find
It's your life, and I said I'd never
Let you ruin mine
I said I'd never, ever
Pay the price
You crossed the line
You crossed the line

Why did you do it? (Oh, yeah)
Why would you choose to use and abuse me?
This close to ruin (oh, yeah)
Why just stand by?
Don't you dare roll your eyes
Why put me through it?
Enough with the lies
I know what the truth is
Sorry, but I know your type
I won't be undermined
I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes gettin' higher and higher and higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher (high-high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-high-higher)
