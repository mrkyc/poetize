Do you think
Everything, everyone, is going mental?
It seems to me we're spiralling outta control and it's inevitable
Now don't you think
This time is yours, this time is mine?
It's temperamental
It seems to me, we're on all fours
Crawling on our knees, someone help us, please

Oh, Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright? No, not slightly
I wanna get a flat, I know I can't afford it
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well, I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles

Oh, yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Don't you want something else
Something new, than what we've got here?
And don't you feel it's all the same
Some sick game, and it's so insincere?
I wish I could change the ways of the world
Make it a nice place
Until that day, I guess we stay
Doing what we do, screwing who we screw
You might also like
Why can't I sleep at night?
Don't say "It's gonna be alright"
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognese
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days
In the magazines, they talk about weight loss
If I buy those jeans, I can look like Kate Moss
I know it's not the life that I chose
But I guess that's the way that things go

Oh, yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Oh, yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...

Oh, Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright? No, not slightly
I wanna get a flat, I know I can't afford it
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well, I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...
But I guess it's just the way that things go
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...
But I guess it's just the way that things go
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...
I suppose it's just the way the cookie crumbles
