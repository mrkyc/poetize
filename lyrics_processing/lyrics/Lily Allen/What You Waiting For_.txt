Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na

Since we separated
I've been suffocated, ah yeah
All the empty space in my head
First I felt liberated by it
But solitude is overrated
The other day I swear someone said
"Someone else is sharing your bed"
Maybe you picked up where I left
Now my heart is sinking
I don't know what I've been thinking

I turned a strong man weak
I threw him down, brought him to his knees
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me
I think to myself

What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
I just don't know, know, know
You might also like
Now the dust has settled
I should probably level with you
Meant it when I said "I do"
Don't know why I was untrue
With everything I put you through
How'd it make you feel if I said I still love you
If I could go back, select all press undo
Never thought we'd be this couple
I ran at the first sign of trouble

I turned a strong man weak
I threw him down, brought him to his knees
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me
I think to myself

What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
I just don't know, know, know
Since we separated
I've been suffocated, ah yeah
All the empty space in my head
First I felt liberated by it
But solitude is overrated
The other day I swear someone said
"Someone else is sharing your bed"
Maybe you picked up where I left
Now my heart is sinking
I don't know what I've been thinking

I turned a strong man weak
I threw him down, brought him to his knees
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me
I think to myself

What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
