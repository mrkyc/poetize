It's 2 a.m., so why'd you stop the music?
I'm still swaying like I was on a cruise ship
Took the words straight out of my mouth
Come on, everybody, back to my house
Take my hand now, you're coming over
It doesn't matter, you can sleep on my sofa
Bring some fags and bring some Rizlas
We're gonna party like it's nobody's business

Let your hair down now, it's the end of the week
And this is our time now, let's forget everything
And put your glad rags on, dressing up like we're queens of the night

We just wanna dance the night away
We don't give a damn what people say
We've had enough, so turn it up
Tonight, we're taking over
We all wanna drink till we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We're going through, it's how we do
Tonight, we're taking over

I feel fly, I'm rocking Kenzo
I'll get high, but I ain't doing benzos
I might dance like your auntie
I don't care 'cause we're here to party
I got a quite good record collection
Yeah, I got everything that came out on Def Jam
I've got hip hop, I've got dubstep
I'll take us right through from sunrise to sunset

And put your glad rags on, dressing up like we're queens of the night

We just wanna dance the night away
We don't give a damn what people say
We've had enough, so turn it up
Tonight, we're taking over
We all wanna drink till we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We're going through, it's how we do
Tonight, we're taking over

Drink a little more and dance a little harder
Shout a little louder if you like
Move a little faster, stand a little taller
Do whatever makes you feel alright
Drink a little more and dance a little harder
Shout a little louder if you like
Move a little faster, stand a little taller
Do whatever makes you feel alright

Go harder
Go harder now
Go harder
Go harder now
We just wanna dance the night away
We don't give a damn what people say
We've had enough, so turn it up
Tonight, we're taking over
We all wanna drink till we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We're going through, it's how we do
Tonight, we're taking over
We just wanna dance the night away

Tonight, we're taking over
We all wanna drink till we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We're going through, it's how we do
