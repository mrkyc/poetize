I'm a beautiful (Beautiful)

Fashionable (Best dressed)
Animal
But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

Tell me I'm brilliant and talented
And that I'm the best
And do you think I've still got it
I think I've been depressed
Where's all my free shit
My packages
My ten trips to the lavatories
My handbags, my pieces
I thought it was beneath me
Please, sir, do you want my picture
Do you want my address
Do you want my fame
Do you want my star
Do you want my beauty
Do you want my power
Do you want my number
Do you want my love

Sometimes I think to myself
That I might have got it wrong
The path I've chosen
Might not be the one I should be on
I can't get enthusiastic
About a shitload of plastic
I thought it would be easy
I thought it would complete me
But I want my evenings
And I want my girlfriends
And I want my peace
And I want my drugs
And I want my figure
And I want my glamour
And I want my life back
I want your love

But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love

If I laid down
What would I be?
What if I stopped?
Would you like me?
What have I done?
Would you show me
How I lost my grip?
Will you stand by me?
