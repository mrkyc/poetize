Don't let anyone
Ever tell you
Who you are
Or can or can't become
So what if it's one in a hundred
Who's to say you are not that one?
Maybe it's, sleepless nights
Eventually you'll get a piece of that patriarchy pie
There'll be tears
Drawn out fights

I don't see no reason you can't
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it

I know what it's like, in more difficult times
I was treading a line
Between drive and survival
If I could go back
See myself as a child
I'd say stick to your guns girl
In fact go get that rifle
They will try, to take you down
Men in the middle
Keep the world spinning round
Love this life
Stand your ground
You might also like
I don't see no reason you can't
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it

There's some light
Think you need it
You look so god, damn defeated
Why'd you feel so cheated
Best believe it

Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
