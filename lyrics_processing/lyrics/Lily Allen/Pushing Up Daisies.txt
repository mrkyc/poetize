I don't know how to tell you
Don't know how to say it aloud
You haven't put me in a bad mood
It's you I'm all about
Might take a few drinks
To spit this out
But I really, really miss you when you're not around

Oh, I don't want to freak you out
But I'm probably gonna freak you out
Should shut my mouth

But lately, I've been thinking about maybe
Having one of your babies
I could take your name
Just claim me
I'll save you if you'll save me
Till we're pushing up daisies
Just you and me, babe

Baby, I can see that you care
I'm not going anywhere
Promise you don't need to be scared
I'm not going anywhere
Baby, I can see that you care
I'm not going anywhere
Promise you don't need to be scared
You might also like
Catching lots of feelings
Wanna say it feels like love
When it comes to these things
I seem to fuck it all up
Never been too good at all this stuff
I don't want to lose you, do you believe in us?

Oh, I don't want to freak you out
But I'm probably gonna freak you out
Know I should shut my mouth

But lately, I've been thinking about maybe
Having one of your babies
I could take your name
Just claim me
I'll save you if you'll save me
Till we're pushing up daisies
Just you and me, babe

When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
One day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
Pushing up the daisies
When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
One day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
Pushing up the daisies

Will you stay with me till there's nothing left?
When we've lost our teeth, sleep in separate beds
When we're just a strain on the NHS
Will you stay with me?
If I start to vote for my own interests
If I'm Daily Mail reading know what's best
Swanning round here in my slippers and dressing gown
Hope you'd give me a dressing down

When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
One day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
Pushing up the daisies
When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
One day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
Pushing up the daisies
When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
Cause one day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
Pushing up the daisies
When we're in our 80s
Hope that you don't hate me
One day, we'll be pushing up the daisies
