I don't know much, but I know this for certain
That is the sun poking its head round the curtain
Now please can we leave, I'd like to go to bed now
It's not just the sun that is hurting my head now
I'm not tryna say that I'm smelling of roses
But when will we tire of putting shit up our noses?
I don't like staying up, staying up past the sunlight
It's meant to be fun and this just doesn't feel right

Why can't we all, all just be honest
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it
From grown politicians to young adolescents
Prescribing themselves antidepressants
How can we start to tackle the problem
If you don't put your hands up and admit that you're on them
The kids are in danger, they're all getting habits
'Cause from what I can see, everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it

I get involved, but I'm not advocating
Got an opinion
Yeah, you're well up for slating
See you've got a prescription, and that makes it legal
I find the excuses overwhelmingly feeble
You go to the doctor
You need pills for sleeping
Well, if you can convince him, then I guess that's not cheating
So your daughter's depressed, we'll get her straight on the Prozac
But little do you know, she already takes crack

Why can't we all, all just be honest
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it

Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it

Everyone's at it
(At it, at it, at it...)
