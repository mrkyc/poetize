Will the defendant please rise? State your full name for the record
Robyn
Do you wish to say anything before the sentence is imposed?
I do, your Honor

You know, from time to time, I need to get down (Down)
Unwind and just bump and grind (Grind)
I get my shine on, have some fun
A little dirty never hurt anyone (One)
I admit, I can get somewhat X-rated on the floor
But your Honor, how's that something you get incarcerated for?

I-I-I done nothing that's wrong
Way better by degrees, some-something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly, Judge, they played my song

Y-yo-yo, Judge, may the record reflect the fact
I don't have any priors
Besides, would you pardon me for being inappropriately attired?
But yo, listen, them cuffs down at county
Totally ripped up my pantyhose
And some snitch punk at legal aid
Stole my voucher for court clothes
I done nothing that's wrong
Way better by degrees, some-something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly, Judge, they played my song
