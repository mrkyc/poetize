Hey girl in the strobing light
What your mama never told ya
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older
Young boy by the traffic light
What your daddy never told ya
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older

Hold up a second, I-I got something on my dirty mind
I start out with good intentions, but mess it up like all the time
I try to keep up appearance
But always end up way out of line, hey
I need some kind of miracle
Cause I lost all my faith in science
So I put my faith in me

He said: "Careful, 'cause you might just get your wish"
(Everybody in the back, singing...)

Back in suburbia, kids get high and make out on the train, yeah
Then endless incomprehensible boredom takes a hold again
And in this other dream, I'm on top of the world
Ahead of the game
Think of reality and it hits me hardcore to the brain
(We've got to get away, ooh)
