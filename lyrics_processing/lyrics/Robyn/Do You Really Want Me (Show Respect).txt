Do you really want me? Am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long
Respect and love is the key, just listen to my song
Yeah, yeah, mm

Boy, listen to me carefully now
'Cause this is something every man should know
Oh, this is a lesson about how
You treat your girl right, just let it show
That you love her, that you need her
Say, yeah, that you want her in every way
You gotta show your girl a little respect
Or you won't get nothing back but hate
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right or get out of her sight
Oh oh

Do you really want me (Do you really?)
Am I really special? (Really special)
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me (If you really)
Don't make we wait too long (Don't make me wait too long)

She'll do anything, just do her right
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right or get out of her sight

Do you really want me? (Do you really?)

No part time job, no time to rest
Let him know what's up before
So he can give you more and more
