You ask us this question the answer seems like a lie?
You know what we're saying and you know what it means
And it's always sincere, God knows
But it never gets through to where you need
Before you were born someone kicked in the door
There's no place for you here, stay back where you belong
Before you were born someone kicked in the door
You are not wanted here anymore
God damn the people who left you in pain
God damn the father, without face, without name
God damn the lovers who never showed up
And God damn the wounds that show how deep a word can cut
Before you were born someone kicked in the door
There's no place for you here, stay back where you belong
Before you were born someone kicked in the door
You are not wanted here, stay back where you belong
And how can it happen, now that you know the cause
That nothing is changing and everything's wrong?
But pain is the healing, and the tears sting like alcohol
Just keep on their breathing, we'll help you down the long, long road back home
