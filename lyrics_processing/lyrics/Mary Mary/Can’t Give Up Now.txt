Mmm
There will be mountains
That I will have to climb
And there will be battles
That I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try

I just can't give up now
I come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far
To leave me

Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I wanted to go (no no no no)
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say help me to be strong

I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
(oh oh oh)
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far
To leave me

Oh oh, no You didn't bring me
Out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that You are with me so I can't

(I just can't give up now) I just can't no no no
'Cause I've come too far from where I started from
(Come too far from where I started from)
Nobody told me, no, that the road would be easy
