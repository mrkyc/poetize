Good morning, I had a goodnight sleep
And it's, my favorite day of the week
And I, I believe I'll start with prayer
Then get ready cause I gotta get there
Soon as I get through the door
My hands up, feet off the floor
Cause all the saints we go to work
That's how we do it down at my church

Ushers march (Ooh), choir sing (Ooh)
Kids playing (Ooh), the tambourine (Ooh)
Preachers preaching, the mothers prayin'
Sunday best on and we ain't playin'
I been workin' hard since Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Saturday came and gone
I can't wait, to get to Sunday morning

Good evenin', night service is about to start
And I gotta go do my part
'Cause I sing with the choir
We try to take the people a little higher
Then I give my testimony
Tell everybody what God done for me
Just wanna encourage you
Cause at my church that's what we do
You might also like

Maybe you go to the park (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Maybe you stay in the bed (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Maybe you go and wash your car (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Or hang (Hang), with your (Hang)
Friends down at the mall (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And all of those things are cool (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And maybe that's fine with you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
