Yo, we taking praises to another level
Ya ready?
Let me see you dance
Let me see you praise Him
Darkchild, Mary Mary

Whatever you need for Him to do
He will do it if you give Him the chance
And I am telling He's already proud
That He can do anything
So give Him the chance
Now there's been so many times
I called on Him
Regardless of the circumstance
He was there
So now I devoted my life to serving Him
It's me for Him 'cause all the time
He was there for me
 (Erica)
It doesn't matter what the need
(No there's no limit, I'll give You anything)
All I want is for You to trust me
(Through My love I'll set You free)
You might also like
He said I'll go wherever
You want me to go
He said I'll do whatever You want me to do
He said I'll go wherever
You want me to go
He said I'll do whatever You want me to do

Now it is a must I testify and
Let everybody know
I live because of you and they
Can have the same life
That I choose
And when they ask me how
I'll say it's because of You
 (Tina)
It doesn't matter what the need
(No there's no limit, I'll give You anything)
All I want is for You to trust me
(Through My love I'll set You free)


Whatever You want from me
What else can I do to make You see
To prove to You I'm everything
That You'll ever need
What else do I have to say
To show you more clearly
That I am, that I am
The beginning and the end
Yes I'm You, everything
 (Fats)
You don't know God is the truth, He is
(And everything that He said He'll do)
(He did) new whips (new cribs)
A few hits (I'm blessed with ice)
Blessed with life (on top of that)
Yo I'm blessed with Christ
(So His heart must be
As big as Texas right)
I ain't thinkin of the change or
(Thinkin of the blames)
Think of range
(I ain't even thinkin the same)
When I think of His name yo
(I'm thinkin of praise)
(Wit) Fats and Darkchild (so close in wit)
Mary Mary (ah yeah)
(You know then)

But we talking about Christ
Get to know Him, come on


He said I'll go wherever you want me to go
He said I'll do whatever you want me to do
That is what He said to me
That is what He said to me
That is what He said to me (oooh whoa)

That is what He said to me
That is what He said to me
