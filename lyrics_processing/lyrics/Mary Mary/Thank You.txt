All kinds of diseases, people are slipping away
Economies down, people don't get enough pay
But as for me all I can say is
Thank You Lord for all You done for me, yeah-yeah, yeah
Ohh, oh
Folks without homes are in the streets
And the drug habit some say, they just can't beat
Muggers and robbers, no place seems to be safe
But You've been my protection every step of the way
And I want to say
Thank You Lord for all You've done for me (hey, hey, hey, hey)
It could've been me (thank You)

With no food (thank You)
And no clothes (thank You)

With a tragic end (thank You)
But You didn't see fit (thank You)

And everyday by Your power (thank You)
You keep on, keep keeping me (thank You)
