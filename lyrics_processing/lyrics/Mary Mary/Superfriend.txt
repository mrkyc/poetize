The machine

They're here now, but then they're gone (Aye)
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door (Aye)
That kinda friend, I gotta let go
A super friend, a super friend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A super friend, a super friend
I got me a super friend

No sir, there's nothing half way about him
This world could never be made without him
No heart, no breath, no mind
No sun, no moon, no time
He's something like the best of them
He's nothing like the rest of them

'Cause they're here now, but then they're gone (Aye)
Where they at? I don't know
Ay, oh, they hit the door (Aye)
That kinda friend, I gotta let go
A super friend, a super friend
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A super friend, a super friend
I got me a super friend

Lord, I'm so weak and scared to run
What have I done to deserve a life like this?
The devil's scared to fight us in the light
He hides in the midst of religion
But I know that my God is listenin' there for me
There's a greater mission
You're no girl, you're no man, but a plan for greater peace
I'll fight for the light until my flesh falls deceased
I'm fightin' the devil, fightin' police
And in the church, Lord I'm looked at as Satan
'Cause in my music I curse
But I'm tryin' to do better and that's the thing that really hurts
All this sex and the drugs in my life mean nothin'
When my super friend hugs me at night, tears come rushin'
There's no kryptonite, no dealin' no lie that could be told
That can separate the power that you have over my soul
So stuntin' is a habit when I'm grippin' this mic
Y'all thinkin' I'm a pimp but I'm trying to be like Christ
In real life, yeah

They're here now, but then they're gone (Aye)
Where they at? (Where they at?), I don't know (I don't know)
Ay, oh (Oh), they hit the door (Aye)
That kinda friend, I gotta let go
A super friend (Friend), a super friend (Friend)
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A super friend (Friend), a super friend (Friend)
I got me a super friend
He heard me before I made a sound (Aye)
Caught me before I hit the ground
He knows everything I need (Aye)
Before I tell him anything
Loves me without requirements (Aye)
Can't see him but it's evident
He's something like the best of them (Aye)
Said he's nothing like the rest of them (Oh)

'Cause they're here now, but then they're gone (Aye)
Where they at? (Where they at?), I don't know (I don't know)
Ay, oh, they hit the door (Aye)
That kinda friend, I gotta let go (That kinda friend, I gotta let 'em go)
A super friend (Friend), a super friend (Friend)
Yes sir, I got me one of them
A super friend (Friend), a super friend (Friend)
I got me a super friend

Can't nobody do me like my super friend
Can't nobody do me like my super friend, no
Can't nobody do me like my super friend
