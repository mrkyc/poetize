I don't mind, though
I'm glad to be free, you know what I'm saying?
Uh
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
What you wanna do? - spoken

Yeah, yeah - spoken
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Fill me - spoken
And I'm gonna praise You
What you gonna do? - spoken

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been bound for so long
Felt like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands
I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance
