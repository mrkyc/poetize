To turn my back on You
When You had given me everything
I let You down, I know that's true
Now I've come to realize that there
There are no happy days because
You're not here, I need to know
If there's a chance for me again
Ohh
All I need is 1 minute of Your time
5 seconds of it may change Your mind
10 seconds to make You see
15 to say Lord I'm sorry
For all the things I've done
It will take 20 more to say that You're the one
9 to think it through
I'll take the one to say I love You
Late at night when I was alone
You held me in Your arms
I strayed away only to find
There was no place to hide
Lord please hear me when I say
I'll give my life to You whatever I've got to do
Show me Lord and i will live for You

5 seconds of it may change Your mind
10 seconds to make You see
15 to say Lord I'm sorry
For all the things I've done
It will take 20 more to say that You're the one
9 to think it through
I'll take the one to say I love You
I'm not willing to, to give up on You
Knowing that You always stood right by me
Until You forgive me my world won't turn
So if you hear me Lord i'm saying that I'm sorry
Said, I'm saying sorry
All I need is 1 minute of Your time
5 seconds of it may change Your mind
10 seconds to make You see
15 to say Lord I'm sorry
For all the things I've done
It will take 20 more to say that You're the one
9 to think it through
