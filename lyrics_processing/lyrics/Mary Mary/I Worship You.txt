I was lost but you came and found me
You left your thrown thinking about me
You bled and died to show me mercy
You gave your all because you saw my need
I was empty but you came and filled me
I was blinded but you helped me to see
I was broken but you made me whole again
I felt like nothin' but you gave me confidence

And I'm filled so much with gratitude
That words are not enough
To explain the magnitude, the passion of my love

Oh, you took everything I was, made me what I am
And with all I am, I worship you
You took everything I was, made me what I am
And with all I am, I worship you

You were life when I was dyin'
You were strength when I was cryin'
You were right and I was so wrong
A melody when I had no song
You might also like
And I'm filled so much with gratitude
That words are not enough
To explain the magnitude, the passion of my love
