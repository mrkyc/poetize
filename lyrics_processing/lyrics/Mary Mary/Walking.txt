Boom, ha, ha, ha
Now that I got your attention, yeah, hey
How ya doin' (How ya doin')
How ya doin' (How ya doin')
How ya doin', c'mon
Baby doll, may remember (Hey)
Come back again (Yeah)
Yeah, I might walk a little
Just a second, talk to 'em

Tell me what you see when I pass by
Shadow, a cloud, or a line in the sky
Am I gettin' you wrong or am I gettin' you right?
Well, all I can take is one, one step at a time

Look at me, I'm trying
Everyday, I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again, next time that you see me
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'

Some people say walkin' takes too long
But I say with walkin' you can't go wrong (No)
Why should you rush away through life?
You won't get very far runnin' all the time

Look at me, I'm trying
Everyday, I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again, next time that you see me

I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'

Why does my life say about me
Can't anyone see, does it show I rock with the greatest?
I can't get back the time I spent
Use the rest of it to show all the world how I made it

(I put one foot in front of the other) I'm walkin', (Yes, I do, yeah) I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
(And I keep on) I'm walkin', I'm walkin', (I'm takin' me one day at a time) I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
(And I'm steady walkin') I'm walkin', I'm walkin', (Yeah) I'm walkin'
('Cause I know that Jesus walks with me) I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin' (Yes, he does)
(Said I know that Jesus walks with me) I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin' (So, I keep on)
I'm walkin', I'm walkin' (Yeah, yeah), I'm walkin'
(Said I keep on) I'm walkin', (Walkin', walkin') I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
Said I'm walkin', yeah

Ooh, hoo
Hey, come on walk with us real quick
Ah, yeah
Left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right, right, right
I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
