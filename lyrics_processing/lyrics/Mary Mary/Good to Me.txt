Growing up in a real big family
I had to take what I could get
There was always a sister or brother
I had to share everything with
I had to share my room, wear hand-me-downs
'Cause we didn't have much money
Now there's not much I long for
Tellin' you God's been good to me, oh no no

You may think I've got it easy
And that's the way it's always been
But that's not really my story

I had to work real hard to get here
But I didn't do it all alone
Someone was watching over me
And that is why I sing this song, oh no

If I began to count my blessings (I wouldn't know where)
I wouldn't know where to begin (God has)
God has done so much for me (Ooh, ooh)
He's been much more than a friend (Than a friend)
He's a protector and provider (A provider)
