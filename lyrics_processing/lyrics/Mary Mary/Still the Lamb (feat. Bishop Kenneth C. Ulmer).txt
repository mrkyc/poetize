He came to be, so meek and mild, a Savior yet and humble child
A Holy Lamb, precious Lamb, they called Him Lamb of God

It was the greatest demonstration of love that the world would ever know
God so love the world that he gave His only begotten Son
And this Son came as a Lamb
He would become a conquering King but He came as a Lamb
He would be King of kings and Lord of lords
But He came as a Lamb and He came for you

People came from miles around, all to worship and bow down
Ohhh the privilege, privilege it was, they called Him Lamb of God

Shepherds came seeking this Lamb, and their lives will never be the same
The angelic host formed a choir, and sang from the heavenlies
Wise men were wise enough to seek and bow down to this Lamb
He came to seek and to save the lost
He came because He loves you
It's great to know that God so loved the world
But more important to know, that God loves you

Now here it is, many years have passed
They say His time has come and passed
Ohhh, but I'm so glad, that it remains
You're still the Lamb of God

John looked over the horizon and saw One walking as no man walked
And he said "behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world"
He's still saving, He's still redeeming, and He's still there for you today
Receive Him!, say yes to Him, and He will change your life
Time cannot change Him and ages do not time Him
He's still the Lamb of God

Still Holy, still righteous, still the Lamb of God
Still Savior, still Redeemer, still the Lamb of God
Still Alpha, still Omega, still the Lamb of God
Still lovely, still healing, still the Lamb of God
Still Holy, still righteous, still the Lamb of God
Still Savior, still Redeemer, still the Lamb of God
Still saving, still loving, still the Lamb of God
