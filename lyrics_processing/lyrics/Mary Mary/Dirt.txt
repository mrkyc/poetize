God made dirt and dirt don't hurt

Funny thing about a garden
Beauty lives within its gates
Bugs and thorns and weeds, and they grow there
But they all help to create
Vivid color variations
Sweet aromas and sensations
Realize under it all, something not so beautiful
But we all

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little dirt to grow

Life at times can make you weak
And I have cried myself to sleep
'Cause reality makes you cry
But the truth will dry your eyes
Things they just can't stay the same
When you work hard and you pray
Yeah, it may be kind of rough now
But the point I'm trying to make is that we
You might also like
(We all) Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little dirt to grow

Oh, sometimes you may sing for yourself
You struggle hard just to prevail
It's the lesson you need to learn
It's the win you've got to earn
Champions never accept defeat
They fall and get back on their feet
'Cause they know (They know) like I know (I know)
That if you want to grow we

We all need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow (Need a little dirt to grow)
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain (Just a little) to wash our souls (Just a little)
We need a little bit (Need a little bit, I)
(I) Need a little dirt to grow
We all (We need) need a little bit (We need)
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit (We need)
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls (I could use some rain)
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little dirt to grow

Need a little dirt to grow (It'll make you better)
Need a little dirt to grow (It'll make you stronger)
Need a little dirt to grow (Oh, we need it, ah)
