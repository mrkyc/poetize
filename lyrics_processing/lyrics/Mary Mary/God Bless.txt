In the mall one day I saw you walking past
And then I looked again and you were gone
Well, anyway, I thought about when I last talked to you
And how I prayed for you
And how I told you things would be fine
In time you would be okay
But that was you then God bless

God Bless
You been on my mind
Thought I'd call you up and tell you
God bless ya
And I'm glad to see you didn't break under the pressure
God bless
I know it's been a while since we spent time together
God bless ya
And I'm glad to see you doing so much better

I remember when you made a big mistake
And had to go away and when your time was spent
You did all you could to prove you had changed
So many people didn't wanna give a second chance
But you didn't let that keep you from getting on your feet again
God Bless

And I'm glad to see you doing so much better

I really wanna let you know
I'm so happy for ya
Ya didn't let nothing hold you back
You did just what you had to
To change you situation and get yourself together
Made it through whatever, wishing you the best
