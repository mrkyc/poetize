When you say, "Love"
You use it so lightly
But when I think of it
This is what comes to me
Loving me, where I am
How I am
Just for who I am
All my good and bad
Sure you think
It's not a possibility
Something so pure it changes me
When after all these years it's still
The same
Just as strong as it was on the first day

This love, this love
The only love
That comes down from the heavens
(Why do you love)
Better than mothers, better than
Fathers, oh oh oh
This love, this love
This love is your love
This love is my love
(Why do you love)
This love, this love
From God, the Father
God up in heaven, you oughta know
You might also like
So you ask, "What about me?"
Sounds real good
But doesn't fit the life I lead
But let me tell you something
There is nothing new under the sun
And I don't care what you've done
His heart is for everyone

This love, this love
The only love
That comes down from the heavens
(Why do you love)
Better than mothers, better than
Fathers oh oh oh
This love, this love
This love is your love
This love is my love
(Why do you love)
This love, this love
From God, the Father
God up in heaven, you oughta know

Everybody oughta know (His love is real)
Said you really oughta know
(Tell me can you feel)
Everybody oughta know
(I'm talking to you, to you)
Please don't walk away from
This love, this love
The only love
That comes down from the heavens
(Why do you love)
Better than mothers, better than
Fathers oh oh oh
This love, this love
This love is your love
This love is my love
(Why do you love)
This love, this love
From God, the Father
