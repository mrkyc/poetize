Lets go
Yeah, yeah, woo
I don't usually do this but check it out

It was once upon a time not long ago
Lived a little Black boy in the middle of the ghetto
Pretty good kid but he always found trouble
Inner city life, it ain't hard to find trouble (Nah)
No income in the home, you find struggle
Two years strugglin', it's no puzzle
He hit the block hard and found him a hustle (Yeah)
He burned the wrong bridge and now he needs muscle
He tried to let it go but the streets don't forgive
I guess they ain't heard of live and let live
But after goin' 'round and 'round he broke it down
Finally found out that only God can save him now

Save me now, please, save me now (And the boy said)
Save me now, please, save me now (The boy said)
I'm on my knees, down on the floor
You're the one I need, oh Lord
Just save me now

I heard the story many times before (Still I'm wondering)
How in the world did I get here? (And what am I doing?)
You took the ring and acted like I do (Without the ceremony)
Now I got three little ones now (Hurting and I'm lonely)
Threw away my dreams when I left school (Now I'm twenty-two)
Never should've chose him over You

(Oh, save me now) Save me now, please, save me now (Save me now)
Save me now, please, save me now (I'm on my knees, Lord)
I'm on my knees, down on the floor
(You're the only one) You're the one I need, oh Lord (Please save me)
Save me now (Oh, take me)

Take me away (Away), I don't wanna stay here (I don't wanna stay here)
I wanna go back to the beginning (To that place)
To that place (Yeah) where love is forever
Me and You together
Lord, will You please

Save me now, please, save me now (Save me, save me, save me)
Save me now, please, save me now (Oh, I'm on my knees)
I'm on my knees (Down here prayin' Lord), down on the floor (On the floor and)
(You're the only one, You're the only one) You're the one I need, oh Lord
(Save me, Jesus, yeah) Just save me now, please, save me now (I'm in trouble)
Save me now (Save me), please, save me now
I love You, Lord (I love You), I need You (I desperately need You), Lord
(Desperately need You) I'm begging of You, Lord
Please save me (Save me)
Save me (And the boy said)
