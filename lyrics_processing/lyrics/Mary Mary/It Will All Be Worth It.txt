It will all be worth it, it will all be worth it
For those who do believe that one day
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now
But one day I know you will

We see through a glass, but hardly
A glimpse of future glory, but darkly
Oh, what a day imagining what awaits
Amidst all of the criticism
Skeptic views and cynicism
Yet we pray just to see your face

(Will it?) It will all be worth it, it will all be worth it (Oh, it will all be worth it)
(For those) For those who do believe that one day
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now (You can't see it now)
But one day I know you will

With every passing of a loved one
The many who've gone on before us
Makes your heartache, wondering why the delay
But with every heartbeat, your faith grows stronger
And the Lord whispers not much longer
Your soul is stirred and comforted with these words that
You might also like
It will all be worth it (It will all be worth it), (Oh, it will) It will all be worth it, (It will all be worth it)
(For those) For those who do believe that one day, (For those of us who do believe)
He will crack the sky, I know you can't see it now, I know

You know you can't see it now, not right now (You can't see it now, I know)
He's gonna wipe away everything that you said (You can't see it now, I know)
Oh, trials will seem so slow, when we see God, oh-oh (You can't see it now, I know)
What kind of space, all sins will be erased (You can't see it now, I know)
I'm gonna walk through the power he gave (You can't see it now, I know)
(You can't see it now, I know) Yes, I'm gonna say his name
I'm not worried about it, I see his praise
Work is gonna be over, yeah (You can't see it now, I know)
But the best is yet to come (You can't see it now, I know)
Yes, it's gonna be over, yeah, everything's gonna be alright (You can't see it now, I know)
You can't see it now
