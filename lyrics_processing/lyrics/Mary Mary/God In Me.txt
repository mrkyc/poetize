(Oh, you're listening to the sound)
I just wanna tell the truth, man
I just wanna tell the truth, man
I just wanna tell the truth, man
I just wanna tell the truth, man

You're so fly (Fly), you're so high (High)
Everybody around you trying to figure out why (Why)
You're so cool (Cool), you win all the time (Time)
Everywhere you go, man, you get a lot of shine (Shine)
Boy, like a magnet, better yet, I have it
Everything you wear, people say they gotta have it
From the sweatsuit to the white tee, to the Gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is you're on your knees
So, the next time you get it, just tell them

It's the God in me, it's the God in me
It's the God in me (Ayy), it's the God in me
It's the God in me
You think I'm so fresh, you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
(What is it, you think you see?) It's the God in me
It's the God in Me

You see her style (Style), you think she's nice (Nice)
You look at her whip (Whip), you say the whip tight (Tight)
You look at her crib (Crib), you thinkin' she paid (Paid)
You look at her life (Life), you think she's got it made (Made)
But everything she got, the girl's been given
She calls it a blessin', but you call it livin'
When it comes to money, she can be a hero
She writes them checks with a whole lot of zeros

But what they don't know is when she go home
And get behind closed doors, man, she hit the floor
And what they can't see is she on your knees
And if you ask her, she'll tell you

It's the God in me, it's the God in me
It's the God in me (Aye), it's the God in me
It's the God in me
You think I'm so fresh, you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
(What is it, you think you see?) It's the God in me
It's the God in Me
What is it you think you see
When you see me, you see me
You don't know how much I pray
Don't know how much I gave
Don't know how much I changed
I'm just trying to explain

It's the God in me (Ooh), it's the God in me
(It's the God in me) It's the God in me
(It's the God in me) it's the God in me
(Ooh, yeah) It's the God in me
(You think I'm so fresh) You think I'm so fresh
(You think I'm so clean) You think I'm so clean
(You think I'm so sweet) You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
(What is it, you think you see?) It's the God in me
It's the God in Me (Yeah)
Yeah, It's the God in me, yeah
God in me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You think I'm so fresh, you think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
