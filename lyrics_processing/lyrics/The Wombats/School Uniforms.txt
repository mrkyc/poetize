It all started on the school bus
You were 9 and I was 10
Remember, you had a Walkman?
All I had was a middle part and a pen

Oh, sweet Louise
Whatever happened to her?

Then it all went downhill
You grew tall; I stayed the same
I guess that that's just puberty
Making us boys all play a losing game

Oh, sweet Louise!

I always found it hard to work
Things through
Those school uniforms made a joke
Made a joke of me and you (Of me and you, of me and you, of me and you)
I'm glad I'm not back in school...

How can I compete with that? (How can he?)
I don't even know the location of the bike sheds

Oh, sweet Louise!

I always found it hard to work
Things through
Those school uniforms made a joke
Made a joke of me and you
I always found it hard to work
Things through
Those school uniforms made a joke
Made a joke of me and you (Of me and you, of me and you, of me and you)

I remember short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere

Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere (Short, skirts, fly, 'where)
Short skirts, long hair, my hormones flying everywhere (Whatever, whatever, whatever happened to her?)
