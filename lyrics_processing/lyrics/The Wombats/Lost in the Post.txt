I should have known you didn't have the time, my dear
To let this twenty-something bring you down with his list of fears
I'd like to think we had some fun times, though
It's just my inability to think outside the box, I know!

She was signed, sealed and lost in the post (Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Gone where all the letters we write to Santa go (We write to Santa, go!)

I could see your interest wane, my dear
She wanted Mary Poppins and I took her to King Lear
Yeah, we had some spills, shall I say?
And I thought you were going to leave, but not that you'd evaporate

She was signed, sealed and lost in the post (Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Gone where all the letters we write to Santa go (We write to Santa, go!)

Please let them go to Santa, go to Santa, go, go, go...
Go to Santa, go to Santa, go, go, go...
Go to Santa, go to Santa, go, go, go...
Go to Santa, go to Santa, go, go, go...
