What a great achievement it was
To get a hotel room this late
I'll bet they charge by the hour here
The kind of place you should bring your own UV ray
It's not a big problem with me, love
You don't look that hygienic, anyway
I'm only here because
I wanna twist the structure of my average day

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your bones that shatter, not mine
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog

What a great achievement it was
To find someone that shared such little self-restraint
I'm a non-believer, but
I believe in these dirty little wicked games
You might also likeSnakes and ladders are banned in here, love
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel the day deserves a truly sordid end

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter, not mine
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog

I've made some bad decisions, I'll admit that freely
It's just that life tastes sweeter when it's wrapped in debauchery
So drop your map, drop your plans, drop that five-step program
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap
It's clear you feel nothing, so jump into the fog with me
(Jump in, jump in, jump in)


Jump into the fog
Jump into the fog
Jump into the fog
Jump into the fog
Music, comedy, fireworks and flag-waving patriotism
You'll remember the rest of your life
