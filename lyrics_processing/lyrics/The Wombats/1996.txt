I had no cares in the 1990s
I knew of no downfalls
Though war was breaking out all around me
My concerns were with prank calls

She kissed me on the cheek, she kissed me on the cheek
Right in front of the older kids
When our self-belief, our self-belief
Wasn't scarred by the modern itch
'Cause now it feels like

We kiss with one eye on our TV set
And the more I give, the less I get
Needing fairground rides just to spark a smile
There's little here to miss
Bring back 1996 (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Bring back 1996 (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
So hard to beat those teenage kicks (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Bring back 1996 (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

We were cloning sheep in the 1990s
We were building telescopes
And sugar filled the whole of my body
As I urged it on to grow
You might also like
I kissed her on the cheek, I kissed her on the cheek
Just to impress the older kids
But my self-belief, my self-belief
Wasn't lost in the modern glitch
'Cause now it feels like

We kiss with one eye on our TV set
And the more I give, the less I get
Needing fairground rides just to spark a smile
There's little here to miss
Bring back 1996 (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Bring back 1996 (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Stop talking, stop talking (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I need a lover, not a friend tonight
I'm leaving, I'm leaving (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm not cut out for the modern life

(Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
(Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
(Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
(Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
Bring back 1996
(Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da
