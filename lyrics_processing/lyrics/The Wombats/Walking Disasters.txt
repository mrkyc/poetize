She used to get her kicks from a four-to-the-floor
But now she's always wasted
A total looker, but she's jaded
The kind of shivering wreck that I adore
I can't offer you a rescue
But I can tell you what I'd do

I'd tell my mother that I love her dearly
And tell my father that I need him back again
And if these words don't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip
And flowers might wilt when we walk past
And self-help might help when it makes us laugh
Only finding questions in answers
You and I are just walking disasters

You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters

She only finds her love in a downtown score
Consumption makes her stronger
You're the sweetest anaconda
A kind of lack of respect that I adore
I can't offer you a rescue
But when you've lost all that you have left to lose
You might also like
I'd tell my mother that I love her dearly (Ah)
And tell my father that I need him back again (Ah)
And if these words won't drop from your lips (Ah)
I will be your Freudian slip

As sharp as a knife and as blunt as a will (Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
You be my calm, I'll be your pneumatic drill
And what we'll never want, we'll always need (Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Right now, we need some pop psychology
To keep us upbeat

So tell your mother that you love her dearly
And tell your father you won't lock him out again
And if these words won't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip
And flowers might wilt when we walk past (Ah-ah-ah)
And self-help might help when it makes us laugh (Ah-ah-ah)
Only finding questions in answers (Ah-ah-ah)
You and I are just walking disasters (Ah-ah-ah)

You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters
