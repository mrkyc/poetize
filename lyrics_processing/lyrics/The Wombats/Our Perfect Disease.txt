We don't admit it, but we've never seen eye to eye
My hobby's moaning and yours is making money
It's always a shock when old friends pass by
But with you, it's no death in the family
Let's not talk about hate when there's hell to pay
For my cowardice and your bad timing
We don't admit it, but we've never seen eye to eye
And it's not through a lack of trying

It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
It was the perfect disease we had
And in its absence lies a painful fact
We all need someone to drive us mad

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like
I didn't say it, but you never were the honest type
You tried to fabricate a bedtime story
And now I miss those games we had of Jekyll and Hyde
Ever since the day that we parted company
Don't send a helping hand, I need a battering ram
To beat the reasons that I miss you so sorely
I didn't say it, but we never saw eye to eye
Now life is carefree and equally as boring

It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
It was the perfect disease we had (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
And in its absence lies a painful fact
We all need someone to drive us mad

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I need you in the TV, I need you on the train
I need you every single which way
I need you in the mirrors, I need you in my bed
I need you here to wreck my head
I need you in the TV, I need you on the train
I need you just to stand in my way
I need you in the mirrors, I need you in my bed

It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
It was the perfect disease we had (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
And in its absence lies a painful fact (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
