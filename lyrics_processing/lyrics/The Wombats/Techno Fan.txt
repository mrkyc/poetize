East London's not a bombsite
It is a treasure chest
We use our penguin costumes
More than our evening dress
She said I should come over
Though the music's not my type
Don't you know I'd chop a limb off
Just to have a good time?

Shut up and move with me, move with me
Or, or get out of my face
I didn't queue for an hour to leave straight away
Shut up and stay with me, stay with me
Or, or let go of my hands
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno fan

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

This is not a weird weekend
It's an angry wormhole
I'm talking like a city boy
And drinking with a Northern soul
She said I should come over
Though there's carnage at times
It still seems I'd chop a limb off
Before I put up a fight

Shut up and move with me, move with me
Or, or get out of my face
I didn't queue for an hour to leave straight away
Shut up and stay with me, stay with me
Or, or let go of my hands
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno...

We are the 1980s
We are the Detroit lights
And I never wanna, I never wanna see this stop
I'm in debt to you
But don't feed me plant food
Just shut up and move with me, move with me
Or, or get out of my face
I didn't spend twenty sheets to not cut a shape
Shut up and stay with me, stay with me
Or, or let go of my hands
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno fan

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I never knew I was a techno fan
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I never knew I was a techno fan
