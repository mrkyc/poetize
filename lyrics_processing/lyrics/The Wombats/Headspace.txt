Headspace, I need her out of my headspace
There's a war in here and I need you to take
Take her out of my headspace

Gonna drive, drive, drive this Cadillac
Up the ocean road until it runs out of gas
'Cause I'm hurt
I laugh and I joke but I'm hurt
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing my new swan-song
So all the bright young sparks have got a tune they can hum
But it'll hurt
I'll dance if they ask but it'll hurt

Headspace, I need her out of my headspace
There's a war in here and I need you to take
Take her out of my headspace
Did these 5.5 litres of blood
Have too sour a taste
For your sweet tastebuds?

'Cause now I feel, feel, feel like a discoball
From the 1970s all dusty and worn
And it hurts
I reflect the light, but it hurts
I used to run, run, run until my knees gave way
I used to wrestle with bears and kiss poisonous snakes
I didn't care
They scratch and they'd bite, I didn't care
I didn't care
You might also like
Headspace, I need her out of my headspace
There's a war in here and it's a body to save
Well, take her out of my headspace
Did these 5.5 litres of blood
Have too sour a taste
For your sweet taste buds?

You put a war zone inside me
Above and below the neck
Above and below the neck

Someone flick a light on
The dark just makes it worse
I'm running out of options and I'm lost for words
Little life wrecker, are you gonna let me know
Or keep showing me the compassion of a talkshow host?
I'm not acting my age here and I'm  growing up too fast
If these streets are paved with gold
I want my money back
'Cause Liverpool feels like a clouded memory
Now the Californian air has wrapped her claws around me
(Headspace, my headspace)
She wrapped her claws around me
