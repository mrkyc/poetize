She works downtown in an unmarked bar
Flyin' round poles, she always gave me the fright of my life!
I didn't mean to get involved
It was the alcohol mixed with an empty feeling inside

It's such a bad idea
To fall in love with a 'lady of the night'

(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Why couldn't God give her two left
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Feet
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Then she couldn't run away from me!

Months go by, and I'm alone in bed
While she's greasing up for when the businessmen and lawyers arrive
I've got to wear a beard, a suit, and tie
To get past the door if I want to see my girl tonight

I go to all this effort
Just to see my fair Patricia going home with some other guy
You might also like
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Why couldn't God give her two left
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Feet
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Then she couldn't run away from me!
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Oh, why couldn't God give her two left
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Feet
(Woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Then she couldn't run away from me!

She thinks I'm sad
And that's alright
But she doesn't hate me, so
There's my little alibi
I can't, I can't leave, I can't, I can't
I can't; she's my coked-up
Botox girl
Patricia, Patricia

Oh, Patricia
The stripper, you are my sunshine!
Oh, Patricia
The stripper, come on home tonight!
Oh, Patricia
The stripper, you are my sunshine
So why can't you come home with me
