Tonight we'll both go M.I.A
In different towns but in similar ways
I've tried my best, best to forget
But I can't, I can't, I can't
Tonight we'll scratch each other's face
If it's in the moment no one complains
I've tried my best to move along
But I can't, I can't, I can't

Kiss me with your fist; it's alright
Wrap your hands around my throat; I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just want to be your shadow

Just one more up-tempo tune
The suits don't care if their feet aren't blue
Are you aware of what's going on
In my heart, my heart, my heart?
Those machine gun eyes
Have fired crystals into me
You're such a violent high
And I'm such a loose cannon, can't you see?
You might also like
Kiss me with your fist; it's alright
Wrap your hands around my throat; I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just wanna be your shadow
Hire a bus, drive it over my rib cage
Snap my bank cards and throw them at my face
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just want to be your shadow

And I just want to be
The sum of your broken parts
And I just want to be
Your creature of the dark (I just want, I just want)
And I just want to be (I just want, I just want)
The sum of your broken parts (I just want, I just want)
And I just want to be (I just want, I just want)
Your creature of, your creature of the dark
I just want to be your shadow...

Kiss me with your fist; it's alright
Wrap your hands around my throat; I won't mind
I'm permanent, now I won't go
I just want to be your shadow
I just want to be your shadow
