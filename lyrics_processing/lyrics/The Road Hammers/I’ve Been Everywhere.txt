When along came a semi with a high and canvas covered load
"If you're going to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride."
So I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land."
I've been everywhere, man

Across the deserts bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man

Of travel I've had my share, man
I've been everywhere
