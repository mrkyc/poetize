Ain't nothin' gonna go gettin' outta hand while I'm behind the wheel
I'm on fire and I'm wired, full of diesel and ready for hire
Well, I'm buildin' a rollin' empire of blood, sweat and steel
I don't waste time, I make time, tearin' a strip off the white line
I'm a professional man, I'm one of a kind and I know how to bring it in
I'm a road hammer, a white knuckled steel gear jammer
A rig jockey highway slammer, I'm just doin' what I gotta do
I'm a road hammer, double talkin' CB grammer
Haul your load from Alabama all the way to Timbuktoo
I've hauled the left coast, the west coast
California sun where they're chillin' the most
To follow 309 Teddy Bears ghost
All the way to New Orleans
I've been from Thunder Bay, to PA
All the way down to FLA
And every little town along the way
There ain't much that I haven't seen
I'm a road hammer, a white knuckled steel gear jammer
A Rig jockey highway slammer, I'm just doin' what I gotta do
I'm a road hammer, double talkin' CB grammer
Haul your load from Alabama all the way to Timbuktoo
You might also likeAnother day, another town
Diesel up and hammer down
I've got a pimped ride, pretty bride
Four little babies and my hound reside
Back in the hills on the mountain side
South of the river bend
I've got my cell phone, she's on roam
Sweet little thing wants to get it on
She says I left somethin' turned on at home
Can't wait 'till I'm back again
I'm a road hammer, a white knuckled steel gear jammer
A rig jockey highway slammer, I'm just doin' what I gotta do
I'm a road hammer, double talkin' CB grammer
