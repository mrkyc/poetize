In the picture on the billboard in a field near the big old highway
Rollin' down the highway in my Jimmy, haulin' freight
From Chicago to St Louis, Lord, I see her every day
Oh, a double clutchin' weasel like me can hardly ever get
A girl to look at him that way
Smilin' like the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Wow, what a girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick, take her towel away
I'd slow my Jimmy to 20
That's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Oh, I love the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
And I guess I'm gettin' bolder 'cause I'd rather kiss and hold her
Than just keep lookin' at her every day
At 4:45, coffee-drinkin', eatin' time
Jimmy shimmied, while I woke up the artist that painted the display
Of the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Doggone, that girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed, painter said the girl wasn't real and I better get on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a-way
Shattered by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Who was the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Well, who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Yeah, who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
