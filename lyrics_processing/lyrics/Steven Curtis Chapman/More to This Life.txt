Today I watched in silence
As people passed me by
And I strained to see
If there was something hidden in their eyes
But they all looked back at me as if to say
Life just goes on

The old familiar story
Told in different ways
Make the most of your own journey
From the cradle to the grave
Dream your dreams tomorrow
Because today
Life must go on, oh...

But there's more (but there's more) to this life
Than living and dying
More than just trying
To make it through the day
More to this life
More than these eyes alone can see
And there's more
Than this life alone can be

Tonight, he lies in silence
Staring into space
And looks for ways to make tomorrow
Better than today
But in the morning light, it looks the same
Life just goes on

He takes care of his family
He takes care of his work
And every Sunday morning
He takes his place at the church
And somehow, he still feels a need to search
But life just goes on, oh...

But there's more (but there's more) to this life
Than living and dying
More than just trying
To make it through the day
More to this life
More than these eyes alone can see
And there's more
Than this life alone can be
So where do we start to find every part
Of what makes this life complete? (what makes this life complete)
If we turn our eyes to Jesus we'll find
Life's true beginning
Is there at the cross where He died
He died to bring us...

More to this life (there is more)
Than living and dying
More than just trying
To make it through the day
More to this life
More than these eyes alone can see

And there's more to this life (and there's more)
Than living and dying
More than just trying
To make it through the day
More to this life
More than these eyes alone can see
And there's more
Than this life alone can be
More to this life
Oh-whoa...
(More to this life)
More than living and dying
(More to this life)
(More to this life)
More than trying
To make it through another day
(More to this life)
