Well, I've been looking back over my shoulder
Retracing every step trying to unforget
And I see the mountaintops I've journeyed over
And I see the valleys deep where I crawled on my hands and knees
Pages and memories filled with joy and stained with tears
They call my name and if I listen, I can hear them saying

Remember the way He led you up to the top of the highest mountain
Remember the way He carried you through the deepest dark
Remember His promises for every step on the road ahead
Look where you've been and where you're going
And remember to remember, remember, remember

And now I'm looking out at the road that's waiting
But my eyes can only see so far out ahead of me
As sure as the sun will shine there'll be more mountains I will climb
And more deep dark shadowlands where
Desperate faith is all I have
Until I'm home, I'm resting all my hope and trust
In the only One whose name is God with us

Remember the way He led us up to the top of the highest mountain
Remember the way He carried us through the deepest dark
Remember His promises for every step on the road ahead
Look where we've been and where we're going
And remember to remember

Remember the day is coming
When He's gonna wipe the tears away
He'll look in our eyes and say
Remember the way I led you off the mountain
Remember the way I carried you, oh

Remember the way I led you up to the top of the highest mountain
Remember the way I carried you through the deepest dark
Remember my promises for every step on the road ahead
Look where you've been and where you're going
Look where we've been and where we're going
And remember to remember

Oh, remember to remember
Oh, remember to remember
