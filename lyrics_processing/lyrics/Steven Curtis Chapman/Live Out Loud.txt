He says, "Do you want to be a millionaire?"
They put me on the show and I win with two lifelines to spare
Now picture this... I act like nothin' ever happened
And carry all my money in a coffee can
Well, I've been given more than Regis ever gave away
I was a dead man who was called to come out of my grave
And I think it's time for makin' some noise
Wake the neighbors, get the word out
Come on... crank up the music... climb a mountain and shout
This is life we've been given meant to be lived out
So la la la la live out loud, yeah
Live out loud, yeah, yeah
Think about this... try to keep a bird from singing
After it's soared up in the sky
Give the sun a cloudless day and tell it not to shine
Now think about this... if we really have been given
The gift of a life that will never end
And if we have been filled with living hope we're gonna overflow
And if God's love is burning in our hearts we're gonna glow
There's just no way to keep it in
Wake the neighbors, get the word out
Come on... crank up the music... climb a mountain and shout
This is life we've been given meant to be lived out
So la la la la live out loud, yeah
Live out loud, yeah, yeah
