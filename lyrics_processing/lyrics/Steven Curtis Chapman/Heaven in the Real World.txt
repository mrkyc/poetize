Where is the hope?
I meet millions who tell me that they feel demoralized by the decay around us
Where is the hope?
The hope that each of us have
Is not in who governs us or what laws are passed or
Or what great things that we do as a nation
Our hope is in the power of God working through the hearts of people
And that's where our hope is in this country
That's where our hope is in life

I saw it again today
In the face of a little child
Looking through eyes of fear and uncertainty
It echoed in a cry for freedom
Across the street and across the miles
Cries from the heart
To find the missing part

Where is the hope? Where is the peace?
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world

Stand in the pouring rain and believe the sun will shine again
To know that the grade is not the end
To feel the embrace of grace across the line
Your real life begins, you know in your heart
You found the missing part

'Cause there is a hope, there is a peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world
Heaven in the real world

It happened one night
With the tiny baby's birth (Tiny baby's birth)
God of creation crying
And He sent heaven to Earth

He is the hope, He is the peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world
(He is the hope) He is the peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world
Heaven has come to the real world
Heaven has come
Come to the real world
He is the hope, He is the peace
Jesus is heaven
Heaven in the real world
Heaven, heaven in the real world
Heaven in the real world
Heaven, heaven in the real world
Heaven, heaven in the real world
