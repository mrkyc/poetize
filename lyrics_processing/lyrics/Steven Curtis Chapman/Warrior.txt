I feel my heart pounding in my chest
I hear the war raging all around me
And somehow I feel like I was born for this
I can taste the fear, but I choose courage
As I raise my shield and lift my sword
And I fall on my knees and I fight like a warrior
I am a warrior on my knees
I call on the Name of the One Who is Conqueror
I'm more than a conqueror when I believe
The enemy trembles every time
'Cause he knows the battle is no longer mine
When I fall on my knees and I fight like a warrior, like a warrior, oh, oh, oh
Daughters and sons, we can hear your calling
Broken and weak, we can hear your cry
And even though our enemy roars like a lion
The Lion of Judah is on our side
And He will go before us and behind us
Fighting on the left and on the right
So I fall on my knees and I fight like a warrior
I am a warrior on my knees
I call on the Name of the One Who is Conqueror
I'm more than a conqueror when I believe
The enemy trembles every time
'Cause he knows the battle is no longer mine
When I fall on my knees and I fight like a warrior, like a warrior, like a warrior

He says, "I am with you so don't be afraid
'Cause I've already won this war."
So fall on your knees and fight with me
We are the Warriors when we are on our knees
The enemy trembles...
We will fall on our knees and fight like a warrior
We are the Warriors on our knees
We call on the Name of the One Who is Conqueror
We're more than conquerors when we believe
The enemy trembles every time
'Cause he knows the battle isn't yours or mine
When we fall on our knees and fight like a warrior, like a warrior
We are warriors on our knees
We are the warriors, we are Warriors, we are Warriors on our knees
