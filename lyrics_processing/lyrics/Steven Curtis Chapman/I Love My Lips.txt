I l-o-v-e m-y l-i-p-s
I l-o-v-e m-y, lips!
I l-o-v-e m-y l-i-p-s
I l-o-v-e m-y, lips!

If my lips ever left my mouth
Packed a bag and headed south
That'd be too bad, I'd be so sad
If my lips said, "Adios, I don't like you and I think your gross"
That'd be too bad, I might get mad
That'd be too bad I might get mad (Go!)

I l-o-v-e m-y l-i-p-s
I l-o-v-e m-y, lips!

If my lips moved to Duluth
Left a mess and took my tooth
That'd be too bad, I'd call my dad
That'd be too bad I'd be so sad
I might get mad and call my dad

Because I love my lips

*phone rings* Ah, hang on guys. Hello?
Yeah, Caleb, hey it's Dad. Listen, I heard you were trying to get a hold of me, is something wrong with your lips?
Dad my lips are fine. I'm in the studio right now just working on this song. Hold on just a second dad

On the day I got my tooth
I had to kiss my great aunt Ruth
She had a beard (Hahaha, I remember that actually.)
And it felt weird (Yeah, it was kinda weird, wasn't it?)
She had a beard and it felt weird (Actually, wasn't that the Christmas you gave her a razor?)

Hey Caleb, I just stopped by. You know, speaking of lips, did I ever tell you my story?
Ten days after I turned eight
I got lips stuck in a gate
And my friends all laughed
Yeah, my friends all laughed

And I just stood there until the fire department came
And broke the lock with a crowbar and I had to spend
The next six weeks in lip rehab with this kid named Oscar
Who got stung by a bee right on the lip and we couldn't
Even talk to each other until the fifth week because both
Our lips were so swollen and when he did-
Dad, dad, I've heard this story like a million times
Sorry
