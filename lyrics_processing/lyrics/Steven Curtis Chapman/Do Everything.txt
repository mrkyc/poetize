You're picking up toys on the living room floor for the 15th time today
Matching up socks, sweeping up lost Cheerios that got away
You put a baby on your hip, color on your lips and head out the door

While I may not know you, I bet I know you
Wonder sometimes, does it matter at all?
Well let me remind you, it all matters just as long

As you do everything you do to the glory of the One who made you
Cause he made you to do
Every little thing that you do to bring a smile to His face
Tell the story of grace with every move that you make
And every little thing you do

Maybe you're that guy with the suit and tie
Maybe your shirt says your name
You may be hooking up mergers, cooking up burgers
But at the end of the day
Little stuff, big stuff, in between stuff
God sees it all the same

While I may not know you, I bet I know you
Wonder sometimes, does it matter at all?
Well let me remind you, it all matters just as long

As you do everything you do to the glory of the One who made you
Cause he made you to do
Every little thing that you do to bring a smile to His face
Tell the story of grace with every move that you make
And everything you do

Maybe you're sitting in math class
Or maybe on a mission in the Congo
Or maybe you're working at the office
Singing along with the radio
Maybe you're dining at a 5-star
Or feeding orphans in Myanmar
Anywhere and everywhere that you are
Whatever you do, it all matters
So do what you do, don't ever forget

To do everything you do to the glory of the One who made you
Cause He made you to do
Every little thing that you do to bring a smile to His face
And tell the story of grace
As you do everything you do to the glory of the One who made you
Cause he made you to do
Every little thing that you do to bring a smile to His face
And tell the story of grace with every move that you make
And every little thing you do
In every little thing you do
