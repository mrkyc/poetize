It was the day the world went wrong
I screamed till my voice was gone
And watched through the tears
As everything came crashing down

Slowly panic turns to pain
As we awake to what remains
And sift through the ashes
That are left behind

But buried deep beneath
All our broken dreams
We have this hope...

Out of these ashes
Beauty will rise
And we will dance among the ruins
We will see it with our own eyes
Out of these ashes
Beauty will rise
For we know joy is coming
In the morning...

Beauty will rise

So take another breath for now
And let the tears come washing down
And if you can't believe
I will believe for you

'Cause I have seen
The signs of spring
Just watch and see...

Out of these ashes
Beauty will rise
And we will dance among the ruins
We will see it with our own eyes
Out of these ashes
Beauty will rise
For we know joy is coming
In the morning...

I can hear there in the distance
And it's not too far away
It's the music and the laughter
Of a wedding and a feast
I can almost feel the hand of God
Reaching for my face to wipe the tears away
You say "It's time to make everything new
Make it all new"

This is our hope
This is a promise
This is our hope
This is the promise
It will take our breath away
To see the beauty that's been made
Out of the ashes
Out of the ashes
It will take our breath away
To see the beauty that He's made
Out of the ashes
Out of the ashes

Out of these ashes
Beauty will rise
And we will dance among the ruins
We will see it with our own eyes
Out of this darkness
New life will shine
And we'll know joy that's coming
In the morning
In the morning...
Beauty will rise!
