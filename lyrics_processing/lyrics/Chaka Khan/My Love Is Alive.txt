Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I found
I have lived unaware of what I am
It's all clear to me now

That my heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive, my love is alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, there's something inside
That's making me crazy
Tryin' to keep it together
'Cause what I'm saying, I have been saving
And now could be forever

My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul is like a wheel, like a hot wire
My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul's like a wheel, like a hot wire

My heart is on fire (So on fire)
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive, my love is alive
