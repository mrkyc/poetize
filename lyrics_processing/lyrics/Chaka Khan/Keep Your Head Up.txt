When your heart is free
It's easy to make a decision
When your head is clear
You know you have good judgment
But when your life is turning topsy-turvy
And you have no reasons for what's disturbing
Remember these words my father said to me
He said

Find your power, you know you're strong
Make that step and it will help you along (Mm, ooh)

When your mind's at peace (At peace)
Sleep comes so very peacefully (Ooh)
When you start to dream
They're wonderful and so very sweet
But when your life is turning topsy-turvy
And you have no answers for what's disturbing
Remember these words a preacher said to me
