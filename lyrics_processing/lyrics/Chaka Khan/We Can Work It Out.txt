Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting
So I'll ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking
Until I can't go on
Boy, you see it your way
You run the risk of knowing
That our love will soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out

Hear what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's all right
Hear what I'm saying
We can work it out
And when it's straight, we'll say good night

That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right
Or if I am wrong
Boy, you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart
Before too long

Life is very short
And there's no time, no more time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
