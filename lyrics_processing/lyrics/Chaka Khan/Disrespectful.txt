Disrespectful (Hey)
You don't wanna treat me
You don't wanna play around
'Cause you could be history
Don't mess around with me
I'm too good to you (Yeah)
What the hell you take me for?
I'm nobody's fool!
Boy, what is wrong with you?
I don't have time for this
You can't make me lose my mind
I'm too strong for ya!

Disrespectful (Yeah)
It's no mystery (Sing Chaka)
Best thing to happen to you
No one compares to me
Baby, I remember when you used to
I remember when you used to love me
Through the good and bad
What a good thing we had
I remember when you used to love me
Why you so brand new?
What happened to you?
I remember when you used to love me
Love me

I don't think you hearing me
Better pay attention
I'm everything you need
Who's the one cookin' your food
Going through the same thing you going through
That's me
You better get your act together
Before I have to flip out on you, baby
Boy, what is wrong with you
I don't have time for this
You can't make me lose my mind
I'm too strong for ya
Disrespectful (Yeah)
It's no mystery
I remember when you used to love me
Through the good and bad
What a good thing we had
Runnin' out of time
Runnin', runnin', runnin' out of time
For your disrespectfulness
Runnin' out of time
Runnin', runnin', Runnin' out of time
I'm just too through with this

There are times that I do miss you
But I must keep movin' on
I never thought that I would wake up
And you'd be gone
You never thought about me

Don't you take me for no fool boy
I know you better than you know yourself
You so shady low down crazy
To think that I wouldn't see you through all your mess
I remember when you used to love me
Through the good and the bad
What a good thing to have
I remember when you used to love me
Why you so brand new
What happened to you?
