(Ah)
(Tonight)

I'm putting on my makeup
It's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me
I'm ready and I'm willing
To pull out the happy feeling
Something special's in the air for me

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?
It feels so right
This mirror's telling no lie
I'm gonna let this magic shine

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine
This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

I feel like winning
I don't know the reason
Something telling me to let it ride
Got me rocking and reeling
I don't know what the deal is
Something special I just can't describe

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
On my way to paradise
It feels so fine
It feels just like the first time
I'm going all the way this time

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine
This is my night (Tonight)

My, my, my night

This feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie

Let it shine, let it shine
