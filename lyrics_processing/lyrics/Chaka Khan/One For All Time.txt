I can still remember
The magic I saw in your eyes
So honest and so tender
True love with no compromise
All these things I miss
When I reminisce
About you, baby

Why can't we go back in time?
When I was yours and you were mine
Love this special's meant to be
Eternally our love is one for all time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Time
Mm-mm-mm-mm

How is it that I see you
In every strangers face?
I don't wanna need you
But my stubborn heart keeps going
And I just can't erase
All these things I miss
When I reminisce
About you, boy
Bet you didn't know
How much I love ya
Want me to show you, baby?
