Walking hand and hand as only lovers can
You must understand we've got each other
They can scream and fuss, it won't bother us
And that is because we've got each other

I can recall memories we shared
Such love, none other could compare
Do you remember when you were loving me?
Holding me? How could this love not be?

Walking hand and hand as only lovers can
You must understand we've got each other
They can scream and fuss, it wouldn't bother us
And that is because we've got each other

Lost in dreams, I spend the hours
Scared in the dark, in a room that once was ours
Do you remember when you were loving me?
Holding me? How could this love not be?

We are one, sharing each other's dreams
With a love that only we could bring
