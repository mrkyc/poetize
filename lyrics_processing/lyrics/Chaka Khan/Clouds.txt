In the distance, coming to change my plans
All my dreams will melt like sand

The moment that you say goodbye
They're gonna rush right to the sky

It's gonna rain down tears
Of heartaches and fears
It's gonna rain (Gonna rain)

It's gonna rain down tears
Of heartaches and fears

It's gonna rain (Rain)
There in the distance
Is that number one pain
