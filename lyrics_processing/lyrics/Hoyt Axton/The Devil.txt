And we cannot hardly reach the other side
And the devil, he's in trouble; I can see it in his eyes
If you don't give him shelter, he won't have no place to hide
The devil deals in dyin' and he travels in a hearse
He treats you like a dog, now; he'd like to treat you worse
But he don't have the answers, an' if he did, he'd lie
The devil is a joker an' he don't want you alive
An' some you win, an' some you lose
An' the winner's all grin and the losers say:
"Deal the cards again
"Won't you deal the cards again."
L.A.'s in California, Lord, I been there many times
It is an education, to be sure
I loved a lovely lady there, she opened up my eyes
She ran a dancin' school; it was a front, she loved the Lord
It's been rainin' in the mountains and the river's on the rise
And we cannot hardly reach the other side
And the devil, he's in trouble; I can see it in his eyes
If you don't give him shelter, he'll have no place to hide
It's been rainin' in the mountains and the river's on the rise
And we cannot hardly reach the other side
And the devil, he's in trouble; I can see it in his eyes
If you don't give him shelter, he'll have no place to hide
