Some people say I'm a no count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travelin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should

And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar
Spend it as fast as I can
For a whalin' song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, oh yeah
The only things that I understand, ooh yeah

When I was a little baby
My mama, she said "Son
Travel where you will and grow to be a man
And sing what must be sung, poor boy
Sing what must be sung"

And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar
Spend it as fast as I can
For a whalin' song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
You might also like
Now, that I'm a grown man
I've travelled here and there
And I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song
Are the only ones who care, oh Lord
The only ones who care

And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar
Spend it as fast as I can
For a whalin' song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, oh yeah
The only things that I understand, ooh yeah

'Cause some people say I'm a no count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travelin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should

And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar
Spend it as fast as I can
For a whalin' song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, oh yeah
The only things that I understand
That's all that I understand, poor boy
