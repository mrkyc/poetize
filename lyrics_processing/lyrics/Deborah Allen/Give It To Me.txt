Your tender touch
Those yearnin' glances
Offer your love
I think about it bein' wasted
It's such a cryin' shame
If she don't want it
Give it to me
Your Monday mornin's
Your long, late nights
I could be with you
Holdin' on tight
You need to be appreciated
That's my number one aim
Give it to me, yeah
Give it to the one who is gonna give it back to you
She's had every chance to come to the dance
I'm kinda glad she's sittin' out
Well honey, if she don't want it, give it to me
It's so one-sided
It's so unfair
For her to be with you
When I could be there
You're bein' highly under-rated
You're not the one to blame
Give it to me, yeah
