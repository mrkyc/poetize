So you like the way I walk
So you like my disposition, oh
The same old story, a different situation, yeah

I know your kind like the back of my hand
You're just a hungry wolf in a valley of lambs, oh
You don't have to talk for I understand
The heat in this room speaks loud enough

Telepathy, hey, baby
You don't have to tell me what's on your mind
Telepathy, hey, baby
Everything you want is in your eyes

You don't know what I'm about
Still, you wanna make time, you say you wanna go out
Baby, when you know that ain't all that's on your mind
Baby, baby

I know your kind like the back of my hand (Baby)
You're a hungry wolf in a valley of lambs, oh
You don't have to talk for I understand
The heat in this room speaks loud enough
You might also like
Telepathy, hey, baby
You don't have to tell me what's on your mind
Telepathy, hey, baby
Everything you want is in your eyes

Hey, baby
Now you know I know
What's on your mind, what's on your mind
I know your kind (Know your kind)
You wanna make some time

So you like the way I kiss
You say you like the way my body feels next to yours
You know it's awfully hard to resist, baby
This kind of friction could start a war, uh-huh (Start the third World War)

I know your kind (I know your kind)
I know your kind like the back of my hand
You're a hungry wolf in a valley of lambs, ooh, yes, you are
Don't talk for I understand
The heat in this room speaks loud enough
Telepathy, hey, baby
You don't have to tell me what's on your mind
Telepathy, hey, baby
Everything you want is in your eyes
Telepathy, hey, baby
You say you like my disposition
Telepathy
The same old story, just a different situation

Don't get me wrong
I want you
But on the very first night
Might be your style
But two wrongs don't make a right
Come on and kiss me
Cause I don't wanna fight
Kiss me, baby
Don't waste tonight on idle talking
Jive walking
Snow lines, red wine
Come on
Come on, yeah
Tonight I feel you, baby
Telepathy, baby
No lie
'Cause I know what's on your mind
It's in your eyes, it's in your face
It's in your eyes
Telepathy, hey, baby
Telepathy
