In the 60s and the 70s
Before we'd even met
I took those pin-ups to my heart
'Cause I hadn't found you yet
In back of cab in the streets of Rome
I drunkenly called a name
On 13th floor in Paris hotel
I looked north-west in vain

In bus shelter and phone box
Whilst piss ran round my feet
I caught wrong bus, rang wrong number
'Cause my life was incomplete

So in case you think it wrong to ask
In case I don't ask you
In case it may just cross your mind
In case it don't, I do!
In case you think it's up to me
In case I need a clue
In case you want that bended knee
In case you don't, I do!
You might also like
In pick-up truck on dusty road
The wheel, your only friend
What kept that big wheel turning was
The thought of you at end
On desert highway, hitch-hiking
Thumbing from A to B
I knew not where I headed
Before my map to thee

At foot of the Alps in Switzerland
I yodelled through the rain
And it sort of kept me going
To think you'd probably do the same

So in case you think it wrong to ask
In case I don't ask you
In case it may just cross your mind
In case it don't, I do!
In case you think it's up to me
In case I need a clue
In case you want that bended knee
In case you don't, I do!
Now, again, we're miles apart
We talk, but do not touch
Water, food and alcohol
I miss them half as much
'Cause halfway up that mountain pass
No compass or no guide
Still don't stand me steady for
When you I'm not beside

So if you need a shelter
I guess I'll need one too
If you want the same address
Even if you don't, I do!

Even if you don't, I do!
Even if you don't, I do!
Even if you don't, I do!
Even if you don't, I do!
Even if you don't, I do!
I do! I do!
Even if you don't, I do!
I do! I do!
I do! I do!
