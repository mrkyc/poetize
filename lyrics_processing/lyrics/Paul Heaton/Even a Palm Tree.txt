Unless I've had drugs
What about just getting plain drunk?
She shrugs
I mean, flies love shit
And lizards love bugs
Yeah but there ain't no snails
Sleeping with slugs
Like there ain't no Kings
Sleeping with ho's
You saying a slug ain't never climbed a rose?
You think when Adam had Eve, Eve chose?
Y'all just cavemen in better cars
And worse clothes
When the man has had quite enough
Of woman answering back
He goes out and buys a dog
But not to race on track
6 months training dog
To be a genuine friend
That serves him
Companion to the end
The only difference 'tween the wife
And what the dog don't do
Is make his tea most every night
And grant him monthly screw
Y'all just cavemen in better cars
But worse clothes
So when I drank that quart of vodka
And turned up at your door
Was it meant to say I love you
At half past fucking four?
Is that what true love does to you?
Does it microwave your brain?
So you can't tell the difference
Between love and pain
I was trying to say I love you
That I want to make amends
You throw stones against my window
And you think we're back to friends
Y'all just cavemen in better cars
And worse clothes
He's going out cause it's not raining
She's staying in too despite the sun
Drawing curtains on a summers day
Causin' sadness just searching for fun
Loving life for no real reason
Adore your job cause you love the pain
Hate working in high season
Even a palm tree needs a little rain
Meanwhile, the woman bored
Of not being listened to
Buys a cat to prove just that
It's him and not just you
That cat it may not say that much
But least it lends it's ear
To conversation livelier
Than football, girls and beer
Y'all just cavemen in better cars
But worse clothes
He's going out cause it's not raining
She's staying in too despite the sun
Drawing curtains on a summers day
Causin' sadness just searching for fun
Loving life for no real reason
Adore your job cause you love the pain
Hate working in high season
Even a palm tree needs a little rain
Even a palm tree
Even a palm tree
