Good old Texas
Lazy old days in the Amarillo haze in my work vest
Sat out on the porch
Wonderin' which country to torch next
God bless Texas
Where the only real trace of a brown or black face is in a bird's nest
Where bears are for shooting and the world's for polluting, not protest

And for every Tom Sawyer idling by the bank
There's a gas pipe facing East and a sewage tank
For every Rio Grande rolling South
There's another Thames or Nile frothing up at the mouth

So when soy sauce comes falling from the trees
Maple syrup's weighing down the bees
Tabasco bleeds from every hand you squeeze
Let the Lone Star state get down on hands and knees

Good old Texas
Sat doin' nothin' while the world's up coughin' asbestos
Just a Colt .45 and a Jim Bowie knife to protect us
You might also likeGod bless Texas
Ask any peckerwood if the Mississippi flood'll affect us
Now that old Jim Crow is just an ordinary Joe in a Lexus

And when vinegar lines the riverbank to rust
Salt and pepper line your lungs to dust
Sugar lines your inside to a crust
And you're living life in peace but only just

So when soy sauce comes falling from the trees
Maple syrup's weighing down the bees
Tabasco bleeds from every hand you squeeze
Let the Lone Star state get down on hands and knees


And as the burger van drives the buffalo from the plain
The cowboy feels so stuffed that he doesn't complain
Peanut butter's coursing through his veins
And chilli stings his skin every time it rains
And it's brown sauce seeping from the bough
Mayonnaise comes leaking from the cow
Mustard from the nipple of the sow
And they're singing, "God bless Texas", but God knows how
And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
They're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
They're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
They're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
(And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
Singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how
Singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
Singing, "God bless Texas", singing, "God bless Texas" (And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
But God knows how (Singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
Singing, "God bless Texas" (And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
But God knows how (Singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
Singing, "God bless Texas", singing, "God bless Texas" (And they're singing, "God bless Texas"; God knows how)
