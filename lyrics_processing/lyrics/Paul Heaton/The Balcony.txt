As he taxes a draw on the fifteenth floor
He can't help cursing his luck
Life could have dealt him such a different hand
Maybe two across and twenty-three up
But there ain't door on the thirty-eighth floor
No shortcut out of this dump
The nearer highrise comes closer to the skies
The temptation to actually jump

And it's sadder, the leaving than left
Sadder, the going than gone
Saddest of all is the person bereft
Of the chance to jump off or walk on

Falling from ladder, landing on dagger
A thousand and one ways to die
Better the brave and the early to grave
And damn those too frightened to try

As he awaits the last score on the 25th floor
He looks down at the madness below
It's always some Grimsby or Scunthorpe
Some place he ain't been or won't go
You might also likeAnd as result comes in and his head goes down
Yet another week he's gonna be stuck
Where the betting slips rain like confetti
Let down, thrown out or screwed up

And it's sadder, the leaving than left
Sadder, the going than gone
Saddest of all is the person bereft
Of the chance to jump off or walk on

Falling from ladder, landing on dagger
A thousand and one ways to die
Better the brave and the early to grave
And damn those too frightened to try


So we wish you good spaces in faraway places
Good luck in the folk that you meet
Cause if you don't travel, the dust and the gravel
Will swallow you up from your feet

This song that we give, please carry it with
To remind you we long your return
Travel thee far and travel thee well
And bring back every lesson you learn
Travel thee far and travel thee well
