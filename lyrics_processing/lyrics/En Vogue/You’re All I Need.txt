I haven't seen you lately
But you keep me wondering where you are
Lately I remember the way you were

When all I need is someone who gives
Someone who's there to love me always
Baby, please, you're all I need
No longer can I hide how I feel inside
So I'm saying to you

(Shoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
You're all I need and I got to have you here with me
(Shoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I want you, baby, yeah
(Shoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)

I used to think that maybe
You'd see all the things I sacrificed
But lately you've been running out of my life

When all I need is someone who gives
Someone who's there to love me always
Baby, please, you're all I need
And it hasn't been the same since you want and gone away
I'm singing
