Are you ready to roll?
Funky Divas with a cool light stroll
Sending smooth vibe to all our dear fans
It feels good to be groovin' again

Chocolate cream to me baby, so sweet to me
Like some honey to a honey bee
I am drawn to you baby like a strong magnet, oh
Once I'm there, there's no turning back
There is no real excuse, why take this abuse
I keep running back, taking smack
Don't know what to say or to do
It's amazing, but I act crazy
I can't win, it's a sin
So I feel I have to fight it

Runaway love
Like a train on broken tracks
Runaway love
It's too hard to turn it back now
Runaway love
Feels good without a doubt, yeah
Runaway love
Has to stop before it turns me out

Ooh, I'm not qualified to play love games with you
I've been hurt hard lately, I'm not for being used, no more
Just a little lovin', it's like a drug and I'm a drug addict
I just don't know why I just can't let go
I can't walk away, fade away
Every day my love grows and grows
It's a sickness, or is it weakness
Should I cope, is there hope?
All I know it's hard to stop...

Runaway love

Take me
Take me
Take me higher, higher
Ooh, take me higher, higher
Take me higher, take me higher
I know you can do it
Oh yeah, take me higher, higher
Take me higher, take me higher, ooh
Take me higher, higher
