Oom baby, oom baby, oom baby, oom baby
Oom baby, oom baby, oom baby, oom baby
Hey you, baby

A feeling I can't control
Is haunting me when you're not home
A feeling roams deep inside
There really is no place to hide
(Desire)

Desire, ooh, like fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire
Ooh oh desire)
Desire, ooh like fire
(Come on baby light my fire)
Desire, ooh, like fire

Everywhere I go I have thoughts of you
Little fantasies of being with you
Having no control when having desire
Like having no more water to put out the fire
Every little minute grows my addiction
Each and every hour I fight the power
On and on the feeling never gives in
Don't never try to fight it, you'll never win
