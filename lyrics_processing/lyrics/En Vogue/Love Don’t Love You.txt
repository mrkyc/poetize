Love don't love you, love don't care
Love don't love you, love don't care

You said you'd always be there
You said you'd always care
You always comfort me
You used to share things with me
You used to have time for me
Now it all seemed to end

I can't control my fears
Neither hold back tears
Knowing that something's wrong, yeah
The more that I fight with you
The more I realize
It takes more than love
To satisfy my life

Love don't love you, love don't care
(It's got to be you, baby)
Love don't love you, love don't care
(Not love, baby)

I thought I never would see
The day that you and me
Could not communicate
It came to my surprise
The only reason why
We misused the four-letter words

I should have known the signs
Instead I was blind
Ignoring what people would say
When will I ever learn?
Can't blame it all on one word
Some words can seem more brutal than kind

Love don't love you, love don't care
(Love don't love you, got to be you)
Love don't love you, love don't care
(Love don't care about you, no way, no way, no way)

You see it takes a fool to learn
That love don't love nobody (Got to be you)
But I've learned
That love don't love me
And it sure can't love you (Can only be you, oh)
So what are you gonna do
Don't just say you love me (Baby)
You got to show me (Show me that you care)
So where do we go from here?
Ha, you tell me
You got to show me that you love me
Show me that you care
I need to know that you will always be there, be there
All the love, oh, I'm gonna be there for you
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Love don't love, love don't love no one
And it sure don't care
Love don't love nobody
You should take my advice
Show me that you love me
Show me that you care, baby

Love don't love you, love don't care
Love don't love you, love don't care
