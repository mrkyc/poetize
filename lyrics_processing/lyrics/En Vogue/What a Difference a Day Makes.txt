Six o'clock in the morning
Oh, a new day is born
Can't wait to get my day started
I think I'll run a few laps
Then I'll take a hot bath
And dash to my favorite hair salon

Now with a fresh 'do
I did the nails and the feet too
It's time to go on a shopping spree
Spoil myself with something lovely
Oh, I can't forget
I got a date up town 'bout six
I'm lookin' great and I'm feelin' fine
It's good to be off work some time

Ooh, back at home again
Right where I first left off
I'm glad I had some fun today
'Cause I sure was stressin' out
Feelin' as high as ever, lookin' better
All I needed was one day
When you just can't take and make time to shake it
