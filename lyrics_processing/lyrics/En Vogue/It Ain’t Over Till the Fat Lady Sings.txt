It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

Here's a flow
An En Vogue hip-hop intro
Time to rap, talk about the info
Pertaining to the four
Who re-opened the harmony door
And let the vocals soar
(Shoo wop shoo wop)
All of the gossipin' it put us in a recite mode
Unloadin' while the grooves explodin'
Just steppin' and keepin' peepin'
A vocal lethal weapon
In this song will be givin' ev-ology lessons
About our history and our passin'
How long steady, strong will the En Vogue be lastin'?
Ask us the prediction
Already predictin' the quad squad will roll
And continue to kick it wicked
Doubts about the En-V? It's envy if you ask me
Trying to down Dawn, Maxine, Terry and Cindy
Black, beautiful, intelligent, well-structured and strong
It's gonna be a long forever, hold on

So, continuing my flow
Goin' back about two years ago
Lip-synching was the way to go, though
A face to a voice, a voice to a face
All the real talent was just going to waste
The word was out, a talent search was on
Auditioned with ambition
A vision, En Vogue was born
To sing, the essential ingredients mended
Four individuals perfectly blended
Strong mind, positive, attitude is a must
Group trust, eliminate the outside rush
Using lies as alibis to get to us it's strange
Negative attenion you gain in the world while you entertain
Stuck up? Of course not, the knives in our back
Those coming from behind on a publicity attack
It's not easy duplicating the four
There's a lot more in store
Until the fat lady roars

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
People wonder if we're rich
I'll tell you this
More money now than before the music hit
And our hair, of course it's real
We just jazz it up a bit for the sex appeal
And no we don't lip-synch, it's all from the heart
2 Tuff-Enuff Productions put us on the charts
A few answers that I thought I should give
For the minds who enquire how the En Vogue lives
Born to sing, and we proved it
A gift from the man above
Peace to our fans, and to competitors, one love
Sorry, not in it for the competition status-quo
Our only perspective is to grow and to blow, ya know
In house, in reggae, in rock, En Vogue
Stylin' profilin' sippin' coke with a smile
2 Tuff funk it, pump it, hip-hop jump it
Now En Vogue's comin' versatile
(Shoo wop shoo wop)

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

Here we go, here we go, here we, here we, here we go
It ain't over, it ain't over, it ain't over, it ain't over
It ain't over, it ain't over, it sure ain't over
Here we go, here we, we got a long way to go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go...
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
