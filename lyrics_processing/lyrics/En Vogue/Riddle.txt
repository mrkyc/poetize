Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Going on with you, your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind?
Or is it something I should pay attention to?
Then on Tuesday, having lunch with friends
I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant, but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if what I saw was true, ooh

Wednesday evening
Every time the phone would ring, you'd say hello
But when I'd come around, you'd say I got to go
Your friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyrone
Oh, now it's Thursday
You left the house to go to work an hour early
You said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home
And when I called your job, they said you were not there, oh yeah

Friday night is the night we've always had our weekend date
But you showed up at the house extremely late
Without any conversation, you just went to bed
And said that your head ached
Now it's the weekend
And you know that it's the day I do my cleaning
And when I washed your shirts, I just could not believe
I'm picking hair weave off your sleeve
Found a letter in your pocket from Louise, please
