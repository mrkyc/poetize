This is your life
Live it your own way
This is your life
Live it your own way

I lived part of my life
Being scared of my dreams
Every time someone asks what I'm shooting for in life
I would hide my true feelings
And when I spoke up to my friends
They made fun of my dreams
So when times got too rough
I would think back on one thing
My mama would say to me, mmm

This is your life
(You got to) live it your own way
(Mama would say) This is your life
(You got to) live it your own way

Forces of evil struck back and forth
Throughout my young days, ooh yeah
Because I would listen
And care what other people would say
Like a four letter word
I ignored the whole world
And built my own tiny world with respect
But it took time to relate
What my mama would say time after time again, she said

This is your life
(Mmm, you got to) live it your own way
(My mama would say) This is your life
(This is your life, you got to) live it your own way
(Mmm, it's gotta be that way)
This is your life
(Ooh, yeah) live it your own way
(Mama used to say) This is your life
(This is your life, you got to) live it your own way, ooh, ooh, ooh


This is your life
(Mmm, you got to) live it your own way
(My mama would say) This is your life
(This is your life, girl) live it your own way
(It's gotta be that way)
This is your life
(Ooh, you got to live) live it your own way
(Mmm, you got to) This is your life
(Gotta live your life for the best now) live it your own way
