My love
We vowed to being together
Through the good times and stormy weather

Ooh, but if it outgrows
If I should lose in you sudden darkness
You should always know I'll be

Sitting by heaven's door
Waiting for you to come home
(I'm waiting on you to come back home, my baby)
Sitting by heaven's door
Waiting for you to come home
(I'll be waiting, no hesitating)

All I know is from this day on
We bond as one forever more
No way, no way we can lose, mmm
And any mountain we can move
With a team who beat the game called love
And, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
You know the time will come
When life will end somehow
And one of us is left without the other
If it happens to be me
Don't worry much, darling
I'll leave a passage to my heart
And this is where I'll be
(With the key in my hand)
