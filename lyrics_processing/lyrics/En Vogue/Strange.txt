It really isn't clear
What the story is my dear
So I'll have to analyze
All those lies and alibis
One look was all it took
Cause I know you like a book
You think you're cleaver
Those endeavors, that you're hiding
I'm deciding that we're through
Strange

Got a feeling you've been lying to me lately
When we kiss I get a bad vibration
You tried to hide the guilt in your eyes
Leaving clues without a trace
We used to talk and now you're always quiet
I ask you why, you say that you're just tired
You get a call and you're ready to walk out the door
And I think it's kinda strange

My suspicions are killing me
But I don't wanna point the finger at you
You say I shouldn't place the blame
But it seems you're playing games
How much longer must I tolerate this madness

Strange
So low I can't get under it
So high I can't get over it
So wide I can't get around it
And it's looking mighty strange

Yesterday I saw you across town
Buying roses, that's something you never do
When you got home, hello is all I got from you
Don't cha think that's kinda strange
I been feelin kinda funny since the last time
Cause you left in such a hurry, tryin' to buy time
If you're doing what I'm thinking that you're going
Then I think you need to change

My suspicions are killing me
But I don't wanna point the finger at you
You say I shouldn't place the blame
But it seems you're playing games
How much longer must I tolerate this madness

Strange
So low I can't get under it
So high I can't get over it
So wide I can't get around it
And it's looking mighty strange
Rap:
I can't say when
But it seems it all began
When I felt an icy tingle down my spine
You say it's in my mind
So I must resolve to find
Little pieces of the puzzle that fit
You think you're so slick
But I'm up on all your tricks
And I think you're soon to be
A small part of history
I know it's hard to see
So how you are cheating me
You can't hide
I can't stop it
Can't get by it
