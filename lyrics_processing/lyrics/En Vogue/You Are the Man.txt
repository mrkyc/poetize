Nobody touches my heart like you do, oh-oh
I swear I'm just hopelessly fatal for you
'Cause I can't go through a day without
Thinkin' 'bout kissin' you places all over
All over your body and your body all over me
Don't you know

You, you are the man I want
There is no other love
You give me what I need
You are the only man for me
Hey, hey

You can see it in my eyes how much I'm feeling you
There's nobody else in this world I would do, I would do
'Cause you will, you will go places
That I'm not usually tasted
And it just makes me go crazy
And I can't deny I'm obsessed over you, yeah, yeah, yeah

You, you are the man I want
(Darling, you're the man, you're the man)
There is no other love
(There is no other love)
You give me what I need
(You give me what I need)
You are the only man
(You are the only man)

'Cause you a long time ago stole my heart
(You stole my heart, you stole my heart)
You broke me down from the start
And nothing has changed since the first day
That we made sweet love, baby, baby, baby

You, you are the man I want
There is no other love
You give me what I need
(Every little thing I need)
You are the only man
(You're the only man for me, baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You, you are the man I want
(Man I want)
There is no other love
You give me what I need
(You give me what I need, hey, hey, hey)
You are the only man

For me, yeah
