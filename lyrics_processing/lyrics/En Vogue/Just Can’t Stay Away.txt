Ooh ooh ooh, won't you come close to me now, now
Ooh ooh ooh, won't you come close to me now, now, now, now

Here I am, baby
Right back in your arms, yeah, oh yeah
What is it 'bout your love
That draws me to you?
And though this is not the first time, baby
I ever wanted to get away, no
Oh, but the magic of your love
Just would not let me stray

So I find that I just can't
Stay away from you, baby, you, yeah
You see, I just can't (Just can't, just can't)
Stay away from you
Let me tell ya
I've been through a lot of changes

See, my mama scorned me, oh, yes she did
And my closest friends, oh Lord
You know they warned me
They said you're no good for me
But I just ignored it, yes I did
'Cause I didn't have time, no time, no time
No time to sit around and decide what to do, no
When someone controls your mind
There's not much you can do

So you see that's why
I can't stay away
I don't wanna, from you
It's not in my power to leave you
You control the soul in me
Just can't, just can't, just can't stay away from you
You've been so good to me
I just love that man
Just can't, just can't, just can't
Don't want to, I can't, no way
Feels so good to me, my baby, from you
Oh, don't wanna go
No no, no no, no no, no no, baby, oh oh
Just can't, just can't, just can't
Feels so good to me, my baby, from you
I can't stay away from you, baby
Down on my knees, hold me, darling
And begging you please, hold me, darling
'Cause I just can't stay away from you, baby
No no no no no no, no no, no no, no no, hoo hoo hoo
Just can't stay away from you
