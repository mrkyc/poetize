When I (When I) had you (Had you)
I treated you bad
Wrong, my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I hang around, sit around (Sit around)
With my head, head hanging down
And I wonder (Wonder, wonder)
Who's (Who's) loving you? (You)

Ooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would've known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
(You got to hold on)
Hold on to your love
(Ooh, hoo, baby, hold on)
Hold on to your love
(Oh, you got to hold on, hey)
Hold on to your love, ooh

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's 'bout good love you make when his heart's on fire
Give him love every day
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
(You got to hold on, hey)
Hold on to your love
(You gotta hold on to your love, yeah, hey)
Hold on to your love
(Oh, baby, hold on, oh)
Hold on to your love
(Baby, hold on)

Trust, and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Oh, the magic that you share
So, sacrifice and show how much you care
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
(You got to hold on)
Hold on to your love
(Don't let go, keep the ties)
Hold on to your love
(Hang on tight, and don't let go, no)
Hold on to your love, ooh
(Doo-ya-ba-dee-yee-ya-ba, don't let go)

Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love, ooh
Hold on to your love
If you love him, if you need him, really want him
(Hold on to your love, ooh)
Just keep on, just keep on hanging on (Hold on)
Little trust, honesty, golden rule (Hold on)
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep (Hold on)
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home (Hold on)
Hey, yeah
He'll come home to you (Hold on)
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you (Hold on)
All the time, oh (Hold on)
Here is a little saying, don't be so blinded (Hold on)
Fight blind thoughts of despair, oh (Hold on to your love)
