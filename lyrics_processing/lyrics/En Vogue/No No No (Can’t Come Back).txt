Last night, woke up to be
In a cold, cold sweat (So sweaty, so funky)
Dreamin' of bad things to be (Or not to be)
Haunting things like homelessness (All the lonely people)
Without a job, car, or food to eat
Leaves you a little bit paranoid, well well
(Brother, can you spare a dime?)
But it reminds me how easily
We let our fears affect who we are
(No no no, can't come back)

No bad feelings, no no no
No sad feelings, no no no
No jealous feelings, no no no
No insecure feelings
No no no, can't come back
No ill feelings, no no no
No jealous feelings, no no no
No ego trippin', no no no
No insecure feelings
No no no, can't come back

Had a friend in desperate need
Of a little attention, compassion, you see
Did I mention that friend was me? (Nope)
Who'd just broken up from a love affair, well well well well
I must admit I was truly hurt
And I could n't change the facts and that's a fact (That's a fact)
He loves her more than he loves me
And it's truly just as simple as that
No no no, can't come back
