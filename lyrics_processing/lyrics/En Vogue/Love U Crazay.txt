I knew it from the first time I kissed your lips
I can't resist, the passion was so strong
As I looked into your eyes
I became a little weak and I was mesmerized
I lost all track of time

	I don't wanna loose it

	(Crazay, crazay)
	I've got crazay love for you
It must be fate
I never would of met you if I wasn't late
Oh, my mistake for hitting your new car
Somethin' 'bout you took me in
Somethin' 'bout that dark brown skin
Somethin' 'bout that sexy smile
Somethin' 'bout you drove me wild
And now I'm crazay
They're goin' to put me away

As I can't believe this world without the sun
I can't believe my heart without your love
Those who don't understand
Haven't had anyone to win their heart
Like you've done to me thus far

So what part of the game is this
I'm suppose to be real smooth
Instead I stumblin' over words and ish
You got me nervous, shakin', makin' my hands sweaty
Nobody's ever had this effect on sweets Marzette
I found myself doing things I'd never do
Lately I been ditchin' all my friends
And dissin' other men for you
All I think about is you
And I don't like it one bit
Somehow you crashed into my life
And now I'm crazay lovesick
Yo
Repeat 1 (x2)
2 - I'm in love with you
And my love is true
No one else will do
I got crazay love for you
