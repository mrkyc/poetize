She ran away from home at seventeen
Didn't know what it cost to choose her dream
And mama's at home brokenhearted
He robbed a bank, stole a car and fled the scene
Didn't stop to think about family
The ones all alone brokenhearted

Ooh, can't figure it out
What the world is comin' to
Can't figure it out
What in the world are we gonna do?
If you wanna be free
Love has gotta come from you and me
It's the only thing we got
Let's come together heart to heart

Open your mind, can't you see (Open your heart, yeah)
The world's in need, hear the plea
Show love to your fellow man (Show love)
It's part of the master's plan
It's about love

She's very young and cries from daddy's touch
Disillusioned by life, she sings too much
And she lives her days brokenhearted, mhm
He was a soldier at war for me and you
Now he waits in line beggin' for food
A soldier who stands brokenhearted, oh-oh-oh
