I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely
What must I do to make you stay?

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Ooh, don't go (Don't go)
Oh no (Ooh-ooh), don't go (Don't go)
Ooh-hoo-hoo (Ooh-ooh, don't go)
Don't go (Ooh-ooh, don't go)

I feel the time is right
'Cause my love for you has known
Up 'til this very night
I had doubts your love was strong enough
To break me down
Now I'm caught up in this web
You've spun for me tonight
Don't go
It takes a gifted man
To release the love in me
So far you're the only man
Who has gone this far for me
It feels it's out of my hands
Can't think twice, it's much too right
This may be my only chance
Don't go

I've been such a fool, mhm
To have kept my love from you
(Been so slow for so long, didn't know)
Could have lost your love
(I was slow, oh)
Searching for the truth

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Ooh, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go nowhere (Ooh-ooh), you know I care
Stay right here with me forever, baby (Don't go)
(Ooh-ooh) Don't go (Don't go)
Oh no (Ooh-ooh, don't go)

Let's make sweet love tonight
I won't put up any fight
Your wish is my command
Lay me down upon my bed
And make me feel the heat
Of your body next to mine
I just have one demand
Don't go
You send chills down my spine
I surrendered all my love
You captured all my life
In just one night of ecstasy
You brought me to my knees
Your first bite was just too strong
You left a scar on me
Don't go

I've been such a fool, mhm
To have kept my love from you
(Been so slow for so long, didn't know)
Could've lost your love
(I was slow, oh)
Searching for the truth

(Ooh-ooh) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Don't go)
Baby, don't go (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh-hoo-ooh (Don't go)
Oh, baby, don't go (Ooh-ooh)
Please don't go (Don't go)
I want you right here, baby (Ooh-ooh, don't go)

I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely, oh yeah
