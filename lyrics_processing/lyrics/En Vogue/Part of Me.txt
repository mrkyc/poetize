Rain, such a simple thang
Every drop, a different stop
But they all come from the same
God is the cloud
And we are the rain
That's why I sometimes feel
That somehow we are the same

Whenever I lay my head to sleep
There's a strong thought that keeps haunting my mind
Careless whispers of a nation
That somehow was caught trapped in the dark
And nowhere to go
I know my thoughts are tellin' me

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

Life has no guarantees
That you'll keep what you have
Even though you're blessed with then
That's why I'm feeling
Some fear for the world
With all the grief and misery
How much real time is there?

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world
The irony of tryin' to do the right thing
Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness
And you say

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
Callin' me from the depths of my soul
Gotta be a part of me
Making it part of you, part of me
Everything must combine to be fine
The world is what we make it
What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today
It's a shame that peace and respect
Have been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others
Don't you see, love - that's the key

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart and my soul
Gotta be a part of me
And my world is callin' me
Gotta be a part of me
'Cause my world comes from within
Gotta be a part of me
Making me, making me, making me a part of the whole
Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
You're a part of me, they're a part of me
Gotta be a part of me
We're a part of each other, you and me, yeah
Gotta be a part of me
They're a part of me
Gotta be a part of me
Oh, oh, oh
