Here I go again
I guess I can't pretend
I'm a sucker for pure love, my friend
I find myself always thinking
About that first romantic weekend
It's like there's nothing else to do
But sit and fantasize of you

Love, love, love (Love)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs (Uh-huh)
Love, love, love (Love)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs

You can't fight it, anyway
It grabs you by the heart
And makes you walk away
So far, you gave me love
What more could I be asking for?
I'll make him mad he leaves
'Cause I won't go all the way from me

Love, love, love (Love makes you)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs (Do da do da do do thangs)
Love, love, love (Love makes you do thangs)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs (Do thangs)

Letters all the time
Why can't I simply say what's on my mind?
I got to make it hard and thangs with poetic sayings
Why it's so hard to see the signs of love in front of me?
Maybe I don't believe there could ever be a love for me

Find yourself a bit confused
Wonder why you're doin' things you don't normally do in life
I got news for you: it's the same for everyone
Once you're in you can't win, so you might as well have fun

Love (Love), love (Love), love (Ooh)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs (Do da do da do do thangs)
Love, love (Love, yeah), love (Love makes you do thangs)
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs
If you choose not listen to me
Don't you say I didn't warn you
One day love comes back to haunt you
Don't be fooled, baby, it's the same for everyone
Once you're in, you can't win, so you might as well have fun, hoo

Love (Love), love, love
Makes you do thangs
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs
Love (Love, yeah), love, love
Makes you do thangs (Do thangs)
Do thangs (Do thangs), do thangs (Do da do da do do thangs)

Ba da da da da (Ho) ba da ba
Ba da da (Do do do) da da ba da ba (Do)
