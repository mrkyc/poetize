I love the way you love me
I love the way you love me
It feels good to me

All I do, is think of you
I lose my cool every time that you're around me
See, that surprised me, but now I know
You got that thang, it's hard for me to let it go
I can't function when you are my drug
I'm addicted, can't get enough
I'm so gone, ooh, I'm feeling this
Like after my first hit, now I can't resist

I love the way you love me, it's so right (So right)
It's so good (So good), you're all mine
I love the way you love me, I can't lie
It feels good to me
I love the way you love me, it's so right (So right)
It's so good (So good), you're all mine
I love the way you love me, I can't lie
It feels good to me

What you want, it's all right by me
Can't even function, a heart without a heartbeat
I can't be, how I wanna be
I need you close, I made you my priority
