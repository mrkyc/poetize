Did I hear you say that
You want another chance
You need another try
You're ready to reclaim your prize
So, you want my love back
(You want my love back)
Why'd you let it slip away?
Why'd you ever let me go?
Your change of heart has come too late

Well, the door is locked
You can't get in
The game has changed
You've been

Too gone, too long, baby
To ever get back again
In my heart (In my heart)
Too gone, too long, baby (Too long)
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone, too gone, too long

Didn't you hear me say that
You'd be a fool to leave
You'd regret the road you chose
You'd come running right back to me
(You'd come running right back to me)
You had such a good love, sugar
You'll never find with no one else
But what I knew all the time
You had to find out for yourself

And now you'll never know
That love again
You're on your own
You've been

Too gone, too long, baby
(Ooh, much too long, baby)
To ever get back again
In my heart
Too gone, too long, baby (Too long)
You're too many tears too late (Just too late)
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone, too gone, too long
Did you really think I'd take you back
Let you back in my life
Oh, baby, just like that?
Someone new is loving me
Loving you is what used to be
Baby, you're too late
To win my heart again

Too gone, too long, baby (Too gone)
To ever get back again (Ever)
In my heart (In my arms)
Too gone, too long, baby
You're too many tears too late (Too late)
To ever come back, to get back to me, baby
Too gone (Too long), too long, baby (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
To ever get back again (No, never)
In my heart (No, never, oh, oh)
Too gone, too long, baby (Just too long, baby)
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms again

I don't need ya (Too long)
I don't want ya (Too long)
Later for you, baby (Too long)
Oh, oh (Back in my arms)
Hit the road, Jack (Too long)
And don't you come back (Too long)
No more (Too long)
No more (Too long...back in my arms)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh yeah-yeah (Too long)
Oh oh yeah, oh-oh yeah (Too long, too long, too long)
Oh, hey, hey, hey (Back in my arms)
(Too long) Too-ooh-ooh (Too long) Too-ooh-ooh
