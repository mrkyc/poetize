Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise

It's the same game
Played in many ways
Everyone is the victim too
It's just a waste of time
Made for simple minds
So why do people insist on lies?

I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Getting caught up in a vicious web of lies

Lies (They can hurt you), lies (And destroy you)
Using lies as alibis (Watch out for lies)
Lies, lies (Lies), just a devil in disguise
(Just a devil in disguise)

The nation's leaders as well as teachers
Practice lies as a way of life, yes they do
So think before you speak
'Cause what you sow you reap
The truth will always be brought to light

Will we ever learn one day
That telling lies will always lead to madness
Misery and sometimes pain

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis (Using lies as alibis)
Lies, lies (Oh lies), just a devil in disguise (And it's made for simple minds)
Lies (Yeah), lies (Lies), using lies as alibis (Made for simple minds)
Lies, lies (You've got to think about it), just a devil in disguise
(Those lies)

Lies and deceit, yes, it's running real rampant
Communities suffering, yo, I can't stand it
When we think of lies, we tend to think of politicians
But what about the husband who's on a mission?
Lying to his wife so he can get it on and get some
Coming back home with a dumb expression
Written on a face that's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude
People, do you hear me though?
Listen, to a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair and we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And every lie the tell affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold
I guess what Debbie T. is really tryna say
When you break it all down, we're really all the same
I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Caught up in a vicious web of lies, oh

Lies, lies (Oh), using lies as alibis (Using lies)
Lies (You're lying), lies (Stop cheating), just a devil in disguise (Lie, lie, lie, lies)
Lies, lies (Oh-oh), using lies as alibis (Oh yeah, they'll ruin your life)
Lies (You better think twice), lies, just a devil in disguise
(Stop hurting, deceiving, and telling your lies and, oh-oh-oh, ooh)
Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lies, lies, just a devil in disguise
(Just a devil in disguise)
Lies (Oh lies), lies (Evil little lies), using lies as alibis
