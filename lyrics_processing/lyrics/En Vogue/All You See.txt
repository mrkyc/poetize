You best believe every day I get the same ol' thang
All kind of brothers coming up to me
With silly lies that could make you sick
Oh, they need to quit, and get away from me
Don't get me wrong, I like attention, too
But do they really have to act a fool
'Cause they see a lady lookin' good?
Please admit

Is it my hips? (Ooh ooh) My lips? (Ah-ah)
My eyes? (Ah-ha) My thighs? (Hey hey)
My chest? (Ooh ooh) My hair? (Ah-ah)
My big ol' hey-e-e-ea (Ah-ha, hey hey)
Is that all you see?
Is it my hips? (Ooh ooh) My lips? (Ah-ah)
My eyes? (Ah-ha) My thighs? (Hey hey)
My chest? (Ooh ooh) My hair? (Ah-ah)
My big ol' hey-e-e-ea (Ah-ha, hey hey)
Is that all you see?

How come you actin' like you don't know
Why some brothas always lose control?
When you're wearing them hip-high jeans
With your thong out, baby please, let a playa speak
And don't you start to tweak
You got the body that can make men weep
So when you walk around in "do me" clothes like those vide-hoes
Girl, you need to know that all I'm lookin' at is
Hips (Ooh ooh), and lips (Ah-ah)
And eyes (Ah-ha), your thighs (Hey hey)
Your chest (Ooh ooh), your hair (Ah-ah)
Girl, that big ol'
Hey-e-e-ea, is that all you see?
Your hips (Ooh ooh), your lips (Ah-ah)
Your eyes (Ah-ha), your thighs (Hey hey)
Your chest, baby (Ooh ooh), your hair (Ah-ha)
You're sexy underwear
Hey-e-e-ea, is that all you see?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, sexy underwear I see
Ooh and I know, I know
Your hips, somethin' 'bout your thighs
Is driving me crazy, ooh, hey, uh-huh, uh-huh
