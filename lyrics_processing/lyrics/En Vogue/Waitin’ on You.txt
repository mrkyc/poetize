Gosh, fire's going, got a bottle of wine
Everything's perfect
There's only one thing missing


It's ten o'clock and I'm still alone
Waitin' by the phone
It makes me think you won't be back again
And I'm feeling so intense, ooh baby
(Got me waitin', got me waitin')

I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(I can't keep on)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now

I fantasize of makin' love
It's such a lonely feeling without you
But I would not have to dream
If you would just be there to share my love's desire

I should not be alone
Just waitin' for a man who claims he loves me so
I have more patience than I believe
It's such a shame, I can't believe I'm still alone
(I can't believe that I'm still alone, baby)

I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(Come on, baby, come on)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(Come on back, come on back, come on)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(I've been waiting for so very long for this moment)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
(Come on)
To come home, to come home now
(I can't believe)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(I can't believe you won't come home to be with me)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(Baby, baby, baby)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
To come home, to come home now
(Come on back, boy, come on back)
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
(I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting)
