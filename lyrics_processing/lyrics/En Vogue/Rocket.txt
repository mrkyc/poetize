Looking at the sky at night
Little bitty circles of light
You point out a constellation that you like
And tell me all about it
Cause you know about it
And I love that you know stuff like that
Love that the little things means so much
That's why I'm always smiling
I swear I smile my face off
Let me kiss you face off
Right before we take off

In this rocket (of love)
In this rocket (of love)
And you got me so high
Higher than I ever been
And you got me so high
Higher than I ever been

Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars

Darker than I've ever seen ya
Don't think I ever felt so small
But darkness never felt so bright
And in your arms
It's hard to feel afraid at all
On your neck I feel your breath
Chills up my spine
Feels I'm in mine
All the time
That's why I'm always smiling
I swear I smile my face off
Let me kiss you face off
Right before we take of

In this rocket (of love)
In this rocket (of love)
And you got me so high
Higher than I ever been
And you got me so high
Higher than I ever been

Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars with you
Up in the stars
Well if this world don't understand the love
That we share between us babe
Oh then we'll fly away
Fly away and just find one that does

In this rocket (of love)
In this rocket (of love)
And you got me so high
Higher than I ever been
And you me so high
