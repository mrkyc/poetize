You shut
Me down
You want
Me more
And More
Upside and down
It's really on the floor
Break my will you
Jagged little pill
You'll live to burn
Your lesson never learned
Can't breathe
I don't need this

You lock me up
These chains are
Wearing thin
All of your lies
Getting under my skin
I turn attack
We lead you into black
This dream is out
There's no turning back
You might also like
I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
Now your words can't kill what's already dead
I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
Now your words can't kill what's already dead

Back and forth, you swing me on a noose
One after one the threads are coming loose
Run me down, you wreck me to the core
Scraping me up as if there's something more

What's left in this mess
Can't you see I don't need this

I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
Now your words can't kill what's already dead
I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
Now your words can't kill what's already dead
No wonder there's nothing left
No wonder life feels like death
No faith in love survive
Cause once you start nothings left to learn

I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
Now your words can't kill what's already dead
I try, wanna forgive but you lied all over again
So I can't forget, forget what you did and
