I'm never looking back the future's right in my face
And if you're stepping up like you got something to say
You can tell it like it is or get on out of my way
We're going so fast, so hard
It's too good to stop now
This time it's my way
Big lights and Broadway
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
We're going so fast, so hard
Too much to stop now
Don't care if you doubt
I've got my middle fingers out
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
'Cause I got my middle fingers out
I've never shown the bruises that you cast on my skin
On the surface we're the same but we're different within
I'm following my heart and now I'm living the dream
While you talk all the shit that you'll never be, yeah
And I don't want and I don't need you
It's all about the size of your middle finger
You might also likeWe're going so fast, so hard
It's too good to stop now
This time it's my way
Big lights and broadway
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
We're going so fast, so hard
Too much to stop now
Don't care if you doubt
I've got my middle fingers out
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
'Cause I got my middle fingers out
Always in the mirror
But you never see clear
You're just what they want you to be
You believe what they said
It got into your head
And now you're acting desperately
Your story's old
The truth's untold
You had it handed to you
Nothing to save
Burn it away
I'm leaving you in yesterday
We're going so fast, so hard
It's too good to stop now
This time it's my way
Big lights and Broadway
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
We're going so fast, so hard
Too much to stop now
Don't care if you doubt
I've got my middle fingers out
Live fast, die young
Some how we'll figure it out
