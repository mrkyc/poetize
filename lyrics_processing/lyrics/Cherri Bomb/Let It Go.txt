You never see my way
Pissing on my flame
I'll be the one left standing
With everything I do
It never pleases you
But I'll be the last one laughing

Listen
You're always missing
Blind to my vision
No!

I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
No matter what
It's in my blood
I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
It won't die
This dream's alive
And I won't let it go
You might also like
I thought I'd try your way
But I went down in flames
I should a seen it comin'
Life is more than sitting back
Oh I'm on the attack
Yeah I am off and running

Listen
I'm on a mission
Done with this pissin'
Now...

I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
No matter what
It's in my blood
I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
It won't die
This dream's alive
And I won't let it go
It's in my blood
And I won't give up
Cuz it's running through my veins
It's in my blood
Cuz it's all I want
And I won't go down in flames
(Let it go!)
It's in my blood
And I won't give up
Cuz it's running through my veins
(Let it go!)
It's in my blood
Cuz it's all I want
And I won't go down in flames

I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
No matter what
It's in my blood
I just won't let it go
Just can't let it go
Just won't let it go
It won't die
This dream's alive
It won't die
This dream's alive
And I won't let it go
Let it go
