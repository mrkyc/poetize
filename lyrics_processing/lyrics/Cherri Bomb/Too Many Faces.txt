Do you care about me?
Do you think I don't bleed?
Are you trying to hide behind a stupid lie
When the truth is in your eyes?
Do you think I don't see
What you're pushing on me?
In your mind you think it's only you against the world
Is it you against the world?
You say you'll never go that far
But you're not who you say you are
You've got too many, too many faces
Your time is up in too many places
You say you'll never push that hard
But you're not who you say you are
You've got your heart in too many places
You've got too many, too many faces
Have you lost yourself?
Always trying to sell
The person that you think you are
You stay alone
Cause real's just too hard
You might also likeAlways laying the blame
You're never one and the same
Could it be that you're afraid to look inside and find
You'll never get it right
You say you'll never go that far
But you're not who you say you are
You've got too many, too many faces
Your time is up in too many places
You say you'll never push that hard
But you're not who you say you are
You've got your heart in too many places
You've got too many, too many faces
So many sides to you
Nobody knows the truth
How you ever gonna keep it straight?
I know what you're all about
I've got you figured out
Do you wanna be a memory?
You say you'll never go that far
But you're not who you say you are
You've got too many, too many faces
Your time is up in too many places
You say you'll never push that hard
But you're not who you say you are
You've got your heart in too many places
You've got too many, too many faces
