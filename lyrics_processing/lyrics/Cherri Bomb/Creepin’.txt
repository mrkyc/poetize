You think
I'm gonna turn a blind eye
You don't think
I see you watchin' my guy
Well you should know
You're never gonna bring me down
(verse 2-Miranda)
It's like this
I know you're really lonely
And I can tell
You're actin' kinda phony
Well guess what
It's only gonna bring you down
(pre chorus-Miranda/ *Mir and Rena*)
Get up, get out, give in
I see right through you
Back up, move out
* 'cause I know what you're up to *
(chorus-Miranda/ *Rena*)
*hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend*
Do you know that cheatin's not the new trend
*well don't you dare to try and pretend*
You're a fake, I know you're not a real friend
You might also like(both)
La la la la la la la la (x2)
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
(verse 3-Mir)
So now, you're getting on my bad side
So piss off, go and find your own guy
He's not ever gonna make it right
(pre chorus-both)
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye
But now you know, at least you tried
He's here for good
He's stayin' by my si-i-i-ide
(chorus)
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
*do you know that cheatin's not the new trend*
Well don't you dare to try and pretend
*you're a fake, I know you're not a real friend*
(both)
La la la la la la la la (x2)
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
Whoa
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
Do you know that cheatin's not the new trend
Well don't you dare to try and pretend
You're a fake, I know you're not a real friend
(Miranda/ *Rena*)
*hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend*
Do you know that cheatin's not the new trend

You're a fake, I know you're not a real friend

La la la la la la la la (x2)
Hey you, you're creepin' on my boyfriend
Whoa
