-Oh, shit. I hope I don't screw up
Now there are blues that you get from happiness
There are blues that you get from pain
There're blues when you are lonely for your one and only
Blues that are hard to explain
And there are blues that you get from waitin'
But the meanest, the meanest blues that be
They're kind that I got on my mind
Blues there are all very meanest kind
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Oh, yeah
Oh, they're blues you get from women when you see 'em goin' swimmin' and you haven't got a bathin' suit yourself
There are blues that start to flicker when you had a lot of liquor and someone goes and takes it off the shelf
There are blues you get from waitin' on the dock, and you wonderin' if your little boat is gonna rock
Blues you keep a gettin' in a taxicab a pettin' every time you hear the meter jump the clock
And there are blues you get from cryin' when your uncle Will is dyin' and he afterwards forgets you in his will
There are blues you get from kisses when you are walkin' with the missus and another baby shouts, "Hey, Bill!"
Blues that kinda make you hop and really shake and shiver, kinda make you want to end it all in the river
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Oh, play that thing!
