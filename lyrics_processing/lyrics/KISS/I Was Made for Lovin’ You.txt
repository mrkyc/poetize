Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Tonight, I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness, there's so much I wanna do
And tonight, I wanna lay it at your feet
'Cause, girl, I was made for you and, girl, you were made for me

I was made for lovin' you, baby, you were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby, can you get enough of me?

Tonight, I wanna see it in your eyes
Feel the magic, there's something that drives me wild
And tonight, we're gonna make it all come true
'Cause, girl, you were made for me and, girl, I was made for you

I was made for lovin' you, baby, you were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby, can you get enough of me?
I was made for lovin' you, baby, you were made for lovin' me
And I can give it all to you, baby, can you give it all to me?
