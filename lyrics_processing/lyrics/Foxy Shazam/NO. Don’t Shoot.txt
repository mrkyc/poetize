Love is good to you
I can't say the same for me
SMILE!
Love is good to you
I guess I'm not the only one
Q-tip and hostered guns
Sesamie seeds find your gun
And i'll accuse you
Because i've been so far
And i've been so wide
Now i'm finding all these things i never knew existed
Since you since you since you since you
Since you been gone
Since you been good
Since you been here
NO don't shoot
NO don't shoot
NO don't shoot
NO!!!

I was in the bathroom the one day at school, when a bar of soap under the sink caught my eye
I picked it up and the name 'Lisa' was carved in it, nine years later I watched my only daughter walk beautifully down the aisle and she turns to me and says the six words Ill remember for the rest of my life;
"EEE OOOh aaaah. biggity biggity boo"
Repeated a few times then Donald Duck-worthy sounding fun nonsense
"I'm not a crook
I'm not a crook
I'm not a crook and I swear it"
"I'm not a crook
I'm not a crook
I'm not a crook I swear"
Since you since you since you since you
Since you been gone
Since you been good
Since you been here
NO don't shoot
NO don't shoot
NO don't shoot
