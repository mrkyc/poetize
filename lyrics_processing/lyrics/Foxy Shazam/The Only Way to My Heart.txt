I was thinking of love and how you got none in you
I piss my pants in an expensive suit (oh yeah)
I can keep my hat on in the worstest hurricane (Make it rain)
Hold me, I get lonely
I can only wait so long
I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Keep the flowers, I'll just give 'em back
'Cause the only way to my heart is with an axe
So keep the flowers, I'll just give 'em back
'Cause the only way to my heart is with an axe, yeah
A cup of coffee before bed, so I dream fast
I stoled your car that I purposely crashed
Hold me, I get lonely
I can only wait so long
I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Keep the flowers, I'll just give 'em back
'Cause the only way to my heart is with an axe
Keep the flowers, I'll just give 'em back
'Cause the only way to my heart is with an axe, yeah
