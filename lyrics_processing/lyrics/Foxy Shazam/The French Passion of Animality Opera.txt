You gave your eyes
I've never looked to this deep into myself before
And I'm pretty sure that I'm only human, then again I could be..
Wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong
I could be..
I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong
Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes I'm wrong
I never felt this way about anything
I am a Beast and i'm pretty sure that there is no cure, but then again I could be..
Wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong
I could be..
I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be
The stars the stripes the goddess in gold
I gotta keep a steady rhythm of fashion and old
The way look the way you move the way it all makes me feel
I wanna ddddd-die
That concentrated gaze
You gave your eyes
I've never looked to this deep into myself before
And I'm pretty sure that I'm only human, then again I could be...
Wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong
I could be..
I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, I could be

I gotta keep a steady rhythm of fashion and old
The way look the way you move the way it all makes me feel
I wanna
Live...today, tonight
Chain me to the bed i want to live..today, tonight
Chain me to the bed and chain it tight
Out of control, I can't control
Out of control, I can't control
I am a beast
Gaze you gave your eyes
I've never looked this deep into myself before
And I'm pretty sure
That I'm only human
