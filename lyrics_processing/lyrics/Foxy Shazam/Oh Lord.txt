Mommy don't leave me
Yeah, Julian!

Yeah!
Aw!
Alright, lemme tell you

Julian, it's a hungry world
They're going to eat you alive, son, a-yeah
Oh, Julian, when their fangs sink in
I'll stitch you, but then I gotta throw you back in, oh

You just try and sleep, even though you're alone
You just close your eyes, boy, you dream of home
The light is always on, just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning, you'll be satisfied

'Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
And God knows I've had some rough fuckin' years
Ooh, oh Lord, oh Lord, keep on keeping on
You might also like
Julian, I thought I told you this
But I guess I was wrong, yeah yeah
Oh Julian, it probably scares you now
In the future it counts, you gotta trust me, trust me, yeah

So hide this song away for a darker day
When you're down on your knees, screaming, "Oh Lord"
I am always there, you just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning, you'll be satisfied

'Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
And God knows I've had some rough fuckin' years
Ooh, oh Lord, oh Lord, keep on keeping on


La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
'Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
God knows I've had some rough fucking years
Ooh, oh Lord, oh Lord, keep on keeping on

La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
