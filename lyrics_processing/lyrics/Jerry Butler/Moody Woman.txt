Oh, I love you when you hug and kiss me
I get the feeling that you really miss me
Girl, I can't stand it when you start acting funny
And look at me like I'm buggin' you honey

Oh, moody woman (Moody woman)
You change like the weather
Moody woman (Moody woman)
But you got it together
Moody, moody, moody woman (Moody, moody, moody)
I love you
You bet your life I do

Oh variety is the spice of life
Guess the pain makes the pleasure nice
You make my day when you say you need me
But, that's no way to play when you say you're gonna leave me
You might also like
Moody woman (Moody woman)
Oh, I love you
Moody woman (Moody woman)
I think the world of you
Moody, moody, moody woman (Moody, moody, moody)
I love you

Oh baby you could be impossibly smart
You know you can, girl
But I know you love me
You think the world of me
And you got a great big heart

People tell me that love's blind
There ain't no love as blind as mine
And though I have to suffer when you're feeling blue
My life would be much tougher if I didn't have you

Oh, Moody baby (Moody)
I know all about you
Moody woman (Moody)
Can't live without you
Moody, moody, moody (Moody, moody, moody)
Woman, I love you
You bet your life I do
Oh, moody woman (Moody)
You know I love you
Moody woman (Moody)
I think the world of you
You have been my whole life, baby
Moody woman (Moody)
I don't wanna leave you
Moody baby (Moody)
You know that I need you
Why don't you let me love you?
Moody woman, I just wanna seize ya
