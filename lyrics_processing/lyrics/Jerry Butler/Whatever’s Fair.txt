There was a time (eh babe)
When we'd sit and rhyme for hours
And you said you'd like the flowers
That I'd buy for you some time
But now I find (oh yeah)
You can get along without me
You say you don't even think about me
Something else is on your mind

You wanna be free
Well that's all I  need
You got somebody else
Honey, go play Sam
You see that's how much I care

Whatever's fair
Go on and do what you gotta do
Whatever's fair
I only want what's best for you
I said: I only want what's best for you

You used to be (you sure did babe)
Such a tender loving woman
Now you've been such a long time coming
I think you're gonna be a long time gone
But don't you worry 'bout me (don't, don't worry babe)
I'll be full of tears inside
All of my fears I'll try to hide
I'll just keep on holding on
You might also like
So you made up your mind
You wanna leave me behind
And I can't turn the tide
So I'll just step aside
Freedom make a pair

Whatever's fair (uh cry baby)
Go on and do what you gotta do
Whatever's fair
I only want what's best for you
Yeah, I only want what's best for you

But if you need me
I'll be to defy
And if you want, want me
I'll be somewhere around
And I'll do everything that I can
To lend you a helping hand
Anyway
Anytime
Anyplace
Anywhere:
Whatever's fair
You know, go on and do what you gotta do
Whatever's fair (ooh wee baby)
I only want what's best for you:
Whatever's fair
I said whatever's fair darling
Go on and do what you got to do
'Cus I believe that you'll be foul by played
Whatever's fair
Just don't want me no more baby
I only want what's best for you
Go ahead and reach out for the 
Whatever's fair
What's gonna make you happy lady
Go on and do what you gotta do
I think I can stand it
