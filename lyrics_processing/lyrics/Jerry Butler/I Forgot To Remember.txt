(I forgot to remember to stop loving you)

I remember
(I remember)
When you and me would disagree, baby
We were sitting on needles and pins
I remember
(I remember)
Our meaningless words spoken in anger
That made matters worse, hey, than they should have been
I remember saying that separating
Would be the best thing for us to do

But, I forgot
(I forgot)
To remember
(To remember)
To stop loving you
That's what I did
I forgot, baby, I don't love you
Listen

I remember
(I remember)
How we fuss and fight most of the night, baby, baby, baby
And got nothing resolved
Ain't it strange, hey, yeah
How two people who are so in love
Could let things change and drift apart, do you hear me, love?
All I recall at the end of it all
I said: "I'm so glad we're through"
You might also like
But, I forgot
(I forgot)
To remember
(To remember)
To stop, hey, loving you, baby

I forgot that I ain't supposed to be in love with you
I keep remembering how you kiss me
How you told me that you loved me
And every since that day (I forgot)
You've been my girl (To remember)
You've been my whole world (To stop loving you)
I just left, baby (To stop loving you)
I can't forget about ya (I forgot)
I can't do without you (To remember)
I can't do with you (To stop loving you)
I guess I got to quit ya, but (Loving you)
I really love you, woman (I forgot)
And, I want you by my side (To remember)
Every day, baby (To stop loving you)
Every night, woman (Loving you)
I can't forget you, no (I forgot)
Can't forget you, baby (To remember)
Can't forget you, woman (To stop loving you)
I love you, baby (Loving you)
