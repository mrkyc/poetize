You took me on a wonderful high
And it was beautiful, baby
(Beautiful, baby)
We had almost reached the sky
And it was beautiful, baby
(Beautiful, baby)
And I didn't want to come down
As your love's around
So, I could have stayed up here
But it's nothing, nothing without you here

Every step I take, a tear falls from my eyes
I stand alone, nowhere to turn
My lonely heart suddenly cries

I'm just walking around on teardrops
I'm just walking around on teardrops

I was high on love, you were by my side
Where did you run and hide
I'm talking to my shadow
(Talking to my shadow)
Wishing it was you
Where did you go, what did you do?
You might also like
I'm just walking around on teardrops
I'm just walking around on teardrops

Only yesterday, girl we were doing fine
All of your plans were mine
My room's filled with tears
Every place I step
Girl, only your love can help

I'm just walking around on teardrops
Oh, baby, just walking around on teardrops
Oh, darling, I'm just walking around on teardrops
I'm just walking around on teardrops

Ever since you left me, girl
It's a strange world
And I'm walkin' around here
Tryin' to find you, baby (Walk, walk, walk)
I don't know why, I don't know
I don't know why you left me
After bringing me way up
You brought me up so high (Walk, walk, walk)
That if you ever leave me, baby (Walking in teardrops)
I'll just lay down and give it up (Walk, walk, walk)
I don't need it baby (Walking in teardrops)
If I can't have you (Walk, walk, walk)
I'll keep walking around (Walking in teardrops)
Crying my eyes out, darling (Walk, walk, walk)
Until your love is mine (Walking in teardrops)
I think you've reminded me
To bring all this way
