(Been such a long time)
(Since I had a little love)
(Been such a long time)
(Since I had a little love)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)

Oh, little mama, can I have your attention
I've been lonely longer than I care to mention
And, you look like the kind of girl who can truly satisfy
And, I'm the fellow who needs it
Well, let me tell you why

'Cause it's been so long since I've been loved (It's been a long time since I've been loved)
It's been a long time since I've been loved (It's been a long time since I've been loved)
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Honey, I could tell ya a whole lotta pretty words
But, I doubt if I find one that you never heard
Come on, let me squeeze you and kiss you on your neck
Aw, maybe my lovin' will get me some respect

'Cause it's been a long time since I've had some love (It's been a long time since I've been loved)
It's been so long time since I've been loved (It's been so long since I've been loved)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh, baby, I don't really mean to scare ya
If I'm too aggressive, mama let me tell ya
Ain't nobody loved me since I don't know when
So glad I found ya, girl where you been

'Cause it's been a long time since I've been loved (It's been so long since I've been loved)
Said it's been so doggone long since I've been  (It's been so long since I've been loved)

Held real tight, squeezed all night
Been a long time since somebody cared
I said been plenty long since she said she need me (Been such a long time)
(Been such a long time)
Been plenty long since somebody squeezed me
(Been such a long time)
Baby, I don't know how I can stand it
Ooowee woman, think you must have planned it
