Oh I'll never let you under my skin
Baby, I just could not stand, um, hum
To be hurt again

Um, hum, ooh wee, baby, ooh, hoo
Listen lady:
Hey, I'll wine and dine you
Take you anywhere you wanna go
Oh, but when the night is over
Hey, you just may not see me no more
All I want is...

A one-night affair (One night affair)
That won't hurt nobody
A one night affair (One night affair)
Hey, I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'll be a son of a gun
(Son of a gun)
But I'll hit and run, but it could be promising

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't wanna take me a wife
Girl, you just may not be ready
To go steady for the rest of your life
So, for that reason...

A one-night affair (One night affair)
It'll be alright
A one night affair (One night affair)
Let's start tonight
Hit and run
Uh, huh, son of a gun
I'm gonna hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will

'Cause you see I've been a lonely man
And I want you to understand
That I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again
Oh no, baby
(Hit and run)
Um, hum
(Son of a gun)
I couldn't stand it, baby
(Hit and run)
No, no, no, no, now

A one night affair (One night affair)
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair (One night affair)
But you don't have to worry
I'll hit and run, I'll be a son of a gun
And I know you have been lonely too
That's why you will understand
Why a broken heart is so hard on a man
But one of these days
(One of these days)
I'll be alright
(Gonna be alright)
If you would just let me
(Would let me)
Love you tonight
(Love you tonight)
And though it may sound
(May sound)
A little temporary
(A little temporary)
Sometimes, baby
(Sometimes)
It's so necessary

A one night affair (One night affair)
I declare
One night affair (One night affair)
Hey, it's hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'll be a son of a gun
(Son of a gun)
Said I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
Yes I will, yes I will, baby
One night affair (One night affair)
Won't hurt nobody
A one night affair (One night affair)
Baby
(Hit and run)
Won't you be mine
(Son of a gun)
For just a little while
(Hit and run)
Hey, won't you be mine
Won't you hold me
One night affair
