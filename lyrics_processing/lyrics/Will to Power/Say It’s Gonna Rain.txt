And no one's gonna go out tonight
You say it's gonna rain
That's why I'm hopin' you hold me tight
If I only live my life for you
There's only one thing I'd like to do
So I'm hoping you give me this chance
So tonight let us start our romance
You say it's gonna rain
And no one's gonna go out tonight
You know it's gonna rain
That's why I'm hopin' you hold me tight
If you only have eyes just for me
Close them tight and I'm sure you will see
That nothing can stand in our way
It can happen to us any day
You say it's gonna rain
And no one's gonna go out tonight
I know it's gonna rain
That's why I'm hopin' you hold me tight
If I only have one wish come true
I will spend my whole lifetime with you
In the dark of the night I can see
That this storm is about to be free
