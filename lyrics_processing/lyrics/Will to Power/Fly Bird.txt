Sail across the sky
Oh what you're seeing is hard to believe
As you watch the world go by
Fly away, bird
I know you can fly so high
Oh got to get away
And I know the reason why
A good thing's today
But don't think about tomorrow
Life is a journey
We're only passing through
You can't run away
'Cause all you will feel is sorrow
We gotta make a better place
We can see it through
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings and go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
You and me can soar to a new high
You might also likeGonna make a better place
Give you more than you ever had
Here's a little bit of sunshine
To clear up the rain
Fly away, bird
I still can hear you cry
Oh now you're fearing that the end is near
And we'll have to say goodbye
Fly away, bird
I don't wanna hear no lies
Oh tell me what you see
Just open up your eyes
They're taking the land
Then spill oil in the ocean
Damned up the rivers
Poisoned the air we breathe
What can withstand
To put all the plans in motion
It's time to think of Earth first
And what it needs
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings and go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
You and me can soar to a new high
Are you gonna come back?
Will I see you next summer time?
With a little bit of help
We can lesson the pain
Fly bird
Fly high
Fly bird
Fly high
Gonna make a better place
Give you more than you ever had
Here's a little bit of sunshine
To clear up the rain
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings
We'll go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
Watch the world go by
Fly bird
Fly high
Sail up to the sky
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings
We'll go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings and go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
I can still hear you cry
Fly bird
Fly high
Spread your wings and go for a long ride
Fly bird
Fly high
