Now here's a little story that must be told
Of a place where the streets are paved in gold
The air's so clear and the water is blue
But you can't let the outside fool you
The place is Miami, it's really nice
Is hot as fire and cold as ice
The pimps and drug  street
 to the tune of Miami Vice

You go to the horse track every day
And spend the last dime of your last week's pay
 hopin' you get
 to pay your debt

You're rockin' to the beat of the Magic City
The sun always shines and the ladies are pretty
Anything you want from A to Z
You see, the world is yours in Miami

A deal goes down 'tween seller and buyer
They try to settle up with machine gun fire
You do them wrong and they'll do you in
You always lose, but you think you win
Take me to the freak show called downtown
The junkies and the prostitutes are walkin' all around
You gotta share the cost of a paradise lost
'Cause there're people on the streets while the deal's goin' down
Murder, violent crimes, it's a sign of the times
See, it happens everywhere, the police don't care
A kickback, bribes, and they're always takin' sides
But the word on the street is Miami Vice
(Vice)

You come when you can to the promised land
Where the surf and the turf go hand in hand
Where the good and bad go cheek to cheek
Where drug smugglers play hide and seek
Where snow is white and money's quick
Where the jet set go out to be seen
But if you play the game, you're gonna pay the price
 to the tune of Miami Vice

You're slidin' down the boulevard called Biscayne
Sleeker than a shark and cooler than the rain
A call from base and they pick up the pace
Put the pedal to the metal and wind up in a chase
You see Miami's finest, the men in blue
The undercover agents and the SWAT team, too
And if you're gonna strike once, you better think twice
Or feel the mighty wrath of Miami Vice
