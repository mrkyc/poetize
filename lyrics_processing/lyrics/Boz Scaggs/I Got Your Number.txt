I know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number
I'd say you ain't got no choice at all
No no no no no
I took your head from lonely
Chased your pain away
I gave you more than loving
In my special way
I shocked you out of boredom
Made you a faithful wife
Gave you an education
On the facts of life
In you there's come a change
I'll be damned I got you trained
And thats why I.. I.. what I know
I got your number
I know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number mama
No you ain't got no choice at all
No no no no no no
Why listen to your girlfriends
When they can plainly see
That the boy that they call lover
Ain't half the man as me
Hey I don't have to prove nothing
Long as you're satisfied
Cos if you need more loving
There's plenty more inside yeah
Just tell them I'm glad that he's my man
Something they'll never understand
That is why I....I...
