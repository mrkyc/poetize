Let some shark drag the thing away
I can see the headlights drawing very near
Let me do the talking now just in case fix you face
We can make the border by tomorrow
If your brilliant young Madonna doesn't do us in
We should have given her the shot that you took
And put her away
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Oakland California 1948
Stella promised Blackie she was going straight
Now Blackie my main man he takes the major leagues
He could sell Geronimo a string of beads
But Stella could sell Blackie almost anything
He's lucky she ain't yet sold him up the stream
Just one more job could put us back on Easy Street
C'mon baby
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
You might also likeI said Blackie you can't listen to the dame
She's gone back on her promise now it's a losing game
But we pulled off the job anyway
And she cursed the day we met
And Blackie took a slug or two he won't forget
By now the kerbs were shining with the falling rain
And I kept dousing Blackie just to keep him sane
I'm wondering if it's over now or just my fevered brain
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
