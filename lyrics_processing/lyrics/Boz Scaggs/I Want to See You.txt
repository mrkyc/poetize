Can't see her when you want to
You've got to see her when you can
I had a dream, late last night
You were speaking to me
Everything was alright
I had a dream, in the morning time
Birds were singin'
Everything was just fine
I want to see you
I want to see you
I'd like to call you
Want to get to know you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you
Talk about a woman, you're sad and leave
Said that you wanted to find out about me
Sorry Anna Lee, go on, do the best you can
Got a one track mind; I know you understand
I want to see you
I want to see you
I'd like to call you
Want to get to know you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you

Then I start to wonder
What you tryin' to do?
Next she untied my right shoe
Then she said to me, 'am I comin' through?'
(Yeah, you're comin' through alright)
