What more is there to say?
Here's to your eyes and my final demise
Oh, Simone, it's you
I knew from the start that my easily-touched heart
Was about to go out for a ride
Conquer the room with a touch of perfume
Oh, Simone, it's you
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right
Make it romantic, make it up I don't care
Look up and sigh even if it's a lie
Oh, Simone, what can I do?
What charm could sway me
Then burn and betray me
But thrill me the way that you do
Second to none, so completely undone
Oh, Simone, it's you

Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right
It's time they told you, it's about time you knew
Straighten your gown throw a Manhattan down
Yes, Simone, it's true
What do you think, you're foolin' somebody
Do you think that I can't see?
There's no doubt, not a trace
It's all over your face
Oh, Simone, it's me, ooh
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right, oh
