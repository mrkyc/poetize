Wide enough to hold your world
It's real
Though in reality not quite
Simple like a boy meets girl
Cause we can be whatever
We believe when we're together
And we both know that
We're never gonna care what they say
We don't need a label or an antiquated fable
To define what we're unable to describe anyway
Come a little closer
I don't mind
I wanna be with you
All the time
Can you feel your heart beat next to mine
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Now
Because you know I believe
In every breath that you breathe
Because you know I believe
Yeah
Our lives
Are mysteries at the best times
Not to mention at the worst
Our prize
Is the freedom
To go our way
Even if we don't come first
Cuz we can channel our intention
Deep into a new dimension
Free of fear and apprehension
And politics
I just wanna follow you
So hold my hand and take me to
The secret place where dreams come true
Before they exist
