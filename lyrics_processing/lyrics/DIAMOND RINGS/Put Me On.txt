Between the pigeons, and the northern loons
Crossing the river to the valley's side
Driving together in your fathers ride
Come on
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on
Roll down the window and let down your hair
Turn up the music in the cool night air
The engines revving through the heart beat glass
And all I wanna do is make it last
Come on
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on
Hold me in arms until I'm blacker than blue
And if you wanna lay down, I'll lay down next to you
I can take you places you thought you never knew
Baby, we can will this dream into coming true
It's for you
You might also likeNo matter what I'll try the best I can
And because of you, I am who I am
So take my hand and get behind the wheel
And let me give you everything I feel
Come on
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on
Hold me in your arms until I'm blacker than blue
And if you wanna lay down, I'll lay down next to you
And I can take you places you thought you never knew
Baby, we can will this dream into coming true. It's for you
Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
Put me on, put me on. Come On
