Thinking of you laying by my side
Keep forgetting I'm away from home
In another hotel on my own
Curse the ring
Another wake up call
Spend a minute
Staring at the wall
I don't even know the state I'm in
Could be Illinois or Michigan
Either way it's all the same to me
Minibars, guitar and TV
Just a marker on the highway line
With a number and a dollar sign
Hate to play because I play for keeps
Still I can't help count these weeks
Till the day that I can hold you near
So come on an work it out right here
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
You might also likeOne, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
I'm been trying to make the time for you
But you know just what I have to do
And if ever you think I've gone blind
Don't forget you're always on my mind
'Cause I know that everyone gets scared
And we're never really quite prepared
For whatever we're about to face
It's a mystery of time and space
Still if you can keep a watchful eye
Overhead upon the night time sky
Soon enough you're gonna see my sign
Shining for you when the stars align
But for now just put your backbone side
Feel the rhythm of the kick inside
All I wanna do is show you how
So come on and sing it out right now
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
No matter what I won't forget
Not to forget you
And if my love had a color
It could be true blue
Paris to London to Berlin back to Toronto
Where ever I am you know I can feel your heart glow
Because your love is so warm it can make the snow thaw
The way you walk you should be br-br-br-breaking the law
I got the spirit so come on bring on the feeling
Love is a drug
And it's the only one I'm feeling
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, all day and night
One, two, let me love you
Three, four, love you more
Five, six, seven, eight, nine
