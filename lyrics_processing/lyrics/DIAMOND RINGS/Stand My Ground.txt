Sometimes I feel as if I'm falling apart
But in the end I know all I can do is follow my heart
I'm always going but never coming home
I fall asleep but always wake up alone
And pay the price to live a life that I've been calling my own
But I see everything in vivid extremes
When I'm awake inside the world of my dreams
Refractive light within a blink of an eye
And painting rainbows 'til I run out of sky
I was just a lost boy but now oh how I've been found
Burning through the day light uptight all night turning round
But I used to get high, get high, 'til I come back down
Now I'm gonna stand tall, stand up, stand my ground
I felt the power of the tiniest spark
I faced the death of every pitch of the dark
And I'll keep touchin' them 'til I finally make my own mark
'Cause I see everything in vivid extremes
When I'm awake inside the world of my dreams
Refractive light within a blink of an eye
And painting rainbows 'til I run out of sky
You might also likeI was just a lost boy but now oh how I've been found
Burning through the day light uptight all night turning round
But I used to get high, get high, 'til I come back down
Now I'm gonna stand tall, stand up, stand my ground
My inspiration is my love of the song
My motivation is what moves me along
And if I'm true to me then I know I can never be wrong
'Cause I see everything in vivid extremes
When I'm awake inside the world of my dreams
Refractive light within a blink of an eye
And painting rainbows 'til I run out of sky
I was just a lost boy but now oh how I've been found
Burning through the day light uptight all night turning round
But I used to get high, get high, 'til I come back down
Now I'm gonna stand tall, stand up, stand my ground
