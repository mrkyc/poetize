Be the hangman in my moon
Feel my scar in a burned out car
Breathing in petrol perfume
Put me down in a one horse town
Be the poison in my veins
Break my fall in a washroom stall
When i call you out by name
Wear that phrase like a longing gaze
Be the gum under my shoes
Cut my hair in a kitchen chair
In a kitchen full of booze
Let me live underneath your bridge
Be the cloud covering sun
Take my hand into your command
And ill grab that loaded gun
I'll rise a bonfire burning bright across a dying nation
Two broken windows open to a soul lay bare for taking
Consigned to spend all time alone in quiet desperation
So shine your sign upon me if you believe I'm worth saving
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Five it up to get it tonight
You might also likeHear me out 'til there is no doubt
Be the hawk inside my chest
Give me truth in a pay phone booth
Even if I'll set the best
Take your place in an empty space
Be the means unto my end
Pierce my skin with the safety pin
'Cause i've nothing to defend
I'll rise a bonfire burning bright across a dying nation
Two broken windows open to a soul lay bare for taking
Consigned to spend all time alone in quiet desperation
So shine your sign upon me if you believe I'm worth saving
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
Give it up to get it tonight
