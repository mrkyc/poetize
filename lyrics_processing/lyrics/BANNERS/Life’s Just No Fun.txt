This town is strange love
Without you now
It's like a movie with the sound turned right down
Car chases
Without the wheels on
A world to save but now
Without its hero

Love on your worst days
You made it okay
You made it all make sense

Life's just no fun without you here
The colours run if you're not near
You made the bad days disappear
Life's just no fun without you here
I thought that I might be the one
It's a nice dream but now it's gone
It's just you made the stars appear
Life's just no fun without you here

It's like you changed the weather
You somehow made it better
Raining perfume on my pillow
That I don't wanna wash away
They say the first days are the worst
And after that the planet turns
But if I felt alright I'd lose
This last connection with you

Love on your worst days
You made it okay
You made it all make sense

Life's just no fun without you here
The colours run if you're not near
You made the bad days disappear
Life's just no fun without you here
I thought that I might be the one
It's a nice dream but now it's gone
It's just you made the stars appear
Life's just no fun without you here

Nothing moves me the right way
Since you went down that highway
Can't get warm now your fire's gone
So I sleep with the light on
And my dreams all come untrue
Like a future with out you
I wake up and you're still not here
There's no soul in this party

Life's just no fun without you here
The colours run if you're not near
You made the bad days disappear
Life's just no fun without you here
I thought that I might be the one
It's a nice dream but now it's gone
It's just you made the stars appear
Life's just no fun without you here
Without you
Without you, without you
Life's just no fun without you here
Without you
Without you, without you
