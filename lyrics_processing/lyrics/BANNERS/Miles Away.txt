Ever feel like there's something missin'
Like you're shouting, but nobody's listenin'?
That you're always left outside lookin' in, lookin' i-i-i-in
'Cause the way that the world keeps spinnin'
How could anyone call this livin'?
When I needed somebody to get me away, then you came

I was stuck and coming undone, Heaven, help me
You're the only one out there that could pick me
Up you make escape seem easy
You're the only heartbeat that could take me

Far away, far away, far away from here
I wanna be miles away, miles away
We could disappear

Now I got your dreams by my side
Let's take the whole world out for a ride
Yeah, we'll leave all the warning signs in the dirt
Leave it all behind
Seems like nothing I couldn't do
There's no desert I can't get through
I got it all if I got you on my mind
Yeah, the truth is

I've been stuck and coming undone, Heaven, help me
You're the only one out there that could pick me
Up you make escape seem easy
You're the only heartbeat that could take me

Far away, far away, far away from here
I wanna be miles away, miles away
We could disappear

And you're always bringing me 'round
When it seems like the whole world's dragging me down
And all the love you're giving me here
Is the reason I feel like somebody now
I feel like somebody now

I was stuck and coming undone, Heaven, help me
You're the only heartbeat that could take me

Far away, far away, far away from here
I wanna be miles away, miles away
We could disappear
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
Mi-mi, mi-miles away
