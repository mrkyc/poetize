I'm a mess sometimes
Who knows it better than I do?
When I lose my mind
Nothing finds like you do

You pick me up and, pull me out of the dark spaces
You, always know the perfect words to say

I've been high, I've been low
When I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home
And keeps me going
And if I win, or if I lose
I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you
To keep me going
To keep me going (You keep me going)

When I hit the wall
You're there right beside me
When the curtain falls
And all I feel is empty

You, pick me up and
Dust me off when I'm, on my knees and
You, always know the perfect words to say

I've been high, I've been low
When I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home
And keeps me going
And if I win, or if I lose
I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you
To keep me going
To keep me going
To keep me going

When the ground just shakes, my bones just ache
And the world stops turning 'round
When I'm giving up, I'm letting go
All the wall start crashing down

I've been high, I've been low
When I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home
And keeps me going
And if I win, or if I lose
I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you
To keep me going
To keep me going (Ohh)
I've been high, I've been low
When I get lost along this road
Oh, you keep me going
If I win, or if I lose
You just keep me going
And if I win, or if I lose
I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you
You just keep me going
Oh, you keep me going
You keep me going
You keep me going
