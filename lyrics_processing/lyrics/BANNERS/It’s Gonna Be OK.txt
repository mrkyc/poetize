Wish I could hear you say goodnight
And kiss you on the forehead
Turn off the lamplight and see you in the morning
Hold you close when you're upset
Sit and watch the sunset
Like we're the only people on earth
So beautiful, we can't find words

And if all the sky is falling
Hold on

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
Sometimes when I'm losing my mind
Somewhere between space and time
I can feel your hand in mine and hear you say
"It's gonna be okay"

There's a feeling that I get staring at the darkness
Even though you couldn't be farther
And everything without you is harder
Take a breath, close my eyes and you are by my side
I know we're looking at the same stars
And we're not gonna fall apart

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
Sometimes when I'm losing my mind
Somewhere between space and time
I can feel your hand in mine and hear you say

"When the night's long
If you keep the light on
I know you're always there to guide me home
And if you just stay strong
And tell me you'll hold on
I know you're always there to guide me home"

And if all the sky is falling
Hold on

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
