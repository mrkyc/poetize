No matter what I do I'm stuck on you
I can't control my hunger for more and more
'Cause all I think about is a way to get through
I can't believe that I can't receive
'Cause this is where I belong
I want it all, and I want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
I want it all and I want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
Ooh yeah
Now I hear a distant drum
From deep down under
Believing it will guide my way to you
Afraid to lose my way along this journey
Afraid to be the one who gonna fail
I can't believe that I can't receive
'Cause this is where I belong

As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
I want it all and I want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
This is what I really needed
My ego is defeated
I came to see my victory
You wish to beat it
This is what I really needed
My ego is defeated
I came to see my victory
You wish to beat it!
I want it all and i want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
I want it all and I want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
I want it all
I want it now
I want it all I want it now
As a matter of fact
You better step back
'Cause I'm here to take everything
