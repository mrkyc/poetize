See a page and I close my eyes
Don't wanna know what you did last night
I must be blind
I did the best that i could do
To be a part of your damn life
Maybe i was not good enough
Maybe your too blind
If you ever knew what i really feel for you
You wouldn't break my heart in two
No
Now its too late
Too bad you never said how much you care
Too bad you not acknowledge i was there
I know
You know
It was there
Now its too late it's the end
Goodbye my friend
Never thought you could be so bold
So many things we left untold
I don't wanna fight no more
For your time
You might also likeWho the hell do you think you are
A master bee or superstar
I don't ever wanna see your page again
Oh oooh
If you ever knew what i really feel for you
You wouldn't break my heart in two
No
Now its too late
Too bad you never said how much you care
Too bad you not acknowledge i was there
I know
You know
It was there
Now its too late it's the end
Goodbye my friend
Oh
Yaaay Yaaay Yaaay Yaaay
Now it's too late it's the end
Goodbye my friend
Sometimes i just think about
Think about
How it would be if you were mine
I dont know what to do
What to do
Be mine
Be mine
Mine
Miiine
Too bad you never said how much you care
Too bad you not acknowledge i was there
I know
You know
It was there
Now it's too late it's the end
Goodbye my friend
Too bad you never said how much you care
Too bad you not acknowledge i was there
I know
You know
It was there
Now it's too late it's the end
Goodbye my friend
