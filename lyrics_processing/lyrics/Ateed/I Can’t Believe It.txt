Even though I know you're a fool
I know I've got to leave you
After all the pain I was going through
I've tried to find I friend in you
Tried to make it up to you
I can't stay 'cause you're driving me insane
I can't believe it
All the things you put me through
Maybe I mean it
When I say I'm over you
I don't need a reason
I've got nothing up to lose
Will you think surprise when I say goodbye
'Cause I'm on my way
Feel good since I left you
I can breathe
Free to do what I want
There's no one trying to control me
Nobody making me bad look
And I can't believe I'm leaving you
There is nothing that you can do
I can't stay 'cause you're driving me insane
I can't believe it
All the things you put me through
Maybe I mean it
When I say I'm over you
I don't need a reason
I've got nothing up to lose
Will you think surprise when I say goodbye
'Cause I'm on my way
Hey
I can't believe it
All the things you put me through
Oh no no no
I can't believe it
Heeeeey
Heeeeey
I don't know
I can't believe it
All the things you put me through
Maybe I mean it
When I say I'm over you
I don't need a reason
I've got nothing up to lose
I can't believe it, no
Things you put me through
Maybe I mean it
Will you be surprised when I say goodbye
'Cause I'm on my way
I can't believe it
All the things you put me through
Maybe I mean it
When I say I'm over you
I don't need a reason
I've got nothing up to lose
Will you be surprised when I say goodbye
'Cause I'm on my way
Will you be surprised when I say goodbye
