Get your ass up.. get your ass up.. get your ass up..
I hear your car keys jinglin, go 'head and crank it up
Spent a thousand on the liquor but tonight it ain't enough
Cause this town is full of drankers and they all hang with us
Grabbed Betty by the arm, told her man, "Stay in touch"
We takin this one all the way from Athens to Virginia
Hit Timmy for a hundred - that's the last one I'mma lend ya
Ol' girl wanna kick it but she not on my agenda
Did I ever love her? Well, not that I remember
Twerk that, work that, Betty where your purse at?
Snatch daddy's credit cards, here take his shirt back
Where the hell my car at, does anybody know?
If it ain't back in five, everybody gotta go
Ah to hell with it, y'all keep that little Honda
I'm waitin on some Beams from this bitch named Yolanda
Y'all lookin all tired shit I'm just wakin up
By the way when you get up out my bed, make it up

 Boy take that shot  I'll take that shot
 Girl hit tonight  I'll hit tonight
 Boy crank this spot  I'll crank this spot
 Girl get me right  I'll get you right
You might also like
Aight, get your ass out my bed I'm through playin
You wanna stay the night - what the hell is you sayin?
I ain't tryin to come across to you as inconsiderate
But momma always said if you don't love it then get rid of it
Besides, I got thirty dogs waitin in the yard
They gotta eat too girl, don't make it hard
I'm kinda difficult to understand at first contact
Offered you a beer, don't be expectin much beyond that
Aww shit, y'all quit, I'm winnin
Drownin in a pool of alcohol and I'm swimmin
You wanna play with me but can't last nine innings
Since you wanna chase, what you like, lime, lemon?
I'll make an open challenge to this whole industry
We can do it with tequila, bourbon gin or Hennessy
Have you butt naked pukin in a purple limousine
I ain't doin shit but drankin do some rappin in between


We lit tonight (ain't we)
She gettin right (ain't she)
We ain't gon' stop (is we)
Until we all (dizzy)
I walked in like a star and I ain't even with Timmy
Stop bein hard, baby girl I give plenty
I seem like a prick cause I got some shit in me
Grab your long johns, boy it's gettin a bit windy
You really wanna know the secret to this white pimpin?
Though I might love 'em, I don't really like women
New the next day and finally the night ended
Lookin back on it that shit was quite splendid
