Much love when it all goes down
Toast up when it all goes down
Clear eyes when it all goes down
Full heart when it all goes down
I ain't plant my flag, give it all I have
Man, how the hell y'all gon' sound?
No fake shit, whatever y'all on now
Be on it when it all goes down, down, down

I remember bein' tired of livin' but I still don't wanna die (Die)
Really I just wanna fly (Fly)
Picture me, myself, and I floatin' through the sky
I never even told 'em goodbye (Goodbye)
Good try, good lie, coulda ate the whole pie
Instead I spit it 'bout 59 times (Damn)
Just livin' for the moment and a friend of mine climbs
In the winners circle right beside mine
Young king, young queen just turned 18, what a dumb dream
But I'm livin' walkin' proof you can turn the thing into one thing, only to something
But what seems like so much fuckin'
So it comes a very fucked up scene
A whole life wasted is just obscene
But if it all goes down show me what love means, come clean
You might also like
Much love when it all goes down
Toast up when it all goes down
Clear eyes when it all goes down
Full heart when it all goes down
I ain't plant my flag, give it all I have
Man, how the hell y'all gon' sound?
No fake shit, whatever y'all on now
Be on it when it all goes down, down, down

So it's money every time somebody dies
All the ones who had a grudge be the first ones to cry bitch
I got it from the mud, stand tall on my pride
Keep my kids livin' good, only job I ever applied
If I had to give my last request, don't ever cash a check until it's wrote
And you should live it like you lose it 'cause tomorrow never has to come
Don't be an ass, better pass the love
And never die with knowledge you haven't told
'Cause somebody in the world wishin' they was in the casket too
And any help could in fact be useful
And that grass ain't greener, keep your ass in school
Don't put me on the t-shirt, you can blast my music
Roll the reefer, reminisce and cool it
Leave no regrets and always eat the truth
When it all goes down you can see me through this
Much love when it all goes down
Toast up when it all goes down
Clear eyes when it all goes down
Full heart when it all goes down
I ain't plant my flag, give it all I have
Man, how the hell y'all gon' sound?
No fake shit, whatever y'all on now
Be on it when it all goes down, down, down

Where I started at
How could I forget to pray every day?
I'm so confident
And that's not a compliment
I'm just scared of fallin' back (Back)
Where the places and playmates await
Because I done ran a lap
And I don't want no more of that
But if you leave a message I'll call you back
When my old self re-awakes
If I can hold the phone without catchin' shakes
And my mind hand-eye coordinates and we can chat
Clear the air about way back (Way back)
Handshake and hug the way brothers should
Closure comes without payback (Payback)
Much love when it all goes down
Toast up when it all goes down
Clear eyes when it all goes down
Full heart when it all goes down
I ain't plant my flag, give it all I have
Man, how the hell y'all gon' sound?
No fake shit, whatever y'all on now
