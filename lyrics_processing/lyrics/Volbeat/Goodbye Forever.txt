Did you say the thing you wanted?
Have you ever felt in love?
A moment where no problems would ever get you down
Free as an eagle but only for a day
Yeah, listen

The final is a warning, wake up before you go
There'll be no second chances, that day you're on your own
Let out the feelings, tomorrow may not come

All alone in the dark
Move the curtains for once
See the light life has brought, or goodbye forever
Take the arms that embrace
No more being afraid
Feel the sun on your face, or goodbye forever

Were you listening to the evening?
Have you ever felt the dawn?
When everything around you told stories from the world
Dear mother nature speaks louder than you know
Woah, listen

The final is a warning, wake up before you go
There'll be no second chances, that day you're on your own
Let out the feelings, tomorrow may not come

All alone in the dark
Move the curtains for once
See the light life has brought, or goodbye forever
Take the arms that embrace
No more being afraid
Feel the sun on your face, or goodbye forever

We are the birth
We are the end
We are the souls
We have a name
We are the rising and fallen ones
We are the spirit, forever more

We are the birth

We have a name
We are the rising and fallen ones
We are the spirit, forever more
All alone in the dark
Move the curtains for once
See the light life has brought, or goodbye forever
Take the arms that embrace
No more being afraid
Feel the sun on your face, or goodbye forever

All alone in the dark
Move the curtains for once
See the light life has brought, or goodbye forever
Take the arms that embrace
No more being afraid
