Remember those days
Your emotions went wild
You were so young
Well, nothing much has changed
We got older and learned how to get along

Remember those nights
Remember those days
I don't know where I've been
Just move along

I'm under the influence
I'm overpowered
There's really nothing I can do anymore
I'm a fan of yours

Never met you before
But when I saw you the first time, I knew you were
I knew you were the one I've been waiting for all my life
You didn't know

Remember those nights
Remember those days
I don't know where I've been
Just move along
You might also like
I'm under the influence
I'm overpowered
There's really nothing I can do anymore
I'm a fan of yours
I'm under the influence
I'm overpowered
There's really nothing I can say anymore
I'm a fan of yours

Hanging on the emotions
Even before we knew what it was
I didn't know that you felt the same
But you said I was the one
Was the one

I'm under the influence
I'm overpowered
There's really nothing I can do anymore
I'm a fan of yours
I'm under the influence
I'm overpowered
There's really nothing I can say anymore
I'm a fan of yours
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone
It's not all gone

I'm under the influence
(It's not all gone, it's not all gone)
I'm overpowered
(It's not all gone)
I'm under the influence
(It's not all gone, it's not all gone)
I'm overpowered
(It's not all gone)
I'm under the influence
(It's not all gone, it's not all gone)
I'm overpowered
(It's not all gone)
There's really nothing left to say anymore
