The smell is rotten, I'm out in the free
The trees are squeaking and the wolves are unleashed
I got a hole in my head, and the cramps are so tight
I'm decomposing in a sack of bones, I'm on fire
And I go, ooh
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)

Hell's fire, now cut me some slack
Is that the only thing you got? 'Cause I'm back
My body might be deformed, the flesh is gone and has been torn
I'm breathing down your motherfucker's neck, I'm howling like a wolf and I go

I don't think I'm out here alone
I see the shadows walking along

I am the deceiver of time
More or less I'm controlling your mind
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones
The sky is falling, the dark is so cold
The grim reaper is walking us home
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones
You might also like
A sorry sack of bones
A sorry sack of bones
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)
And I go, ooh
(A sorry sack of bones)

Ding dong baby, I'm home, how you been?
I might be wasted but I'm howling again
Let's never waste any time, we're going out Friday night
Singing biba ba-luba and the drinks are on fire

I don't think I'm out here alone
I see the shadows walking along

I am the deceiver of time
More or less I'm controlling your mind
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones
The sky is falling, the dark is so cold
The grim reaper is walking us home
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones
A sorry sack of bones
A sorry sack of bones
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)

I don't think I'm out here alone
I see the shadows walking along

I am the deceiver of time
More or less I'm controlling your mind
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones
The sky is falling, the dark is so cold
The grim reaper is walking us home
I have the feeling of being in a sorry sack of bones

A sorry sack of bones
A sorry sack of bones
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)
And I go, ooh
(A sorry sack of bones)
(A sorry sack of bones)
And I go, ooh
