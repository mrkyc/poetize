It's 7:02, breaking all the rules
Dance the boogie-woogie and let's fire up the booze
'Cause we die to live, we die to live
We know about the law, but that won't get us far
When the rattlesnake is shaking and the gun is on the floor
'Cause we die to live, we die to live

We can go all night 'til the morning light
And the mayor will be there too
Call the cops who got all the drugs
And then send them home by noon
Let it burn, let it burn
Oh, well, let it burn, let it burn

Rebellious attitude, your mama's got it too
We can't do nothing right when wrong is what we do
'Cause we die to live, we die to live
We ain't got the time for a Christian lullaby
When off goes the alarm and the house is going down
We die to live, we die to live

We can go all night 'til the morning light
And the mayor will be there too
Call the cops who got all the drugs
And then send them home by noon
Let it burn, let it burn
Oh, well, let it burn, let it burn
You might also like
Let it burn
Oh, let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn
Oh, let it burn, let it burn

It's 7:02, breaking all the rules
Dance the boogie-woogie and let's fire up the booze
'Cause we die to live, we die to live
We know about the law, but that won't get us far
When the rattlesnake is shaking and the gun is on the floor
We die to live

We can go all night 'til the morning light
And the mayor will be there too
Call the cops who got all the drugs
And then send them home by noon
Let it burn, let it burn
Oh, well, let it burn, let it burn

Let it burn
Oh, let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn
