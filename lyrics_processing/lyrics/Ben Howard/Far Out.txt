Tell me is there vacancy
In the house beyond the green
I'm in the fountain of asking
I'm asking

Always a diamond to make
Everybody smiling on the take
Everybody wheeling around
Just to make the sun come down
Everybody knows a rain

We're together all as one
If we don't act now
It'll be tomorrow"
Well, I've seen this show before
So I left and closed the door
When I walk into the nearest forest clearing
There was nothing there to see
Just a boy beyond the trees
Picking psilocybin

Far out

Tell me is there vacancy
Out in the house beyond the trees
