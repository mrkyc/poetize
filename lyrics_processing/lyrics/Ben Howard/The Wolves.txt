Falling from high places
Falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that there's nowhere to go
Watching from both sides these
Clock towers burning up
I lost my time here
I lost my patience with it all, hmm

We lost faith in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
(Oh, hiding lately, hiding from the news)
Because we've been fighting lately
Ah, we've been fighting with the wolves
(Oh, fighting lately, fighting with the wolves)
Ooh, with the wolves
Ooh, with the wolves

Oh, falling from high places
Falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that we're so far from home
Watching from both sides these
Towers been tumbling down
I lost my mind here
I lost my patience with the Lord
Oh, with the Lord

And we lost faith in the arms of love
Oh love, love, love, no

Oh, where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
(Oh, hiding lately, hiding from the news)
Ah, 'cause we've been fighting lately
Ah, we've been fighting with the wolves
