There is no rush when you don't belong
Turns out we don't all
Fight like dogs in the end
Most of us want to roll out
Roll under the grass
You are limbless, cartoon
No bridge in your song
Spirulina won't cure my heartbreak
I was a dreamer when I learned to take
In between her and the fireplace
There are factors that conditioned me
Something in the canopy, clearly

And the blank ones
Cartwheel out of the furnace
The mould never cracked you see
The girls in St Denis
Still sleep on their backs
Understood a fact
When you spoke in all your marvelous ideologies
The world is always at ease
At ease
At ease
Don't you see

And the deaths on the highways
From drinking at casinos
Feel so natural
Every day a dice roll
Every way you gamble
Where is something I can handle?
And the world void of Petrov, our savior
We are taught to savour
Everyone else's failures
Endlessly

Even the greatest
The very very greatest
Gave up, tapped out
Told all you fuckers to lie down
Yet still you found cathedrals of dissent
Where does the robber go, where does the robber go to repent?
Tell me

'Till there you were
You wouldn't buy a round
For your best friend
See, it's trickled down
On you I don't depend
There you go then, bye
Another end, bye
Infinitum, bye
There you go then, bye
With such a heavy sound
There is no rush when you don't belong
Turns out we don't all fight like dogs in the end
Most of us want to roll out
Roll under the grass
You're a limbless cartoon
No bridge in your song

Make me wonder again
Or make me learn to pretend
Make me wonder again
Or make me learn to pretend
Make me wonder again
