If you'll only look and see I know you will agree
That the taxes on the farmer feeds us all

The farmer is the man, the farmer is the man
He buys on a credit until fall
Then they take him by the hand
And they lead him from the land
And the merchant he's the man who gets it all

While the woman uses snuff, and they never get enough
But the farmer is the man that feeds them all
While the farmer's black and dirty
But he works like a turkey
Got good clothes a-hanging in the hall
If you'll only look and see I'm sure you will agree
That the taxes on the farmer feeds us all

The farmer is the man, the farmer is the man
He buys on a credit until fall
Then they take him by the hand
And they lead him through the land
And the merchant is the man that gets it all
You might also like
While the judge is on the bench
He will scratch his head and wink
But the farmer is the man that feeds them all
But the lawyer I'll declare
Will tell a lie and swear
But the farmer is the man that feeds them all

The farmer is the man, farmer is the man
He buys on a credit until fall
Then they take him by the hand
And they lead him through the land
And the merchant he's the man who gets it all
If you'll only look and see I know you will agree
That the taxes on the farmer feeds them all

While the doctor hangs around
And the blacksmith works his iron
But the farmer is the man that feeds them all
And the preacher and the cook
They'll go fishing on the brook
But the farmer is the man that feeds them all
If you'll only look and see I know you will agree
That the taxes on the farmer feeds us all
The farmer is the man, the farmer is the man
He buys on a credit until fall
Then they take him by the hand
And they lead him through the land
