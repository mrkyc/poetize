But now prices nearly puts a man to sleep
When we pay our grocery bill
We just feel like makin' our will
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
I remember when dry goods were cheap as dirt
We could take two bits and buy a dandy shirt
Now we pay three bucks or more
Maybe get a shirt that another man wore
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Well, I used to trade with a man by the name of Gray
Flour was fifty cents for a twenty four pound bag
Now it's a dollar and a half beside
Just like a skinnin' off a flea for the hide
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Oh, the schools we have today ain't worth a cent
But they see to it that every child is sent
If we don't send everyday
We have a heavy fine to pay
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Prohibition's good if 'tis conducted right
There's no sense in shootin' a man 'til he shows flight
Officers kill without a cause
Then complain about funny laws
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Taxed and schooled and preached to death
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Oh, it's time for every man to be awake
We pay fifty cents a pound when we ask for steak
When we get our package home
A little wad of paper with gristle and a bone
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Well, the doctor comes around with a face all bright
And he says in a little while you'll be all right
All he gives is a humbug pill
A dose of dope and a great big bill
