Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love
I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours
I never knew love, I never knew hurt
I never cried tears, I never felt heartache
Never felt my soul was connected to another
Never felt any of this before you came
Mistakes we both made
The times that life can take
It's all over now, we won't get it back
But still I know in my heart that
Baby
Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love
You might also likeI'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours
I remember what you wore, remember what you said
Remember the expressions on your face
I never forgot one thing you said to me
Everything we were is in my memory
Mistakes we both made
The hurt, the love, the pain
It's all over now, we can't get it back
But still I choose to believe that
Baby, baby
Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love
I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours
Our love is not for this world
And no design of this world
And there's another place for it
Somewhere
Our love is not for this world
And no design of this world
And there's another place for it
Somewhere
Somewhere there's a place for us
Somewhere there's a place for us
Somewhere
There's another place for us somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
(Our love is not for this world)
Somewhere, somewhere
(And no design of this world)
Baby, there's another place for us somewhere
(And there's another place for this somewhere)
I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
