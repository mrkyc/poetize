Remember wanting me so much
I used to tingle from your touch
And I'd wait for you to come home
You're sittin' right beside the phone
And there was nothin' else but you
And who could separate us two
I'll never know when we got lost
But now I'm counting up the calls

I wish we could go back
(To love less complicated, I)
Wish we could go back
(Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no)
Just tell me you miss that
(That new love, crazy love)
'Cause I wanna go back
(I know it's possible, tell me you feel it, too)

What I wouldn't do to rekindle our romance
(Oh, what I wouldn't do, not many get a second chance, oh no, no)
Come on, baby, 'cause our love hasn't yet died
(Ooh, it hasn't died, we gotta give love one more try)
You might also like
We barely talk, we barely smile
No hint of what we used to be
No courtesy and no romance
Not too much left of you and me
But it's not to late, I believe
But baby we can get it back
'Cause life's too short for us to let
What we had die and just forget

I wish we could go back
(To love less complicated, I)
Wish we could go back
(Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no)
Just tell me you miss that
(That new love, crazy love)
'Cause I wanna go back
(I know it's possible, tell me you feel it, too)

Let's go back
(I know it's possible, oh, what I wouldn't do)
Let's go back
(I know it's possible, don't you wanna go back, baby?)
Let's go back
(I know it's possible, oh, what I wouldn't do)
Let's go back (Go back, go back to the way we used to be)
I wish we could go back
(To love less complicated, I)
Wish we could go back
(Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no)
Just tell me you miss that
(That new love, crazy love)
'Cause I wanna go back
(I know it's possible, tell me you feel it, too)

What I wouldn't do to rekindle our romance
(Oh, what I wouldn't do, do-do, do-do)
Come on, baby, 'cause our love hasn't yet died
(Ooh, baby, I know it's possible, tell me you feel it, too)

I wish we could go back
(To love less complicated, I)
Wish we could go back
(Ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it, no)
Just tell me you miss that
(That new love, crazy love)
'Cause I wanna go back
