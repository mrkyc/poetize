Just like you're into me
No way we can lose
It's how we're meant to be
Lover and a best friend
I dig your energy
You're my centerpiece
Us together feels complete
My family
You treat them like your own
And I'm gone, I'm so gone
Can't find my way back home
Not that I need to go
I feel so comfortable
You give that extra
That I need to grow
And I'm so, so, so
So far gone, so far gone, ohh, ohh
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
You might also likeYeah, he got me
(He got me)
Yes, he got me
(Yes, he got me)
Definitely, I'm so far gone
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Gone, gone, oh, yeah
Gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Gone, gone, oh, yeah
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone
I'm in a different space
A permanent vacation
Physically, you might seen it
We don't have to change
Like I'm on cloud nine
In a better place
You put a smile on mine
Every time I see your face
We let it flow and
Didn't rush into anything
We let it grow and watched it
Blossom into many things
Baby, I just wonder
How you do it like that
'Cause you make it so easy
Just to love you right back
And I'm so, so, so
So far gone, so far gone, ohh, ohh
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah, he got me
(He got me)
Yes, he got me
(Yes, he got me)
Definitely, I'm so far gone
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Gone, gone, oh, yeah
I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm, so gone)
Believe I'm gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone, gone, oh, yeah
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone
I'm trapped inside your heart
Without a key, I'm tryin' to be
Baby, I don't want nobody else
Around for me
Gone like a fast lane
Gone like jet plane
Gone like I'm insane
Gone like just like yesterday
I wanna live with you all my life
You got that love, I can fall in twice
So far gone like a punch by Mike
And I'm knocked out cold and the Vegas lights
And I don't wanna wake up 'cause I got it so bad
When you're away, it feel like a break up
If we broke, together we scrape up
If we rich, forever we caked up
I see a life ain't all about
Money, high heals and make up
So I let my guard down
Even when you had your poker face up
And now the camera's can't
Spot us so they mad
So paparazzi that they
Don't need a GPS for that
We're so, yeah, we so
Gone, gone, gone, oh, yeah
(Gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Believe I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)
