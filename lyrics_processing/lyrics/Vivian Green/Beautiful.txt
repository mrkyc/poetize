I've been there, done that (yeah)
I don't want to put all the anger you caused me back on you
Though I know I'd be justified but I'm in another place
I don't want to put any negative vibes into this universe
I've done it enough (oh ooo)
And I don't want to tell who, what, when, where, why and how
Cause who cares
No, nobody cares
But I hope you soon find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I thought I could teach you but you were more afraid
than willing
So when it comes don't push it away
One day you will find it is the greatest gift
And I hope you don't take advantage of it again
Hold her when she wants to be held
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you
Take her to her favorite place
more often than not
Don't take her kindness for weakness
'Cause I'm sure she'll love you alot
Support her in all that she does
Don't tear her down, lift her up
'Cause that is the worst thing you can do to someone you love
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful
I used to think that I could not bear you to be with anyone but me
But I been there, done that (yeah)
And since then I have come to think silly of that whole mentality
I still want to find love too
No it won't be with you
I wish for everyone to one day find happiness and love
Including you (yeah)
And I don't want to go into details 'cause I've said enough
And its not my intent to hurt you no
But I hope you soon find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I thought I could teach you but you were more afraid
than willing
So when it comes don't push it away
One day you will find it is the greatest gift (gift)
And I hope you don't take advantage of it again
Hold her when she wants to be held
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you
Take her to her favorite place
more often than not
Don't take her kindness for weakness
'Cause I'm sure she'll love you alot
Support her in all that she does
Don't tear her down, lift her up
'Cause that is the worst thing you can do to someone you love
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful
