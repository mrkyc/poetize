Love is a beautiful thing
It's more rare than a diamond ring
So if you find it, try to keep it
Be strong together 'cause you'll need it

Things don't work out all the time
Some of the greatest loves don't stay together
Could be yours and mine
'Cause I was taught never say never
But if we ever went our separate ways
I know I loved enough to last all my days
'Cause this is so right
And now I can't find enough ways to say it, no

I can't say it enough
(Can't say it enough)
There's nothin' like your love
(Ain't nothin' like your love, baby)
I keep tryna find new ways to say I love you, baby
(I love you, I love you, baby)
And nothin' can change it, no, no, no

We could be poor on the street with no food to eat
Nothin' but the warmth of our bodies
We could be miles away for months at a time
The distance wouldn't break us
We could be filthy rich together
I wouldn't love you no better than I do right now
I can't find enough ways to say it, but I love you, baby
You might also like
I can't say it enough
(I can't say it enough)
There's nothin' like your love
(Ain't nothin' like your love, baby)
I keep tryna find new ways to say I love you, baby
(I need a new way, I love you, baby)
And nothin' can change it, no, no, no
(I just love you)

'Cause love is a beautiful thing
(It's a beautiful thing more rare than)
It's more rare than a diamond ring
(And if you find it, try to)
So if you find it, try to keep it
(Be strong 'cause you will need it)
Be strong together 'cause you'll need it
(When times get rough)
When times get rough you can't give up
'Cause nothing's more important than your love
(Your love) Your love
(Oh, I can't say it enough to you, baby, I...)

I can't say it enough
(I can't say it enough, baby)
There's nothin' like your love
(Ain't nothin', never been like, never will be)
I keep tryna find new ways to say I love you, baby
(See, I love you, baby)
And nothin' can change it, no, no, no
(And nothin' can never ever change that)
I can't say it enough
(Can't say it, can't say it, can't say it enough to you, to you)
There's nothin' like your love
(Nothin' like your love)
I keep tryna find new ways to say I love you, baby
(Find a new way to say I love you, baby)
And nothin' can change it, no, no, no
(No, no)
I can't say it enough
(No, no)
I can't say it enough
I can't say it enough
