Hey, ooh ooh
Ooh yeah, hey

Called me screamin'
Tellin' me you're leaving
You can't take it no more
But that's so crazy
'Cause it's me who's fed up
You've been messin' up
I've been sittin' and waitin'
But now I'm goin' on
You pushed me over and over again
Don't know how to talk to me
Don't know how to treat me
But you're twisted in your head
Somehow you reversed it

I'm mad at you (And you say)
I'm mad at you
Mad is what you say I make you, baby (Ooh)
You ain't seen (Ain't seen) mad, baby
Until you've seen what you created in me, oh oh
You might also like
Many years gone by
My life gone with them
Thinkin' you changed
But I don't know why
Givin' everything, gettin' nothin'
But your coldness, boldness
Total disregard for me and my feelings
Don't have to deal with it
Lookin' at you makes me sick, ooh ooh
You treat me so nasty
The thought of you touchin' me
It makes me wanna vomit, baby
But somehow you reversed it on me

I'm mad at you (And you say)
I'm mad at you
Mad is what you say I make you, baby
(Say I make you, baby)
You ain't seen mad, baby
Until you've seen what you created in me, oh oh
I'm mad at you (And you say)
I'm mad at you (You say)
Mad is what you say I make you, baby (Ooh)
You ain't seen (Ain't seen) mad, baby
Until you've seen what you created in me, oh oh
Done nothin' but taken advantage of me
Mistaken my niceness for someone weak
And now you tellin' me you gon' leave
Well, after all you've done to me
That would be the nicest thing
You called me screamin' tellin' me you're leaving
You can't take it no more
But that's so crazy
'Cause it's me who's taken all I can take
I've crossed over from love to hate

I'm mad at you
I'm mad at you
Mad is what you say I make you, baby
(Say I make you, baby)
You ain't seen (You ain't seen) mad, baby
Until you've seen what you created in me, oh oh
I'm mad at you (And you say)
I'm mad at you (You say)
Mad is what you say I make you, baby
(Say I make you, baby)
You ain't seen (You ain't seen) mad, baby
Until you've seen what you created in me, oh oh
