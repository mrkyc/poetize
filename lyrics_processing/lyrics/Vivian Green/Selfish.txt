Sorry but I can't help it
Gotta do this for me
Please don't beg and plead
(Repeat 2X)
You don't understand it
Just can't comprehend how I can just get up and leave
You think it's gonna get better
Nothing lasts forever
Open up your eyes and see
That I'm just somewhere else
Don't need nobody to validate me, I'm good
I wanna do just what I want
Whatever that may be
I'm solely focused on me
(Chorus)
You see, what I'm going through
Might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I'll like it
You see want I'm going through
Might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I'll like it, I do
You might also likeYou've got many folks who love you
No, you don't need me your gonna be all right
I'm always here for you
Can do what we use to do
But soon someone will come along
As for me I just wanna be free to
Live life to the fullest extent
I've played my role and this chapter has closed
Now cause for new auditions
(Chorus)
(Repeat 2X)
I do(do), I do(do), I do(do), I do(do)
I do(do), I do(do), I do(do), I do(do)
I'm always (lovin too much)
And I'm always (learnin too much)
And I'm always (givin too much)
Givin too much of me
And I'm not (punishin you)
Or blaming you (blaming you)
What I gotta do (I gotta do)
For me
It's what I want (it's what I want)
It's what I need
Just let me be
I'm sorry if you think this is selfish
You see what I'm going through
Might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I like it, I do
What I'm going through
Might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I like it
(Repeat 4X)
Yes I do, Yes I do
This might seem selfish
I do, I do I like it
This might seem selfish
You see want I'm going through
