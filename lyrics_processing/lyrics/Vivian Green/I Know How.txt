Put your hand up, put your hand up
Put your hands up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air if you know you got a good one
I got a good one, yeah
I got a good one, yeah, yeah
So put your hands in the air if you know you got a good one

Where do you come from, baby?
What are you doin' with me?
Have I gone through hard times
So I can see you at the end of it all?
And I know I almost lost it
I even gave up on it
But now I got it and I swear I'm only givin' my all

All that it takes, yes, I'm willin'
Let's go for the long haul
No matter how the chips may fall
We gotta build it up, make it unbreakable, yeah
'Cause the record shows and I know
That most people, baby, don't know how to stay in love

I know how to break up
I know how to leave someone
But baby, I wanna learn how to stay
I know how to say goodbye
When the waters run dry
So, baby, baby, hold it down
'Cause I wanna stick around
You might also like
You make me wanna, baby
Cry like I never ever
Boy, you know I'm in this
So focused and committed to want it
I know I want somethin' you know
Not what I'm not used to 'cause I
I can fake it, be complacent
But it won't be long 'til I'm gone, no

And all that it takes, yes, I'm willin'
Let's go for the long haul
No matter how the chips may fall
We gotta build it up, make it unbreakable, yeah
'Cause the record shows and I know
That most people, baby, don't know how to stay in love

I know how to break up
I know how to leave someone
But baby, I wanna learn how to stay
And I know how to say goodbye
When the waters run dry
So, baby, baby, hold it down
'Cause I wanna stick around
See we're here today or gone tomorrow
Fallin' in love, time's gettin' rough
We're breakin' up, here comes the rebound
(Besides the pain just falls around)
But we're here today, we'll be here tomorrow
We fell in love, times will get rough
No, I don't wanna say goodbye and walk away
I wanna change and learn how to stay

I know how to break up
I don't wanna walk away
I know how to leave someone
No, I wanna learn how to stay
I know how to say goodbye
Say goodbye
When the waters run dry
When they run dry
Hold me down, hold me down, baby
I know how to break up
Break up
I know how to leave someone
Leave someone
But, baby, I wanna learn how to stay
I know how to say goodbye
When the waters run dry
When they run dry, when they run dry
Baby, hold me down
