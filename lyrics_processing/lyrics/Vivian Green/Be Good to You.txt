I'll never hurt you, oh
And you will never shed a tear for me
I know you're tired of being in and out of love
With nothing to show and nowhere to go, but
Back to the same one, only with a different face
But now you are in a different place
And if my words don't comfort you, time will surely prove
That I'll do just what I say

I'll only be good to you (Only be good to you)
Be like I should to you (I'll be like I should to you)
Be everything to you (Everything)
Bring you nothing but the good stuff
I'll give you good love (Baby)
I'll only be good to you (I'll, I'll only be good to you)
Be like I should to you (Be like I should, be like I should)
Be everything to you, said I'll be good to you
Only be good to you (Good to you, oh)

You say it's too good to be, too good
And I agree, that's the way it seems
Except for my instinct
It's telling me it's something else
It's not a rebound, a playground
But something that's real (Ooh)
I've got so much to give you
So don't you dare hesitate to receive it
If my words don't comfort you, time will surely prove
That I'll do what I say and more
You might also like
I'll only be good to you (Only be good to you)
Be like I should to you (I'll be like I should to you)
Be everything to you (Everything to you)
Bring you nothing but the good stuff (Good, good)
I'll give you good love (Good love, baby)
I'll only be good to you (I'll, I'll only be good to you, oh)
Be like I should to you (Be like I should to you)
Be everything to you, said I'll be good to you (Oh)
Only be good to you

Oh
Consistency, loyalty, longevity
Unselfishness, all that is good
My heart give to you (Oh, oh, oh, ooh)
I'll always be there when you fall, never doubt my heart at all
It's you that I've chosen, you are my focus
And this ain't no phony disguise
You can see if you look down deep
There'll be nothing but good love, good love coming from me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'll only be good to you (Only be good to you, baby)
Be like I should to you (I'll be like I only should to you)
Be everything to you (Everything to you)
Bring you nothing but the good stuff (Good stuff)
I'll give you good love (Good love, good love)
I'll only be good to you (I'll only be good to you, baby)
Be like I should to you (Be like I should, like I should)
Be everything to you, said I'll be good to you (I'll prove it to you, I'm telling you)
Only be good to you (I'm gonna be good to you, oh)
I'll only be good to you (Ooh)
Be like I should to you (I'm gonna be like I should to you, baby)
Be everything to you
Bring you nothing but the good stuff (You, baby)
I'll give you good love (Ooh)
I'll only be good to you (I'll only be good to you, baby)
Be like I should to you (I'ma gonna be like I should)
Be everything to you, said I'll be good to you (I'm talking to you, I'm telling you)
Only be good to you (I'm gonna be good to you, be good to you)
