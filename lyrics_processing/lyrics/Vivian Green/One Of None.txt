And I don't remember
Lookin' into
Anyone's eyes but yours
I love your face
I love to touch it, hold it
Close to my heart
Right there, yeah
And I love your skin
The texture, complexion
Looks great against mine
I just can't stop touchin' you, touchin' you
And I love your lips
I could kiss them for hours
Upon hours
No, I don't think you understand
That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Or have I been hallucinatin'?
Did I create you in my mind?
Or maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where
You might also likeI don't have all the answers
But tell me what it is I'm missin'
'Cause you can't be that perfect
Ain't nobody that perfect
No, I don't have it all together
But you can't be that perfect
So tell me what it is that I'm missin'
'Cause it's gotta be somethin'
You tell me I'm beautiful
Seems every chance you get
Never a day goes by
Without you sayin' it ten times
You adore me
The way I've always wanted
Someone to adore me
Yes, indeed
And you handle me so gently
Verbally and physically
So attentive, so generous
All the things a man should be
No, I couldn't have designed you
Any better myself
And that is why
Why I don't think you understand
That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Or have I been hallucinatin'?
Did I create you in my mind?
Or maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where
I don't have all the answers
But tell me what it is I'm missin'
'Cause you can't be that perfect
Ain't nobody that perfect
No, I don't have it all together
But you can't be that perfect
So tell me what it is that I'm missin'
'Cause it's gotta be somethin'
That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Have I been hallucinatin'?
Did I create you in my mind?
Maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where, oh, yeah
I don't know
You're too perfect, baby
Somethin's gotta be missin'
Somethin's gotta be missin'
