I know I'll see you soon enough
It's love to miss someone so much
It sounds so crazy
But you're my baby
And I know sometimes we gotta go
I gotta hit the road
You gotta work over load
I'm thinking 'bout you
You're thinking 'bout me
I'm half of you
And you're half of me
And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out
But I can't help but think about you
With you and me
I only feel one thing
And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
But you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
You might also likeNo, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
And you ain't even far
How I wish the time could stop so
We wouldn't waste it
Nothing but patience
No more waiting for you to come home to me
Nobody taking the time that belongs to me
And you know that whenever I leave
With you
Is where I wish that I could be
(Yeah, yeah, ohh, ohh, yeah, yeah)
And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out
But I can't help but think about you
With you and me
I only feel one thing
And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
But you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
No, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
And you ain't even far
Ain't trying to complain, baby
I'm wrecking my brain
Got my cell under the pillow
Wanna see your name
Come on
(Yeah, yeah, ohh, ohh, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, oh
And I don't care what nobody says
I would see you everyday if I had my way
(How I miss your face, the way your lips taste)
And you ain't even far
Who would've thought it would be so hard?
And I never thought it would be so hard, ooh
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out
But I can't help but think about it
With you and me
I only feel one thing
And I never thought it would be so hard
(Never, I never knew it would be so hard)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
(Ooh, yeah, and you ain't even far)
No, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
