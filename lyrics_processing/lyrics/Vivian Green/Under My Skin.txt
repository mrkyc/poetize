These days are fulfilling
And I have peace of mind
But everytime I get too high
You do you best to knock me down
But I am not who I was back then
Your trying to hurt me, your really trying
I feel like you owe me
No fighting, fussing, caring to start an argument
Why can't I have my peace?
I understand why they say misery love company
But what you failed to see I hold the power I am in control
And all things must come to an end
Your trying to hurt me, your really trying
Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win
Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'll ever be unhappy again
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
Your trying, but it's all right
Your watch it, wait for your 15 minutes of my day
It make you feel good if you think that you've got into me
Funny cause I don't wish nothing bad on you
Constant drama all you want to put me thorugh
I've made my decision and I'm firm on it
So I don't know why your even trying
You might also likeYour trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win
Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'll ever be unhappy again
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
Your trying, but it's all right
I'm feelin faith
And no you can't take that from me
Your driving all your energies into yourself
Turn it into positivity
I'm feelin faith
And no you can't take that from me
Your driving all your energies into yourself
Turn it into positivity
Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win
Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'll ever be unhappy again
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
