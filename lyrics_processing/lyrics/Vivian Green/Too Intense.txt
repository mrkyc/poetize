I feel just like that
Thirty five thousand feet
I feel just like that
Skydivin', freefallin'
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
One across the first car
I feel just like that
Ferris wheel, at the top
I feel just like that
Carousel spinnin' round
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control
You might also likeGot me thinkin' 'bout the future
I feel just like that
Wanna trust, lose control
I feel just like that
Apprehension out the door
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
Don't care what anybody says
I feel just like that
Let's run away together now
I feel just like that
Whatever you wanna do
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control
Tell me if you feel
(Just like that, that)
On top of the world
(Just like that, that)
Higher
Now I can get higher
Just look at me now
Nothing can bring me down
Butterflies in the sky
I feel just like that
Thirty five thousand feet
I feel just like that
Skydivin', freefallin'
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
One across the first car
I feel just like that
