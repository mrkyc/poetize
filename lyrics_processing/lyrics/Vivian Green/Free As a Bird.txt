Baby, I just gotta be free to be me, oh
Baby, I just gotta be free to be me
Don't wanna turn into another person when you're around me
Somebody else I know I don't really want be
Hold back my tongue when I really wanna scream
Don't try to edit, don't modify me

I'm free as bird, free as my word
You can say what you wanna, I'ma do what I'm gonna
This is the real me, and I just gotta be
Free as a bird in the sky
Free as bird, free as my word
You can say what you wanna, I'ma do what I'm gonna
This is the real me, and I just gotta be
Free as a bird in the sky

Baby, I just got to be free to fly away, oh
Baby, I just got to be free to fly away
Don't want nobody keeping my feet on the ground
My spirit's too alive, I need to move around
So let me go and just let me be
Don't try to edit, don't modify me

Free as a bird in the sky
Free as bird, free as my word
You can say what you wanna, I'ma do what I'm gonna

Ain't nothing like being free
Controlling your own destiny
So take off and fly with me
This life is an odyssey
Free like the wind and the water
Leaves in the autumn falling
That's what I'm calling free
The only way I wanna be
That's how it is so that's how I'll leave, I'm free

Free as bird, free as my word
You can say what you wanna, I'ma do what I'm gonna
This is the real me, and I just gotta be
Free as a bird in the sky
Free as bird, free as my word
You can say what you wanna, I'ma do what I'm gonna
This is the real me, and I just gotta be
