I I'm in in, in love
I I I I'm in in in in love
(Verse 1)
I can't stop thinking 'bout my honey
And he won't quit thinking about me
Now what we got is worth more than money
So much more than what people see
(Bridge)
Could this be love, could I be out of my mind
Or could I be caught up in the thought of spending time
(Chorus)
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Oh could it be?
I I'm in in, in love
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I'm either caught up or I'm in love
Ooh I'm in love
You might also like(Verse 2)
Well I don't know if this is alright
But I miss you so much
When we're far apart
Text and talk keep me up all night
But I can't have you go breaking my heart
(Bridge)
Could this be love, could I be outta my mind
Could I be caught up in the thought of spending time
(Chorus)
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Oh could it be?
I I I I'm in in in, in love
Could it be that I'm in love
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I'm either caught up or I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I I I I'm in in in in love (and I need you like)
(Verse 3)
Strawberries to chocolate
Or money to pockets
Or brackets to lockett's
I need you
You're air for my lungs
Yes you could be the one
Not just casual fun
No I think I'm in love
(Chorus)
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know
I don't know
Or could it be?
I I I I'm in in in in love
Could it be that I'm in love
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Or could I be caught up
I'm in love
Ooh I'm in love
Oh, yeah
I I I I'm in in in in love
I I I I'm in in in in love
