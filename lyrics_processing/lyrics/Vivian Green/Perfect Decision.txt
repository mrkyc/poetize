I'm begging to resist
I want to scream for more
I want to run out the door
The skin against my skin
The skin of my best friend
We never even kissed
So how'd we get to this?
He loves me oh so much
But he never shared his touch
As natural as it feels
I don't want it to kill
Something so flawless
That we both cherish
And as bad as I need it
We could ruin something so perfect
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
You might also likeHe thinks we'll be fine
Maybe create a stronger bond
But then he just a man and clearly I'm all women
When we get up to leave, tell me how it will be
And the next time I see you
Will you feel like a stranger?
Have we entering a danger zone?
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
What if we want more from each other?
What if we become only part-time lovers?
What if our drama-free friendship suffers?
What if everything we've built get lost under the covers?
Will I think it's the same the way you scream out my name
Thought it would ever come to this
Who'd thought I'd like your touch, your kiss
I don't wanna miss this opportunity, maybe we're suppose to be
Stop askin questions, and guessing and keep it going
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
Can give to me just like...No cause we're perfect
Damn it feels so good to...No we're too perfect
Who made to rules, who drew the...Line shouldn't be crossed
What if it's the best thing
What if it's all lost
