Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
I heard you were married
Had a few babies
Put on on a few pounds, that grown man weight
But heard you looked real good
Makin six figures
Well I could of figured you were always ambitious
You went to college, I did my singing thing
Moving around it's hard to stay in touch
But I've missed you so much over the years
Just wanted to give you a hollar say hey
How you doin these days
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
You might also likeYou were so funny, had me in stiches
Now any man I date must make me laugh
You kissed me in places thought I was going to hell
Secrets I would never tell my momma then
But you were so sweet
Didn't take my virginity
But you saw the good in me
Even talked about marrying me
The future we tried to see
We were not suppose to pass
Now everything doesn't last
I wanted to say hey how you doin these days
I guess I don't know you no more
I wonder how much you've change
Would we have the same chemistry?
Could you still make me laugh?
Could we still have a blast?
Are you happy? Have you've done all thing to wanted to?
One thing I want to do is to see you and just chill, just talk and reminisce
It would make me so happy if we could do this
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
(Repeat til end)
How you doin, baby?
