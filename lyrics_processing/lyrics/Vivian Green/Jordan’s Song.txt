All the words in the books
Every possession to lavish you with
You still wouldn't understand
What could ever be enough
How could you comprehend my love?
The only way that you could ever see
Would be to step inside of me
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
If you breathe every air I breathe
If you could think the thoughts I think
The only way for you to ever see
Would be to step inside of me
Wish I could protect you from everything that hurts
I wish you never had to cry a single tear
Wish you could cast every single care upon me
Wish I could change the world, you wouldn't have to see
And if I had all the time in the world
All the words in the books
Every possession to lavish you with
You still wouldn't understand

Every morning at sun rise, I'm inspired
To be stronger than I was the day before so I
Can watch you grow like a flower, I watered
You with love down on my knees everyday
Praying He'll make it all right
