Baby when, when?
Cause I think it's about that time
Turn back, I see you again
Baby when, when?
Cause we have such a good time
Baby you're such a good friend to me
Friend, friend
We need to make it happen
We need to make it happen
When can I see you again?
When can I see you again?
Baby I missed you so much
And I think about you all the time
All the time
Baby you are so far away from me
Just can't shake you off my mind
Just the plane right away
But we weren't every day
We just can't take off whenever we want
Whenever we want
It's beautiful in-between
When we get a chance to see
When we do ain't nothing like it
I'mma grind these haters by

Friend, friend

When can I see you again?
When can I see you again?
At night I close my eyes
And my thoughts, they just run wild
Running wild
And I dream that you're coming soon
You'll be here in just a little while
It's just killing me, this anxiety
It drives me out of my mind
Now I don't care what you're doin'
Who you have to talk to
I need you to make a plan
Get here as soon as you can
Baby when, when?
Cause I think it's about that time
Turn back, I see you again

Cause we have such a good time
Baby you're such a good friend to me
Friend, friend
We need to make it happen

When can I see you again?
When can I see you again?
And we can do anything you like
All I need is for your arms just to hold me tight
And baby nothing even matters, you got all my time for the taking
We'll be making love until we just can't make no more
And let's do it like there's no tomorrow
Cause you're finding me and then I'll need more
Until we do it all again
When can I see you again?
Baby when, when?
Cause I think it's about that time
Turn back, I see you again
Baby when, when?
Cause we have such a good time
Baby you're such a good friend to me
(such a good friend to me and baby I need to see)
Friend, friend
We need to make it happen
We need to make it happen
When can I see you again?
