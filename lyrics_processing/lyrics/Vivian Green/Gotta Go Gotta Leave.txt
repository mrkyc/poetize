I tried to love you like you loved me
Maybe for wrong reasons....maybe
At first it was beautiful
Every girl has a fairytale
But then you wake up and see
It's not all it's cracked up to be
It turned into screaming days and solo nights
Just wasn't right (yeah...)
I didn't really wanna see you
Was happy when you were leaving yeah...
I liked how it felt when I was by myself
And that's the way I wanna be
So please, don't beg and plead
Just let it be
Just let it be...

I gotta go. I gotta leave
So please don't make it hard for me
I've gave enough, I'm tired of love
I gotta let it go... 
Couldn't have given you more
Gave you everything
There wasn't anything that you were denied (yeah)
But you should never give it all...
'cause sometimes there's nothing left
But bitterness and regret
And it just ain't worth it
You might also like'Cause then there's the sudden change
Out of nowhere, it seems
Never know I could be so mean
But that's just how far you pushed me (yeah)
You say it just isn't fair
And you didn't know
You need to take responsibility for your own
'cause you're grown
And you known (yeah)

I gotta go. I gotta leave
So please don't make it hard for me
I've gave enough, I'm tired of love
I gotta let it go... 
Now I take the blame
For trying to stay and work it out
Shoulda left before it got complicated
Shoulda left when there was still some happiness
Yes I take the blame
For having faith in the relationship
I thought it made me complete
But the truth is
I'm complete without it
Yeah-eah
(Gotta Let Go-ooo-ooo-oo)

I gotta go. I gotta leave
So please don't make it hard for me
I've gave enough, I'm tired of love
