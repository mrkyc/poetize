I'm crawling in your heart

Love in moderation was all you ever gave but look inside
'cause the sting of this sensation
It flickers like a drug there in your eyes

And you feel it but you fight it
The more you pull the rope, it tightens
And you follow the moments to the place we've built to find

I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You envy all the others
You're thumbing through the words just to feel the high
And will you ever see it
Well it's me here by your side

Can you feel it but you fight it
The more you pull, the load gets light
And you follow my words, dear
To the place we've built to find
You might also like
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)

When you feel it, don't fight it
We can sail away tonight
And we'll follow the flashes of the love we built to find

I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)
I'm crawling in your heart, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(We've got miles and miles to go)
(You and me a million miles to go)
