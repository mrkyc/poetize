And I'll be there ten days before you call
Give me one thing you know, girl, that makes you cry
And I'll do everything in my power to make it subside
You know I'll be there for you
You know I'll try
When I drift in from your love, babe
You'll be my inward tide
I, I ain't felt the same
Since I saw your face beneath the wind on Washington lane
Your voice, it echoes off the walls
Travels down these halls, it's led me back to you
You know I'll be there for you
You know I'll try
When I drift in from your love, babe
You'll be my inward tide
You know I'll be there for you
You know I'll try
When I drift in from your love, babe
You'll be my inward tide
Caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
I'm caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
And it's all the same, it's all the same
You might also likeI'll sell the seven seas and get down on my knees
I'll sing this symphony just to bring you back to me
I'll sell the seven seas and get down on my knees
I'll sing this symphony, oh
You know I'll be there for you
You know I'll try
When I drift in from your love, babe
You'll be my inward tide
You know I'll be there for you
You know I'll try
When I drift in from your love, babe
You'll be my inward tide, oh
Caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
It's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
And it's all the same, it's all the same
Caught in the way that it was
