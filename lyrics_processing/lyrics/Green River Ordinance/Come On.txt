Everywhere I look I see your smilin' face
Every song I sing, I sing in hopes you're listening
When the tables turned I learned from my mistakes
We're only human here after all, oh, aren't we all?

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye
Don't leave me here, no not tonight
Don't walk away like any other time

Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right
It's been too long to let go now
Hear me out
Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right
Said I won't be here when the morning comes

Even with your eyes closed do you hear my voice?
Carrying the weight of all we loved and left behind
Love so unpredictable have we been blind?
We're only human here after all, oh, aren't we all?
You might also like
Don't walk away, don't say good bye
Don't leave me here, no not tonight
Don't walk away like any other time

Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right
It's been too long to let go now
Hear me out
Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right
Said I won't be here when the morning comes no

I just wanna be the hand you hold when you're cryin'
I just wanna be the voice that tells you it'll be alright and
When your world is coming down
And your hopes are nowhere to be found
Well I'll be here, well I'll be here, well I'll be here
For ya

Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right I said
It's been too long to let go now
Hear me out
Come on, come on
If you wanna make it right we can make it right I said
It's been too long to let go now
