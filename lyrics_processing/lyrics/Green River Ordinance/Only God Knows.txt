Standing in the crossfire
Shaking but I'm not afraid
Cause I got a truth they cannot take
I know that he's a liar
Whispering I'm not okay
Words may wear me down
But I won't break

Gonna keep my eyes on heaven
Till I hear those gates swing open wide
Gonna take the strength of Jesus
To get me through this lonely fight
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Only God knows where I'm going
Only God knows where I'm going now

It don't come easily
I know I got a fight in front of me
Like Daniel in the lion's den
You knock me down, I'm gonna rise again
Not sure where it's leading me
But I know it's where I need to be
You might also like
Gonna keep my eyes on heaven
Till I hear those gates swing open wide
Gonna take the strength of Jesus
To get me through this lonely fight
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Only God knows where I'm going
Only God knows where I'm going now

And I know I'm walking blind
But I'm reaching for your light
Father, raise the dead in me
Help me make it through the night
Walls crash around me
But I'm still alive

Gonna keep my eyes on heaven
Gonna keep my eyes on heaven
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down

Gonna keep my eyes on heaven
Till I hear those gates swing open wide
Gonna take the strength of Jesus
To get me through this lonely fight
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Ain't no devil gonna hold me down
Cause only God knows where I'm going
