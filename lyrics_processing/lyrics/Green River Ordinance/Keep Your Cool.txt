I don't know where I put myself
I must be lost or hiding
Cause the man staring back at me
Have trouble recognizing
Keep your cool boy, keep your cool

Yeah, if you see me lately, oh, I apologize
Say if you don't bend, you're breaking
That's a mighty fine lie
I've been acting out like a damn fool
Like a boy who can't find his cool

Push comes to shove, blood hits the dust
Don't stop spinning once you can't back up
Get your head out the clouds, feet on the ground
Pride don't mean you gotta be too proud
Remember, whatever you do boy
Keep your cool boy, keep your cool

In all these days of power, man
I'm sure feeling weak
Even in these iron footsteps
This mountain's much too steep
Keep your cool boy, keep your cool
You might also like
Push comes to shove, blood hits the dust
Don't stop spinning once you can't back up
Get your head out the clouds, feet on the ground
Pride don't mean you gotta be too proud
Remember, whatever you do boy
Keep your cool boy, keep your cool, yeah
What you do boy, keep your cool
Remember, whatever you do

Push comes to shove, blood hits the dust
Don't stop spinning once you can't back up
Get your head out the clouds, feet on the ground
Pride don't mean you gotta be too proud
When push comes to shove, and blood hits the dust
Don't stop tripping on
Remember, whatever you do boy
Keep your cool boy, keep your cool

Life's too short to let it hold you down
Gotta break before you know how to bend
Life's too short to let it hold you down
Gotta lose before you learn how to win
Life's too short to let it hold you down
Gotta break before you know how to bend
Life's too short to let it hold you down
Gotta lose before you learn how to win

Life's too short to let it hold you down
Gotta break before you know how to bend
Life's too short to let it hold you down
