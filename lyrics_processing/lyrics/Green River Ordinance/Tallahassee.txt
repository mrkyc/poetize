Yeah I'm going back to Tallahassee
Where the Wild wind lays besides me
And I'm leaving on Sunday morning
Left my heart in Tallahassee
Come on take me home

Stood there on the goodbye steps
Looking for a dice to roll, with the world strap to his back
Oh man, that's a heavy load
A story that's worth talking bout, ain't all busted folds
It's a dream he must decide, to lock it up or let it Go

Said I'm going back to Tallahassee
Where the wild wind lays besides me
Said I'm leaving on Sunday morning
Left my heart in Tallahassee
Come on take me home

He held that sunshine in his mouth like a long-lost promised land
Where the morning's sweet like Clementines
And the night's like an old brass band
Like a river he was rolling, got the ticket in his hand
Now a dreamer must decide, when to fly or when to land
You might also like
Said I'm going back to Tallahassee
Where the wild wind lays besides me
Said I'm leaving on Sunday morning
Left my heart in Tallahassee
Come on take me home
Come on take me home

If the roof is on fire, baby let it burn
If the lid is gonna rise, I won't be concern
No I won't, no I won't
If the devil's gonna come, go and tell him come
And the Skies open wide, and I was born to run
So I'm gonna run

Said I'm going back to Tallahassee
Where the wild wind lays besides me
Said I'm leaving on Sunday morning
Left my heart in Tallahassee

Now am going home (lays beside me)
No there ain't no coming back
(Said I'm leaving on Sunday morning)
(Left my heart in Tallahassee)
(Where the wild wind lays besides me)
(Said I'm leaving on Sunday morning)
