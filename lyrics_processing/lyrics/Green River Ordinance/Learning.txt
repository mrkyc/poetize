If I could be just what you need
Maybe we'd be better off
Different lives and different dreams
Calling out from underneath
Hey, I'll be alright, oh, oh I

If I could turn this car around
Only drive into the flames
All the things that we've burned down
Wonder which one will remain

Hey, Please take your time
Oh, oh, I, just do this for me

Let me be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'd give up everything to show you
To show you there's still time
I could be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'm still learning how to love you
You are the only one that's worth the fight
You might also like
I wish you'd learn to let this go
Lay your troubles down on me
Give me one more chance to show
I'll be all you'll ever need

Hey, Please take your time
Oh, oh, I, just do this for me

Let me be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'd give up everything to show you
To show you there's still time
I could be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'm still learning how to love you
You are the only one that's worth the fight

Don't hold your heart too long
You'll find yourself alone
You've got time, we've got time
Let me be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'd give up everything to show you
To show you there's still time
I could be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
I'm still learning how to love you
I'm still learning how to love you

Let me be the one you run to
I could be the one you run to, no
Let me be the one you run to
For the rest of your life
Still learning how to love you
