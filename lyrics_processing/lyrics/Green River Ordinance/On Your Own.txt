Watchin' the time go, the second hand is movin' to fast
Who ever thought that it ever really ever would last
And if your conscience weighs a little heavy tonight
Maybe you'll find it, maybe you'll find

Nobody told you that nothin' plays out like it seems
Twenty years now runnin' scared of all of your dreams
Is it everything you thought it would be?

When you come back, I'll be alright

On your own again, back to where it all began
The phone don't ring and the tears they fall
But you carry on and on and on

Past is past, you never really gave it a shot
To survive with your one last shot in the dark
And if your conscience weighs a little heavy tonight
Maybe you'll find that
Empty boxes on the stairs
Remind you that there's no one there
Is it everything you thought it would be?
You'll see
You might also like
When you come back, I'll be alright

On your own again, back to where it all began
The phone don't ring and the tears they fall
But you carry on and on and on

You gotta go, you'll never know
Just how it all will turn out
Forget what's done
The western turn leaves no doubt

On your own again, back to where it all began
The phone don't ring and the tears they fall
But you carry on and on and on
On your own again, back to where it all began
The phone don't ring and the tears they fall
But you carry on and on and on
On your own again, back to where it all began
The phone don't ring and the tears they fall
But you carry on and on and on
You gotta go (when you come back I'll be alright)
On and on and on (when you come back I'll be alright)
You gotta go (when you come back I'll be alright)
On and on and on (when you come back I'll be alright)
You gotta go (when you come back I'll be alright)
On and on and on (when you come back I'll be alright)
You gotta go, you gotta go
