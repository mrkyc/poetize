She breaks right through to the heart of me
The part of me that I can't explain
I can't find the words to say, but I wanna try anyway
I'm chasing her shadow, chasing her shadow
Day and night, I told her so
Even though I don't know
If this dream is all in vain
What if she don't feel the same?
I'm chasing her shadow, chasing her shadow

Oh, I feel her move like water
Holding on, it only gets harder

You know I need her, I can't take it any longer
I'm without her but it's clear that she belongs here
From the start I was in too deep
This love is moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh, moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh, she's moving through the heart

I just sound like Saturday, left me dreamin' here for days
Every time in a different way, in a different place
Left in the shadow, chasing her shadow, oh, oh
You might also like
Oh, I feel her move like water
Holding on, it only gets harder

You know need her, I can't take it any longer
I'm without her but it's clear that she belongs here
From the start I was in too deep
This love is moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh, moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh, she's moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh, moving through the heart of me
Yeah, yeah


You know I need you, I can't take it any longer
I'm without you but it's clear that you belong here
From the start I was in too deep
This love is moving through the heart of me
You know need ya', I can't take it any longer
I'm without you but it's clear that you belong here
From the start I was in too deep
This love is moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh
Moving through the heart of me (Moving through the heart)
Oh, oh
She's moving through the heart of me
Oh, oh
Moving through the heart of me (Moving through the heart)
Oh, oh
She's moving through the heart of me, yeah
She breaks right through the part of me
