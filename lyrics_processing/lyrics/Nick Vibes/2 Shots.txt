House Party, everybody feeling good
Got the music up loud, what you think?
What you think?
Uhh, backyard, summertime, everybody take a shot, shot, and tell me what you drinking
What you drinking?

2 shots, 2 shots, 2 shot of whatever
She want 2 shots, (Ahh). (2x)
Well lets just take a couple more shots of this patron that we can open
(Pour it up)
Till we get open baby
And lets tell each other all the things we're too afraid to say when we're sober
(Pour it up)
'Cuz you know, you know

2 shots of whatever, 2 shots of whatever
I ain't going out tonight, this house party is much better
All the drinks is on ice, and all the girls look so nice
And then I see you coming though, like where been you
My whole life
I don't smoke but my homies do, and man I got a little high contact
I wana make a move and talk to you, but first I need a little eye contact
Then she gave me that look, like boy what the hell you waiting on
I'm like only you tonight, I'm at your service girl
What you drinking on?
She says, 'Two shots of whatever, how 'bout you just surprise me.'
And I'm real good at surprises, plus ass and foot messages
And I ain't trying to blur the lines, so tell me what rhythms
With messages
We just drinking baby, we just drinking baby
(We just drinking baby)
