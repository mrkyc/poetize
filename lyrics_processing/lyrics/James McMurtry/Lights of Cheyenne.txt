Look off down the highway at the glittering lights
Like windshield glass on the shoulder at night
As the diesels come grindin' on up from the plains
All bunched up like pearls on a string
And I guess time don't mean nothin', not nothin' at all
And out on the horizon the broken stars fall
Old broken stars they fall down on the land
And get mixed in together with the lights of Cheyenne

Well I've been up all night, and I'm down in my back
Workin' the counter to take up the slack
'Cause the money tree's light and the whiskey stream's low
You ain't worked a week since July
You say the gravel pit's hiring after the First
But you don't have the nature for that kinda work
You might could hire on but you won't make a hand
And I'll still be here lookin' at the lights of Cheyenne

You stand in the sky with your feet on the ground
Never suspectin' a thing
But if the sky were to move you might never be found
Never be heard from again

We go on good behavior when our youngest comes home
She comes up from Boulder, but she never stays long
And that oldest still fights me like she was 18
Stopped in for a 6-pack awhile ago
And she's got a cowboy problem, and this last one's a sight
All dressed up like Gunsmoke for Saturday night
And they were off to the bars for lack of a plan
Racin' the stars to the lights of Cheyenne

And you've kept all that meanness inside you so long
You'd fight with a fence post if it looked at you wrong
Well a post won't hit back and it won't call the law
I look at ya right or I don't look at all
Now take a crumpled up soft pack and give it a shake
Out by the dumpster on a cigarette break
With one eye swoll'd up from the back of your hand
And the other eye fixed on the lights of Cheyenne

You stand in the sky with your feet on the ground
Never suspectin' a thing
But if the sky were to move you might never be found
Never be heard from again
Now there's antelope grazing in range of my gun
But come openin' weekend you won't see a one
They'll vanish like ghosts 'cause somehow they know
But now they're up to the fence in the early dawn
And it's warmin' up nicely for this time of year
The creeks are still frozen but the roads are all clear
And I don't have it in me to make one more stand
