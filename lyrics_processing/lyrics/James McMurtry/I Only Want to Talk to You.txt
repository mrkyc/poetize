Slightly misconstrued
All hell broke loose at midnight
When I guess you got the news
There's a dead bird on the sidewalk
And I'm wishin' I was too
And I only want to talk to you
There's tire marks on the concrete
Where you spun out of the drive
There's a hound dog in the corner
Lookin' glad to be alive
And if the phone rings on the table
Well I don't know what I'll do
I only want to talk to you
It's serious this time
What am I supposed to say
Is it a test of some kind
Or a price I ought to have to pay
Now it's upside down and backwards
The foot's on the other shoe
I only want to talk to you
I only want to talk to you
The neighbor kids across the street
Are pointing across the yard
And the social worker next door
Dropped by and left her card
But I don't want to talk to nobody
About what we're going through
I only want to talk to you
I only want to talk to you

What am I supposed to do
Walkin' a fine line
Must've broken it clean in two
Now it's upside down and backwards
The foot's on the other shoe
And I only want to talk to you
I only want to talk to you
There's a nice young man in a clean white shirt
Ringing the front door bell
I'm gonna hide out in the kitchen
And let that hound dog give him hell
'Cause I don't want to talk about Jesus
Not even for a minute or two
I only want to talk to you
I only want to talk to you
