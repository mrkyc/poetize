Short tables, no slop eight ball
Line of crank off his gold top Les Paul
Woke you up, set you right
Kept you talkin' to the middle of the next night
He had the stance, major attitude
Vibrato you could o' thrown a cat through
A little much, a little heavy
I guess the world just wasn't ready
Just a ghost from back a long time ago
Blue-eyed shadow, you never mention anymore
Nothin' ventured, nothin' saved
You poured it out like bourbon on a fresh grave
And learned your lesson well
We learned your lesson well
No helmet or a care in the world
Bein' such a bad little girl
Your face buried in the back of his shirt
Shut your eyes and you'll never get hurt on the Valley road
Black walls, looking through the front door
Mirror ball in the middle of the dance floor
And in the dream it's still the same
But in the daylight none of that remains

Seems like everybody's livin' in the third act
That's how it happens, it's kinda weird
The whole scene just disappeared
We learned our lesson well
We learned our lesson well
He missed a curve on his hard tail sled
Nothin' broken 'cept for his head
You know it's kinda fittin' somehow
Hard to picture what he'd look like now
You learned your lesson well
You learned your lesson well
You learned your lesson well
You learned your lesson well
No helmet or a care in the world
Bein' such a bad little girl
Your face buried in the back of his shirt
Shut your eyes and you'll never get hurt
Flying in the Papago Wind
Half way to Gila Bend
No helmet or a care in the world
