I'm runnin' 'round in circles and I'm chasin' my tail
Carvin' my initials with a rusty nail
Betrayin' my intentions, man, it happens without fail
You'd a' thought that I'd know better by now

It might be some dark secret I keep bottled up inside
Or just some miniscule transgression I shouldn't've tried to hide
It's not the size that matters, it's deceit she can't abide
You'd a' thought that I'd know better by now

And of course she knows 'cause I can't fool her
And I know she knows 'cause she don't fool me
And she knows I know she knows and we might discuss it eventually
When the pressure builds 'til it blows the seals all out from in between
You'd a' thought that we'd know better by now

You'd have thought that we'd know better
You'd have thought we'd understand
Through all the smoke and mirrors
I guess we do the best we can
Hidin' out without a doubt it's gettin' out of hand
You'd a' thought that we'd know better by now
See James McMurtry LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like
And I've seen the phantoms hidin' in the shadows in her eyes
It's not that I'm not threatened, it's just that I'm not surprised
"Good for the gander" said the old folks but they lied
You'd a' thought that we'd know better by now

Now they circle up the wagons, expressing deep dismay
That we know all the words that they can't bring 'emselves to say
There's so much they never tell you, there's so much they hide away
You'd a' thought that we'd know better by now

You'd have thought that we'd know better
You'd have thought we'd understand
Through all the smoke and mirrors
I guess we do the best we can
Hidin' out without a doubt it's gettin' out of hand
