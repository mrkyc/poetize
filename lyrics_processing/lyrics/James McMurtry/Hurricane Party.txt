The hurricane party's windin' down
And we're all waitin' for the end
And I don't want another drink
I only want that last one again
It gave me such a fine glow, smoky and slow
Now I should probably be homeward bound
There's just no one to talk to
When the lines go down

I guess that in the morning I'll go lookin'
For my gray-striped cat
My old house can take the weather
So I'm not too concerned about that
It was built to take the wind back in nineteen-and-ten
When this was one damned fine town
But now there's no one to talk to
When the lines go down

Candles flickered on the back bar
And the buildin' was shakin' with the wind
I bought a whiskey for the gypsy
And she turned my leather back into skin
Just a fleeting sense of that rare suspense
I once thought made the world go around
But now there's no one to talk to
When the lines go down

Open up your back screen door
Let me see your face once more
My hands are cold and my feet so sore
And I can't go on this way

And the thoughts come too fast and too many to keep count
Best just let 'em on through
Now I'm breakin' those glass insulators
With my old .22
Off the telephone polls as a half dollar rolls
Across the knuckles of a rodeo clown
There's just no one to talk to
When the lines go down

My one great love
My God, I can feel her still
She ran off to California
And now she's livin' in those Hollywood hills
With some bullfrog prince, I've not seen her since
Though she calls when he's out of town
And there's no one to talk to
When the lines go down
Open up your back screen door
Let me in your space once more
I was looking for an easy score
But it just don't work that way

Some insurance-man biker
Is yellin' out for one more beer
But a part-time pirate
Just can't get much respect around here
We got our problems too, man we'll get to you in just a minute
Sit your drunk ass down
Yeah, there's no one to talk to
When the lines go down

Now there's water up past the wheel wells of my Ford
And I don't guess that it'll run
But I left a pack of Winston's on the dash
Could you fetch 'em for me son?
The morning's first cigarette, that's as good as it gets all day
I should know by now
That there's no one to talk to
