My brother's a fascist
Lives in Palacios
Fishes the pier every night
He holsters his Glock
In a double retention
He smokes while he waits for a bite
He don't like the Muslims, he don't like the Jews
He don't like the Blacks and he don't trust the news
He hates the Hispanics and alternate views
He'll tell you it's tough to be white

My sister's a Christian
She likes to go fishin'
She don't mind my brother at all
He puts her on Redfish
And Flounder and Trout
And they tear up the flats in the fall
She gets back to Dallas all sunburnt and sour
Worn out from slingin' plugs hour after hour
Seein' spots when she closes her eyes in the shower
She don't see a conflict at all

It's the state of the union, I guess
It's always been iffy at best
We're all in the family, the cursed and the blessed
It's the state of the union, I guess
We're all in the family, the cursed and the blessed
It's the state of the union, I guess

Mother turned eighty
The consummate Lady
We took her to Golden Corral
'Cause she likes the Yeast Rolls
And Bourbon Street Chicken
We oughta known better by now
'Cause me and my brother got into it good
I called him a hick and he called me a hood
He said, "Dad always treated his Mexicans good
"I guess you think you're better somehow"

"Yeah you think you're better
"Cardigan sweatered
"Snowflake if ever there was
"You think you're so cool
"'Cause you did good in school
"You got whipped every day on the bus"
Sister lit out 'fore the shoutin' got worse
Went to Wednesday night prayer at the new Christian church
With a cross on her neck and a nine in her purse
She might be the wisest of us

It's the state of the union, I guess
We're all in a hell of a mess
We're all in the family, the cursed and the blessed
It's the state of the union, I guess
It's the state of the union, I say
Christmas dinner might be hell to pay
So "How 'bout them Cowboys?" and "Have a blessed day!"
It's the state of the union, I say
It's the state of the union, I guess
It's always been iffy at best
We'll do all we're able with what we got left
It's the state of the union, I guess
We'll do all we're able with what we got left
