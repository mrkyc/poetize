It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

Three in the morning, my pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, you're starting to wonder
Where I'm at, what I'm doing and all that
I could have called, but instead I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three, I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know to set things straight
That's it's a thin line between love and hate

It's a thin line between love and hate
(Don't think you can keep treating me bad)
It's a thin line between love and hate
(I'll just sit back and enjoy it)
It's a thin line (Yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
(He's going to fool you one day)

Although it's wrong, you've been doing is big enough
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember, early December
You told me, "Don't come over
Because of the cold and rainy weather"
But *knock, knock, knock* (Who is it?)
Yo, it's Frost, girl (Let me in)
 Frost don't let me down
Well, you know I won't let you down
Just remember that...

Yes it is, yes it is

It's a thin line between love and hate
(Love and hate, love and hate)
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five in the morning, and you're still trying to get through
Sweating the Frost for hanging out with the crew
But baby, if this keeps going on
I came and just like I came, I'm gone
We been through thick and thin, good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I knew you'd trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line between love and gate
It's a thin line between love and hate
(You can't keep treating me like this)
It's a thin line between love and hate (Yes it is, yes it is)
It's a thin line between love and hate (Between love and hate)
It's a thin line (I'll just sit back and enjoy it)
Between love and hate (Yes I will)
