Yo, this is really a trip, man
It's even a trip I'm really here
I think I'll fire up the funk with my man Kid Frost
Mary Jane
Mary Jane
Mary Jane
Mary Jane

Man I'm stoned cold in love with this hyna named Mari
And every single night, it's like me and her, we party
Let me drop a 4-1-1 for those who claim they know me
I'm not the jealous type, for I share Mari's with my homies
She's the type of girl that makes you feel good
Real good, do like a real lover should
And she never complains and talks back
She's right up the block, yo picks her up
And she's neatly wrapped and ready
All of us steady
We been going on now for the past thirteen years
Yeah its a long time for a relationship
I takes her when I roll cause yo, I like the way she trips
Now what you want to say about that
You can't stand the fact that I'm getting over like a fat rat
I heard tonight yo, there's a party
If your down, call me up homes and I'll hook you up with Mari
You might also like
She's Mary Jane
Ooohh she loves to party
My Mary Jane

My people on the spot 2-6-9-2-6-1
The hoods with me now vause they want in on the fun
I guess its the sheer essence of a presence
That got my homies on the block hitting hard all day
But that's the type of game the she plays on a vato
A ghost of eleven, yo' the next thing she got you
Feeling all light in the head
In a daze, with your eyes all red
And she ain't afraid to two-time that ass
She took a get in the pocket of the man with all the cash, then dash
To the other side of town
Mari's got a whole lot of love to spread around
Calling me now so I'm a go and get her
Cause I know that you never met her
But you better be down to party
Her she is ese, meet my home girl Mari

She's Mary Jane
Ooo and we love to throw down
My Mary Jane
She's Mary Jane
Ooo and she loves to party
My Mary Jane

Man I can't believe this girl Mary Jane
Has put such a big affect on my brain
In the south side, they calling her the chronic
Yeah, they call her lots of names but it don't matter, they still want it
Any chance they get, huffing and puffing
Talking about, "Ooo, that's the shit"
So let me get a hit and get slow
As I cruise around pumping the big boom foam
But that's how we kicks it in the sur
And that how we kick it out on tour
And if there's one thing that I know for sure
Is Mari's love is 100 percent pure
So come on baby lights my fire
Cause your love gets me more higher
I can't describe what you do to my body
And no matter what girl, I'll always love you Mari

My Mary Jane
Ooo and I love you baby
My Mary Jane
Talking bout Mari
She's a super freak
Ooo and I love you baby
She's a freaky, freaky, freaky baby
Yeah... ta, ta
Yo, check this out
Rolling the east side with my homie Kid Frost
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Searching hard for Mari, no matter what the cost
(Oh no, oh no)
Kid said she's his girl, I said she's always been mine
Since 1979
You know when we're ever together
We have a really good time
She's a freaky, freaky, freaky girl
