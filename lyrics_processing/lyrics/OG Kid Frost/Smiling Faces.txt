Can you dig it, can you dig it
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Can you dig it
Smiling faces, sometimes pretend to be your friend
Can you dig it
Smiling faces, show no traces of the evil that lurks within
Can you dig it, can you dig it

I've been hearing them, there in lots of places
Many, many people and seen many faces
But the smiling kind is the kind that I don't like
Turn your head and then a spike
Gets stuck in your back, real deep and fast
The little double headed snake in the grass
Is lurking, suckers are smirking
Shaking my hand and at the same time, they're jerking me off
They're soft, I see the mic and I'm grabbing it
Once trace of being two-face, I ain't having it
Cause I'm the boss, the funky Frost
And if you try to double cross, you're gonna get tossed
I ain't the one to play around with a pat on the back
And next week, a smack
A lot of people in the business is wilding
A lot of faces in the crowd and they be smiling
You might also like
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes (Can you dig it)
They don't tell the truth (They don't tell the truth)
(Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces, tell lies (Can you dig it)
And I got proof (Can you dig it, can you dig it)

Hey Frost, what's up, why don't you come in
We rip the microphone and leave it humming
I like the way you rhyming and if you do me the time
I could make you a star and you'll go far
I'll give you some money for a track
A patted back and a booty ass contract
So go ahead and sign it
I bend over and homie was behind it
But I ain't going to trip or slip check
I lost some money but I still got my respect
I did the track but in fact, turned your back
And it's all about the payback
So how you like when the wheels are turned
Yo, how you like getting burnt
Lots of people in the business is wilding
Lots of faces in the crowd and they be smiling

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes (Can you dig it)
They don't tell the truth (They don't tell the truth)
(Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces, tell lies (Can you dig it)
And I got proof (Can you dig it, can you dig it)
And that's the end of Steven truth
Lots of people at my door and they're pounding
Two-faces, one smiling, one frowning
And they're talking about friendship
Happy with my money but without, none of them trip
Every chance they get, yo they'll toss me
I'd rather be broke with one friend than a posse
Our homeboys out for my money, it's funny
And if you get the cash, yo then everyday sunny
I never thought of all these people always bore me
As soon as the moneys gone, then it's storming
Get me this, get me that, make it snappy
I dish out the money and everybody's happy
Smiling faces tells lies and I got them
I see you smiling, are tell them the truth
Or do you want the Frost to take you places
Yeah, smiling faces

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes (Can you dig it)
They don't tell the truth (They don't tell the truth)
(Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces, tell lies (Can you dig it)
And I got proof (Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes (Can you dig it)
They don't tell the truth (They don't tell the truth)
(Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces, tell lies (Can you dig it)
And I got proof (Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes (Can you dig it)
Smiling faces, smiling faces, tell lies (Can you dig it)
(Can you dig it, can you dig it)
Can you dig it
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Can you dig it
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Can you dig it
