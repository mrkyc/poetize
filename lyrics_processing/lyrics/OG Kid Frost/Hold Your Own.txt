Growin' up in the streets of L.A
Life and death can be determined by the words you say
Being misunderstood if you're in the wrong hood
'Cause then you got to face those up to no good
Forefront, we're coming from the side
But one is running back for a gun in his ride
The sign of a shade Glock, the sound of a pistol cock back
A plaque of a Vietnam flashback
Unlike a movie, here in the streets we play for keeps
And tonight, someone's mother is going to weep
For dead, the most would say is senseless
Senseless is to walk the street defenseless
And the man, he don't understand
Why sometimes you must take the law into your own hands
The city's a jungle and in the jungle you're all alone
There comes a time you got to hold your own

You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold you own
You might also like
Man no matter where you live, you got to hold your own
If you're even in a gang or you roam alone
A man's got to do what a man's got to do
One false move and your ass is through
If you're not prepared to back yourself up
Man you better shut up or get cut up and run up
A dealer of drugs will have to hustle with thugs
A pimp gets paid while his girl gives hugs
Holding his own in whatever he does
Just to get back what once was
From the street ghetto raps to the rich and the wealthy
To the ones that are sick, to the ones that are healthy
The message is clear, spread for far and wide
The solution is yours, it's up to you to provide
And decide and take pride and never hide
Your true colors that you hold inside

You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold your own, hold your own, hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold your own, hold your own, hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
From the gate, another one's a gate goat
You got to let them know that you're down to throw
A petty squabble turned into a quarrel
Fierce the storm, I was standing here tomorrow
But you never really now, 'cause it's like throwing the dice
One gets away, the other gets iced
My mind is a trigger, ready to deliver
Words from the mind with knowledge, it'd get bigger
The more you can expand, the more your set can
Learn and absorb, grow together and withstand
Time and pay attention to the next generation
The Latin Alliance is growing throughout the nation
My hands in a fist for whatever might happen
From the streets and the fences or on stage when I'm rapping
Frost is back, so just let it be known
That I'm here to hold my own

You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold your own, hold your own, hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
You got to hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
Hold your own, hold your own, hold your own
Got to, got to (Refuse to lose)
