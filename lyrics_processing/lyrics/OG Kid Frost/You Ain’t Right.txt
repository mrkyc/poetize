You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good

I was raised in a rough neighborhood up to no good
I'm looking at the older fools in my hood
I want to walk like them, I want to talk like them
I want to be a little G and hold a Glock like them
I want my Dickies creased, I want to sag
I want to inhale some paint out of paper bags
And big puffing up a block got a fat money roll
And a firme '64
So, I guess it's me against the world
I'm only thirteen and I'm raising up a baby girl
And I'm inducted in a hall of crime
Cause they jumped my ass in back in '79
Now how you going tell me that I should get a job
Dirty money spends easy so I'd rather rob you, fool
But that's how it goes in the hood
And momma used to say that I was no damn good

You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good

I knock on the door about six in the morn'
Where the hell you been now, it's the crack of dawn
I've been working in the studio, hooking up some videos
But she knows I was out with some little hoes
It's like that song, it's a thin line
She's starving for attention cause it's been a long time
And when I come home, I smell like a woman
There's lipstick on my collar, a phone number on a dollar
But that's just me and just last week she found a hotel key
Now every single time, she be hitting star '69
Not knowing who she might find on the other line
Will it be my homie or will it be my hyna
Will she come home early and find her
Hitting that thing like I know I should
My woman used to tell me I was no damn good

You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good

Nowadays it seems like things ain't the same
It's juvenile  killers in my gang
And all these little fools are looking up to me
I'm thirty-three so they're calling me an OG
And I'm telling them the stories of the old day
And how we handled things in our own way
We wouldn't drive-by like a little punk
We'd tie his ass up and throw him in the trunk
We fought toe to toe and stood like a man
Not shooting out the back of an Astro Van, damn
But nowadays they all on that speed and crack
And most of them ended up on their back
With a tag on their toe
I guess they didn't know, from 1981 through 1994
Rest in peace but that's how it goes in the hood
It's 1995 and it's still no good

You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good, baby
