I like the way
We're cruisin' on the weekend
The sun in our eyes
There's no better feeling
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you take me for a ride?
Hmm mmm
Won't you take me?

We never lose when we're takin' a cruise
I got that yeska 5 flavors to choose
We can get high we can peel back the roof
Sun in the sky baby girl you're the truth
All I wanna do is cruise this whole town with your glory
All I wanna do is put you on my IG story
Cause you fine, you mine, you one of a kind
You lay papi down with that love so divine and it's time

Baby, baby, baby
Won't you take me for a ride?
Hmm mmm

Baby I'm a swoop you up
Cause I just wanna ride with you
We could roll in the '56
Or we could bomb in the '52
We could roll in the Coupe DeVille
It all depends on how we feelin'
Right now I'm feeling good
You got me feeling like I should
Like I never thought I could
Like I never thought I would
And I put that on
Like the Cadi emblem on the hood
So come roll with me, I'll be there at 5:00
Let me be the low-ride, the time of your life

Hmm mmm

Yeah
Come on sweetheart, well it's time to roll
I'll take you any place you wanna go
Yeah I'll take you for a ride
We can slide in the bomba
Lean to the side like what's hattenin', que onda
Bouncin' and dippin' and bumpin' the rolas
Can't get enough and it's driving her loca

You drive me crazy
Won't you be my baby?
And take me... for a ride
Baby
One more time
I wanna show you off
And see how you shine
Take me for a ride
Let me love you one more time
