Nick made me wait all year for the dick
Twelve months of Christmas screamin' ho-ho-ho
Slide down my chimney, suckin' on my mistletoe
Fresh chocolate chip cookies, sittin', waitin' by the stove
Hot, warm buttermilk slip-slidin' down your throat
I can hear the sleigh bells pullin' up to my door
I been a good girl all year, so my gifts are on the floor
Keep my sugar to myself, it's for nobody but my Santa baby

Santa, baby (Jolly 'Ol Saint), please hurry, hurry, hurry
Santa, baby (Jolly 'Ol), he takes care of my worries
Santa, baby (Jolly 'Ol Saint) please hurry down my chimney (Jolly 'Ol Saint), tonight
Santa, baby (Jolly 'Ol Saint), he hurries down my chimney at night (Jolly 'Ol Saint)

All I want for Christmas is my Santa baby
To shower me with gifts and maybe make 'em bigger
Most wonderful time of the year, that's for sure
Here comes Santa Clause Little Drummer Boy
Silver bells ringing Silent Night, let it snow
Givin' love on Christmas Day, it's a happy holiday
Wish it was Christmas every day, I believe in Santa Claus
Mistletoes and holly, absolutely egg nog
It's a Winter Wonderland, butt naked with bells on
The man with all the toys, spreadin' joy to my world
His corncob haunts my Jack Frost, drives him crazy
Anything and everything for my Santa baby
