You put your trust in a nigga? Stupid ho, how you figure
He won't fuck your best friend and your sister?
A-lie to ya, a-then screw ya
A-get mad if his homeboys do ya
A-he's a nigga, don't let him fool ya
They all dogs, that's what they do, uh
'Til you to put a stop to the shit they pull and
Get your own shit, that's what you do and
Don't worry 'bout him or his jewels, man
You make him sweat dubs on your shit as
You ride by, music high as hell too
He's watching you, lusting with his bitch, you
Smile at him, nod at him, keep riding
You see him later 'cause he wanna stop by when
He sees you off the chain, looking good too
You even got his bitch wantin' to freak you

Now when he comes, open up, let him freak you
Do all the thangs, freaky thangs his bitch can't do
From the back, to the side, just riding
Tighten up, grip it down, shit' wild then
Get him up, put him out, nigga, get gone
She's the one cussing, blowing up your cell phone
I'm over you, yeah, you had to learn the hard way
I gives a fuck 'bout what you might have to say
'Cause you'll see I'm a queen in the end, though
You see where you're gonna be in the end, broke
Knowing nothing with nothing, stuck in the hood
While I'm straight, lookin' lovely, living real good
So trust no nigga, fuck a nigga, get your own shit
To let him know that he's fucking with a raw bitch
With her head on her shoulder, knows how it goes
And when it's time to let a motherfucker get gone
