Ugh
6-4-1-2-7 nigga
Pinky finger tycoon nigga

I don't really rock Gucci, Ima different shopper
Gucci strap on my chopper, I do this for Gotcha (What up Sliccs)
I tote it on my back, like my city nigga (KC)
I'm posted in the trap, shooting fifties nigga (That's right)
If he ain't in the game, you can keep it common
Always hollering Big Fact, never getting dollars (Yup)
Ya'll bad for the sport, I'm just being honest (Being honest)
That's why these new niggas, they don't wanna pay no homage (Nope)
They got respect for the shooters, but not they mamas (Not they mamas)
Till they end up with a bond, half a million dollars
That nigga lying every time he put it on his mama (They lying)
When he knowing damn well he don't care about her (That's your mama nigga)
You can try to hit granny, she ain't picking up (She ain't picking up)
Disrespect his gang gang, so they cut him off (Gang gang)
He was just going live, talking fly shit (Talking fly shit)
But he was never in position and that's nine tenths (That's 9 tenths)

Free all the real, you know the system corrupted
I rep the struggle, I ain't giving a fuck
I ain't giving a fuck
Throw up the M when I'm giving it up
The Whale Mafi, we ain't giving a fuck
We ain't giving a fuck
You might also likeI don't internet beef, Ima different mobsta
Send a kite to your city, they pull up and drop ya
Ya already know about my city dude
I can get a nigga touched before his Uber do (KC)
Ya'll ain't got these sticks, these is different choppers
Hit the switch, do a hundred like that nigga ???
Without the four finger rings, I'm the head honcho
Eat a bag of ranch Doritos, on the ranch with Poncho
High IQ, equals low-risk
Tied in like Hootie with the Blowfish

Getting 'em for a price we can live with
He was tied in, playing with them M ticks
Once a month I hear a horn on my compound
He don't never let cha know when he touching down
I move just like him on the realie nigga
You'll never meet this level of a Whalie nigga
A humble ass huslta, showing no aggression
Never made the same mistake, big up progression
We pop the Crystal, nineteen ninety seven
We toast it to the game, man this shits a blessing
They ain't one units, you can recompress 'em
We switching up spots, gotta keep 'em guessing
Got them things come in floods in my section tho'
Nine tenths of the game is possession tho'
Free all the real, you know the system corrupted
I rep the struggle, I ain't giving a fuck
I ain't giving a fuck
Throw up the M when I'm giving it up
The Whale Mafi, we ain't giving a fuck

Tied in like Hootie with the Blowfish
High, high IQ, equals low-risk
