If you ain't talking scrilla then it really ain't important
I'm smokin on some green cracc straight from Portland
Walked out the courthouse straight from court
Been drivin on suspended license
Hopped straight in my Porsche and
Bangin them gears like fucc the judges
Im'ma show these mothafuckers real meanin of thuggin!
Hundred raccs on rims flyin up the avenue
I know you know how I'm feelin if you havin loot!
Stopped by the land I need some fitted hats
Blow ten at the mall cause imma get it bacc
A homemade millionaire from the ghetto and
You can hear the engine roar when I step on the petal
You can hear my bitches heels when she walk in stilettos'
You gone get hella dizzy if you watching bezel (what is it?)
D.Atlantis timepiece half a man on the wrist
Thats fifty thou for you slow niggas in the mix (slow niggas)

My music sellin out like cracc in the store
Im'ma Northside Crip what they mad at me for?
They really can't believe that a real life gangsta cha
Turn his life around start transferrin anger
Puttin it in song mode turn it into scrilla
Don't think I just rap Im'ma well known killa
When it comes to the gritters Im'ma well-known builda
Build a nigga up from nothin' have him out here hustlin'

Money (money) doublin
Everybody lovin him

In a way it got me kinda feelin like Meech
The way the gangstas worldwide show love on the streets

Dressed in all black got rep for my brotha (BMF)
And it ain't about the scrilla he'll give me whatever (give me whateva) in one day he can turn you to a millionaire
But its genuine love make you billionaire
Its fucced up him and T had problems
When it was all one it wasn't no stoppin his mobbin'
Miami on the late night pullin up white on white
Maybach before (Rick) could ever say that
BMF them some powerful letters
They say death before dishonor equal powerful chedda'
Two hundred mill' them some crazy ass accusations
This how it is when you loyal and you havin patience?
