My OG told me, we gotta  hustle
It's when you grind til you're so far away from them busters
I'm from the era where the quietest last the longest
I'm from the city where they stack you if you stacking commas
It's every man for theyself, but I can dig it
They rather talk down and ask you how you did it
My daily agenda is go and get it
The hustle is American, the car is British
Boys buy one Bentley, and they think they a mo
Check out my resume of foreigns, add up the total
No sleep, no time to eat, gotta meet the quota
My expertese in hustling's all anecdotal
Mama raised a soldier, I was Texas made
Grinding all through the Midwest, getting paid
When it comes to hard work, I never been afraid
Twisting up satellite OG like a braid

Onlookers staring like the elevater's broken
The kush came from  the cookie came from Oakland
And me, I'm Kansas City barbeque smoking

You a sucker  you'll never last

Waiting for  Benz
 I'll settle for an M double
Always knew that I could do numbers with this big hustle

 you a  dealer
Bust a 500 magnom one hand, nigga
So you know how I kick when I got the stick
What's in me? Rosay mixed with Henny
Order green bottle Remy, with 
 you can hear it open up
Breaking  got the  smoking up
On my way to the money, no suckers involved
Over the years, you can see that my hustle evolved
 gloab, can't fuck with the
