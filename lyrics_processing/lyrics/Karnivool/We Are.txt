I know there's something wrong
Stop making it up
We're too proud to see
We've lost more than our trust
And now there's nothing left
The wells dead and dried up
This disease has left
A foul taste in our cup
It just keeps on flowing
And we drift on knowing
It just keeps on flowing
This babble from our mouth

Who we are
I fear most of the time
Carry on shuffling
In order and in line
Who we are
I fear most of the time
Carry on, whipping boy
Stare into the light
Stare into the light

And it feels familiar for good reason
I want us to break the case we're in
We've worn it for too long, this catatonic skin
Remove all our parts
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Let's reset it all
Let's reset it all
You might also like
Well, it stings, it hurts
Is this how it's meant to be?
Well, it stings and it hurts
Is this how it's meant to be?
Well, it stings, it hurts
A small price to pay to be
In control, a rebirth
What our future's meant to be

Who we are
I fear most of the time
So carry on, whipping boy
Stare into the light
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Let's reset it all (We are, we are, we are)
Let's reset it all (We are, we are, we are)

These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the worst day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the worst day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
