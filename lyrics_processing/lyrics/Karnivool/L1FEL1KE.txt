You relate through just a bloodline
When I can never take anything that you give
Always wanting to relate through me
I go watch you slowly slip away

You're wanting to put your trust in
When I can feel this remedy kickin' on
Just to taste it, just to want it
And I can say it's not my fault

Say it's alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, it's so lifelike
Come make it alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, I'm fragile

Would you choose me, just abuse me?
When I can never take anything that you give
Always wanting to relate through me
I go watch you slowly slip away
You might also like
You're wanting to put your trust in
When I can feel this remedy kickin' on
Just to taste it, just to want it
And I can say it's not my fault

Say it's alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, it's so lifelike
Come make it alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, I'm fragile

(You see, I'll be the one in your darkest time)

(It's not my fault)
Should I begin to erase myself?
I'm caught in this picture of you
Should I begin to assess myself?
Tell me it's over
It comes from above with these feelings
It takes you away and it buries your soul again
So now blessed by ignorance
'Cause you want to
So run with me if you must follow
I'll take you away to this place where we can be free
A place I call ecstasy
Now you lie alone
Your chance to stop and stare
God, I kiss your bones
Now say it's not my fault

Say it's alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, it's so lifelike
Come make it alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, I'm fragile

Well, you say it's alright
When I'm coming down
Not again, it's so lifelike
Come make it alright
When I'm coming down
