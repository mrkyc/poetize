Hopeless in deep space
You made us wait
Like you used to
Our world's an utter disgrace
You made us sing hallelujah
And now it's all gone
Every time we've tried

We cannot pity
We cannot stand around
Nervous for the hope we're yet to find
Every time we try

Which one are you?
Two sides of a coin
Taking pride in plenty
Of good advice
Win or lose our mind
It ain't picture perfect
Every time we've tried

Nervous for the hope we're yet to find
(We cannot pity, we cannot stand around)
Every time we try
You might also like
We have got to set
All feelings aside
Wherever new life rises
We all build together

(We all see your call)
Win or lose our minds
(The writing on the wall)
Win or lose our minds
It ain't picture perfect
Every time I try

Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc
Break the mold
Let's shake the ground, wreak havoc

(Waiting, watching for good news)

We all strike a match
And burn this ordinary life
When the sun rises high
You best pray you're the better man

We all strike a match
And burn this ordinary life
When the sun rises high
You best pray you're the better man
We've all gotta take to the wall soon
Break free and burn it to the ground

This ain't no ordinary life
This ain't no ordinary life
(Waiting, watching for good news)

This ain't no ordinary life

This ain't no ordinary life
