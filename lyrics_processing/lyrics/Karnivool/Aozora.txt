Here we sit now, camouflaged
 cover
My fate washed away 
 our philosophy
And are you still awake? I hear it too
The sound of ten thousand 
This time, we 

The radio is quiet, don't say no
, we begin to fall 
Don't wanna be God knows
We all see what's going on, more trouble up ahead
 for those lessons we 
Are we ever gonna dignify our cause?
Now I don't fucking sleep now
Can't find a melody

If I held your face to the mirror, would you smile?
If I held your face underwater, would you fight all of the lies?

We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape

If you ever get to see outside
Maybe you can send a letter if you like
If that's alright
Tell me there's hope within our reach
Tell me what it's like living life in peace
It's so profound
You found a way out now

Still waiting for the great escape
Still waiting for the great escape
Still waiting for the great escape

The conversation dies, 
Ain't no life along the way
These things always go south
Yeah, we fail to dig our way out
We all see what's going on, more trouble up ahead
 for those lessons we 
And we're never gonna see inside the reason
But we're never gonna dignify our cause
Now I don't fucking sleep now
Can't find a remedy
So much 
If I held your face to the mirror, would you smile?
If I held your face underwater, would you fight for your life?
As I  on the back of my neck
You're telling me not to let you go
If I held your face to the mirror, would you smile?

We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape
We're waiting for the great escape
