Don't stand so close
Don't stand so close
Don't stand so close

It's just some more of the same, you

Same, same, same

Say, man into the mind, the place that you know
The feeling's so fast, you're stripped to the bone
Taken the time to learn what's within
The feeling's so fast, I can't give in
Listen to me, I'll tell you a song
Within your vowels are stripped to the bone
Taking the time to learn what's at heart
I've given it up, I'm giving you a chance

Its just some more of the same, you
It's just some more of a shame
Just give me someone to blame, you
I say, let's have some more
You might also like
Same, same, same

Say, man into the mind, the place that you know
The feeling's so fast, you're stripped to the bone
Taken the time to learn what you know
The feeling's so fast, I can't let go
Listen to me, I'll tell you a song
Within your vowels are stripped to the bone
Taking the time to learn what's within
I've given it up, I'm giving you a name

Its just some more of the same, you
It's just some more of a shame
Just give me someone to blame, you
I said, let's have some more

Say what's on in your mind, just to fake it away
Just to show I'm inside, just to turn up today
So you laugh and you learn, yeah, you take what you take
Up and down in this world, rip it up in vain
I'm listening as you fall
I'm running away from you, yes I am
I see that stare in your own fly
I see that stare in your own eye
A message left for you
Yes, I am the one that's gonna let you go
Yes, I am the one that's gonna let me go
Yes, I am the one that's gonna let you go
Yes, I am the one that's coming back for you
This is why I'm here with what I have to say
This is why I'm here, I think it's time to pay
This is why I'm here for you
