I see you with the bitter light
And a candle burns here by my side
So I found a place where I can stay here for the night
Hope you feel the same
When I wake next to you
God knows why I'm still here
Why I'm still here with you

All that you left here
All that you own
Nothing was left here
Nothing has grown
So go on your own
Play by yourself
And give it to me
I know that you won't blame me

You shame me
Your eyes they told
And you don't call in
Save your soul
You run around
And you don't call in
By now you surely should have realized
What's done is done and you cannot reverse
Now the seed is sown
To late your time is up anyway
Your chance has passed to make a pet of me
Now the seed is sown
You might also like
All that you gave her
All that you own
Nothing was safe here
Nothing has grown
So go on your own
Say what you feel
Leave it to me
I know that you won't blame me

You shame me
Your eyes they told
And you don't call in
Save your soul
You run around
And you don't call in
By now you surely should have realized
What's done is done and you cannot reverse
Now the seed is sown
To late your time is up anyway
Your chance has passed to make a pet of me
Now the seed is sown

What is the problem?
What is this noise?
This is the way here
So bring on the boys
Time is a weapon
Time is a tool
You take what I give you
Yes you put it to use
For you
So I say to myself, "Yes, I'm never going back"
Got the rocks to my face, kind of smoky in my back
And it seems to my mind there's something quite so clear
Listen to the face and rip it up in fear
But you let go
Settle for the back row
You were never there for
Can't, but you see what you be
Did you want me
Don't want to be me
Listen to your hedge row
Motherfucker, it's not fair
But you want it, you need it, you see it
You're trying hard to beat it
Don't steal it, don't feed it
So what comes next
One last breath before I dive
Deep into your anger ocean
Just one taste I beg you please
Just one taste of your sweat potion
You shame me
Your eyes they told
And you don't call in
Save your soul
You run around
And you don't call in
By now you surely should have realized
What's done is done and you cannot reverse
Now the seed is sown
To late your time is up anyway
Your chance has passed to make a pet of me
Now the seed is sown

Yes, I'm trying to make it on my own
Yes, I'm trying to make it to my home
