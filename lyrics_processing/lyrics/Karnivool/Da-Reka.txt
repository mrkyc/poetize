What's on your mind? I dare to ask
The feeling within we try to mask
Broken again, the stars
Those steel pins, they part
Now you realize what just passed you by
You want some?

Even now I pray for you
It's so soft and safe
And life regains
The gift they took from you

Say too late, I've become what I most fear
To change could make my view seem so clear

The pain
Why you wanna step through me?
What will go out, she'll see
Nothin' left here but the replica
The replica exists here

Say too late, I've become what I most fear
To change could make my view seem so clear
You might also like
The pain
Why you wanna step through me?
What will go out, she'll see
Nothin' left here but the replica
The replica exists here

Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch me
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch this
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch me
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna see

He'll see, reality escapes
From what I've found
This is not for me to say
Go your way, find yourself
Go your way, let this be my shelf

So come taste this
Now come taste it
So come taste this
Now come taste it
So come taste this
Now come taste it
So come taste this
Now come taste it
Hey
Who am I to stand here before?
Who am I to stand here before?
A question that's raised
So you better just answer
You think you're fast, you think you're better
Who am I to stand alone
Who am I to stand alone
Their all burning, take control
I want it back, the life you stole

The pain
Why you wanna step through me?
What will go out, she'll see
Nothin' left here but the replica
The replica exists here

Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch me
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch this
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna touch me
Stop heading 'cause you're never gonna see

He'll see, reality escapes
From what I've found
This is not for me to say
Go your way, find yourself
