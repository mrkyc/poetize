Down with the heavy trip, feel the undertow
As if I'm falling away from something your home
This other shit has got to stop
I'm popping up inside my brain
What you can and you will see to
I'm taking back what's mine and yours
What you can and you deny
This pain is instinct

You're stepping back, you're stepping back
You're stepping back in the real world
Come on, bring it back, I wanna give it back
You'll take it back in the real world

Stop me and you're pleased to do it
I'm the lyrical wizard, ripping up this pad
What you say is nothing meaning
I'm the cop, the saint, the primate
Time to listen, to come and change you
But you take it, but you won't break this pain
But what you can and you deny
This pain is instinct
You might also like
You're stepping back, you're stepping back
You're stepping back in the real world
Come on and give it back, just bring it back
You're stepping back in the real world

I'm the only, yes, the only
I'm the only taste for your true mouth
I'm the only, yes, the only
I'm the only taste for your true mouth

For reach I stay inside
Would you walk away? Don't hide
To reach I stay inside
But now I'm feeling you

I don't come around anymore because of you
Mama, tell me why I've been upset to this point in
Mama, tell me why
Mama, tell me why
Mama, tell me why
Mama, tell me why
Swear
You

Somebody yell, where there's problem I know it's true
So you lie and I stare, who gave you my space here?
I don't need this shit, it's not alright
When you walk away and you find
I don't need this shit, it's not alright
When you walk away, yes, you walk away
You'll find

Tell 'em all not to get inside

You are always gonna be in my insides
You are always gonna be in my insides
You are always gonna be in my insides

Kiss of the cruel, would you show us a break?
Swear
