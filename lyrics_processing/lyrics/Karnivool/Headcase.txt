For what it's worth, I feel it slip away
I've become immune, woke up in a daze
Show me what you mean, take away from me
Everything I have, everything I need
Suck me dry

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
For the last time, please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my
It's rising

So now it seems that you push me away
Further than I've been, not too far to stay
Here where I belong, where my soul can rest
I need time to heal, I need time to see
You've sucked me dry

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
For the last time, please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my
It's rising
You might also like
And so you emerge
Like a butterfly
So dangerously are you
Beautiful tonight
Drown me in the shadows, won't you?
You walk away
I look away
Lift me up, I want to see
Then drag me down from everything
In this I cannot see the end
And I will only be your friend

Tears drop and my eyes close
Tears drop and my eyes close
Tears drop and my eyes close
Tears drop and my eyes close

Problems imaged, after me
Come on, this in yo head
Not the face, come on, this in yo head
Not the face, oh, come on
They say "What's the problem? You're the problem now"
Sent to me, come on, this in yo head
Not the face, come on, this in yo head
Not the face, oh, come on
They say "What's the problem? You're the problem"
You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
For the last time, please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my
