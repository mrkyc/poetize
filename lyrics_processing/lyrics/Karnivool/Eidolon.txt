I couldn't hide my face to claim my innocence
I wouldn't have the sense to keep going on
Maybe I'm just too proud to stand in your defense?
Still I feel the pull of hidden wires

I'm never gonna try
I lied, I dared to speak my mind
When all the old changes made before
Don't seem to change a thing at all

Are you real?
Are you real?

I wouldn't find my place with this poor disguise
Why can't I face myself without these lies?
I couldn't find my path without knowing it
I've been around every turn, I know what's left is right

I never let it die
I tried, I dared to free my mind
And all the same changes as before
Don't seem to change a thing at all

I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back
It started with a smile, I know, but it won't come back
This is real

I should have seen it coming
Now I'm feeling nothing
I was taken far beneath the middle
I should have seen it coming
Now I'm feeling nothing
I was taken far beneath the middle

I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back
(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
It started with a smile, I know, but it won't come back
(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back
(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
It started with a smile, I know, but it won't come back
(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back
(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
It started with a smile, I know, but it won't come back
