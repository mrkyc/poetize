This is my sense of reality
And this is proof of my coming of age
This is truth in captivity
And this is lucid affirmology, I
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel-witted mind
This is my sense of reality
And this is proof of my coming of age
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel-witted mime

Are you with me?
Are you of like mind?
Are you with me?
Are you of like mind?

We keep falling free of gravity
We just severed these umbilical wires
This is more than just affinity
We're moving further through an endless design
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel-witted mime

Don't look down or feel afraid now
Let's go higher
This is the sound of your reason to wake
Have we forgotten now?
Can we relate?
It's backwards, it makes no sense
So real that we can't pretend
It's backwards, it makes no sense
It's harder to just pretend

Say it once more, say it again
Hey, is this the end of all I know?
Say it once more, say it again
Hey, is this the end of all I know?
Are you with me?
(Can we relate, can we relate, can we relate?)
Are you of like mind?

Say it once more, say it again
Hey, is this the end of all I know?
Say it once more, say it again
Hey, is this the end of all I know?
