I keep staring at the sky
I've been waiting for some time
So out of touch, so out of mind
I can feel you there, I won't lie
We're all just kids, we're all good liars
Good liars

Please try to understand, there is no great plan
We have no idea what lies beyond our reach
Try to understand, there is no great plan
We will cross the line with an open mind

Show me what it is
Hush my desires
Set me on fire

Please try to understand, there is no great plan
We have cast our eyes to the open skies
Try to understand, we've another plan
We have crossed the line with an open mind
We have crossed that line
You might also like
You're new to me
And I believe
You have to be
The one we need

Soon you will see it when all
Our reasons for trying are justified
We'll hold the fate of the world
The dearly departed
They won't make a sound
They won't make a sound

You are the same as the salt blood running in our veins
Few have the heart of the brave, now, will you run or stay?
We hide away our vicious things, don't let them out
Even the ones that we don't see, who are always there, here
You are the salt of all

You are the salt of the same blood running in our veins (In our veins)
Few have the heart of the brave, now, will you run or stay? (Will you run or stay?)
We hide away our vicious things, don't let them out (Let them out)
Even the ones that we don't see, who are always there, here (Who are always there)
You're new to me
And I believe
You have to be
The one we need

Take me with you on this sky machine
(Please try to understand, there is no great plan, we have cast our eyes)
I'm dying to know
(To the open skies)
Where you're from and what it is we seek
(Try to understand, we've another plan, we have crossed the line, with an open mind)

Soon you will see it when all
Our reasons for trying are justified
We'll hold the fate of the world
The dearly departed
They won't make a sound
