You said, "Just show me what you want to be
I will never stand in your way"
Take it back and then you say again
"Tell me what you want to be
I will never stand in your way"

You know I sat here thinking just the other day
What it was you said to make me snap
You were always gonna be my friend
You're not the enemy
I will never stand in your way

Yeah, but in my mind I see clearer

Take me back into the other day
When I was so proud to hear myself
You will slap me and I know this sucks
You're just the enemy
I will never stand in your way

Yeah, but in my mind I see clearer
Now that I've found
Somewhere to rest my head
You might also like
In time, I guess this will all fade
In time, I guess this will all fade

In time, I guess this will all fade
In time, I guess this will all fade

In time, I guess this will all fade
In time, I guess this will all fade
Slap me up again, just slap me up again
(In time, I guess this will all fade)
Slap me up again, just slap, slap me up again
(In time, I guess this will all fade)
Slap me up again, just slap me up again
Slap me up again, just slap, slap me up again
In time, I guess this will all fade
