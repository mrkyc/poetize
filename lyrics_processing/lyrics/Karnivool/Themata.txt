Step in this room where I wanna be
Surely you mean this is something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
And it's a truth that I wanna see
I search myself for the reason
The ever-loving greed
I am put off slightly
So what am I to see? (In the sensory, serenity)
Oh, my love (In the sensory, serenity)

So pull the pin inside, baby, let it ride
Never knowin' I'm the next to see
With the fire sign, never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to be

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see?
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie
You might also like
Like a knot it binds, suffocating minds
Never knowin' I'm the next to see
With the fire sign, never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to bleed

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see?
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy
I search myself for the reason
Forever loving greed
I am bored of silence
So what am I to see?

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe
Surely you mean this is something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
And it's the truth that I wanna see
(In the sensory, serenity)
(In the sensory, serenity)
In the sensory, serenity
How could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
How could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
How could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
Could it be, that I'm in ecstasy?

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world isn't mine
It's so good to see (So good to see)
This world I'm in, world I'm in, world I'm in
