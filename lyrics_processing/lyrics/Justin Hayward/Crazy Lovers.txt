As plain as the stars that are shining above
And I know that you know I wait for the morning
I wake up beside you my love
And all of the things that you thought you should tell me
Are all that I needed to know
You told me our love was eternal
Eternity's such a long time left to go
Two crazy lovers we must find a way
Hold on now baby I am on my way
Book us a ticket on the midnight train
You never know darling, they might never see us again
'Cos I know that you know that we know
As plain as the stars that are shining above
And I know that you know I wait for the morning
I wake up beside you my love
It seems like the world has been waiting to show us
A secret it's kept for so long
And oh how I know that it's love that has found us
It's found us right where we belong
Two crazy lovers we must find a way
Hold on now baby I am on my way
Book us a ticket on the midnight train
You never know darling, they might never see us again
They might never see us again
They might never see us again, again, again
