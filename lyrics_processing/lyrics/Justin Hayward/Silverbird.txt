The rain that falls
Waves that crash upon the shore
And I know that everyone
Must have freedom today
And baby in my dreams I see
I see you walking away
I can understand the moon and stars
(understand moon and stars)
Wonders of this world of ours
(wondrous world of ours)
And I see the fire of life
Burning brighter each day
And baby in my dreams I see
I see you walking away
(walking away)
So far away
(so far away)
I see you walking away
(walking away)
So fly, my silverbird
(fly silverbird)
You know that I
Am waiting for you
And everywhere you go
I'm with you still (fly silverbird)
I know you will
Return someday
And through the rain and the snow
(and the snow)
When there's nowhere left to go
I hope you'll stay
Oh darling, now I understand
And I'm home to stay
