In the sky that night
Two lonely travelers, high flying
Alone in the night on an endless flight
Killing time with polite conversation
Killing time in your shy hesitating way
Killing time, killing my isolation
Two lonely travelers breaking ice
By opening up a few old back pages
We were two golden eagles in the sky today
Two golden eagles high flying
Who swept through the air
To a secret lair
Flying free slowly wheeling and gliding
Flying free on the sea and the high plateau
Flying free on the breeze without trying
Two lonely travelers breaking ice
By opening up a few old back pages
And letting secrets out of their cages
But wanting to remain perfect strangers
'Cos I was on a night flight
Floating above the world
Yes it was the moonlight
Painting the wings in pearl
High above the clouds
High above the world
