He walked right out the door
He said goodbye to his former life
And he never came back no more
Oh, Billy
There's anger in your heart
Oh, Billy
There's madness in your eyes
He took his favorite handgun
With his rifle he felt free
He cleaned them all the night before
He was armed as he could be
Oh, Billy
There's anger in your heart
Oh, Billy
There's sadness in your eyes
'Cause it's a sad world
Where there's no one
Who can reach out
To the source of your pain
Yes it's a sad world
Such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes
At the end of a gun

He found the tallest building
Like a bird's nest in the sky
He shed a tear as he took his aim
At the people passing by
Oh, Billy
There's anger in your heart
Oh, Billy
There's sadness in your eyes
But it's a sad world
Where there's no one
Who can reach out
To the source of your pain
Yes it's a sad world
Such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes
At the end of a gun
Whoa, oh, oh, oh...
Before he pulled the trigger
He knelt as if to pray
And at the top of the church
He will never be found
Since he took his life that day
Oh, Billy
There's anger in your heart
Oh, Billy
A sadness in your eyes
'Cause it's a sad world
Where there's no one
Who can reach out
To the source of your pain
Yes it's a sad world
Such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes
At the end of a gun
Yes it's a sad world
When there's no one
Who can hold you
When you just need to cry
And it's a sad, sad world
When there's no one
Who would care if
If you live or you die
It's a sad world
Such a sad, sad world
