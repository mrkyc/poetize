They came with nothing but pockets full of dreams
They came in hope, looking for the promised land
They brought their faith, believing in their hearts
They brought their children, searching for a new start
They came looking for the promised land
And all the rumours said it was heaven there
And all the signs were pointing to a new world
Someway, somehow there's got to be
A place for us
Somewhere, there's got to be
A better way, a new beginning, a second chance
It's all in the new world
Equality, liberty
Freedom
It's all in the new world
A better life, a brighter future, the right to believe
It's all in the new world
For you and me, it's got to be
Freedom
It's all in the new world
Through the ages, all through history
They braved the deserts, sailed the raging sea
And left their homes, looking for the promised land
They brought their culture, pride and prejudice
All they wanted was a reason to exist
And still they come, looking for the promised land
