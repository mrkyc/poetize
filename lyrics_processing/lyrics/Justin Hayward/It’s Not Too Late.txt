Why can't it be
Just like it was once before?
Well you lead the way and I'll find the tree
And you catch the leaves as they fall
Don't you know that it's not too late?
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late?
And even though I tell myself
All is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning
Away
If we were free
To do as we please
What would we change, you and I?
To hold back the night
To do what is right
To live under bright blue, blue sky
Don't you know that it's not too late?
The time's not past
And don't you know it's not too late? Ohh...
And even though I tell myself
All is lost
But somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning
Away

Way out on the sea
We see the sun still rising
Just for you and me
When we were young
Life was so strange
So complicated we would cry
But when we grow old
Will mystery hold us both in its spell?
As time goes by
Don't you know that it's not too late?
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late? Ohh...
And even though I tell myself
All is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning away
Away
Don't you know that it's not too late?
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late? Ohh...
And even though I tell myself
All is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning away
