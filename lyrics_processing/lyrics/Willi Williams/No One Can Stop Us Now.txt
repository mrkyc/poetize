I, well-well, can't stop me
So now they can't

No one's gonna stop us now (Oh no, they can't)
We're on the move (Got to move on)
We're moving on, yeah
No one's gonna stop us now (Gotta keep it strong)
We're on the move (Got to move along)
We're moving on, yeah

And I know some people
They haven't make it to bide I
And all they do is just sit and criticize I
Instead of joining in just to help a situation
They say "No, no, it's a violation"

No one's gonna stop us now (Oh no, they can't)
We're on the move (Got to move on up, ya)
We're moving on, yeah
No one's gonna stop us now (Oh, no-no-no)
We're on the move (Got to move along)
We're moving on, yeah

And if you check a man and just to realize
Then it's only the strong that survive
So if you listen and all move to the sound
Say thanks to the father in a positive sound (By singing)

No one's gonna stop us now (Oh no, they can't)
We're on the move (Got to move on up)
We're moving on, yeah
No one's gonna stop us now (Gotta be real positive, stronger)
We're on the move (Now-now-now-now)
We're moving on, yeah

So let man talk and let them understand now
That this is just a part of my master's plan
'Cause I still know some people
And I still know they got to make it to bide I
'Cause all they wanna do is just sit and criticize I

No one's gonna stop us now (No-no-no, we gonna move on up)
We're moving up (Got to move on up)
We're moving on, yeah
No one's gonna stop us now (Gotta keep on strong, ya)
We're on the move (Gotta move on up)
We're moving on, yeah
No one's gonna stop us now (Gotta be so strong)
We're moving up (You got to move it up now)
