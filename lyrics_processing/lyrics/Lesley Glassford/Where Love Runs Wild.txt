An epitaph of days gone by
A hopeful You, a younger me
Fictitious faces framed, in a time
When we thought we knew it all
All the time
Somewhere we took a turn
Unconcerned with danger signs
The sun came beating down
Until we found
Our hearts in need of rain
Just a taste to take away the pain
And save our life, together
I knew there and then
That I would die for You
And in my brokenness
I felt a mist blowing from Heaven
Through the desert thirsty and dry
Love brought us down to the water
Like a raging flood
Sustaining our hope with the rush of the river
Crawling lifeless, end of the line
Love brought us down to the water
To take a drink
And bathe in the healing deep blue waters
Of the cleansing tide
Where love runs wild
You might also likeSticks and stones
And broken bones along the bank
Drifting debris of misery
Pieces of our past
That the storm has left behind to show
That we survived, together
So when we feel the arid wind
And we fear a drought
We can be at peace
'Cause we know we will always remember
Through the desert thirsty and dry
Love brought us down to the water
Like a raging flood
Sustaining our hope with the rush of the river
Crawling lifeless, end of the line
Love brought us down to the water
To take a drink
And bathe in the healing deep blue waters
Of the cleansing tide
Where love runs wild
Through the desert thirsty and dry
Love brought us down to the water
Like a raging flood
Sustaining our hope with the rush of the river
Crawling lifeless, end of the line
Love brought us down to the water
To take a drink
And bathe in the healing deep blue waters
Of the cleansing tide
Where love runs wild
Through the desert thirsty and dry
Love brought us down to the water
Like a raging flood
Sustaining our hope with the rush of the river
Crawling lifeless, end of the line
Love brought us down to the water
To take a drink
And bathe in the healing deep blue waters
Of the cleansing tide
