When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all be there
When Johnny comes marching home
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all be there
When Johnny comes marching home
With drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo
With drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo
With drums and guns and guns and drums
The enemy nearly slew ye
Darling John, it's been so long
Johnny I hardly knew ye
You might also likeTis glad I am to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
Tis glad I am to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
Tis glad I am to see ye home
My darling John, so pale and worn
So low in check, so high in bone
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all be there
When Johnny comes marching home
Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that were so mild
When my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did ye run from me and the child
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all be there
When Johnny comes marching home
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run
When first you went to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye
Ye haven't an arm, and ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an arm, and ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an arm, and ye haven't a leg
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
And Ye'll have to put with a bowl to beg
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all be there
