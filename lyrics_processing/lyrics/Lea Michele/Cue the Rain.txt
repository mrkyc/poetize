How many times have I driven this road
On my way home, it's always the same
So many people just standing in line
Chasing the lights, but loosing their way

And I find myself looking for you (For you, for you)
Yeah, I find myself looking for you
Looking for you

The city was on fire for us, we would've died for us
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh, oh)
In my heart little sparks, everywhere that you are
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh, oh, oh)

Headlights and taillights, they all look the same
We come and we go, need something to chase
Hard to remember what we left behind
With your hand in mine, It's hard to erase

And I find myself looking for you (For you, for you)
Yeah, I find myself looking for you
Looking for you

The city was on fire for us, we would've died for us
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh, oh)
In my heart little sparks, everywhere that you are
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh)
And I'll stay, yeah, anything but okay
And I'll fade tonight
The city was on fire for us, we would've died for us
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh)
Cue the rain (Oh, oh)
Why can't I stay?
Whoa, whoa, I was slipping away

And I find myself looking for you, oh
Yeah, I find myself looking for you, oh

The city was on fire for us, we would've died for us
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh, oh)
In my heart little sparks, everywhere that you are
Up in flames, cue the rain (Oh)
And I'll stay, yeah, anything but okay
And I'll fade tonight
The city was on fire for us, we would've died for us
