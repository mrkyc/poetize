My words are wrapped in barbwire
My actions speak for what I can't say
'Cause I fall one step forward
To push you away, push you away
I wish that I could listen
To all the advice that I give away
But it's hard to see things clearly
Through all of the pain, all of the pain
I'm caught in the rain, caught in the rain

And my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you, tonight
But in this black-out state of mind
Baby, all I want is you, tonight
When my head tells me no, my heart tells me go
So, I'm hitting the road 'cause I
I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yeah, I'm on my way to you, you
To you, tonight, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you
I'm on my way to you

Yeah, there's a million voices
Screaming that this love's a dead end road
But the only voice that I hear is tellin' me go, tellin' me go
The sun is rising sober
While passion fades and I'm on my own
My helpless heart's hungover
I'm all outta hope, all outta hope
Where do we go? Where do we go?

'Cause my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you, tonight
But in this black-out state of mind
Baby, all I want is you, tonight
When my head tells me no, my heart tells me go
So, I'm hitting the road 'cause I
I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yeah, I'm on my way to you, you
To you, tonight, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you
I'm on my way to you

And no wise words can stop me
I'm past the point of no return
No matter how it hurts me
I'm running to you, running to you

And my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you, tonight
But in this black-out state of mind
Baby, all I want is you, tonight
When my head tells me no, my heart tells me go
So, I'm hitting the road 'cause I
I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yeah, I'm on my way to you, you
To you, tonight, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you
