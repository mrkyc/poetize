Come out of the shadow
Step into the light
This could be the moment
Are you ready to fight?
Don't you know, you know?
You're not the only one

Why so low, so low? What are you waiting for?
All I ever hear are whispers
All I ever hear are whispers

But I just wanna
Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?

Wanna be remembered
Stand out of the crowd
Don't choke on the fire
It's tryna burn you out
You might also like
Why so low, so low? What are you waiting for? (Waiting for)
All I ever hear are whispers (Whispers)
All I ever hear are whispers (Whispers)

But I just wanna
Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?

Come out of the shadow
Step into the light (Light, light, light)
This could be the moment
It could change your life (Life, life, life)
All I ever hear are whispers (Whispers, whispers)

But I just wanna
Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder? (Louder)
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder? (Louder)
Turn it up, I know you can
Why don't you scream a little louder? (A little louder)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
