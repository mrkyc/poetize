I'm screaming at the sun
I'm scratching out my eyes
Trying to cut my way
Through this jungle of a life
Nothing's going good
Nothing's going right
Another hopeless day
Another sleepless night

Heaven help me get through these demons in my mind
All I know is, I will survive

I'm still a believer
Can nobody tame this raging heart?
Yeah, I'm still a dreamer
I'm fighting my way up to the stars
I'm running wild, I'm going out
I'm flying high, I'm screaming out
I'm blowing up, a fire in the sky
I'm still a believer
Can nobody tame this raging heart?

And nothing's like you said
And nothing's like we thought
I remember when we were dancing in the dark
And I just gotta thank you from the bottom of my heart
For pouring gasoline and lighting up a spark
You might also like
Heaven help me get through these demons in my mind
All I know is, I will survive

I'm still a believer
Can nobody tame this raging heart?
Yeah, I'm still a dreamer
I'm fighting my way up to the stars
I'm running wild, I'm going out
I'm flying high, I'm screaming out
I'm blowing up, a fire in the sky
I'm still a believer
Can nobody tame this raging heart?

I'm coming here to start a riot
I'm coming here to break the silence
Nobody gonna stop me now
'Cause I'm on a roll
I'm coming here to take you down
I'm coming here to take this crown
Nobody gonna stop me now
I'm out of control

I'm still a believer
Can nobody tame this raging heart?
Yeah, I'm still a dreamer
I'm fighting my way up to the stars
I'm running wild, I'm going out
I'm flying high, I'm screaming out
I'm blowing up, a fire in the sky
I'm still a believer
