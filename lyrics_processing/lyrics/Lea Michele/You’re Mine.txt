You're insecure, but I was so sure
But I wanted you
Yes, I'm powerful and a little girl
But I wanted you
So I told you so, wanted you to know
We've just one life to live

And I told you all my dreams and fears
And you looked at me and your eyes filled with tears
And you said those three words I've been waiting for
You became a part of me

You're mine, for life (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, for life, for life, for life)
And I'll be by your side (Your side)
We are entwined (Entwined, entwined)
You're mine, for life (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, for life, for life)
Hold me until we die (We die, we die)
I'm yours and you are mine (You're mine, you're mine)
I'm yours, you're mine (I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine, you're mine)
I'm yours, you're mine (I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine, you're mine)

Now I'm so happy, you found a place for me
Boy you wanted me
Some security and two heart beats
Boy you wanted me
Then you told me so, wanted me to know
You let the past go
You might also like
And I told you all my dreams and fears
And you looked at me and your eyes filled with tears
And you said those three words I've been waiting for
You became a part of me, yeah

You're mine, for life
And I'll be by your side (I'll be by your side)
We are entwined (We are entwined)
You're mine, for life (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, for life, for life, for life)
Hold me until we die (We die, we die)
I'm yours and you are mine (You're mine, you're mine)
I'm yours, you're mine (I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine, you're mine)
I'm yours, you're mine (I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine, you're mine)

I'm yours, you're mine
