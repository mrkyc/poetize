Everyday I get a little bit closer to
The resolution that I am not yet bulletproof
Oh, the battle within rages on and on
The neighborhood seemed so small
The church on the corner has steps good for waiting
I should go in, but I'm tired of praying
And anyway

I can't stop the bells
Ringing since you've been gone
I thought I was moving on
But I think of nothing else
I can't break the spell
I still hear you every place
Can't forget what I saw in your face
I know every inch so well

I can't stop the bells
Can't stop the bells
Can't stop the bells
I can't stop the bells
Can't stop the bells
You might also like
And it doesn't even matter what's going on
The sound in my head is constant
And I can't turn it off
Oh, and patience is hard when you just don't know
Where all the waiting is taking you
The church on the corner torn down in December
That kiss in the doorway I still won't surrender
And anyway

I can't stop the bells
Ringing since you've been gone
I thought I was moving on
But I think of nothing else
I can't break the spell
I still hear you every place
You don't know what you left in your wake
I guess I'm not so well

If you could feel what I feel for the moment
Just see what I see
And you know that I won't find peace
Until you'll come back to me
Oh, I thought I was moving on
But I think of nothing else
I can't stop the bells
I still hear you every place
Can't forget what I saw in your face
I know every inch so well

I can't stop the bells
Can't stop the bells
Can't stop the bells
I can't stop the bells
