It's easy to fall in love, but it's so hard
To break somebody's heart
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield
Once lust has turned to dust and all that's left's
Held breath, forgotten who we first met
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

We both know it's comin'
Does illusion count for somethin' we hide?
The surface tension's gotta break
One drop is all it takes to flood out this lie, oh

You and I, we have to let each other go
We keep holdin' on but we both know
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield
Peace will come when one of us puts down the gun
Be strong for both of us, no please, don't run, don't run
Eye to eye, we face our fears
Unarmed on the battlefield
You might also like
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea

No blood will spill if we both get out now
Still it's hard to put the fire out
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield
Feelings are shifting like the tide
And I think too much about the future
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

We both know it's comin'
Does illusion count for somethin' we hide?
The surface tension's gotta break
One drop is all it takes to flood out this lie, oh

You and I, we have to let each other go
We keep holdin' on but we both know
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield
Peace will come when one of us puts down the gun
Be strong for both of us, no please, don't run, don't run
Eye to eye, we face our fears
Unarmed on the battlefield (Ah)
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea
