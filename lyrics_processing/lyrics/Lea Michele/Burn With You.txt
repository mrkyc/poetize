We are broken, we can't fix it
There's no cure for our condition
Desperate eyes are starin' at me
Should be hopeless, but we're happy
It's not perfect here between us
Even angels have their demons
Trapped inside this twisted circle
It ain't right, but it's eternal

There's a white light, and it's callin' me
And it's promisin' ecstasy
But I don't wanna go to heaven if you're goin' to hell
I will burn with you, I will burn with you

We're not healthy, barely breathing
But this pain keeps my heart beating
We are lost when we're together
But I'll follow you forever

There's a white light, and it's callin' me
And it's promisin' ecstasy
But I don't wanna go to heaven if you're goin' to hell
I will burn with you, I will burn with you
I don't wanna go to heaven if you're goin' to hell
I will burn with you, I will burn with you

I don't wanna dream without you
I don't wanna bleed without you
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I know you'll burn with me too
I don't wanna dream without you
I don't wanna bleed without you
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I know you'll burn with me too

There's a white light, and it's callin' me
I don't wanna go to heaven if you're goin' to hell
I will burn with you, I will burn with you
I don't wanna go to heaven if you're goin' to hell (I don't wanna go)
I will burn with you, I will burn with you

I don't wanna dream without you
I don't wanna bleed without you
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I know you'll burn with me too
I don't wanna dream without you
I don't wanna bleed without you
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I know you'll burn with me too
