It's time to leave it all behind
It's time to pick up the pieces of my scattered mind
And after all my petals fall
I can finally find beauty beneath once and for all

I've spent way too long judging myself
Running from truth into someone else's arms
But I'm done, the battle's begun, the battle's begun
There's fire in me, deep down in my veins
These clouds in my head, they're not gonna rain
There's fight in my heart, there's hope in my eyes
There's hope in my eyes

I push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall
I keep on believing anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh, anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh

It's time to crack the open door
It's time to leave every teardrop on the bathroom floor
If I'm scared, I'll go in scared
Yeah, I've got nothing to lose, it's only up from here

I've spent way too long judging myself
Running from truth into someone else's arms
But I'm done, the battle's begun, the battle's begun

I push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall
I keep on believing anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh, anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh

Yeah, the night is all around me, 'round me
But in the dark, the stars they found me, found me
I'm here, woah, woah, woah

I'm gonna push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing (believing)
Anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall (I keep on believing)
I keep on believing (keep on believing)
Anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh (oh, ooh, ooh)
Woah oh oh oh oh oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Anything's possible
