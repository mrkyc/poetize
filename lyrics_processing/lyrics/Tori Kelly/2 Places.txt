These days I keep finding myself caught in between
Am I awake or am I walking in my sleep?
Just never know what I'll be feeling today
Happy or sad, yeah, it could go either way
One minute I'll be fine then I don't know how to feel

I'm in between the two, standing still and on the run
Don't know what to do, I'm in two places at once
I feel like the moon tryna stay up for the sun
Heart is so confused 'cause it's two places at once, oh

I'm always spinning back and forth, I'm up and down
My head's all over the place and I'm stuck on the ground
Just look at the birds, they only know how to fly
Up in the clouds, they never worry like I do
One hand holds onto hope, the other's filled with doubt

I'm in between the two, standing still and on the run, yeah
Don't know what to do, I'm in two places at once
I feel like the moon tryna stay up for the sun
Heart is so confused 'cause it's two places at once, oh

The same things that make me smile are the same things that make me cry
The same things that comfort me are keeping me up at night, oh
I must be goin' numb, maybe it's all because, oh
I'm feelin' everything, and I feel it all at once
I'm in between the two

I'm in between the two (Hey), standing still and on the run (Standing still and on the run)
Don't know what to do, I'm in two places at once
I feel like the moon tryna stay up for the sun (Ooh-ooh)
Heart is so confused 'cause it's two places at once

My heart is two places at once
