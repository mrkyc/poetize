Why? Why?

Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price (All right, all right)
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight

I should be more cynical and tell myself that's not okay
(To feel this good when I'm with you)
Try my best to fight it, say "I hate you", but I always stay
Woah, oh, ooh, 'cause

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do (Wait, hold up)

Everybody's talking 'bout the next thing (Yeah, yeah)
Feel like what they got ain't good enough, oh, oh yeah
But all I wanna do is release the tension (All right, all right)
Bring the conversation back to us, oh, yeah
