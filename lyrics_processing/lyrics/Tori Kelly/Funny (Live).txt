It's so easy to lose all the meaning of who you are
What is your definition of a true superstar?
Is it beauty? Is it money? Is it power? Is it fame?
Are you in it for the glory? What's the purpose? What's the gain?
Everything you ever wanted got you tied up in chains
Be careful how you play the game

Cause the same things that chose you
Are the same things that own you
The same thing that built you is the same thing that kills you
The same ones that praise you are the same ones that hate you
Funny how it all goes around

If you lose your soul, you lose it all
If you're at the top, then brace for the fall
Surrounded by faces, but no one to call
Funny how it all goes around
If you lose your soul, you lose it all
If you're at the top, then brace for the fall
Surrounded by faces, but no one to call
Funny how it all goes around

If you look through a microscope at this messed up world
You would see every scratch, every flaw, every ounce of dirt
Your so-called friends you're leaning on, but all they do is take
You say it's fine, but deep inside you wish you could escape
Everything you ever wanted got you tied up in chains
Be careful how you play the game

Funny how it all goes around
If you lose your soul, you lose it all
If you're at the top, then brace for the fall

You keep on crying out
Don't let me hit the ground
Your soul is crying out
Don't let me hit the ground
You keep crying out, Lord

If you lose your soul, then you lose it all
If you're at the top, then brace for the fall

If you're at the top, brace for the fall
Funny how, funny how it all goes around, yeah

You keep on crying out
Don't let me hit the ground
