Whatever you're searching for
You won't find it here
But I'll admit something keeps pulling me back into your atmosphere
I'm really good at mistakes, all the marks I've left on the page
They seem to never wanna disappear

Why do you still come around?
When all I do is push, push, push you away
I really, really wanna take a chance on you but I
I hesitate

I'm afraid to start, don't wanna break your heart
Just finished picking up the pieces from this mess
I never meant to hurt nobody, but now I tend to move slowly
'Cause if I ever slipped from your fingertips
My name will be stained on your lips

Feel like everybody's watching to see what my next move is
Do I proceed with caution or do I just dive in?
I'm fine with taking it slow, enjoy life on my own
But I can be confusing sometimes, I know

Baby all I do is push, push, push you away
I really, really wanna take a chance on you but I
I need to make sure this isn't just a phase

I'm afraid to start, don't wanna break your heart
Just finished picking up the pieces from this mess
I never meant to hurt nobody, but now I tend to move slowly
'Cause if I ever slipped from your fingertips
My name will be stained
I'm afraid to start, don't wanna break your heart
Just finished picking up the pieces from this mess
I never meant to hurt nobody, but now I tend to move slowly
'Cause if I ever slipped from your fingertips
My name will be stained on your lips

Nothing wrong with taking my time with love
I don't wanna be the bad guy again
I don't wanna be the bad guy again
Still working out the kinks of my tainted love
Colors bleed out from my heart to his
Different shades that I can't predict
