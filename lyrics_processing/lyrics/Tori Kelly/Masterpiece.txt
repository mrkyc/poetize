A blessing in disguise

Lord, I'm so glad You're making me
A masterpiece

When You look at me
Do You see a work of art in the making?
A sketch of what I'll be, mmm
I wonder what You see in me
Like what do You think?
When my life is not a melody in the morning
And I feel off key, yeah
Do You still believe in me?
Like a symphony, hey
You know how to make all things work together
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise
