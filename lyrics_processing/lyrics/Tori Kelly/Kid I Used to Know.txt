Mmm, yeah

Lost in this desert, feels like a thousand years
Looking for water, swear there was an ocean here (Mmm)

How do I get back where I came from
When everything has all changed so much?
Feeling the pressure now
It's tying my heart down
I'm missing the empty skies of my youth
Never a cloud on the ever bright blues
Just want that peace again, but the chaos is closing in

I know that I can't ever go back to the world when life was only
Playing, dreaming, dancing on my own
I keep trying to find that fearless heart that's running wild with
Nothing weighing heavy on my soul
Looking for the kid I used to know

All of these voices, it's hard to tune them out (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I should accept it, it ain't so simple now (No, no, yeah)

I wanna say whatever I want
Not even think about falling in love
Chasing the rainbows
And where did the time go?

Yeah, I know that I can't ever go back to the world when life was only
Playing, dreaming, dancing on my own
I keep trying to find that fearless heart that's running wild with
Nothing weighing heavy on my soul
Looking for the kid I used to know
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah
The kid I used to know
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, back when I learned to fly
And went outside the lines
Oh-oh

No, I can't ever go back to the world when life was only
Playing, dreaming, dancing on my own
I keep trying to find that fearless heart that's running wild
With nothing weighing heavy on my soul
Looking for the kid I used to know
