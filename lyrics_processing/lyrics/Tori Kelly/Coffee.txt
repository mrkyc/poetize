I envy the cup of coffee that kisses you every morning
That pillow caressing your cheek when you are tired and yawning (Mmm)
I'm jealous of the steering wheel you wrap your hands around
That seat belt's on your chest hearing your heart, holding you down
I envy the cup of coffee that kisses you every morning
Oh

Ooh, ooh-ooh
I would jump over the edge for you to get to you
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I'd walk an ocean to get to you (Next to you)

It's unfair 'cause I'm missing you way too much
I'm missing you, missing you way too much
And I'm wishing you were right here because
I'm missing you way, way too much
And I know that it's so silly of me
To be jealous of all these stupid things
But I'm missing you, missing you way too much
I'm missing you way, way, way too much
And it's unfair

Am I crazy to wanna hold you like the clothes on your body? (Oh-ooh)
I would trade places with the air that rushes by you so softly
Oh

Ooh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
I would jump over the edge for you, to get to you, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

It's unfair 'cause I'm missing you way too much
I'm missing you, missing you way too much
And I'm wishing you were right here because
I'm missing you way, way too much
And I know that it's so silly of me
To be jealous of all these stupid things
But I'm missing you, missing you way too much
I'm missing you way, way, way too much
And it's unfair

That you've got the things I need, but they're always out of reach (And it's unfair)
That I always have to dream to get you next to me
And it's unfair
Even the stars that shine get to see you at night (And it's unfair)
It all reminds me of you and maybe that's the reason why I'm always

Missing you way too much, yeah
I'm missing you, missing you way too much (Too much)
And I'm wishing you were right here because (Were right here because)
I'm missing you way, way, way too much (Oh, missing you)
And I know that it's so silly of me (To be jealous of all)
To be jealous of all these stupid things
But I'm missing you (But I'm missing you, yeah), missing you way too much
I'm missing you way, way, way too much
And it's unfair
And it's unfair
And it's unfair
And it's unfair
Said I'm missing you way too much
