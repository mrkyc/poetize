She don't smile too much
But when she does, it's just enough to make you smile back
She don't cry too much
But when she does, it's just enough to make you feel bad

She got dreams to be seen on screens by everyone
But underneath, truly, just wants to be known by anyone
She's in the fast lane, making big waves, so there's no time for her heart
Can't slow down now

She said it's easier to be an actress
Call me insane or call me an addict
But like champagne when it touches my lips
I can choose who I wanna be
Yeah, it's easier to be an actress
Fresh tear stains are found on the mattress
Hide my pain, I can never admit
That I'm sick of all this
But nuh-uh, it's easier to be an actress
Yeah
Oh-whoa

She don't fall in love
'Cause that would mean gotta let 'em see behind the mask, oh
And she don't know enough
About how beautiful she is without all the magic tricks that she's hiding
