Let me tell you, baby
Don't need no diamonds on my body
Got no green in my eyes
Can you feel me, yeah?
Got a brand-new Bentley
I'll tell you now, it makes no difference
Just want all of your time, yeah yeah yeah

Cause you kiss me like I'm dreaming
Like I'm one in a million
And I think it's time you figured it out, oh
Cause I know I've got that something
And it won't cost you nothing
I already feel expensive enough
Turn that gold into dust
That's what matters, matters
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money don't buy love

No, your money don't buy love

If I'm a king, power falling in my pocket
Get a diamond ring for my girl and her mama
Wonder why she still ain't callin'
Do you love me? I'm a man with a problem
Never found love, so went out and I bought it
And my two cents makes sense, I'm talkin'
Hey, girl, I'm here, no wallet
Whatever happened to the love in the moment?
A hug and I hold you, a hand to your shoulder, man, to feel closer
Runnin' to the date, number nine, no soda
Grab a milkshake, we'll be dancing, it's over
Grab a milkshake, we'll be dancing, it's over
Grab a milkshake, we'll be dancing, it's over
