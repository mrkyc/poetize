Let me choose my words real carefully
Don't let me be misunderstood, no
'Cause I don't wanna say something I don't really mean
I just wanna love you, love you, love you, love you real good

They always say, "Don't go to bed angry"
So it's been days since I got some sleep, babe
I say, "I miss you," you take it as I'm tryna guilt you
Like I'm insecure, oh
This quiet game ain't working out for me

Leave your pride, I'll leave mine

Lord knows I need patience with you
So I can explain this to you
I'm tryna learn your language, sugar
I just wanna love you, love you, love you good
We got issues, so what?
It's gonna be worth it when it's over
I'm tryna learn your language, sugar
So I can love you, love you, love you good
