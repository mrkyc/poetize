If I said I'm difficult sometimes
Say whatever comes to my mind
Would you stay with me any-anyway?
If you knew I made a lot of noise
Say whatever just to make my point
Would you stay with me any-anyway?

Well, this is the only Tori that I know how to be (how to be)
I'm sorry if that don't fit your reality (reality)
I'm giving one hundred percent of me, so take it all or leave
Whether you're in or out (out), this is what I'm about

Because I'm up, I'm down, I'm left, I'm right
I'ma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay, this is me any-anyway
I do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay, this is me any-anyway

Whoa, yeah (na-na-na-na-na-na)

Where to begin? Comfortable in my skin
I don't smoke, might drink, you act like it's a sin
While you out partying with men and women who pretend
I'm cool with being different while you hipsters blend in
My head's full of dreams and I feel like living them
Why you messin' with perfection? Inspiration's what I'm chasin' and
Take it or leave it, babe, I'm not gonna change
If you don't understand I don't need you anyway
