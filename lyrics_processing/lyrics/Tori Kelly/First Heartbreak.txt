You never hear me singing love songs, wasn't big on poetry
Never cried in the movies, didn't want to feel so weak
I would never talk about it, never let it get too deep
But something in me's changing; guess you did something to me

Cause for the first time, I get worried when I'm looking in your eyes
That one day, you might leave me, and it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you, cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me, that would be my first heartbreak

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
If you ever left me, that would be my first heartbreak

Maybe I shouldn't be thinking so far ahead
Better just enjoy this moment and be happy for what I get
But you know it's not that easy to get out of my head
So I guess that it's a good thing when you want something so bad

Cause for the first time, I get worried when I'm looking in your eyes
That one day, you might leave me, and it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you, cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me, that would be my first heartbreak

I wanna run, I wanna stay
Hold every piece so it won't break
Wanna let go, wanna hold tight
Afraid that I might suffocate
You with my love
How much is enough?
How much is too safe?

Cause for the first time, I get worried when I'm looking in your eyes
That one day, you might leave me, and it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you, cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me, that would be my first heartbreak
