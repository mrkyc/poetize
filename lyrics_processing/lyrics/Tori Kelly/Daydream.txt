Hold on to anything just so you don't crash
Fought off the empty lies that once ruled your past
Right when you think you've won, jump three steps back
So now you find yourself stuck in your own tracks

(Oooh) They tried to dirty up your name
(Oooh) But it's all a game
Baby, you don't have to know exactly who you are
Because figuring it all out could be the best part, oh

Don't quit your daydream
Don't forget to breathe
Who you wanna be is only up to you
Sometimes, you may crawl
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to

Tried almost everything, still spinning around
But one thing you haven't tried is "erase every doubt"
Keep both feet on the ground while your head's in the clouds
And when you feel like giving up, listen to these sounds
And make sure you

Don't quit your daydream
Don't forget to breathe
Who you wanna be is only up to you
Sometimes, you may crawl
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to

You don't have to know exactly who you are
Just let your heart lead
Its so worth the trials that you're going through
So just enjoy the fall and you'll land right where you want to

Don't quit your daydream (just take it slow)
Don't forget to breathe
Who you wanna be is only up to you (it's only up to you)
Sometimes, you may crawl (sometimes you may crawl, you gotta get back up again)
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to (oh)

Baby, don't you ever quit it
Baby, you don't have to know exactly who you are
