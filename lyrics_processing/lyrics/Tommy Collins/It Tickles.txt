I growed me a mustache on my lip
It wasn't very sticky, mostly fuzz
Thought I'd give all the girls a buzz
I got real sweet on Nellie Wills
I drove that country girl back in the hills
I asked her once if I could give her a peck
If'n you can beat me to the old hay stack
Well I beat her there and I hugged her tight
I turned loose all of my dynamite
I guess my kiss was pretty lush
She smiled real big and began to blush
It tickles, it tickles
I like it but it sure feels funny
It's a ticklin' me
Oh I got me a name in the neighbourhood
The girls all liked it, I knew they would
I let it grow for a month or two
Just to see what I could do
There was a girl named Fanny Smith
Told me she didn't like to kiss
I caught her off guard and I didn't miss
I didn't know it'd feel like this
You might also likeWell her eyes bugged out
Her face turned white
She hugged me up with all her might
I swear it took her breath away
She giggled and I heard her say
It tickles, it tickles
You sure are a lot of fun
It's a ticklin' me
Well I guess I pert'near run 'em wild
They all went crazy over my style
They said I was the best around
The kissinest man they'd ever found
The good ol' days are here again
I used to do it and I still can
Said a widder that I know
I guess you'll never get too old
Well I guess I got that ol' know-how
You ought to see me in action now
My kiss has still got that ol' sting
The widder says I ain't lost a thing
It tickles, it tickles
I feel just like I'm young again
