When I was nothing, nothing at all
I used to bleed for you
I just want to watch you fall
Baby, baby, baby
Leave me to rock and ruin
Baby, baby, baby
Never ever come home
You should've loved me baby
When redemption's too blind
Nature took my beauty
And sin left a scar
Time ravaged my body
And now I live in the house
With the red lights always on, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Shame on you
Oh, baby running away
Running away to you
Now I will wait for you
But I won't wait very long
I will wait for you
And when you bore me I'll be gone
And I will cheat on you
I will fuck you up
It's just in my nature, baby
Yeah well, there ain't nothing, nothing
There ain't nothing I can do to stop

Here comes the rain, yeah
Your blood is pumpin'
Good and evil
God and the devil
Ain't no one
Baby, your love's with me
Your love's with me
Your love with hate
I will fuck you up
I will feel no guilt
That's right, rub it in, rub it in
Can't get under you skin
You'll never get it out
You'll feel well
I'll mess with your head
Till you can't see straight
I watch your blood, it's pumping black
Cause baby, baby your love's with me
Here we go round
You're red and you're red
You writhing away
Run away
Your head's on fire
Can't tell the difference
Between hate and desire
Everything went all fucking wrong
Chaos reigns when I'm along
Fuck you up, won't get me out
Wash that stain under your skin
Can't wash it out cause I'd wash it in
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All my love's in vain
All my love's in blood
All my love's in vain
