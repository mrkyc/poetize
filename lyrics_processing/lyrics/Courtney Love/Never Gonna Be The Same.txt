Should've stood in your way
He lied
And everywhere a dream
Nothing came between
I died
Give me a way
I will not bleed for you
God comes down
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
And if you wanted water
And if you wanted food
And if you want shelter
I cannot come over to you
And if you want love now
Or a needle and a spoon
You gotta show a little faith in me
Now baby I can't come over to you
It's never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
God come on down
You might also likeAnd if you want my heart out
Sitting by the bay
Well the sun went down tomorrow
It will not come up today
And if you want love now
And wrapped your arms so cruel
If there's a god it's me
Now baby I cannot come over to you
It's never gonna be the same
She drew me in anyway
She lied
You gotta show a little faith
Your old rugged cross you made
What goes up must come down
And down and down and down, god
And if I wanted fame
All the glory all the womb?
And if I want my name emblazoned
On every light in you
And if I wanted Christ or
A Messiah by my side
I can't believe in anything
I know that Mary lied
I sucked you up today
Could've got away
Oh, Mary lied
Do you know
Can you feel it?
Do you feel me?
Yeah
And if you wanted madness
And if you want what's pure
Well you gotta come over to me
Baby, my light doesn't reach to you
And if you want love so
Unconditional and real
You gotta ride that black horse baby
Through the depths of hell that I've been
Follow me away
Yeah though I walk
I will be the same
Strongest one that's made
Through the valley of life
Never gonna be the same
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
Ah goodnight
