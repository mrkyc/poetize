Shut up!
I'm about to take all your innocence for free
In the end you're gonna wanna pay me any and everything
Shut up!
I'm about to tell you how I won the war
I'll tell you what or how or when and in the end you'll never ever ever ask what for

(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Are you talking to me?
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Breathe, baby, breathe!

Shut up!
I'm about to tell you about the difference you will never make
And win the war with no regrets, no hurt no pain no shame
Shut up!
I'm about to tell you some secrets you will never know
Now don't ask what don't moan don't cry don't even ask where this is going to go no no

(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Are you talking to me?
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Breathe, baby, breathe
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Are you talking to me?
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)

What's the matter?
My baby's dead
His heart went blind on me
My dress caught fire from one match that you gave me
And all that's left is your bail and the breath i got
Yeah I won't share in your misery cos your phone calls gone
And no one's coming
No one's coming
No one's coming
No one's coming for you!

(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
My dress is on fire
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Lets burn it down
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
I got no desires no one no one
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
But you leave the same day same year
Ring around the posy
Addicted to all that shit
Pocket full of real estate
Tax returns
And don't you hate when it all burns down
And dies and dies and dies and dies
