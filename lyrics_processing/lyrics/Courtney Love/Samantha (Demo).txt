Samantha, you swore
You'd never turned that trick before
Keep waiting for war
You'll never win, you'll lose again

I won't swing the balance in your favour
Your defeat is my favourite flavour

Samantha, you wore me out
Samantha, you used me up

Samantha, your war
Was a lost cause before I came
Keep praying, pray for
The pretty things you won't get back

Steal my soul and stab my back once more
But you'll come from dark alleyways to score once more

Samantha, you wore me out
Samantha, you burned me down
You might also like
Look in my eyes, there's nothing there, goodbye
Wanted you all with my whole life, goodnight
Wanted your life, Samantha

Well, no one can regain
Your innocence again
And your sins are pouring down like rain
But I love your angry pain
Go and hit the streets again
Cause theres nothing here for you
Leave the money by the bed!
In the gutter where you live!
And I'll throw it all away!
Yeah, I'll throw it in your face!
And if you were on fire
I would just throw kerosene!
And I love so much, I hate!
And I hate what you have seen of me!

Samantha! (You wore me out)
(Samantha, you used me up)

You used
Oh, don't look back
Baby, don't look back
Baby, don't look back to me
Baby, don't look back
Baby, don't look back
Baby, don't look back at me
And I live in this hole
And I die in this cage
And, oh, you hold the keys to the zoo
And I don't wanna go
But I can't seem to come
And it's not up to me
It's up to you
And the plane is on fire
And we're all gonna die
And we're all going down this time
You can lead a whore to water
You can lead a whore to freedom
But you can't drink away what's mine
