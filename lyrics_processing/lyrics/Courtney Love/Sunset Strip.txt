I got everything
I need from this world
Oh tonight, I got it right
Just one time
Cruising down the Sunset Strip
And there is nothing that's not
That's not within my grip
Oh tonight, I can fly
I can fly
Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
And I know, no tomorrow
Rockstar, popstar, everybody dies
All tomorrow's parties
They have happened tonight
And I know that I won't see tomorrow
Sitting on the Hollywood sign
Watching the girls get off the bus
Watching the danger in their eyes
When they leave with broken hearts
Their shredded valentines
You might also likeI came here from a dirty dark street
There was no one there to protect me
To make the nightmares go away
It has to sparkle
It has to shine
So hard
Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
And I know, no tomorrow
Rock star, pop star, everybody dies
All tomorrow's parties
They have happened tonight
And I know that I won't see tomorrow
Turn on all the porno please
Been drowning here for days
Bad food, bad sex, bad TV and internet
Take all these stupid pills away
Climb down the boulevard
I'm coming down so fast
I'm coming down so hard
And I've said I can't stop
All those voices in your head
I don't sleep, I never dream
I just shut them up
Now I just keep screaming run away
It's the last time
It's the last time
Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
No, I know, no tomorrow
Before the sparkle in my eyes
Turns to strichnine
While this bleeding heart is still a valentine
Gonna ride this thing until the wheels fall off
Cause girls like me, we always get what we want
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Diamond hard promises and million dollar bills
All the nights we wasted in the Hollywood Hills
Cause we know, we're to good for tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yesterday's girl or tomorrow's hot teens
Were you jerking off to her
Or were you jerking off to me?
And I know, that I won't know tomorrow
Yeah, you want my massive power
You want my porno ways
I'm throwing them out
It's a wonder that you wait
Lawsuit diamond's Guns n Rubies
Baby au revoir
You rock'n'roll bitches
You can get what you want
You were made for me and I was made to you
With the keys to the Bel Air and the chateau too
Your little shit coated world
It is rotten to the core
I didn't know you were born without a soul
I've got voices screaming in my head
Are you jerking off in your bed?
It's not punk, it's not cool
It's not even boring
And it's not Eminem who's gonna save me
It's for real life
They tried to steal my soul
I've got pills when I'm Famous
I've got pills when you're old
I've got pills cause I'm blonde
I've got pills cause you're dead
I've got pills cause I am the worst and best dressed
I've got pills cause I feel more than twentyone
Got pills cause I know, baby, you're not the one
I've got pills for my coochie
Cause baby, I'm sore
I've got pills cause you're fat
I've got pills cause I'm bored
Cruising down the Sunset Strip
And there is nothing that's not
That's not within my grip
Oh tonight, I got it right
