There's a ghost on the highway
And I want to run it down
There's a phantom in my bed
And I'm all alone now
I've seen every hotel
I've seen every hell
There's nothing I haven't done
There's no one I haven't had

Would you be there when the lights
When the lights get shot right out?
Would you be there when the roof
When the roof comes crumbling down?

And I know myself too well
And the Devil speaks to me
And he's got me pinned down now
Telling me I'm so empty
Oh, just say you're sorry now
And you'll never do it again
Take the edge right off and keep it
'Cause you'll never be high again
You might also like
Would you be there when the lights
When the lights get shot right out?
Would you be there when the roof
When the roof comes crashing down?
Would you be there when the Devil
When the Devil comes for me?
Would you be there when the lights
Go black and empty?

And I live in a box
And I die in this hole
And you hold the keys to this zip
And I don't wanna go
But I can't seem to come
And it's not up to me, it's up to you

And at all tomorrows parties
I will be there, not at one
And when you all start to miss me
Oh, just pass me the gun
And it's Valentine's again
And there's nothing here for me
Would you be there when the lights
When the lights come crashing down?
Would you be there when the roof
When the roof comes crumbling down?
Would you be there when the Devil
Takes me to the underground?
Would you be there when the night
Stays night all year round?

Would you be there in the ice?
In the frost and cold and freeze?
Would you be there any time?
