Follow me back to the Sunset Marquis
Lock ourselves into the room
Gamble it all and lose it on me
Until the sorry end
Until it happens again

And I can tell we are never gonna be friends
And I can tell that you're lost
And I can tell this is gonna have a bad end
Oh, baby, you were worth the cost

Till I'm black and blue, so cynical
How'd you get so resigned?
I have walked through scorn and ridicule
Oh, did I not see the signs?
Oh, descend, descend, and go, you must
Oh, walk your walk of shame
But I will have my revenge

Face down in front of the Sunset Marquis
You were the closest to God
We can do all the things that no one believes
People like us do
They haven't got a clue
You might also like
And I can tell this is going down in flames
You better burn me all the way
I hope you took some, some pleasure from my pain
I'll set the fires if you just pray

And it's all goodbye, how cheaply
And how fast you sell your soul
That's the stupidest thing I have heard
Now how low can you go?
And I am not crippled any longer
No, I can dance again
But I will have my revenge
Oh, I will have my revenge

Lock ourselves in at the Sunset Marquis
Set the room on fire
Play happy neighbors from bad families
Oh, baby, you could move
You could light up a room
But the light's gone obscene
It sure looked real to me

And I can tell that you have come to burn me down
And I am atrophied in ashes
And this will end in tears with all lost and none found
It's just a story you can cash in
And no one knows where we go
And I know that you don't care
But you are the overseer
Of the depths of my despair
And it's glorious and dead
And I know that you are there
But you're the one unfortunate
