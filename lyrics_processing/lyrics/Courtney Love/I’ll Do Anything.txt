Yeah, you need to be free
Yeah, your hungry huddled masses
Screaming "Me! Me! Me!"
Give me danger, give me sorrow
Give me heat, give me grime
Give me, give me empathy
Give me, give me everything
C'mon, give me from behind!
(Woo hoo!)
Throw me up against the wall!
(Woo hoo!)
Oh, baby, do that again!
(Woo hoo!)
Oh, baby, I'll do you
'Cause you, you, you, you'll do anything!
Give me white boys skinny
Give me big black men
Give me ice cream on my birthday
Oh, give me that again!
Give me love, love, love
Give me me, me, me
'Cause I'll do you 'cause you'll do anything
You might also likeGive me dick, give me speed
Give me white hot heat
One day my prince will come
But man, it's just too late!
Give me one match so I can set myself on fire
Let them eat cake until they all starve!
Give me one light that pulls down on me so hard
Twist it like a miracle
Blast your heart to shards
(Woo hoo!)
Throw me up against the wall!
(Woo hoo!)
Oh, baby, do that again!
(Woo hoo!)
Oh, baby, I'll do you
'Cause you, you, you, you'll do anything!
Give me white boys skinny
Give me big black men
Give me ice cream on my birthday
Oh, give me that again!
Give me love, love, love
Give me me, me, me
'Cause I'll do you 'cause you'll do anything
Give me some last solutions
Give it to your hand
Give it to me
C'mon baby give me and pray
You're a star
It's your show
I got the power to heal
God or the devil just give me a deal
Give me love, love, love
Give me me, me, me
'Cause I will do you 'cause you'll do anything
I'm ready to die for you
No, I'm too young to be this old
Don't scratch the car when you go
(Woo hoo!)
(Throw me up against the wall)
Don't slam the door when you go
(Woo hoo!)
(No baby do that again)
I'll burn the sheets when you go
(Woo hoo!)
(No baby, I'll do you cause)
Just fucking go when you go when you go
(You, you, you, you'll do anything)
