(I got my) I got my hand on my nutsac bellin' 'cross the stage
In a motherfuckin' rage like a animal in a cage (Rage)
I catch wrecks like a junkyard fool (Fool)
Fuck around and get'cha holdin that jar, Cool!
Yep that's me on the motherfuckin' mic-a (mic-a)
Nova, hyper strikin' niggas like a viper
Who wants to step to the rep that I kept
For a long, long, long, long, long, long, time
I got more flavor then a truck load of Snickers
Ya punch her by the straps, ya got ta kick her, fuck it!
That's how it go when ya dealin' with a pro-per
I got my hand on the mic and I'm about to let it flow
Coolio locc and I'm down to blast
Peter Piper picked a paper, pick a pepper's and I jacked his ass
Motherfuckers curse me, but they can't hurt me
When I'm doin dirt, that's why I show no mercy
I flips tha scripts and it's tha dips when I rips
And rock tha fuckin, house for the Bloods and Crips
Danger danger, ol' gangsta gangsta
Droppin' dogs on the wanksta pranksta
40 Thevz and the band with a plan to make some stops
Niggas die on the street but they don't play taps
Or a 21 gun salute, there in cahoots
My name ain't Alex Haley but I still got roots, uh
Bang, bang, bang to the air now ya dead
It was a black and white thang but now it's blue and red
This ain't an episode of Batman, it's more'n like a Blackman
Slap yo' ass up and I jacked ya for ya Walkman
Niggas on the top and you don't deserve nothin'
They frontin' they punks, their whack as fuck, their shit ain't even bumpin'
Suckas play the back 'cause I'm dope when I rap
And my hand's on my motherfuckin' nutsac
And it's like that!
You might also like
It's time for me to step so I'm steppin' in deep (Deep)
I was born a thief so ya know I'm on the creep
Sucka nigga wanna test me but he can't best me
Buck-buck to the chest and I guess you're a dead flea
Now I gotta treat ya like a sucka
'Cause you're soft like butter, you punk motherfucker
C-C-Coolio but you can call me who?
I drop da shit on ya lyrics 'cause ya rhyme style is doo-doo
Ass, feces, you don't wanna see me
With a flashlight 'cause I serve that ass (Right, right, right)
Word to the motherfuckin' homies and you know you can't hold me
Or throw me... so blow me
How many niggas must I stick
Before you get my drift and fully understand not to fuck with this
I never been a stoner, take ya momma home and bone her
One night stand and once again she's a loner
'Cause I won't be played out, strung out, laid out
She only gave it up because she thought I had some clout
And I won't be strayed by a lame ass dame
Keep my dollars in my pockets 'cause I'm hip to ya game
Ho's be acting like they love me but they only wanna fuck me
And suck me, but don't touch me
Back up off me hooker 'cause I won't be taken
Go find you another motherfucker you can break it
I gots ta keep playin these niggas like ping-pong
And hit 'em like King Kong, you're singin' the same song
'93 is the year and yes I'm gettin' bigger
Gave a shot to the 121 'cause they my niggas
Scotty B ridin' shotgun, BOOM he got one
Only God knows if he'll catch a hot one
Knick-knack paddy-wack Wino's in the back
And my hand's on my motherfuckin' nutsac
And it's like that
I got my hand on my nutsac
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I got my hand on my nutsac
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I got my hand on my nutsac
Na-na-na-na-na-na
