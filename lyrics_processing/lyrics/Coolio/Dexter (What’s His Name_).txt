Mandark, take a hike

While Dexter takes his bike
Makes a rocket and speeds into the night

But you better tune in to see what Dexter is doin'
I'll meet you in the laboratory
If not, drinkin' juice and look out the window
And watch the morning-glories grow

Before aliens overtake us
Eatin' and steak us
Barbecue and bake us
Like dinner and breakfast
But whose got technology to save the world?
