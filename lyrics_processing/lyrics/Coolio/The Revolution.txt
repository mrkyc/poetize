From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali
I'm callin' rally to the homies in the street light
Take a real close at what it look like
A young nigga in the ghetto raised up on grift
The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit
Playin tag with body bags
Bullets
And bloody rags
Intent to put the dodge on the toe tag
Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow
Cuz life is full of hardships, pimp slaps, and sorrow
Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do
Make sure what you believe is real and true
Fuck the lies an' alibis, I come to realize
My visual assault are wasted on blind eyes
Like AT&T ya gotta make a switch
Or get pushed to the side like a lil' ol' bitch....
-Chorus-
When the Revolution come I'mma be up front
With my finger on the trigger of a Mossberg Pump
When the Revolution come I'mma be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair
I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah
Lootin' an' shootin'
Out doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in
Niggas don't be doin' what they 'posed to do
They betta post on the corner with the busta crew
Playin' games I used to play back in '79
With the same bullshit an' the same ol' line
If you want some residual be an individual
On a nigga nuts cuz he rollin' in a Sixty-fo'
Your favorite line is fuck all a y'all
But one day there's gonna be a final call
That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep
Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep
So pull your money out your pocket an' put it in the middle
This ain't no rooster ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....
You might also like-Chorus-
Way back in the days we used to sling 'em in the street
But now when niggas get beat
They wanna go an' get their heat
Everybody know that you know how to kill
But tell me do you how to let a nigga live
I've got a dream that maybe one day
Niggas can fight then walk away
I'm talkin' fisticuffs, put them pistols up, an'
Shoot 'em from the shoulders
To show that you can hold your
I sing the song of the plight of the black man
In America
In a state of hysteria
No longer will I accept the second rate
I plan to set the record straight before I dissipate
It's the one - two combination punch to the throat
There's a hole in ya boat bitch
That's all she wrote
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....
-Chorus-
When the Revolution come I'mma be straight loc'
Going out in a cloud of pistol smoke
