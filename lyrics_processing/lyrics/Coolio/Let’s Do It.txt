Another Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
I'm down with the 40, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry
I need some come-uppance, peep this, but not up in my stomach
I wanna chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Something's on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, "Let's go the spot
Where the drinks is cold and the girls ain't too hot"
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty
Rats run around the room, but wait, I spoke too soon
Aw, damn, look what done walked in
Pumps and a bump, breath smellin' like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe someday me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song and you can write me a love letter
You might also like
Baby, you can do it (Let's do it)
Take your time, do it right (Get to it)
You can do it, baby (Let's do it)
Baby (Get to it)
Baby, you can do it (Let's do it)
Take your time, do it right (Get to it)
You can do it, baby (Let's do it)
Baby (Get to it)

Damn, I'm feelin frisky, come and sit down with me
Conversate about hanky-panky and a little dranky-wanky
Tell me bout your innermost thoughts, wants, needs and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine, we can spend some quality time
You want a man with vision who ain't afraid to listen
I wanna mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And I just want a regular, old-fashioned, hot hoochie mama
With love for her daddy anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or some filet mignon and still let me know I'm the man
I'm the doctor and you can play the nurse
But we got to have patience, even though we hella anxious
Let's take it slow and proceed with caution
'Cause love just don't come 'round here too often
So take my number and we'll get together later
And I'll take yours, I'm out like the L.A. Raiders
Baby, you can do it (Let's do it)
Take your time, do it right (Get to it)
You can do it, baby (Let's do it)
Baby (Get to it)
Baby, you can do it (Let's do it)
Take your time, do it right (Get to it)
You can do it, baby (Let's do it)

A few months went by with phone calls and some dinners
Moonlit nights with Marvin Gaye, Dramatics, and The Spinners
Top down on the 'Vette watching California sunsets
And pretty soon we developed that respect
That we needed so we was here to get the relationship heated
And hot and bothered, know what I'm meanin'?
It started slow with some kisses and some touches
A few more weeks went by 'cause we didn't wanna rush it
They say a fast horse don't win no races
And I'm a witness 'cause real winners always take steady paces
Hand in hand, woman to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me and
We made love for the first time
In the right way, in the perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot more than your average bump and grind
You better get yours, 'cause I got mine
Baby, you can do it (Let's do it)
Take your time, do it right (Get to it)
You can do it, baby (Let's do it)
