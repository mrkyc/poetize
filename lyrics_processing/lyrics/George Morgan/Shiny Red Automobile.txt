I pulled out of St. Paul and started my haul
Just as lonesome as a trucker can feel
And from the corner of my eye, I saw her flash by
In a shiny red automobile
Well, she winked her taillight and then she passed out of sight
I wondered if the vision was real
So I let my Jimmy roll, and I made it my goal
To catch that shiny red automobile

Well, it started to rain and I slowed down again
There were dangerous curves up ahead
Then my foot hit the floor as down the highway I saw
Another flash of shiny red
It was the radar patrol, and he'd seen my billfold
But I guess she must've got a better deal
I went down in their files while she paid with a smile
In her shiny red automobile

When she stopped to get gas, not wanting to pass
I pulled in and then I started to chat
But she gave me the breeze until I shook at the knees
And she thought she'd put a finish to that
So I said with a smile, "I guess I'll cool it for a while
If you're sure that's the way that you feel"
But when she moved down the road and I kept dragging my load
Behind a shiny red automobile

We made pretty good time to the Alabama line
When she threw a rod and waved my Jimmy down
Then she swallowed her pride and said she'd pay for the ride
If only I would take her into town
But the pretty young queen had to blow the whole scene
I had a swinging thing waiting in Mobile
So I left her high and dry and wondering why
In her shiny red automobile

So I left her high and dry, and wondering why
