You've been tryin' to keep your head up
Your head above the water
You've been lookin' for the sunlight
But it's only gettin' darker
I can see the fear in your eyes
Doin' all you can to survive
You've been tryin' to keep your head up
Your head above the water

Hold on to my promise
When your world comes unglued (Take a deep breath, I am right here)
You can rest your heart, just be still
I'll fight for you

There ain't nothin' I can't handle
There's nothin' that I won't do
And when you're losin' in the battle (I'm right here)
I am gonna rescue you
I'll chase away the tears from your eyes
Gonna keep you safe, you are mine
There ain't nothin' I can't handle
And there's nothin' that I won't do, won't do (There's nothin' that I won't do)

Hold on to my promise (Hold on to my promise)
When your world comes unglued (I'm gonna be right here)
You can rest your heart, just be still (Don't be afraid)
I'll fight for you (I'm gonna fight, I'm gonna fight for you)
(I'm right here)

(Take a deep breath, take a deep breath)
I'll fight for you
(Take a deep breath, you can just be still)

I'll be your lifeline (I'll be your lifeline)
I'll be your sunrise (I'll be your sunrise)
I'll be your soldier (And I'll be your soldier)
You can stand on my shoulders (You can stand on my shoulders)
When you get tired (Oh, when you get tired)
When you walk through the fire (You don't wanna walk through the fire)
I'll be your soldier (Oh, I'll be your soldier)
You can stand on my shoulders (You can stand on my shoulders)

Hold on to my promise (Oh, yeah)
When your world comes unglued (Oh-oh, woah-oh)
You can rest your heart, just be still (You can rest, be still)
I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you
'Cause this battle isn't yours
