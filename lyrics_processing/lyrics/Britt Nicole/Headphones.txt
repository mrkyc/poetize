She gave it her best
She tried to fit in
She tried to be cool
But she never could win
Her mom says she's great
The kids think she's weird
Honestly she wish she could disappear

Why you try, try to be like the rest of them
When you know there's so much more within
There's only one you
Here's what ya' gotta do
Whoa, whoa

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones

He gets in his car
He falls apart

And now it's breaking his heart
He wants to give up
Wants to try again

Hey, you might not see it with your eyes
But keep your head up to the sky
The sun is coming through
Here's what you gotta do
Whoa, whoa

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones

Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones

So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders
It's alright, no, it's not over
Love is here, it came to dry up all your tears
Oh, can you feel it?
Gotta believe it, gotta see it
By your side in the middle of the night
So keep your head up high and the dust off your shoulders
It's alright, no it's not over
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones

So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders
(Coming through your headphones)
So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders
(Coming through your headphones)

Twinkle, twinkle in your eye
Listen to this lullaby
The sun is shining in the sky
I see love it's in your eye
This ain't the first time you felt like this
This ain't the first time, this ain't the first time
This ain't the last time you'll feel like this
But it'll be fine
