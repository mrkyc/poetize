Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

You see my anxious heart
You see what I am feeling
And when I fall apart, You are there to hold me
How great Your love for me
Now I see what You're thinking
You say I'm beautiful
Your voice is my healing

Without You I just can't get back
So I'm

Hanging on to every word you speak
Cause it's all that I need
Hangin on to every word you say
To light up my way
Even every little whisper I'm
Hanging on as if it were my life
I'm hanging on
You might also like
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

And when the darkness falls
I can't see what's before me
Your voice is like the tongue
Always there to guide me

Without You I just can't get back
So I'm

Hanging on to every word you speak
Cause it's all that I need
Hangin on to every word you say
To light up my way
Even every little whisper I'm
Hanging on as if it were my life
I'm hanging on

You know me better than I know myself
Mm, better than anybody else
Your love is sounding like a ringing bell
Oh, oh, I won't let go
Oh oh, oh oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh oh, oh oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Hanging on to every word you speak
Cause it's all that I need
Hangin on to every word you say
To light up my way
Even every little whisper I'm
Hanging on as if it were my life
I'm hanging on
Hanging on to every word you speak
Cause it's all that I need
Hangin on to every word you say
To light up my way
Even every little whisper I'm
Hanging on as if it were my life
I'm hanging on

Oh oh, oh oh (You know myself)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh oh, oh oh (Ringing bell)
