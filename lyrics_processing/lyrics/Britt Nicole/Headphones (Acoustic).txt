She gave it her best
She tried to fit in
She tried to be cool
But she never could win
Her mom says she's great
The kids think she's weird
Honestly she wish she could disappear

Why you try, try to be like the rest of them
When you know there's so much more within
There's only one you
Here's what ya' gotta do
Whoa, whoa

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones

He gets in his car
He falls apart
It came to an end
And now it's breaking his heart
He wants to give up
Wants to try again
Honestly he doesn't know what he's feeling
You might also like
Hey, you might not see it with your eyes
But keep your head up to the sky
The sun is coming through
Here's what you gotta do
Whoa, whoa

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through ya

So keep your head up high and dust off your shoulders
It's alright, no, it's not over
Love is here, it came to dry up all your tears
Oh, can you feel it?
You gotta believe it, you gotta see it
By your side in the middle of the night
Keep your head up high and the dust off your shoulders
It's alright, no it's not over

Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your headphones
Lo-o-o-ove is coming through your
A twinkle, twinkle in your eye
Listen to this lullaby
The sun is shining in the sky
I see love, it's in your eyes
This ain't' the first time you felt like this, no
This ain't the first time, this aitn' the first time
This ain't the last time you'll feel like this
But it'll be fine
