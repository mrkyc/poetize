Have you ever felt, oh
Have you ever felt like that?
Like you just, just rushing through life
Like you don't have time for your friends or the world outside
Well, I've been there
We gotta slow down, take a look around
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?
It's keeping you and me;
From who we need to be

I wanna look like love
Be more than just enough
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy
If we're all they ever see
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like love

Let me be the first to admit
There are days that I just don't have the strength to give
Don't wanna stay there
Looking at me missin' everything
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?
Instead of doing nothing;
We gotta do something
You might also like
I wanna look like love
Be more than just enough
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy
If we're all they ever see
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like love

If I believe there's a Savior
Is the proof in me?
Is He alive and breathing?
Is He what they'll remember?
Is He what they see?
When they look at me
Do I look like, look like love?
Do I look like, look like love?

I wanna look like love
Be more than just enough
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone
It's up to you and me, to leave a legacy
If we're all they ever see
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like love
I wanna look like love
I wanna look like love
I wanna look like love
I wanna look like love
I wanna look like, look like, look like love
I wanna look like, look like, look like love
