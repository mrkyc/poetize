Here I go 'round and 'round again
Venti Chai, you're my closest friend
Lack of sleep is what I do
Starbucks will rescue me again
Work, more work, and somewhere to be
Skip the talk, can't you just text me?
I'm on slow-down, I'm on it
I'm going crazy

'Cause when it's work all day
I cannot escape
I just stop to think, and I'm going crazy
Take a break, hey
Sometimes you got to
Be still and breathe, baby
Here we go, better believe
We can up and leave

Take some time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)
Take my time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)

Is this boy the one? Are we meant to be?
What to wear? Got to look pretty
Maybe I should go solo
Forget it, I'm ready to go where there's no
No more drama to mess up my flow
No more questions to answer (no)
Pack my bags ya'll, I'm outtie
(Flight leaves Gate 17)

'Cause when it's work all day
I cannot escape
I just stop to think, and I'm going crazy
Take a break, hey
Sometimes you got to
Be still and breathe, baby
Here we go, better believe we can up and leave

Take some time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)
Take my time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)
(Rock, rock the beat)
(Rock, rock the beat)
(Rock, rock the beat)
(Rock, rock the beat)

No laptop-bringing
Or cell phone ringing
You know the feeling
When hits, you are singing
I'll kick back and enjoy the sun on my face
The time of my life, baby, it's time to play

If you're ready for a holiday, holiday
Rock the beat, hands in the air
If you're ready for a holiday, holiday
Rock the beat, rock the beat, ay

Take some time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)
Take my time and kick back
I'm on chill and relax
(Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah)
(I'm away on holiday)
(Rock, rock the beat)
(Rock, rock)
(Rock, rock the beat)
Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah
I'm away on holiday (Rock, rock)
(Rock, rock the beat)
(Rock, rock)
Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah (Rock, rock)
