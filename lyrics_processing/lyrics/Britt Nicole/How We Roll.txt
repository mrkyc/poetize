I know that everyone's running
Just tryin' to get away (you, you can't get away)
Life can feel a lot like a rat race
Like everyday is so mundane
But I am saying

Hey, hey, oh, oh
I'm not getting caught in the undertow
I'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow
I'm never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll

Why don't you come on and join us?
Take your nose off the grindstone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Take, take your hands off the keyboard
And put down the iPhone
And let me hear you say
You might also like
Hey, hey, oh, oh
We ain't getting caught in the undertow
We'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow
We're never gonna follow, no

Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll
Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll

Don't fold under the pressure
A smile can make it better
Whoa, you know, you know, yeah
Don't fold under the pressure
A smile can make it better
And if everything goes wrong
Keep singin' this song
Turn it up, make it loud
You, you can't get away
Yeah, don't, don't try to get away
Turn it up, make it loud
You, you can't get away
Yeah, don't, don't try to get away, oh no
Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go
Everybody knows
That's how we roll
That's how we roll
Turn it up, make it loud on your radio
We are gonna dance everywhere we go (everywhere we go)
Everybody knows that's how we roll
That's how we roll

That's how we roll
Gonna dance everywhere we go
