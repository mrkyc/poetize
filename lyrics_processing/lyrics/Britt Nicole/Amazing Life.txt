It's a beau-beau-beautiful world we've been given
From the top of the sky to the ocean
I'll never understand it all (Never understand it all)
It must be supernatural
It's a ma-ma-magical thing, a starry night
Feel, feel so small under a billion lights
Never understand it all (Never understand it all)
It must be supernatural

Amazing life
Amazing life
Flying higher than I've ever dreamed (I've ever dreamed)
From the top of the world I could scream (World, I could scream)
Amazing life
Amazing life

It's a colorful, colorful world painted so bright
Gonna walk on air, gonna take flight
I'll never understand it all (Never understand it all)
It must be supernatural
You might also likeI wanna drink, drink, drink every drop of sunshine
Got a smile on my face, I won't apologize
I'll never understand it all (Never understand it all)
It must be supernatural

Amazing life

Flying higher than I've ever dreamed (I've ever dreamed)
From the top of the world I could scream (World, I could scream)

You're the burning in my heart
That never dies, never dies
Without You here, my world
Is black and white, black and white
Like a show without a stage
Like a storm without the rain
You are the one I can't replace
Need You by my side, need You by my side
