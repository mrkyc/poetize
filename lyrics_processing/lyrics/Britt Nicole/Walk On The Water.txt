You look around
It's staring back at you
Another wave of doubt
Will it pull you under?
You wonder:
What if I am overtaken?
What if I never make it?
What if no one's there?
Will You hear my prayer?

When you take that first step
Into the unknown
You know that He won't let you go

So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities try to alter you
You know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water too

So get out and let your fear fall to the ground
No time to waste, don't wait
And don't you turn around and miss out
On everything you were made for (gotta be)
I know you're not sure
So you play it safe, you try to run away
You might also like
If you take that first step
Into the unknown
He won't let you go

So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities try to alter you
You know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water too

(Step out) Even when it's storming
(Step out) Even when you're broken
(Step out) Even when your heart is tellin' you
Tellin' you to give up
(Step out) When your hope is stolen
(Step out) You can't see where you're going
You don't have to be afraid
So what are you waiting, what are you waiting for?

So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities try to alter you
You know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water
