We are broken
In the right places
Heart's been stolen
So many faces
You came runnin' in
They all were runnin' out
You were savin' me
You coulda saved yourself

And when I'm screaming at night
You're holding me tight
When I'm down in the ring, you finish the fight
When I'm pullin' away, you know what to say
And I know that we'll survive

Even when we're in too deep
We're solid like concrete
The heartbreak is over tonight
Cause we found each other
We won't buckle under
We'll break the edge of the knife
'Cause you and me are concrete
You and me are concrete
You might also like
Wrote our names
Carved in the pavement
On the boulevard
Everyone can see it
And through the footsteps, the cracks and the weights
And all of the stuff in between
Yeah it's still there
And we're still here

And when I'm screaming at night
You're holding me tight
When I'm down in the ring, you finish the fight
When I'm pullin' away, you know what to say
And I know that we'll survive

Even when we're in too deep
We're solid like concrete
The heartbreak is over tonight
'Cause we found each other
We won't buckle under
We'll break the edge of the knife
Cause you and me are concrete
You and me are concrete
Even if the demons try and get you
I'll be standing there right by your side
Everytime (everytime)
There's no mistake that you can make
That's ever gonna make me walk away

Even when we're in too deep
We're solid like concrete
The heartbreak is over tonight, tonight
Cause we found each other
We won't buckle under
We'll break the edge of the knife
'Cause you and me are concrete
You and me are concrete

Concrete
Concrete
