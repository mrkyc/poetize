(Da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Comin' back to You)

I've been looking for love in another's eyes
Searching for water, but I come up dry
Thought that I could find
Happiness in the world's applause
Peace of mind in a worthy cause
Take me back, take me back

Go to trust in the simple truth
Got to trust all I really need is

You
I'm comin' back to You
The only thing I know worth living for
Will You take this heart and make it more like You?
I give it back to You
It's obvious no one could love me more
I'm Yours
And I'm comin', comin' back
You might also like
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I'm comin', comin' back
(Yeah, I'm comin', yeah, I'm comin' back)

To joy that speaks to my deepest need
Arms never far out of reach (La, la, la, la)
Yeah, how Your love it
Calls to me when I lose my way
Holds me close when I feel afraid (La, la, la, la)
Take me back, take me back

Got to trust that I'm safe and sound
Got to trust that it all comes down to

You
I'm comin' back to You
The only thing I know worth living for
Will You take this heart and make it more like You?
I give it back to You (I give it back to You)
It's obvious no one could love me more
I'm Yours
And I'm comin', comin' back
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I'm comin', comin' back
(Yeah, I'm comin', yeah, I'm comin' back)

So no more getting caught in the middle
No more waiting for what is unsure
Back to Your love so true and so simple
Don't understate it or complicate it
It's so simple
Yeah, it's so simple
(Da-da-da-da-da-da)

It's You
I'm comin' back to You

I give it back to You (I give it back to You)
It's obvious no one could love me more

And I'm comin', comin' back
