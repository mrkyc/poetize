Illuminating lights under my skin
Radiation so intoxicating, burnin' within
Feel the heat slowly risin'
The beat that's hypnotizin'
A wonder
Can you feel it?

Fire that's so contagious
It's taking over me
And you can't stop it

Oh, oh
Turn the lights down so we can
Glow, glow
Watch us come alive, we're gonna
Show you something real
Like a city on a hill
Oh, oh
We're gonna glow-oh-oh-oh

They see us coming from miles away
There's no hidin', no denyin'
Cause we're not ashamed
With our hands up in the air
Boys and girls, they start starin'
It's a wonder
Can you feel it?
You might also like
We will not be silent
Won't hide it
The time is now
And you can't stop us

Oh, oh
Turn the lights down so we can
Glow, glow
Watch us come alive, we're gonna
Show you something real
Like a city on a hill
Oh, oh
We're gonna glow-oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh here we go
Welcome to the show
Lights shinin', so blindin'
From our head to our toes
When this room blacks out
You know we will stand out
So come on, oh
We're gonna glow-oh
Oh, oh
Turn the lights down so we can
Glow, glow
Watch us come alive, we're gonna
Show you something real
Like a city on a hill
Oh, oh
We're gonna glow-oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh
Turn the lights down so we can
Glow, glow
Watch us come alive, we're gonna
Show you something real
Like a city on a hill
Oh, oh
We're gonna glow

Oh, oh here we go (glow)
(Like a shooting star)
(We'll li-li-li-light up your heart)
Oh, oh here we go (glow)
(Like a shooting star)
(We'll li-li-li-light up your heart)
Oh, oh here we go
Glow, glow
Oh, oh here we go
(We'll show you something real)
Ah, ah
