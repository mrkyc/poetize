You look around
Staring back at you
Another wave of doubt
Will it pull you under?
You wonder
What if I'm overtaken?
What if I never make it?
What if no one's there?
Will You hear my prayer?

When you take that first step
Into the unknown
He won't let you go

So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities, they try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes, and you can walk on the water, too

So get out, and let your fear fall to the ground
No time to waste, don't wait
And don't you turn around and miss out
On everything you were made for (gotta be)
I know you're not sure
So you play it safe, you try to run away
You might also like
But when you take that first step
Into the unknown
He won't let you go

So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities, they try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes, and you can walk on the water

Step out, even when it's storming
Step out, even when you're broken
Step out, even when your heart is telling you
It's telling you to give up
Step out, when your hope is stolen
You can't see where you're going
You don't have to be afraid
No, no, no
So what are you waiting?
What are you waiting for?
Oh, there's so much more
So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities, they try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes, and you can walk on the water
Walk on the water, too

You can walk
La la la, la la la la la
Oh, we can walk
