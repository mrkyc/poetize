Like a star, like a star
Whoah
Satellite
Like a star, like a star

Been workin' overtime
And gettin' sick of these crazy games
I'll be a satellite
And wait for someone to enter my gaze

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder:
When you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them
Like a star in the sky?

You got me fallin' for ya
And I won't stop 'til I hit the clouds
See I don't wanna hide these feelings
Or even try to figure them out
You might also like
Sparks flyin' all around, electricity
Dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet off the ground, no gravity
Fly with me, fly with me

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder:
When you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them
Like a star in the sky?

Satellite, yeah
You and I identify
I see you like a star in the sky
