When life has cut too deep and left you hurting
The future you had hoped for is now burning
And the dreams you held so tight lost their meaning
And you don't know if you'll ever find the healing

You're gonna make it
You're gonna make it
And the night can only last for so long
Whatever you're facing
If your heart is breaking
There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
Lift up your eyes and see
The sun is rising (The sun is rising)
The sun is rising (The sun is rising)

Every high and every low you're gonna go through
You don't have to be afraid, I am with you (I am with you)
In the moments you're so weak you feel like stopping
Let the hope you have light the road you're walking

You're gonna make it
You're gonna make it
The night can only last for so long
Whatever you're facing
If your heart is breaking
There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
Lift up your eyes and see
The sun is rising
You might also like
Even when you can't imagine how
How you're ever gonna find your way out
Even when you're drowning in your doubt
Just look beyond the clouds
(The sun is rising, the sun is rising)
Just look beyond the clouds
(The sun is rising, the sun is rising)

Whatever you're facing
If your heart is breaking
There's a promise for the ones who just hold on
Lift up your eyes and see
The sun is rising
(The sun is rising, the sun is rising)
Yeah (The sun is rising), whoa, yeah

(The sun is rising)
Even when you can't imagine how
(The sun is rising)
How you're ever gonna find your way out
(The sun is rising)
Even when you're drowning in your doubt
Just look beyond the clouds
(The sun is rising)
Even when you can't imagine how
(The sun is rising)
How you're ever gonna find your way out
(The sun is rising)
Even when you're drowning in your doubt
