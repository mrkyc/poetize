I know you

Don't think you're beautiful
Cause we don't look like
The girls on the cover of Vogue
But I wish I

Could show you what I see
Like a, a mirror to a fine painting

You got it
A work of art
Work of art, whoa

Work of art, whoa

Oh, I want you to go, oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out loud whoa
Oh, I want you to go, oh
And shout it out loud
Shout it out

Comparing is poison
It's killing you and me
The lies of perfection
We ain't gonna believe

Could show you what I see
On the outside, on the inside
That's true masterpiece

Beautifully created
By the one who made the stars

Let the truth invade our heart
