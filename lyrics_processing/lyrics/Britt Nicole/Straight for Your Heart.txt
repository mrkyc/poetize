(Straight for your heart)
(Straight for your heart)

I see you, I see you so clear
I know you, you wanna disappear
You wonder who would notice
If you gave up the fight
Some days you feel invisible
Out of sight

Right here, right now
Tonight

I'm comin' straight for your heart
I'm bringin' light to the dark
It's gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All it takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
'Cause you're never too far
No, you're never too far
You might also like
I'm comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) Straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)

You're heart beats, but it's just keeping time
You're living, but you don't feel alive
The world outside is turning
While yours is lying still
In the cycle, spinning spiral
Holding you until

Right here, right now
Tonight

I'm comin' straight for your heart
I'm bringin' light to the dark
It's gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All it takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
'Cause you're never too far
No, you're never too far
I'm comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) Straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)

You don't have to walk this road alone
I'll hold you, hold you
You don't have to live this life alone
I know you, know you
Even in the dark night, I'll be there
Even when you can't fight, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there

I'm comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) (Straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)

I'm comin' straight for your heart
I'm bringin' light to the dark
It's gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All it takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
'Cause you're never too far
No, you're never too far
I'm comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) Comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) Comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) Comin' straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart)

You don't have to walk this road alone
I'll hold you, hold you
You don't have to live this life alone
