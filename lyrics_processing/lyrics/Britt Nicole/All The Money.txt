No house in Bel Air could ever compare
To the way you're good to me
No 'round the world cruise
Could rock me like you
You knock me right off my feet
It's hard to describe
But I'm feeling like I won the lottery
It's not your car, boy it's your heart
That makes me feel like a queen

Cause a car can't kiss goodnight
And a diamond can't hold me tight
Now I know

All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love 'bout you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love
What I love 'bout you
What I love 'bout you
La la la la la la la love
What I love 'bout you
What I love 'bout you
La la la la la la la love
You might also like
A bonfire night or red carpet lights
Just wanna be where you are
A living room dance, a castle in France
As long as I'm in your arms
You're sweet to the core
Can I ask for more?
You know that's my favorite part
It's not your car, boy, it's your heart
That makes me feel like a star

Cause a car can't kiss goodnight
And a diamond can't hold me tight
Now I know

All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love 'bout you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love
What I love 'bout you
What I love 'bout you
La la la la la la la love
What I love 'bout you
What I love 'bout you
La la la la la la la love
I've been tryna find love for a long time
I've been tryna find a love that is all mine
We make it last for life
Me and you forever be like paradise
I've been tryna find love for a long time
I've been tryna find a love that is all mine
We make it last for life
Me and you forever be like paradise

All the money in the world (me and you forever be like paradise)
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love

All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love 'bout you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I see in you
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy what I love

La la la la la la la love
