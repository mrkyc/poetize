Dreams, they come, plans, they change
Yeah, we're gonna break, yeah, we're gonna break
Things we face make us who we are
Baby, you're a star shinin' in the dark
Let's go back to the summer, the summer when
We dreamed in love, let's go back again
Let's go back again, yeah, back again, my friend
To the summer when

I'm holdin' a picture from seven years back
I smile at the memory, it's smilin' right back at me
And I see
Brown hair and bright eyes, such a beautiful blue
A heart full of laughter with nothin' to lose
That's how I remember you

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
And you fell, and it hurt
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
You might also like
Woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)

Sometimes life don't go the way you planned
And we all have days when we just don't understand
Searchin' for meaning, it's not always easy
But your story's not over, it's still bein' told
Your sunrise is comin' brighter than gold
Let's go back again to the summer when

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
And you fell, and it hurt
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)

What if the picture is bigger than you see?
And God has you right where He wants you to be
Just listen to your heart, He's telling you with every beat
You're still that girl
(You're still that girl, you're still that girl)

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe
You could be the girl
Who could change the world
Don't you know, don't you see?
All you need is to believe, ayy
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world

Woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
You're still that girl (You're still that girl)
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your smile
You're still that girl
