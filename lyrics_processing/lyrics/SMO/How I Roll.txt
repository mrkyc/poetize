Yeah, you know it's been a long time coming on this one right here
We figured we wouldn't make you wait any longer
I got my man Colt Ford in here with me
We 'bout to bring it down for y'all
Whoa, whoa
Tell you how we roll
Hey yo D-Ray you got my back on this?
Yeah yeah
Okay, let's go

I've been the man that I am from day one on this rock
Country livin' in my blood 'cause I was raised and I was taught
To fight for my beliefs no mater the pain or the costs
From that red, white, and blue to the man up on that cross
Know I may have been lost, I was always down
Raisin' hell in the backwoods on the outskirts of town
With them roughnecks ballin',  down them dirt roads haulin'
Yeah, you know how we get down when that sun starts fallin'
Place your bets, boy I'm all in, better ask my folks
I'm a stand up man and I got no time for the jokes
'Cause when the tree lines spoke we just payin' the bills
From the hollers of Kentucky to them Tennessee hills
I grew up makin' deals on hand shakes alone
That's what my daddy taught me and I'll pass it down to my own
So you can take it or leave it, my words is good as gold
And keep it movin' for the money, boy that's just how we roll

I don't care what you say about me
Don't understand why that can't let me be
An honest man, I'm up early through the week
If you shake my hand then you can count on me
That's just how I roll
Yeah, that's just how I roll

Hey yo Smo yeah
Let me tell the kinfolk how I roll
Dog, tell 'em one time

First of all I need to tell y'all that tricks are for kids
And ain't a one of y'all expecting me to do what I did
See Nashville still considers me kinda a step-child
It's funny they love the money they makin' from my style
It's a fact most folks ain't a fan of the truth (Nuh-uh)
And believe me if I can make it there ain't no reason that you (That's right)
Can't be the next me, Smo, Lacs, or Upchurch (Okay)
Better yet the first you, I'ma tell you how it works
It's no quittin', not bullshit, better make that music great (Great)
Say thank you to those fans put food on your plate (Your plate)
Be humble and kind (Kind), always on grind (On grind)
And remember most music folks they mouth open they lyin'
I'm tryna keep it real for you, preach it to you young bucks
Make yourself a career son, be plenty time for them big trucks (Yup)
Keep doin' what you do, that's what I'm gonna do
Never let 'em have your soul, now you know how I roll
I don't care what you say about me
Don't understand why that can't let me be (Yeah)
An honest man, I'm up early through the week (Okay)
If you shake my hand then you can count on me (Come on)
That's just how I roll
Boy I ain't told you once, I told you a thousand times, come on
Yeah, that's just how I roll
You know how I get down now, let's see if you can keep up
D-Ray let's get down for 'em
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, that's just how I roll
Whoa, whoa (Down-down-down a back road)

I don't care what you say about me
Don't understand why that can't let me be
An honest man, I'm up early through the week
If you shake my hand then you can count on me
That's just how I roll
