I can make the mud drop when the beat drops
Meet me in the pit show you how we sling slop
Where my kinfolke at?

I was raised in the South, baptized in the mud
Since day one you know I been tearin' up the clubs
Now we grown folk, you can meet me in the sticks
Cooler full of shine, green handle smokin' out the pit
Side-by-side Can-Am or Polaris (Polaris)
Trails ridein' high, deep pits never scare us (They never scare us)
Watch me while I'm tearin' up the muck in my truck
Mickey Thompson Super Swampers, no they never leave me stuck
I'm a mud digger figure back road representer
There's a party goin' down at the finish line with the winner
Yeah, I keep it ugly while I kick it with my buddies
Tryna chop up the slop 'til the whole world muddy

I wake up blaze one, fill up my Razor
Hittin' trails, raisin' hell, you can't really blame us
Back wood thrill billy pop a motherfuckin' wheelies
Straight through a mud hole with no clothes and a fifth of whiskey
Trap drums and that Gibson get's me, mud thicker than Mississippi
You can hit me with the plug, circle back if you miss me
Packs long, racks strong, kiss my ass I'm back on
Raised on that Tennessee mossy send your ass home
