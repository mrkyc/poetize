Bonfire Music

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close

It's just one of them nights, after one of those days
Pushin' through a double shift 'cause I gots to get paid
I'ma take it to the crib, maybe catch a warm plate
Ol' lady hot and heavy and I know she wanna play
But my cell phone's buggin'
My crew's on a mission for the back road business
Hundred gallon full of sip and fire up the 'ol Chevy
Stick of pine in the wind, dirt-dirt road swervin'
Tryin' to catch my third wind
Bonfire meetin', cash for the cab
Blue flame whiskey on that home grown pine
Load a couple cases make a toast to our kin
Kept us here goin' since way back when
Now running wide open on a full moon night
Chasing this paper, tryin' to get my life right
Keg party waitin' for the man of the hour
Midnight shift for the money and the power

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close

Uh, big bottle of whiskey, fresh jar of that pine
Got somethin' real fine, spendin' some quality time
Tryna unwind at a bonfire, it's so high
You-you-you could see it for miles, it's just one of them nights
Where anything goes, it ain't nothin' off limits
We livin' like this might be our last night of livin'
Mixin' pleasure and business, make drop poppin' tops
Old Mason jars full of, this season's best crops
We party 'til we drop, wake up party tomorrow
Ain't no reason to go, if you ain't goin' hard
If anyone deserves a celebration, it'd be us
Be-be-been workin' so hard, for the last nine months
Studio to the bus, from the bus to the stage
Back to the bus, wake up next day the same thing
Then it's back to the kitchen, cookin' up somethin' delicious
One-eighty proof and them Swishers
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close

It's just one of them nights, shine got me feelin' more than good
Prolly burned through a zip of pine and a cord of wood
Got a jar full of pot, smoke sippin' on a 50 stack
AK got somethin' loud, call it triple black
'Bout to turn a triple play, doin' it a different way
Fifty years from now I'll still reflect on what we did today
Outlaw mentality, rock-rockstar reality
Underground world to see me, you oughta bow to me
Tonight we fixin' to celebrate, like we hit the lottery
Big bonfire at the big homies property
Yeah, I know they talkin' shit, they ain't really hot to me
I'm on a spaceship, another odyssey

It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
Got somethin' real fine, tryin' to pull her real close
It's just one of them nights, where anything goes
Got a whole lot of shine, a lil somethin' to smoke
Bonfire so high, you could see it from the road
