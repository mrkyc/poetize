Big Smeezy baby
Hey yo Sneed, I was thinkin' 'bout runnin' for mayor out here
You know how I do it
Hey

I'm the king of the country, (Yeah) the boss of the stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
I'm a mid ten hustler with a true south swagger
Hillbilly ballin' count money on my tractor
With my John Deere fiddy cap made in the shade
And my throwback Brahma Boots, stompin' your way
Got the game wrapped tight like some square bale hay
I can pull about fresh hit the block and get paid
I own 32 acres of a dream come true
'Bout a 100 head of cattle and a fishin' hole too
Shit, I ain't hard to find, I be doing what I do
Out bush hoggin' fields smokin' on that berry blue
Living my life like an old dirt road
Sippin' poke-brown out the jug, keep me ice cold
I'm a small town boy with some big city dreams
Let me drop a little somethin' just to show you what I mean

I'm the king of the country, the boss of the stix
Boss-boss of the stix, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
K-k-king of the country, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the stix
Boss-boss of the stix, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss-boss of the stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
Tell 'em Sneed

I'm drinkin' shine berry kush let the lights fall
It's Mr. Sneed I keep 'em bouncin' in the trailer parks
That white boy, I switch the game up to south paw
I represent for them hard heads and outlaws
Them John Deere drivers, them sticky green pickers
We runnin' from the smokies and they ain't gonna get us
So I'ma keep 'er movin' and get'er done right
For my good ol' boys on the porches with them Bud Lights
Six shooters, two shots when you step to me
I shot the sheriff but I didn't shoot the deputy
I'm gettin' money buddy, but y'all can stay broke
My Ford pickup got more horses than a stage coach
From the sticks to the wood put the bricks up
You talk too loud and get you dropped off in that pickup
This Tennessee sun it got my ass meltin'
Plus I called up Big Smo 'cause he smoke like Willie Nelson

I'm the king of the country, the boss of the stix
Boss-boss of the stix, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
K-k-king of the country, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the stix
Boss-boss of the stix, boss-boss of the stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss-boss of the stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
Hey yo Sneed, let me slide through in my F100
Sippin' on poke-brown, smokin' on somethin'
Sticky as a honey bun smellin' like pine
I'm gone off that green and buzzed off that wine
It's just another day in this county boys life
Hit the farm in the mornin' get it poppin' by night
From the sticks to the bricks, from the green to the white
I can 'bout guarantee you we can get your mind right
Yo Smo pass he jug boy, pass around it all
We smokin' on this hickey, now we fishin' on the pond
Speakin' of the water did I tell you that I got 'em
Concrete boots ain't for no fish on the bottom
We the pickup drivin' shotgun tottin' mother suckers
We treat you like an iPhone you speakin' we gon' touch
Them real rowdy boys we up to no good
Be the realest in the game from the sticks to the woods
