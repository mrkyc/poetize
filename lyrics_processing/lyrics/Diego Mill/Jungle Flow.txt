Teachers told me I ain't shit
I need a coupe
That spaceship
The doors lift up
That's a face lift
Man I swear da god I kill shit
Should a had a deal that bullshit
Save the talking that bullshit
My girl stay on that bullshit
Willy got signed
I was stuck in the trap
Juice got signed
I was stuck in the rap
Ricky got killed
I was stuck in the trap
My back to the wall
Nigga what about that
You was in the club living up life
I was in the kitchen stressed out
Cuz the coke that I had wasn't stretching up right
Then my girl left
Give a fuck about life
Damn boy

You prolly live real good life
Let me know what you know about that
Let me know what you know about that
Wanna talk to the god like hello hello

Talking to my city god bless you
Rebecca told me they ain't you
And when they talk they hate you
I guess that's just what It came to
Look at your self what the game do

Don't let this money and fame change you
You looking at life from a vain view
You only become what they paint you
I ain't got no cape dude
I'm just like you You just like me
But If you try da play I'm a let off 3
Cuz it was killers riding round me
I still got that mentality
And ill explain to you
Why they made at me
To give up
That just ain't me
So I pick myself up, angry
Give a fuck if they hate me
Cuz the truth is they ain't make me
So god knows they can't break me
And that's the reason they ain't me
Double the trouble I double an o
Niggas don't rumble they fumble da go
If I go broke I bubble a o
Can you eat I'm telling you no
If we got beef ain't letting it go
Had a steak with the entree
Guns big as Beyonce
Let it talk to you like Kanye
In other words unkindly
I'm in the streets come find me
Better watch how your running ur mouth
Them lil boys gone run in your house
And you know what I'm talking about
Yeah you know what I'm talking bout
You know they don't fuck with you
So we look at you like what wrong with you
