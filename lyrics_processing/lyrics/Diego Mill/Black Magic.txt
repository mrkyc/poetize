Look Arround x 2
You would of thought the money ran away
The way I chase it
You would of thought life had face time
The way I faced it
And you be on the bench
You don't play shit
I'm surprised they can't see me
On my A shit
I was with the killers
Yeah I really spray shit
The gun abduct a nigga
Like a mothafucking spaceship
I don't battle rap
I'm trying to get me a mill
But if you talking money
Then I fucking kill
We can bet half a 100k
For the trill
And you gone be the game
How losing 50 feel
Can't no rapper in my city
Even fuck with me
Fuck your record label
Burn down your company
Cuz when it come to war
I be sitting comfortably
You gone need the devil
If you try and come for me
So much money
They don't even know what I got
Say a prayer hallelujah
For the young good

Look Around x 4
It a curse that you hearing
Through your ipod
Black Magic
Someone please turn the lights on
I be spazzin
Yeah my eyes gone
Young legend
Even when I die I'll live long
And may God forgive me
If I live wrong
But they was killing in my city
For that Heroin
A bunch of killers in new eras
With they a's
We don't care if you lift
7ft too tall
These bullets leave holes
The size of footballs
Murder ugly that motherfucker
Ru Paul
But here they do it broad day
Don't care who saw
Money coming in and out
That's a see-saw
And if the money stop
I start having withdraws
And if the feds ask
I don't fuck re-call
Since a young'n
All we did was re ball
Say a prayer hallelujah
For the young good
Look Around
