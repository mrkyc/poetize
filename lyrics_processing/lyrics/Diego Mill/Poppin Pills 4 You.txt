I'm the one that fell in love with you
I take the blame for that
But you the one that fucked everything up
So you gon' be the one to take the blame for that
You gon' try to fix it, I know
But it ain't gon' be the same for that
So I packed my things and got on that plane
Ever since then, it ain't been the same
I know you get sick when they say my name
Because you knew me before the money and fame
We made mistakes, but you showed me some things
Like people gon' be who they be, they don't change
And I'm grateful for that
If anything else
Young Nirvana, pop pills in hotels
I drown in my pain when I'm all by myself

I always seem to make the same mistakes
Too quick, too faulty
Fast to push away, away
I miss a lot of your touch and your embrace
No one ever made me feel so safe, so safe

Sometimes I wish I could share what I seen with you
But that's just in a dream
Everyone that I mean from now on, I have no trust
My life would be easier if it was just us
I know that sounds selfish
But when I got drugs in me
I cannot help it
Remember the first time that we met?
You remember the first time that we met
'Cause I'm poppin' these pills to help me forget
I lean in this room by myself to forget
Might just call you so we can argue
Catchin' myself, I won't do it again
I lie to myself and go through it again
I put the phone down, I won't do it again
I fall asleep, if I do not wake up
Know I was thinking of you again
She might console me, but she just a friend
Tell her I care, but she know I pretend
Say that you love him, I leave you alone
You say you not sure, I get in my zone
She know I choose you, don't ask me again
Say that you love me, I don't answer again
You might also like
I always seem to make the same mistakes
Too quick, too faulty
Fast to push away, away
I miss a lot of your touch and your embrace
