His hair, whack
His gear, whack
His jewelery, whack
His foodstamps, whack
The way that he talks, whack
The way that he doesn't even like to smile, whack
Me? I'm great as fuck

I go flow for you know who
Keep it a secret, yeah I do
Your team green like Mountain Dew
Turn to a savage, it do not matter
Raping the game like I'm Ian Connor
Tracking me a lil UZI
Got guns the size of Lil Uzi
I wanna ice so I look like Tron
Take me three xannies 'til my eyes is gone
They blowin' wet, they got no lungs
Fuck with the set, we got the drugs
It took me a while, I'm sorry I know
I am like Wayne, do five in a row
Number nine all on my spine
My trap boom like dynamite
Dumbing down every line
Finalize, my flow is fine
I'm from where they catch a body
Shit get ugly like Lil Yachty
Since I was ten, in my city, boy I was somebody
Then these ghostwriters I know
So I might sign myself to OVO
Got enough to go around
I got me a whole new sound
We make no statements, we blind
I need ten mil if I sign
Labels wanna play some games
Then I turn into Columbine
They think that I'm out my mind
I am music, I am fine
We got heat, not toast earth
Still moving that Britney Spears
I am pop culture
Show you how to move in a room full of vultures

My denim was made out in Italy
I'm from the set, no bitch in me
They know I made all that history
Buggin' my shit, ain't no fear involved
So far ahead, I'm in the past
I feel like Trunks from Dragon Ball
Put on for the city, they hatin' hard
I just caught me a Charziard
They want my style, I know that you want it
Cut me a check and you know you got it
Beefin' with Ali and Politics
Your career right now it do not exist
Ask B.O.B., I body this
Look in the mirror, boy you look weird
Trust me my nigga, you need a you a stylist
You dealin' with savages who love violence
You thirty-nine and go online
On the timeline tryna catch sauce
For snakes we got Metal Gear
And trust me, I'm the big boss
You stole Mase flow, you been fraudy
My nigga's cheerleaders, they catch bodies
You old and frail, you been bodied
I'm Nas in the camo and big shotty
Shout to Ali Vegas, nigga's know I got next
I heard that song and I thought it was me
Next time you wanna steal sauce
Send a deposit, ain't none of this free
I know your ghostwriter, he said I was nice
20k on the verse, I don't come down on the price
