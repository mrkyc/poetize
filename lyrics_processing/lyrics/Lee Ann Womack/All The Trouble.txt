I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
And I just don't want no more

The deck is stacked against you
Life's a losing hand
Even when you think you're up
You're right back down again
Either way you play it
The house is gonna win

It's hard being little
It's hard being small
Make it up that mountain
You're standing big and tall
Well the trouble with the mountain
There's 8 million ways to fall

I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
And I, I just don't want no more

Hey I need a happy ending
Somebody write me one
If there's a prince awaiting
Somebody send him on
Even Cinderella had to find her own way home

Well it started with a dark cloud
And a couple drops of rain
Then the storm and the wind
And the thunder and the lightning came
Somebody give me shelter
I've had all I can take

'Cause I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
And I just don't want no more


If you've got some good news
Give me a chance
Yeah, if you've got some good love
Just put it in my hand
'Cause I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
I got all the trouble I'm ever gonna need
And I just don't want no more

No I just don't want no more
No more, no more, no more
(All the trouble)
