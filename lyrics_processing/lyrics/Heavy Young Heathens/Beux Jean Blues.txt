I met you alone, on a crowded street
You asked for my name, and said that you'd like to speak
Invited me home to sleep on your floor
Tell me your lies
All through the night 'till the morning come
Tell me your lies
Talked about art, right before we made love
You showed me your room, and the curtains of wood
Your grandma's cross right above your door
Tell me your lies
All through the night to the morning comes
Tell me your lies

I only know, her face, and little else it seems
She was a fuel injected hedonistic suicide machine
Every single person that she's treated with disdain
Swears they had it coming cause they treated her the same

I only want her, i only need her
Her World its over now, but oh you know its all true
Every time she makes you sweat
Doctors, Lawyers, Millionaires - are Fools
Ooh, You, Ohh...

A sinister laugh as i slept on the floor
Attitudes crashed when i ran for the door
The morning had come for which i was doomed la la la la la la la

I only know, her face, and little else it seems
She was a Superstitious, hedonistic nightmare of a dream
And every single person that she's treated with disdain
She swears they had it coming cause they treated her the same
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I never knew, her name, or little else it seems
She was a hedonistic, socialistic suicide machine
Ever single person person that she's treated with disdain
She swears they had it coming cause they treated her the same
