It doesn't matter where you've been, just matters where you're going
There's blessings up ahead and you don't even know it
Yeah, the storm may come but the sky's still blue
'Cause the God of love still fights for you
So don't you worry, no need to worry

Everything is gonna be alright
Even in the rain, we're singing all night
There's a little piece of Heaven in the sunrise
Open up your eyes, you'll see
That everything is gonna be alright, alright
Everything is gonna be, everything is gonna be alright, alright
Everything is gonna be, everything is gonna be

You might be feeling broke, but that don't mean you're broken, oh yeah
You might be losing hope, but that don't mean you're hopeless, no
The fear will try to shape the truth
Don't let it get the best of you
Why worry? There's no need to worry (Hey, hey, yeah)

Everything is gonna be alright
Even in the rain, we're singing all night
There's a little piece of Heaven in the sunrise
Open up your eyes, you'll see
That everything is gonna be alright, alright
Everything is gonna be, everything is gonna be alright, alright
Everything is gonna be, everything is gonna be
