I knew God had blessed my life
From the sound of your first cry
You made us a family
And I ain't ever gonna leave
Felt it then, I feel it now
Through every single up and down
So when the world says you're nothing
Oh, let me tell you something

Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like your father does
Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like your father does

Yeah, time won't slow down
And I won't always be around
To listen to your worries
And hold you when you're hurting
So let me point you to the One
Who's with you til it's done
Take His hand, He won't let go
Gave His life to bring you home
You might also like
Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like your father does
Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like your father does

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I want you to know there's nothing to prove
I've always, always loved you
And I always, always will
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I want you to know there's nothing to prove
He's always, always loved you, oh
And He always, always will

Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Like your father does
Ain't nobody gonna
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like your father does
Ain't nobody gonna
