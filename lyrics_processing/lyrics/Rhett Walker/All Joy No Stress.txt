I got that good news smile on my face
I got that feeling that the world can't erase
There ain't a single day I let it go to waste
I got that good news smile on my face

I got that beat, beat, beating in my heart
I got that gospel song rocking in my car
A little light gonna get me through the dark
I got that beat, beat, beating in my heart

All joy, no stress
No worries, I'm blessed
From early in the morning 'til the crickets and the sun done set, yeah
All joy

I'm gonna thank God Almighty for the good days (Okay)
I'm gonna thank God Almighty for the bad (Alright)
Hand out the window waving bye to my old ways (Old ways)
Yeah, thank God Almighty, I ain't ever going back

All joy, no stress
No worries, I'm blessed
From early in the morning 'til the crickets and the sun done set, yeah
All joy
All joy
