I was a small town joke without hope
Just trying to find my way
I was the fool that lived with the consequence
Of all of my mistakes
I was a guilty man in my Sunday best
Sweatin' in all my shame
If the road I was on hadn't led headlong
Into amazing grace

I would've been a lost cause
Would've been written off
But there's a hope that don't give in
I should've been a long gone
Nowhere to call home
But there's a peace that never ends
When I couldn't see
He rescued me
Oh, ain't it just like Jesus to love me where I am
And not just leave me where I could've been

I'd still be wakin' up
Down on my luck
Sleeping in the bed I'd made
I was as bad as the worst
My name was a curse
Just wastin my whole life away
And then one day, I got outta my way
Gave the good Lord above my life
If it wasn't for that rugged cross
And the mercy of Jesus Christ
You might also like
I would've been a lost cause
I would've been written off
But there's a hope that don't give in
I should've been a long gone
Nowhere to call home
But there's a peace that never ends
When I couldn't see
He rescued me
Oh, ain't it just like Jesus to love me where I am
And not just leave me where I could've been
Leave me where I could've been

When I'm looking back on my crazy past
Only thing I've got figured out
The trails I blazed, mistakes I made
Doesn't change what He's doing right now

I would've been a lost cause
I would've been written off
But there's a hope that don't give in
Should've been a long gone
Nowhere to call home
But there's a peace that never ends
When I couldn't see
He rescued me
Oh, ain't it just like Jesus to love me where I am
