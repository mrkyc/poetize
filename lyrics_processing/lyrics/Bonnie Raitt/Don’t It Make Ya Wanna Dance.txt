Feels so good just to get back home
Back to my friends
And other faces that I love to see
Like a rainbow that is in the sky
The certain twinkle is in her eye
Telling me she believes in
What I am and what I want to be
Well, don't it make you want to dance
Don't it make you want to smile
When your down, down, down
In the country pick and sing awhile
Don't it make you want to dance
Don't it make you want to smile
When your down, down, down
In the country pick and sing awhile
Oh Lord, don't it feel right tonight
Making music when you feel this right
Feeling better with every little single song
Look around everyone is your friend
And every one is bound to grin
And when the chorus comes around
Everybody jump on
