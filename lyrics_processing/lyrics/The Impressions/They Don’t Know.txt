And I feel so insecure
Brother if you feel this way
You're not by yourself
We have lost another leader
Lord how much must we endure
If you feel this way
You're not by yourself
Funny they think
We have no-one to lead us
They think we've lost the fight
And in the night no-one can breed us
But they don't know
Every brother is leader
And they don't know every sister is a breeder
And our love, you see
Is gonna help the world be free
We're gonna move at a steady pace
Keep every brother on the case
They don't know
To help us is to help themselves
We cannot let our people be
Until we're all out of poverty

Don't think we've lost the fight
And in the night no-one can breed us
For they don't know
Every brother is leader
And they don't know every sister is a breeder
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
We've got love you see
And make note of the information
Don't matter about the operation
We shall control the situation
They don't know
To help us is to help themselves
We cannot let our people be
