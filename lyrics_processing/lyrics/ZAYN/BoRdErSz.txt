Border, ayy

She is the life of the party (Border)
Don't stick that knife in my body (Border, border, ayy)
It's somethin' she always wanted (Border)
It's for a good cause, you're doin' a good job (Border, border)

And we're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean, you change what I see
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion, all because of me

So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh

You were right on the border (Border)
Give me all of this, give me all of you (Border, border)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (Border, border, ayy)

Beautiful insanity (Border, border)
You're like a movie, change the scene (Border, border, ayy)
Taste your sweet profanity (Border, border)
It's all for a good cause, think you're doin' a good job (Border, border, ayy)

They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion, all because of me

So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh

You were right on the border
Give me all of this, give me all of you
No fallin' in, don't need no proof
You were right on border
Give me all of this, give me all of you
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (Border)
Give me all of this, give me all of you (Border, border)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (Border)

So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh

Give me all of this, give me all of you (Border, border)
