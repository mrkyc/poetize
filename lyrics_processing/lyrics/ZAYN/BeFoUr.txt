I've done this before
Not like this

I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's somethin' I want
I'll take all the right wrongs now
I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of pickin' that bone
And I can't be bothered
To fight it no more, no

Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
You might also like
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this

Time for me to move up
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Into your song, no

Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now (So say what you wanna say)
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
Flashing lights

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now
So say what you wanna say, what you want (Yeah)
Shame is you won't say that to my face
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna (So say what you wanna say)
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now (Now)
So say what you wanna say, what you want (No, no)
Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before (Never done it like this, baby)
Not like this (Not like this), not like this (Not like this, baby)
I've done this before (Never done it like this, baby)
