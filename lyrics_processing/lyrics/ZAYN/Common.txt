Always lookin' out behind my fences
Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I was so defensive
I'll find a way to let you in

I will die if I don't try, damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real, this is somethin' right
Never been in love, never felt it all until now

As I lay here in your bed, I need you on my chest
To warm me all the time, to take away your breath
It's written on your lips, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I see all your flaws and imperfections
But that's what makes me love you more, oh-oh-oh
We got such a spiritual connection
Don't you know you're fuckin' beautiful
You might also like
I will die if I don't try, damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real, this is somethin' right
Never been in love, never felt it all until now

As I lay here in your bed, I need you on my chest
To warm me all the time, to take away your breath
It's written on your lips, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I wanna feel your love
Just give me all your trust
Common ain't us
'Cause common ain't enough

In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
