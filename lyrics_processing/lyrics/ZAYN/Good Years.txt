I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years

The voices screaming loud as hell
We don't care 'bout no one else
Nothing in the world could bring us down
Now we're so high among the stars without a worry
And neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years

Too much drugs and alcohol
What the hell were we fighting for?
'Cause now the whole damn world will know
That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story
Neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry
You might also like
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years

Need a chance just to breathe, feel alive
And when the day meets the night, show me the light
Feel the wind and the fire, hold the pain deep inside
It's in my eyes, in my eyes

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
