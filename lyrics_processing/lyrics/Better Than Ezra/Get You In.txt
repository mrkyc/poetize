I felt like I was one of them gasping for air
I go from room to room hoping to find your presence
I play my music louder than you'd like me to
Why can't I be your lover?
Can there be another?
And when I feel without I want to get you in
Can't I be your lover?
At five o'clock you come shuffling in
And when I lock you out I want to get you
Get you, get you in
I understand that you are going through a hard time
But what you need to recognize I'm in one too
You say that maybe we should take some time apart
But you go your way, I'll get by, and you'll go get high
You just see if I mind
Why can't I be your lover?
Can there be another?
And when I feel without I want to get you in
Why can't I be your lover?
At five o'clock you come shuffling in
And when I lock you out I want to get you
Let you, get you in
