And under your bed
Lay a picture long forgotten
With a hand to your head
You sigh out loud
As the memory rushes over
And buries you
A summer rain storm
But the shed was dry
With a girl from Carolina
And you held her so tight
For the warmth that the rain denied
As the timer slowed to a flash
So alive, you listen to them when they say
Cry in the sun
When the devil beats his wife
If you cry, cry, cry in the sun
Hope I never see the price of my freedom
Yeah
We'd dance and sing out
And trace the moon
As it crawled across the night sky
And covered in dew, a lover's pact
Well, here's to now and don't look back
And oh, how I tried
To heed the words written here

Ooh, yeah
For everyone one, yeah
There's a person, place or time
That brings you back, and makes you feel alive
Before your reason clouds your eyes
When you could rule the world, if you wanted to
Yeah
Well, I hear you're living
Far away
And that life's treated you well
You know that we were young, and this picture's old
But I call still hear you say
Through the pounding of the rain
And oh, if you try
Tell me, can you hear them say
Cry in the sun
When the devil beats his wife
If you cry, cry, cry in the sun
Hope I never see the price of my freedom
