The way you looked that fall
In your favorite dress
The day before you left
And since that time
I wrote a simple rhyme
And I miss you and the things you do
The time we had, the good and bad
The day we met that I can't forget
Signed sincerely, me
Are you cross at your loss?
But could you be more obsessive
If I'd given you the chance
But since you asked, a reply but it's the last
And I miss you and the things you do
The love you fake, the heart you break
The buzz you caught, and the times we fought
Signed sincerely, me
Oh, my god, and don't forget p.s
I moved away to a new address
It's far away and I think it's best
Signed sincerely, me

The rain falls, the summer ends
Why can't it be like it was?
You always said you'd never go away
And I confess, I was such a mess
I drove for fifteen hours
On this nasty greyhound bus
Yes, I've returned
(you'd think that I would have learned.)
But I miss you and the things you do
The times we had, the good and bad
The day we met that I can't forget
Signed sincerely, me
Could you really be a bitch like that?
Broke my door when you stole the cat
Someone said that you even laughed
Signed sincerely, me
Why can't it be like it was?
The rain falls, the summer ends
Why can't it be like it was?
You always said you'd never go away
And I miss you...
The hope you give
The life you live
The cross you bear
The way you swear
The face you make
When you masturbate
Our bed in the moonlight
And the night we fought
You were so distraught
And the lies I denied
Even when you cried
God knows I apologize
Signed sincerely, me
Why can't it be like it was?
The rain goes, the sun returns
Why can't it be like it was?
You always said you'd never go away
You'd never go away
You'd never go away
