Reciting lines start to end
But she's not crazy
(Knock on wood)
Just a little misunderstood
She takes a walk at 4 a.m
Wakes the neighborhood again
And I find myself recalling everything she used to tell me
Aw yeah, alright, truth hurts inside
Aw yeah, that's right, you go around once in life
Everybody wants to be a part
Everybody loves a situation
Who would ever want to play the part
Of anonymous numbers on a governmental chart
She's waiting tables the next day
She pulls a double then on her way
To an audition in Hollywood, yeah
A little misunderstood
We sit around the house
Waiting for the phone to ring
And I know she alone holds the key
To everything I want to be

When you've got something you can give them
All I've seen, bad and good, she's not crazy
Just a little misunderstood
Aw yeah, all good, she's not crazy
Just a little misunderstood

Who'd have thought we'd get this far?
But I'd give it all away if I
Could see you on that day again
When you quit work
And threw that coffee
At the manager jerk
You said, "Close your eyes
I've got a surprise
A house in the hills
And a car that drives by."
Aw yeah, alright, truth hurts, don't it? Inside
Aw yeah, that's right, you go around once in life
Everybody wants to be a part
Everybody loves a situation
Who would ever want to play the part
Of anonymous numbers on a governmental chart
