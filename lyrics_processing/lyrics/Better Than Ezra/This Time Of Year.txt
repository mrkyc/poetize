Just like a Friday afternoon
Yeah you can go there if you want
Though it fades to soon
So go on
Let it be
If there's a feeling coming over me
Seems like it's always understood
This time of year
Well I know there's a reason to change
Well I know there's a time for us
You think about the good times, and you live with all the bad
You can feel it in the air
Feeling right this time of year
Well there's a football in the air
Across a leaf blown field
Yeah and there's your first car on the road
And the girl you'd steal
So go on
With yourself
It there's a feeling that there's something else
Seems like it's always understood
This time of year
