This bunker
The air is humming
Us to sleep
While outside
The city hurries;
The endless worries
Are out of reach
Promise me we'll never leave this room
A million years from now would be too soon
The world is spinning turning day to night
And my thoughts are running at the speed of light
Got an empty feeling that I never want to fill
Absolutely still
I waited longer 'cause I needed proof
That every door I shut is leading me to you
And there's a nervous feeling that i never want to kill
Absolutely still
We were running
From the same noise
We were stuck in
The same pursuit

A million years from now would be too soon
The world is spinning turning day to night
And my thoughts are running at the speed of light
Got an empty feeling that I never want to fill

I waited longer 'cause I needed proof
That every door I shut is leading me to you
And there's a nervous feeling that I never want to kill
Absolutely still
I'll go anywhere you want tonight
'cause my head is spinning like a satellite
I got a restless feeling that I never want to fill
