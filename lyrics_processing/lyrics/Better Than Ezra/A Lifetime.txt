Graduation day
Got into a car
And crashed along the way
When we arrived late to the wake
Stole the urn while they
Looked away
And drove to the beach
'Cause I knew you'd want it
That way
And you were standing
On the hood of the car
Singing out loud
When the sun came up
And I know I wasn't right
But it felt so good
And your mother didn't mind
Like I thought she would
And that REM song was playing
In my mind
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime

And you move like water
I could drown in you
And I fell so deep once
Till you pulled me through
You would tell me
"No one is allowed to be so proud
They never reach out
When they're giving up."
And I know I wasn't right
But it felt so good
And your mother didn't mind
Like I thought she would
And that REM song was playing
In my mind
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
Are you sitting in the lights?
Or combing your hair again
And talking in rhymes?
Are you sitting in the lights?
When I got home, heard the phone
Your parents had arrived
You know, your dad set his jaw
Your mom just smiled and sighed
But they left soon
And I went to my room
Played that disc that you'd given me
You know, I shut my eyes
I swear I could hear the sea
When we were standing
On the hood of your car
Singing out loud when the sun came up
And I know I wasn't right
But it felt so good
And your mother didn't mind
Like I thought she would
And that REM song was playing
In my mind
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
