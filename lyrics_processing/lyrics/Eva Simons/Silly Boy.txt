You're callin' me more than ever now that we're done
Two keys back to my place, we were havin' no fun
But you're not okay, tellin' me you miss my face
I remember when you would say you hate my waist

I said I'm not comin' back
It seems you only want what you can't have, that ego's hurting
Just too bad for you, that when you had me
Didn't know what to do
(She's over you)

'Cause you had a good girl, good girl, girl
That's a keeper, k-k-k-k-keeper
You had a good girl, good girl
But didn't know how to treat her, t-t-t-t-treat her, treat her
(Her)

So silly boy, get out my face, my face
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
'Cause you like the way regret tastes
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
So silly boy, get out my hair, my hair
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
I don't want you no more, get out of here
You might also like
Silly boy, silly boy
Why you actin' silly boy?
Silly boy, boy
(Boy-boy)
Actin', actin', silly boy?

You comin' with those corny lines
Can't live without me
I'll get some flowers for the day that you are buried
No, people make mistakes
But I just think your ass is fake
Only thing I want from you, is for you to
(Stay away)

I said I'm not comin' back
It seems you only want what you can't have, that ego's hurting
Just too bad for you, that when you had me
Didn't know what to do
(She's over you)

'Cause you had a good girl, good girl, girl
That's a keeper, k-k-k-k-keeper
You had a good girl, good girl
But didn't know how to treat her, t-t-t-t-treat her, treat her
(Her)
So silly boy, get out my face, my face
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
'Cause you like the way regret tastes
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
So silly boy, get out my hair, my hair
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
I don't want you no more, get out of here

No more, no more, no more, no-ooh-ooh-ooh
No more, no more, no more, oh-oh-ooh
(Oooh)
Silly boy, silly boy
Why you actin' silly boy?
Silly boy, boy
(Boy-boy)
Actin', actin', silly boy?
Silly boy, silly boy
Why you actin' silly boy?
(Sii-ii-i-illy)
Silly boy, boy
(Boy-boy)
Actin', actin', silly boy?

So silly boy, get out my face, my face
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
(Oh)
'Cause you like the way regret tastes
('Cause you like, you like, you like)
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
So silly boy, get out my hair, my hair
(Ahh-ahh-ahh)
(Get out my hair)
I don't want you no more, get out of here
(Yeah)
Silly boy, silly boy
Why you actin' silly boy?
Silly boy, boy
(Boy-boy)
