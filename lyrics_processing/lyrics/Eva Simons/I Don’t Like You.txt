Fade to the darkness all the way
At the start guess I hoped
That for once I had escaped the fakes, the snakes
Waste of time, so face to face
I'll be bold enough to throw
All there is I belong to say, to say, to say

That this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here, go

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out

Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
You might also like
I don't like you
All the way

Sane, not confused
Clear in the brain
It's a losing hand, fold
Why play on nothing to gain?
Pull on the reigns

That this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here, go

Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you
All the way

Done with right
I just don't feel this, I'm not all over, it's there
Through with trying, that's what the real is
This love has taken its last breath

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out

Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
