I used to hide away at home to try to save myself
From falling in love or staying up on the shelf
I was afraid to walk the streets alone or by your side
Just waiting up for something that could save my life
But there's the way out, stuck inside my head now
Headed for a breakdown when I should be headed for the door

'Cause I found out there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
No, you can't hide
It's the shot heard 'round the world
Lights out, there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
Baby, don't cry
It's the shot heard 'round the world

If we can light up every street with our cellular phones
Then maybe we can save ourselves or maybe we won't
But it doesn't even matter if we got a plan
As long as you're holding on to somebody's hand
Because the way out's stuck inside your head now
But I know we can break out if we can all just step outside the door

'Cause I found out there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
No, you can't hide
It's the shot heard 'round the world
Lights out, there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
Baby, don't cry
It's the shot heard 'round the world

I'm gonna kiss the sky tonight
Maybe you should try it
I'm gonna learn to fly tonight and you're invited
'Cause all the things that we've become are making me so fucking numb
And this time I have had enough
Goodbye and say hello to the end of the world

I found out there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
And I know you can't hide
It's the shot heard 'round the world
Lights out, there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
But baby, don't cry
It's the shot heard 'round the world
Lights out, there's no such thing as a miracle, a miracle
But baby, don't cry
