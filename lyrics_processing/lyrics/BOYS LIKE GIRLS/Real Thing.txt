Jamie's in love
She's got the summer blowing through her hair
She turns it up
She says, "Tonight, you take me anywhere"
Bobby's in luck
He's got a fire burning in his eyes
He turns it up
And he says, "Girl, you better hold on tight"

'Cause this is the real thing, love changes everything
This is the night when every heart's exploding
The real thing
Slow down; it's happening
'Cause you got time to burn in the heat of the moment
That summer radio, fireworks off the patio
A 3AM string of green lights in a row
And the real thing
Love can change anything
If you can just let go (Let's go!)
(The real thing, the real thing)

Jamie's alive
She's got him rushing through her veins tonight
So hit the lights
It feels too good to ever say goodbye

Whoa
Can't pull the brakes on this runaway train
'Cause whoa
This is the heartache that won't go away

She's got the summer blowing through her hair

'Cause this is the real thing, love changes everything

A 3 AM, string of green lights in a row
And the real thing, love can change anything

Just let go
Jamie, just let go
