Look up, the stars are fading
And I am still here waiting to see you again
Be with you, my friend
When the moon is gone forever
I hope you're up there somewhere
I'll see you again
Be with you, my friend

'Cause all the roads, they lead to where you are
And all the streetlights shine like they were stars
That's where you are

Let's spend tonight on top of the world
And we can do anything, we can be anything
I'll meet you tonight on top of the world
As real as it seems
You're only in my dreams

Look out across the water
Faces of lonely daughters and mothers who care
But just can't be there
Swear that I will see you someday
I have to find a way to show you I care
Even if you're not there

So I'm following the road to where you are
(Meet you tonight on top of)
The streetlights they will guide me to the stars
That's where you are

Let's spend tonight on top of the world
And we can do anything, we can be anything
I'll meet you tonight on top of the world
As real as it seems
You're only in my dreams

My heart is empty without you
Sometimes you don't know what you do
And I need you tonight
I'll fall asleep and it's alright
Close my eyes and I'll be by your side

Let's spend tonight on top of the world
And we can do anything, we can be anything
I'll meet you tonight on top of the world
As real as it seems
You're only in my dreams
Let's spend tonight on top of the world (On top of the world)
As real as it seems
