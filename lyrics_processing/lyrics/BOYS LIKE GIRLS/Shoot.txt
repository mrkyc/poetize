Well, they say that life is like a long and ragged road
Well, I've been falling asleep at the wheel
My nine to five has got me numb and feeling old
It's time to live for the things that are real
So wake up, shake it off, and turn the car around
Get a fill up, just take off and blow out of this town

Has anybody got a one-way ticket to brand new life?
Leave it all behind
Put the pedal to the metal
Time for livin' like it's all green lights
On the road tonight
Find a little bit of love, find a little bit of truth
Get it cooking like a backyard barbecue
Find a little bit of peace and a little bit of you
Put a bullet in all these blues
Gonna pull the trigger, shoot
Shoot

I go to work, I pay my bills, I bite my tongue
Maybe it's time that I do something for myself
I mow the grass, take out the trash, it's never done
I'm not doing it all for my health
And I'm ready and there's Petty playing on the radio
It's a good night for a long drive
So crank it up and here we go
Are you ready?
