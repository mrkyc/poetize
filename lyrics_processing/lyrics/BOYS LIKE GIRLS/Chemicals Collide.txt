I got a couple addictions
But I swear that I'm comin' clean
I got a new way of thinkin'
Yeah, you're bringing out the best of me
I got a bit of a history
But you're telling me that you don't care
I've been a bit of a mystery
But the only thing that I could find to wear tonight was you
So come on, come on
You want to

Shut your eyes
And feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight
You're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes
And feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
On the night you saved my life

I got a couple of problems
A thousand puzzles runnin' through my head
But I think that you could solve them
You're always just one step ahead
I've had a couple of heartbreaks
But you're telling me that it's alright
'Cause all the others were mistakes
Yeah, I think this time I finally got it right with you
So come on, come on
You want to

When the morning is breaking
And your heart is shaken up
Remember how it feels right now
When we're lost in the moment
The sky is exploding
Just keep on floating

Shut your eyes
And feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight
You're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes
I feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites
Spinnin' 'round and 'round tonight
Shut your eyes
I feel the chemicals collide
And I feel so alive
