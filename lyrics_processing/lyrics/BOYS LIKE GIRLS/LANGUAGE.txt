I kinda think that it's all part of your plan
Sendin' me messages I don't understand
Half of the boy, but I'm twice of the man
Who, who are you?
I'm feelin' naked, yeah, I'm feelin' exposed
Covered in glances that I try to decode
Take me to places that nobody knows
Who, who do you

Think you are to leave me speechless?
Wear my weakness like your clothes
When you touch me, it's like breathin' (It goes)

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
I know exactly what you're sayin' when you're sayin' it
I know the game because I'm playin', yeah, I'm playin' it too
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language

There's tiny galaxies all over your skin
Bitin' your lip was the original sin
You're sayin' nothin' but I'm listenin'
Ooh, ooh, to you

When you leave, you leave me guessin'
Wear my whispers like a chain
Then you kiss me, there's no question, you say

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
I know exactly what you're sayin' when you're sayin' it
I know the game because I'm playin', yeah, I'm playin' it too
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language

You're touchin' my body, I'm touchin' you back
I thought we were friends, but friends don't do that
We say what we say, we live how we live
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
I know exactly what you're sayin' when you're sayin' it
I know the game because I'm playin', yeah, I'm playin' it too
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
You're touchin' my body, I'm touchin' you back
I thought we were friends, but friends don't do that
We say what we say, we live how we live
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
Na-na-na, now you're speakin' my language
