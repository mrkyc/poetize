Can you believe it?
It's been almost ten years now
And I'm getting that feeling
As we're driving 'round this town
Passing by the old schoolyard
Everything just looks so small
Before the drums and the guitars
Way back when we knew it all

And she's sitting right next to me, a hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy, but it's true

That you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be eighteen again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
Feels so good to see you, my old friend
It's good to see you again

Can you believe it?
How much everything has changed
Well, they shut down the old diner
And they put in some new chain
You know it's so good to see ya
Man, your hair, it got so long
It feels like it's been forever
And we're still singing that old song

Well, she's sitting right next to me, your hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy, but it's true

That you never get a second chance at the first time (First time)
We will never be eighteen again (Yeah, yeah)
No, you never get a second chance at the first time (First time)
Feels so good to see you, my old friend

Well, you know they say that growing up is hard
Well, it's so hard to think of how we almost got so far
Well, do you remember on the night of our first kiss?
Well, baby, didn't it feel a little just like this?
Oh

With you sitting right next to me, your hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah it's crazy
Crazy, 'cause it's true

No, you never get a second chance at the first time (First time)
We will never be eighteen again (Yeah, yeah)
No, you never get a second chance at the first time (No, first time)
Feels so good to see you my old friend
It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
Good to see you again
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
