I'm only here for one night
The night is almost gone
You pull me close just one more time
You say, "I'm barely hangin' on"
The parking lot is empty
They're packin' up the trucks
The ground is trashed with ticket stubs
And the crew is gettin' drunk

You said, "When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?"

And I said, "Maybe I'll see you in Brooklyn
Maybe I'll see you in France
As long as the waves keep on rollin' in
Things don't always go the way they're planned
Maybe I'll see you in Jersey
Maybe next year in Japan
Sometimes it's so hard to find a friend
You're the only one that just might understand"

I'm lost in wonderland
See BOYS LIKE GIRLS LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Some call me a gypsy
The towns all look the same
And sometimes when I close my eyes
I almost see your face
I'm losing my perspective
Reality is gone
I'm sorry that I didn't call
I know it's been so long

And you said, "When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?"

And I said, "Maybe I'll see you in Brooklyn
Or maybe I'll see you in France
But as long as the waves keep on rolling in
Things don't always go the way they're planned
Maybe I'll see you in Jersey
Maybe next year in Japan
Sometimes it's so hard to find a friend
You're the only one that just might understand"

Ooh
I'm lost in wonderland
Ooh
Lost in wonderland
Maybe I'll see you in Portland
Or maybe I'll see you in Bend
As long as the stars keep on shootin', yeah
Who knows how this story's gonna end?
Baby, I'll see you in Boston
Back where this whole thing began
Sometimes it's so hard to find a friend
You're the only one that just might understand
You're the only one that just might understand
Well, you're the only one that just might understand

Ooh
Lost in wonderland
Ooh
