Hey, hey, hey (That's her)
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, hey (Watch me go)
Woo-hoo

She's full moon shining like a summer night star
She's the girl sunbathing on the hood of her car
Hey, hey, hey (That's her)
She's a silver screen honey with her ray-bans on
Get your heartbeat racing like a ticking time bomb
Hey, hey, woo-hoo

She likes to rock it with the rag top down
With the radio up and she's singing out loud
(Singing out loud, singing out loud, right now)
Yeah
She likes to party in the middle of the day
She's like anywhere, don't care, carried away
Yeah (Let's go)

She's crazy
I don't care
'Cause I'm crazy about the girl with the red cup, hands up, long brown hair
I can't help it
It's not fair
I'm crazy about the girl with the red cup, hands up, long brown hair
