Four in the morning, the party's over
I think I need you now
I can't remember when you left me
But I'm alone somehow
I can hear your voice ringing in my ear
Telling me to just slow down
Sometimes I wanna run
What have I become?
That's enough, I'm tappin' out

Won't you take me home? (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Take me home (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Cold and tired, I lost the fire
And I can't make it out here on my own
So take me home (I've been standing to close to the edge)

Wrote you a letter, I never sent it
It doesn't matter now
All my intentions went out the window
Don't let me hit the ground
Can you hear my voice, calling out your name?
Sometimes I wanna run
What have I become?
That's enough, I'm tappin' out

Won't you take me home? (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Take me home (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Cold and tired, I lost the fire
And I can't make it out here on my own
So take me home (I've been standing to close to the edge)

Lost the love on lonely road
Where I'm going, no one knows
So won't you come and pick me up and take me home?
I've been standing too close to the edge now
I've been standing too close to the edge
I've been standing too close to the edge, now
I've been standing too close to the edge

Won't you take me home? (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Take me home (I've been standing too close to the edge)
Won't you take me home?
Cold and tired, I lost the fire
And I can't make it out here on my own
So take me home (I've been standing to close to the edge)
