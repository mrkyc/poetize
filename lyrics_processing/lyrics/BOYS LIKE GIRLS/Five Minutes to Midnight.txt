Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives, we're stuck in the undertow
But you know the places I wanna go
'Cause oh oh oh
I've got a sickness, you've got the cure
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door

You know you wanna
Just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Sing it, oh oh
We got all we need, so here we go

Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up, turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop, make your heart drop and come alive

We could
Pack up and leave all our things behind
No fact or fiction or storyline
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
You're oh oh
Like air, I can't stop my breathing in
I'm weak and you were my medicine
I won't stop till I am under your skin

And when the clock strikes twelve
Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell?
'Cause you know I never will
I think we should strike a match
And we'll hold it to the wind to see how long it lasts
We could make the time stand still
