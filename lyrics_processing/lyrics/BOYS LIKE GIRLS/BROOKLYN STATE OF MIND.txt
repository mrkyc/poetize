All the crosses on the highway (All the crosses on the highway)
Make a runway in the street (Make a runway in the street)
And just like any given Tuesday, pull up at the valet
"Take me to my seat" ("Take me to my seat")
I was born inside a black car (I was born inside a black car)
Little bag under my coat (Little bag under my coat)
We're counting paper in the backyard, throw it off the deep end
See if it'll float (See if it'll float)

Oh, 'cause I want it all, oh, oh, oh yeah

Closing time
But the night is still brand new
Ain't no stopping me now
One sip, tie up my laces
Got all the right friends in all the wrong places
In my state of mind
It'd be easier on you if I wasn't around
One hit, off to the races
Got all the right friends in all the wrong places, ah-ooh

Talking money in the men's room (Talking money in the men's room)
Pockets lined with gasoline (Pockets lined with gasoline)
Leather jackets like a costume
Soaked in sweat and perfume, but isn't that the dream? (But isn't that the dream?)
Driver, take me back to Brooklyn (Driver, take me back to Brooklyn)
Hit the petal, cross the bridge (Hit the petal, cross the bridge)
I think tonight should be a good one
You're one hell of a women for one son of a bitch (One son of a bitch)

Closing time
But the night is still brand new

One hit, off to the races
Got all the right friends in all the wrong places, ah-ooh
