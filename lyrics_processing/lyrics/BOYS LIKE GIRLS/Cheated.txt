You cheated on me, whoa-oh (Oh)

Can we skip the part where you look in my eyes and tell me you apologize?
That you've been lookin' at me, saying that you're sorry
Isn't gonna change my mind

After all we had, I just can't go back
To the life I wanted, I'm just being honest
This is where it ends, goodbye

'Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me, whoa-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no, oh
You fooled me once and I let you come home
Fooled me twice, now I'm letting you go
'Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me, whoa-oh
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
You cheated on me, whoa-oh

I know I don't deserve this
You don't get a last kiss
Gotta leave you now or never
This is gonna haunt you
Every guy that wants you
Is gonna see a scarlet letter

After all we had, I just can't go back
To the picked fences, coming to my senses
This could never last forever

'Cause I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me, whoa-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no, oh

You cheated on me, whoa-oh
Late at night, in your bed full of roses
You reached for me, and get a hand full of thorns
But before you leave, I just thought you should know this
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I know, whoa oh oh
I know
You cheated on me
You cheated on me, whoa-oh
And I know
You'll never love me
You'll never love me, no oh
