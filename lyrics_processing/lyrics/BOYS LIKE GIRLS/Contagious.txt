I'm flying down the fast lane
Doing ninety-five, ninety things on my brain
Don't know where the hell I'm goin'
But I'm going after you
I'm jumping on the last train
Got this crazy kinda feeling that I can't explain
Don't know where the hell I'm goin'
But I'm going after you

And I know you think I'm crazy
And I dress up like I'm poor
I don't do dinner and movies
But if I showed up at your door

Would you give me one more minute?
The story's far from finished
We could fill in all the pages
I'm feeling sick, girl, you're so contagious
Just wanna say I miss you
I caught it when I kissed you
And I've been through all the stages
I'm feeling sick
Girl, you're so contagious
I'm feeling sick
Girl, you're so contagious

It was raining on Wednesday
Doin' ninety-five, ninety things left to say
Told myself to keep on driving
'Cause I left my heart with you
I never thought that I could walk away
Every second, I'm regretting that I didn't stay
How could I just keep on driving
When I left my heart with you?

You think all my friends are crazy
And I know you hate my car
Well, I don't drive a Mercedes
But would it be that hard?

To just give me one more minute
The story's far from finished
We could fill in all the pages
I'm feeling sick
Girl, you're so contagious
Just wanna say I miss you
I caught it when I kissed you
And I've been through all the stages
I'm feeling sick
Girl, you're so contagious
I'm feeling sick
Girl, you're so contagious
How can I get a second chance?
Don't want you slippin' out my hands
Maybe the words would come out right
This time around (Does this sound contagious?)
Just hear me out before I go
Things that I wanted you to know
Just let me in tonight and I won't let you go
(Does this sound contagious?)

Would you give me one more minute?
