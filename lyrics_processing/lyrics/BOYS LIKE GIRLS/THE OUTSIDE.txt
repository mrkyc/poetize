(Meet me at Foxwoods)
It's okay, it's alright
Baby, welcome to life on the outside
Sleep all day, ride all night
Yeah, we're livin' it up on the outside

I remember the days in the class of '04
In the back of the Jeep, crashin' out on the floor
We had nothin' in our pockets to cling to
And, baby, nothin' but the sky in the rearview
In the halls with a rock tee, Dickies and Chucks
All the meatheads and mean girls like, "Dude, your band sucks"
Had a bandana hangin' out of my grad gown
Like you can push me all you want, I won't fall down, no

It's okay, it's alright
Baby, welcome to life on the outside
Sleep all day, ride all night
Yeah, we're livin' it up on the outside
And you can knock it if you really want to
But we're the life of the party
It's okay, it's alright
Baby, welcome to life on the outside
See BOYS LIKE GIRLS LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Watch the sunset fade to a parkin' lot glow
We were kings and queens of the strip mall row
Tradin' million-dollar ideas for eighth bags
Our little fortunes built on lighters and dog tags
With our fists in the air and the radio up
We were dyin' to live, we were livin' on luck
When they would try to pick a fight in the hallway
We'd just throw a finger in the air and say

It's okay, it's alright
Baby, welcome to life on the outside
Sleep all day, ride all night
Yeah, we're livin' it up on the outside
And you can knock it if you really want to
But we're the life of the party
