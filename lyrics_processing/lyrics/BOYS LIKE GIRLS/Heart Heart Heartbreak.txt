Heartbreak, break, break, break
Heart heart heartbreak, break, break, break

Girl, don't say you love me when you're out the door (Whoa, yeah)
'Cause I know things are different then they were before (Whoa, yeah)
You kill me with your kiss, it's so hard to resist you
When you look me in the eyes tonight

And say we're headed for a heart, heart, heartbreak
And I don't ever ever wanna hear you say
Don't say you love me, don't even
Don't say you love me, you're leaving
Headed for a heart, heart, heartbreak
I'm gonna, gonna turn around and walk away
Don't say you love me, don't even
Don't say you love me, you're leaving

You said we'd stick it out through the thick and thin (Whoa, yeah)
But when the walls came down, you wouldn't let me in (Whoa, yeah)
We've been through it all, my back's against the wall
It's crashing down on me tonight

Headed for a heart, heart, heartbreak

Beating me down with the same conversation
No, don't say you love me tonight
