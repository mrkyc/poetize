We were seventeen and invincible
Had the world figured out
And the girl on my shoulder told me
"Everything's gon' be alright" (Whoa, oh)
And everything was gonna be alright (Whoa, oh)
Yeah, maybe we were in high school
But you never see the ending
When you're young and not pretending singing
"Everything's gon' be alright" (Whoa, oh)
And everything was gonna be alright

Buried her deep inside
Stars stuck in my eyes

Now she's got a boyfriend and I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's in Ohio and I'm on some back road
Driving to the city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
But she's got a boyfriend now (Whoa, whoa)

Then I took a trip out to L.A
For the girl with a smile that could take your breath away
I'm thinking, "Everything's gon' be alright" (Whoa, oh)
And everything was gonna be alright (Whoa, oh)
Maybe I thought I could sleep in
And sweep her off her feet and go right back to Boston thinking
"Everything's gon' be alright" (Whoa, oh)
And everything was gonna be alright
The streets keep rolling on
But now she's so far gone

Now she's got a boyfriend
And I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's on the west coast and I'm on some back road
Driving to the city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
But she's got a boyfriend now

Take me back to you somehow, with everything that I don't know
It's so hard (So hard)
I tore us apart
Take me back to feeling like the world would just keep dealing me the right cards (Right card)
Now you're just so far and I'm
Twenty-three and invincible
Got the world figured out and the bird on my shoulder told me
"Everything's gon' be alright" (Whoa, oh)
And that most everything's gon' be alright

Now she's got a boyfriend
And I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's in Ohio and I'm on some back road
Driving to the city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote (She wrote)
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
'Cause there she goes (She goes)
I wish that I could press rewind somehow (Somehow)
But she's got a boyfriend now (Whoa, oh)
(Whoa) She's got a boyfriend now
(Whoa, whoa) She's got a boyfriend now
