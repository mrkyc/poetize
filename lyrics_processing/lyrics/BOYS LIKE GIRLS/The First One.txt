Even though you're gone and far away
I feel you all around
I think about it every single day
You got away somehow
I can't sleep, it's hard to breathe
And I still feel you next to me
Now I can see

The first one is the worst one
When it comes to a broken heart
Your first love
Yeah, you're so young
And you feel like a fallen star
There's a fire in the city that's burning out tonight
You're breathing, but you're buried alive
The first one is the worst one
When it comes, when it comes to a broken heart

Spinning like a movie in my head
I've seen a thousand times
I've learned to take it hard and fall instead
Of sitting safe on the sidelines
Lost days, pictures fade
Somehow you're still miles away
It's safe to say

You're breathing, but you're buried alive
The first one is the worst one
When it comes, when it comes to a broken heart

'Cause I would run through a thunderstorm just to kiss you
I'm out here on my own
Better now than I was before
But I miss you and I want you to know
I can't sleep, it's hard to breathe
And I still feel you next to me
And I can see, yeah
