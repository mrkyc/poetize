Today is the day
The worst day of my life
You sulk until it hurts me
I don't know why
The cost of misery
Is at an all time high
I keep it hidden
Close to the surface, inside

I'm learning to fall, I can't hardly breathe
When I'm going down, don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me

Could you be with him? Or was it just a lie?
He doesn't get you like I do, and you don't know why
You change your clothes and your hair
But I can't change your mind
Oh, I'm uninvited
So unrequited, now

I'm learning to fall, I can't hardly breathe
When I'm going down, don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me

Words screaming in my head
Why did you leave?
And I can't stop dreaming
Watching you and him
When it should have been
It should have been me
Today is the day
The worst day of my life

I'm learning to fall, I can't hardly breathe
When I'm going down, don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me
Whoa (I'm learning to fall, I can't hardly breathe)
(I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me)
Tell me that you know, it should have been me
Whoa (Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see)
I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me
Whoa (I'm learning to fall, I can't hardly breathe)
(I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me)
Tell me that you know, it should have been me
Whoa (Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see)
