It's over, look out below
And I'm wasted, I still taste it
Yeah, it's so hard to let go
So breathe in now
And breathe it out
The forecast, a car crash
It's looking like another

Breakdown, rebound
This could be my last goodbye
You cross your heart, I hope to die and

I can't deny your eyes
You know I tried to read between the lines
I saw a warning sign
And then you threw me up against the wall
Who said that it's better to have loved and lost?
I wish that I had never loved at all

No rewinds, no second times
And I won't break, I won't waste, everything you left behind
So don't follow
Just let it go
The weather's, been better
Don't let it be another

I can't deny your eyes
You know I tried to read between the lines
I saw a warning sign
And then you threw me up against the wall
Who said that it's better to have loved and lost?
I wish that I had never loved at all

All the nights I spent sitting at home while you were out there on your own
All the nights I waited by the phone when you were going in alone
And all your different faces and all your different ways of making everything a mess
And all I'm saying is that all the different places, and all the compilations, laid to rest and

I can't deny your eyes
You know I tried to read between the lines
I saw a warning sign
And then you threw me up against the wall
Who said that it's better to have loved and lost?
I wish that I had never loved
And I can't deny your eyes
You know I tried to read between the lines
I saw a warning sign
And then you threw me up against the wall
Who said that it's better to have loved and lost?
I wish that I had never loved at all
