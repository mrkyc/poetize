I got your runaway smile in my piggybank, baby
Gonna cash it right in for a new Mercedes
You were worth the hundred thousand miles
But you couldn't stay awhile
I got your little brown shirt in my bottom drawe,  baby
And your little white socks in the top drawer
You were always leaving your shit around
And gone without a sound

Yeah, I'm the first to fall and the last to know
Where'd you go?

Now I'm heels over head
I'm hangin' upside down
Thinking how you left me for dead
California bound

I got a first class ticket to a night all alone
And a front row seat up right by the phone
'Cause you're always on my mind
And I'm running out of time
I've got your hair on my pillow and your smell in my sheets
And it makes me think about you with the sand in your feet
Is it all you thought it'd be?
You mean everything to me

Yeah, I'm the first to fall and the last to know
Where'd you go?

Now I'm heels over head
I'm hangin' upside down
Thinking how you left me for dead
California bound
And when you hit the coast
I hope you think of me
And how I'm stuck here with the ghost of what we used to be

You're burnin' bridges, baby
Burnin' bridges, making wishes
Yeah, you're burnin' bridges, baby
Burnin' bridges, making wishes
You're burnin' bridges, baby
Burnin' bridges, making wishes
Yeah you're burnin' bridges, baby
Burnin' bridges, making wishes
You're a chance taker, heartbreaker
Got me wrapped around your finger
Chance taker, heartbreaker
Got me wrapped around your finger
I got your runaway smile in my piggybank, baby
Gonna cash it right in for a new Mercedes
If I drive a hundred thousand miles
Would you let me stay a while?

Now I'm heels over head
I'm hangin' upside down
Thinking how you left me for dead
California bound
And when you hit the coast
I hope you think of me
And how I'm stuck here with the ghost of what we used to be

Now I'm heels over head
I'm hangin' upside down
Thinking how you left me for dead
California bound

And when you hit the coast
Maybe you'll finally see
