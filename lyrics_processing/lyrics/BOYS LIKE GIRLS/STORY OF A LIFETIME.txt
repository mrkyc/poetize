I wanna feel you when you shake your thunder under my skin
I wanna feel your strike of lightnin' come and whip me again
Heard if we can climb the continental, baby, we can get high
The sky is fallin' like a storm that's rollin' into my bones
This place'll leave you soakin' wet and get you outta your clothes
Crossin' through Jordan begs the question, "Are you ready to die?"

Maybe I'm homesick, maybe just tired
Maybe this broomstick'll loosen the wires
I pray for a message, I pray for a sign
I pray for the passion to stoke the fire

Carry me, carry me
Show me thrill or fantasy
I'm feelin' lost, feelin' weak, feelin' bind
Carry me, carry me
'Cause I've been walkin' in my sleep
Feelin' scared, feelin' free, I'm feelin' fine
Story of a lifetime

I saw the roses, saw the shield, they marked the spot with a cross
Ridin' through miles and miles of pavement fuckin' littered with loss
Out here, the angels put on headphones every time that you cry
They say the badlands get inside you like you're somethin' possessed
Barbed-wire fences line the road, remind you that you're a guest
Best chance at Heaven I've been told is screamin' up at the sky

Yeah, well, maybe I'm homesick, maybe just tired
Maybe this oil slick'll stick to the tires
I pray for a message, I pray for a sign
I pray for the passion but don't got the passion

So carry me, carry me
Show me thrill or fantasy
I'm feelin' lost, feelin' weak, feelin' bind
Carry me, carry me
'Cause I've been walkin' in my sleep
Feelin' scared, feelin' free, I'm feelin' fine
Story of a lifetime

Na, na, na, na, na
Somebody carry me
Na, na, na, na, na
Somebody carry me
Na, na, na, na, na
Somebody carry me
Na, na, na, na, na

Well, carry me, carry me
Show me thrill or fantasy
I'm feelin' lost, feelin' weak, feelin' bind
Carry me, carry me
'Cause I've been walkin' in my sleep
Feelin' scared, feelin' free, I'm feelin' fine
