Alright, you motherfuckers
Let's get this party started, oh
Come on

If I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand fuckin' times
The voices in my head keep telling me I'm doing fine
I say it with a straight face that it's just another line
But it's more than that 'cause there's no way back

Here I go, I'm trippin', where have I been?
I've got a feelin' like I'm slippin', I'm on my knees
Just wanna run, will I ever, ever be free?
It's now or never, it's time to sink or swim

'Cause I'm going off the deep end, yeah, I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't feel important if I'm dead or I'm alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up, going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons so let's get the party started
Yeah

God damn, this'll make me sick
Fuck my life 'cause I'm done with it
Can't fix me 'cause you don't know shit
Better be scarred than to not have lived

Now I'm trippin', where have I been?
I've got a feelin' like I'm slippin', I'm on my knees
Just wanna run, will I ever, ever be free?
It's now or never, it's time to sink or swim

'Cause I'm going off the deep end, yeah, I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't feel important if I'm dead or I'm alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up, going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons so let's get the party started

I'm so happy, I could die right now
I'm so happy, I could die right now, yeah
I'm so happy, I could die right now
Someone fucking kill me
I'm so happy, I could die right now
I'm so happy, I could die right now
I'm so happy, I could die right now
Won't someone fucking kill me?

Get the party started
Get the party started
I'm going off the deep end and I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't seem important if I'm dead or I'm alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up, going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons so let's get the party started
Yeah

Motherfucker
