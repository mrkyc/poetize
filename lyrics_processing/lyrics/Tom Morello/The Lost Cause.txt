By the time you saw the open gate and the cobra by the door
You were half way hauled to holy ghosts, the poison of the Lord
In a trance you'd find him sleeping in the hallway pretty drunk
Oh, how you wanted him to feel the way you felt during the war
Now an insect in your boots, so you negotiate your price
With a wager made in fractions, so you take another slice
Oh, you could feel the breath before you, one thousand angry eyes
There is a reason that you're standing here, a reason in the fight

So every time I try to run away from you
I find another ransom hiding in the scope
And I don't want to believe it
Every time you try to hang your empty rope
Another casual cost of trying to stay afloat
And you don't want to believe it

It starts when you stop
And it stops when you start
To believe that the lost cause is more than it's costing ya
It starts when you stop
And it stops when you start
To believe that the lost cause is more than it's costing ya

So the moral of the story, are the blind leading the blind?
An eraser put to history? A deletion in the files?
What about all you've been teaching?
What a laundry list of fires
What a sneaky misdirection
What a complicated lie

So every time I try to run away from you
I find another ransom hiding in the scope
And I don't want to believe it
So every time you try to hang your empty rope
Another casual cost of trying to stay afloat
And you don't want to believe it

It starts when you stop
And it stops when you start

And it stops when you start
To believe that the lost cause is more than it's costing ya
