From the time I was born
Through all of my days
Try to catch my breath
Out of the womb and into the flames
Searching for the neon path

I've been waiting my whole life
In the crossfire, yeah
I've been hiding my whole life
In the crossfire, yeah the crossfire
Every time I move
Every step that I take
Everywhere I look
It's right in front of my face
One foot in the shadows
One foot on the brakes
One foot towards the gallows
Where it's quiet and safe

Every step that I take
Every step that I take
Every step that I take
Step that I take
Every step that I take

Lost in the motions
Locked in the safe
Trying to forget the key
And I know where I lost it
But I'll never say
One day it was taken from me

I've been waiting my whole life
In the crossfire, yeah
I've been hiding my whole life
In the crossfire, yeah the crossfire
Every time I move
Every step that I take
Everywhere I look
It's right in front of my face
One foot in the shadows
One foot on the brakes
One foot towards the gallows
Where it's quiet and safe

Every step that I take
Every step that I take
Every step that I take
Step that I take
Every step that I take
Step that I take
Every step that I take

Every step that I take, take, take, take
(Take, take, take, take)
Every step that I take

Every time I move
Every step that I take
Everywhere I look
It's right in front of my face
One foot in the shadows
One foot on the brakes
Can't shake this force that
Keeps calling my name

Every step that I take
Every step that I take
Every step that I take
