Does it seem much darker than it did before, before?
Does it feel like we're up against so much more, much more?

But hope is stirring us inside
And the darkness has to run and hide
'Cause we illuminate the night
Oh, woah, oh, woah

There's a war we're fighting
We're waking up and calling on love to rise like a battle cry
There's a fire igniting
It's burning everything trying to hide, the light we shine
'Cause we're stronger than we think we are
There's a thunder rolling in our hearts
Pushing up against the dark
Yeah, we're stronger than we think we are
'Cause we're stronger than we think we are
There's a thunder rolling in our hearts
Pushing up against the dark
Yeah, we're stronger than we think, stronger than we think

'Cause the night has no power on its own, on its own
Through our fear, we give it space where it don't belong, don't belong
