Fighter, a fighter
Fighter, a fighter

So many broken nights, felt like it was the end
All of the losing fights, knocking me down again
But it was in the falling I found my faith
It was in my weakness I found Your strength
So I'm not afraid

Put my heart through the fire, I won't be burned
It's only making me stronger, even if it hurts
So I'll do whatever it takes
I know that I will be changed
When I walk through the fire
I'm coming out a fighter, a fighter (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Coming out a fighter, a fighter (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Voices inside my head, faces of all my fears
Telling me hope is dead, but still, I'm standing here
As long as this blood flows through my veins
You said I won't break under this pain
So I'm not afraid
