There's a brokenness, inside of you
There's a wound that still, reminds you
Of the fear, shame and rejection
You have seen it, you have seen it
You know it's time to get up
But your heart's paralyzed, you're so stuck
You're past the point of trying again
You're defeated, you're defeated

But something inside, you can't deny
You-you hear the call, of Your creator
I made you from more, unlock the door
I wanna restore, your glory

So rise
Breaking the dark, piercing the night
You're made to shine
An army of hope, bringing the world
A radiant light, a radiant light
You were made to rise, rise

Lift your head, and look around you
See the dreams you lost, they have found you
And the heart, that once was beating
Is coming back to life, coming back to life

So rise
Breaking the dark, piercing the night
You're made to shine
An army of hope, bringing the world
A radiant light, a radiant light
You were made to rise, rise

Shut the door on yesterday
Leave what happened in the grave
You were made to rise
You were made to shine
Creation's longing for the day
For kings and queens to take their place
You were made to rise
You were made to shine
Rise
Breaking the dark, piercing the night
Made to shine, bring the world a radiant light
Rise
Breaking the dark, piercing the night
You're made to shine
An army of hope, bringing the world
A radiant light, a radiant light

You were made to rise (rise)
