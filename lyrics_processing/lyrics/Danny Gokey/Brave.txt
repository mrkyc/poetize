I've been staying quiet, I'm not looking for a fight
And I don't hate nobody but nobody seems to like
That I wanna live what I believe
I wanna keep my right to speak
For my family, for my faith
To anyone who feels the same

Be brave
Stand up for freedom, stand for truth
And don't be afraid
You got a voice that you can use
So go on and speak out
The time is right now
If you wanna keep that flame of liberty ablaze
Stand up and be brave (Stand up)
Oh, stand up and be brave (Stand up)
Oh-oh

We're the generation that has to make a choice
Will we push against this evil or will we watch while it destroys?
What so many died to give us
This great country that we live in
There's a heavy price for freedom
And this is how we keep it

So go on and speak out
The time is right now
If you wanna keep that flame of liberty ablaze
Stand up and be brave (Stand up)
Oh, stand up and be brave (Stand up)
Oh-oh, oh-oh

We are the people
The red, white, and blue
Will you stand for me?
'Cause I will stand for you
We are the people
With different points of view
Will you stand for me?
'Cause I will stand for you

Let's be brave
Stand up for freedom, stand for truth (Stand for truth)
And don't be afraid (Oh, ohh)
You got a voice that you can use
So go on and speak out
The time is right now
If you wanna keep that flame of liberty ablaze
Stand up and be brave (Stand up)
Oh, you got to stand up and be brave
(Stand up for my family)
Oh-oh (Stand up for my children)
And be brave
Be brave for your children, be brave for your family
Be brave for your future, be brave for your country
