Light of lights
Eternal hope has come
By and by to lead up back to love
Come behold a manger for a bed
Where the King of King's has laid His head
Light of lights
Eternal hope has come

Hear the angel's song
Break the silent night
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
See the Saving One
Born that none may die
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
Glory to God
Let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
Glory to God
Let the earth reply
Lift up your eyes
