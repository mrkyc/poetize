How was she to know
As she ran and slammed the door
That the angry words she spoke
Were the last words she would breathe
How was she to see eternity
Between the red light and the green
It all ended suddenly

Cause tomorrow isn't promised
All we have is one life, is one time
To live and love and make it right
Yesterday is written
All we have is right now, is right now
To celebrate this one and only life

He always loved the rain
And the sound of a thunderstorm
He had to look for cover
As the wave overtook the shore
He watched helplessly as everything he owned
And everyone he'd ever known
In a moment was all gone

Cause tomorrow isn't promised
All we have is one life, is one time
To live and love and make it right
Yesterday is written
All we have is right now, is right now
To celebrate this one and only life

Sometimes we can't control
When or where or how life goes
We live our life for love
We can dream and pray and hope

She dropped him off at school
As she kissed her son goodbye
Was no way she would know
It would be for the very last time
Later came the news, the violent tragedy
The whole town prays how could this be?
How could this be?

Cause tomorrow isn't promised
All we have is one life, is one time
To live and love and make it right
Yesterday is written
All we have is right now, is right now
To celebrate this one and only
Life is too short gotta make it right
Yesterday's gone and all we got
Is right now, is right now
To celebrate this one and only
Life is too short gotta make it right
Yesterday's gone and all we got
Is right now, is right now
