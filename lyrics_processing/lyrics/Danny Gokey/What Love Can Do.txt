From the first breath we take, twenty-seven thousand days
Or something like that, they say it's all that we have
Don't you throw your life away, it's too beautiful to waste
To live for anything, anything else but love

Only one thing changes everything
Only one sure cure for every pain
The answer's right there waiting for you to choose
It doesn't cost you anything
But your world will never be the same
Take it from me 'cause I'm the living proof
That's what love can do, do
I'm the living proof that's what love can do, do
I'm the living proof that's what love can do, do

A word we rarely understand hold the key to the heart of man
It can shatter the darkness and it can heal every soul
Once you've tasted heaven's love, nothing else will be enough
You'll want more everyday, you'll want to give it away

Only one thing changes everything
Only one sure cure for every pain
The answer's right there waiting for you to choose
It doesn't cost you anything
But your world will never be the same
Take it from me 'cause I'm the living proof
That's what love can do, do
I'm the living proof that's what love can do
