Is your faith in yourself fading
Been there too long to know what to make of it anymore
Just know that you're stuck and can't get free
Don't even know what you need
Pain has become the safest of places
And you're too tired to finish the race
And all your doubt too big to get around
When the waves and the wind push harder
When you feel like you can't get through
He is there with you in the water
And He believes in you
When you're lost and you're broken hearted
When your shame is an open wound
He is holding you at your darkest
And He believes in you
The One who took the cross for you
He believes in you
He wouldn't put you through the fire
If He couldn't take you higher
Gotta remember He is still for you
Calls you His daughter, calls you His son
There's no mistake that could ever take that away
