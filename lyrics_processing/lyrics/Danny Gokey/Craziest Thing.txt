I've heard it all my life
But it took a lifetime to believe
To finally realize
That You could love someone like me
I'm letting it sink in
A little deeper every day
'Cause this freedom has no end

And I feel like letting go of all my cares right now
And I feel like making a fool of myself right now

And You got me like, ooh
It's the craziest thing to know that I'm loved by You
I'm loved by You
And You got me like, ooh
It's amazing to think that this has always been true
I'm loved by You
I don't deserve a single thing
But You give Your heart to me
You got me like, ooh
It's the craziest thing to know that I'm loved by You
I'm loved by You (I'm loved by You)
