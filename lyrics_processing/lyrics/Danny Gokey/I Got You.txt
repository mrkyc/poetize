I got You
I got You

Where would I be if it wasn't for You?
Lost in the dark, then You walked in the room
I came alive when You opened my eyes
I won't go back to that life

The world might be shaking
But I stay in Your presence
Standing strong
In Your love

'Cause I got you
In the joy, in the pain, in the waiting
In the flood, in the fire, in the breaking
I'm standing on You
So I won't be moved
Yeah, I'll get through
'Cause I got You

Why should I tremble with worry and fear?
If I am your temple, You're already here
Heaven surrounds me when I call Your name
There's nothing that You cannot change
