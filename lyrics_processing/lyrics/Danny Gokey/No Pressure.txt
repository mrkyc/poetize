There's no pressure

There's a battle raging
On the ground inside of me
I'm fighting my anxiety
And it gets so heavy
'Cause it feels like I can't reach
The person I'm supposed to be

I need to let go
I need You to remind my soul
That You don't see me the way I see me
I need to let go
I need You to remind my soul

That there's no pressure to be someone
Other than who You love
I can let my stress fall to the floor
There's no pressure to earn Your grace
You gave it all away
I don't have to be perfect
You tell me I'm worth it
There's no pressure (No pressure)

And there's a weight that's lifted
When I get down on my knees
It's like my lungs can finally breathe

I need to let go (I need to let go)
I need You to remind my soul

That there's no pressure to be someone
Other than who You love
I can let my stress fall to the floor
There's no pressure to earn Your grace
You gave it all away
I don't have to be perfect
You tell me I'm worth it
There's no pressure

There's no pressure, oh
There's no pressure
I don't have to be perfect
There's no pressure

I don't have to earn it, no
You already tell me I'm Yours, I'm Yours
I don't have to earn it, no
You already tell me I'm Yours
That there's no pressure to be someone
Other than who You love
I can let my stress fall to the floor (Fall to the floor)
There's no pressure to earn Your grace
You gave it all away
I don't have to be perfect (No)
You tell me I'm worth it
There's no pressure

There's no pressure, oh
There's no pressure (No-no)
I don't have to be perfect
There's no pressure (Whoa)
There's no pressure, oh
There's no pressure (No-no)
I don't have to be perfect
