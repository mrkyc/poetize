You always think I'm somewhere on a mountain top
But never think I'm behind bars
You'd be amazed the places that I'd go
To be with you where you are

So forget what you've heard
What you think that you know
There's a lot about Me
That's never been told

I'm more than you dreamed
More than you understand
Your days and your times
Were destined for our dance
I catch all your tears
Burn your name on My heart
Be still and trust My plan
I'm more than you think I am
More than you think I am

Rumor has it there's a gavel in My hand
I'm only here to condemn
But let Me tell you secrets you would never know
I think of you as My best friend

So much has been said
Even done in My name
But I'm showing you now
Who I really am

I'm more than you dreamed
More than you understand
Your days and your times
Were destined for our dance
I catch all your tears
Burn your name on My heart
Be still and trust My plan
I'm more than you think I am
More than you think I am

Let Me open your eyes to see the heart of Me differently
Come closer than you've ever been
Let Me in like never before
Bring Me every broken part
The wounds and scars of who you are
And hide in Me and you will see

I'm more than you dreamed
More than you understand
Your days and your times
Were destined for our dance
I catch all your tears
Burn your name on My heart
Be still and trust My plan
I'm more than you think I am
I'm more than you think I am
More than you think I am
More than you think I am
