A third eye, a crystal ball, her mama always said
It would guide her
If she kept it inside her
The freak across the street tried to contaminate her skin
She was thinking "who would miss him?"
The world's about to end
And he'd fit perfectly into her catastrophe
She's a woman at heart and a man on a mission
A Saint to purify the human condition
She's a fortune teller, but she's never gonna tell
There's a worm in the bottom of a dead wishing well
A woman's work is never done
A woman's work is never done
Never,when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
Never done,never when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
She found it funny that nine and ten were easier to do
After she'd meticulously filtered out a few
Still the voices shout
Take the garbage out
She was raised to believe that you get what you pray for
If God was really good then she wouldn't have to wait for
Him to drop the gravel,so she'll do it all herself
There's a worm in the bottom of a dead wishing well

A woman's work is never done
Never,when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
Never done,never when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
When the flashing lights cut through the billowing dust
Her voice cried "Looks like it's not just us,justice"
Guess she got a little careless with cadaver eleven
Before she'll go to jail she'd rather go to Heaven
And the final leap of faith of a zealot Jezebel
Led'em diggin in the bottom of a dead wishing well
A woman's work is never done
A woman's work is never done
Never,when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
Never done,never when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
A woman's work is never done
A woman's work is never done
Never,when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
Never done,never when she's a loaded gun,loaded gun
She's a loaded gun
A woman's work,yeah,yeah
Oh,a woman's work
This,this woman's
This woman's work
