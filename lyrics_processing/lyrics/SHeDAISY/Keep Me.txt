This can't really be what life is all about
Learning how to live Just to live without
The travesty's the irony and the irony is you
I've traded in my sanctity for a cheaper shade of blue
And as I surrender to this sunken bed
So afflicted by the tenant in my head
Even now I wonder how you lay her down to sleep
When secretly I know it's my soul that you pray to keep
But will you really keep me
Chorus:
(Keep me)
On your porch, on your tongue
Beating in your chest, or coming undone
Folded neatly in the cover of your favorite book
(Keep me)
At a distance, in your maze
Fumbling through a contemplative haze (keep me)
Or tucked away clandestinely where no one else will look
Where my broken sky reaches to your velvet sea
Will you keep me
Drowning in the bottom of this empty glass
I pray god is good and that this too shall pass
Then from the abyss maybe I'll find a sweet reprieve
When the echo of your kiss reminds me to believe
That you'll always keep me
You might also likeChorus:
(Keep me)
Under god, or on your wall
Behind closed doors forever after all
Or headed south on the blacktop ribbon we designed
(Keep me)
The mantle of integrity, investing in
Something I'll never see (keep me)
At 30,000 feet or in the windows of your mind
In a corner of your heart under lock and key
Will you keep me
Keep me (page 2)
Bridge:
Traipsing on hallowed ground
Has brought a lifelong sentence
Now living without your breath to fill
My lungs will be my penance
And even as I feel I hope you feel it Just as deeply
And even though you've let me go, say you'll always keep me
Say you'll always keep me
Chorus:
The melody you miscontrue
On the ocean crashing into you
Or waiting for the man you'll never
Have the heart to be
In the fervent strains of the tragic elegy
Will you keep me
Will you keep me
