I bounce around somewhere between my dreams and reality
So where'd you dig up the audacity to ask me
How we've all been doin' since you broke our hearts?
Well, so far
Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it, yeah
14 just wants to say, so long by gons
32 wants to do things to you that'll make you blush
10'll key the el camino that you love so much
And there ain't nobody wants to mess with 23
Lucky 4 you, tonight I'm just me
I guess this part is more than your lil' barbie bargained for
She's got you by the sleeve, slowly easin' towards the door
She's probably right, you should be movin' on, don't know how long
We can be late, you better have the valet, get your car
('Cause you know how women are)
