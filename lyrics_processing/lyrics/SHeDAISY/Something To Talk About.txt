People are talkin', talkin' bout people
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under covers
I just ignore it, but they keep saying
We laugh just a little too loud
We stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they're seeing, something we don't, darlin'
Let's give them something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let's give them something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let's give them something to talk about
How about love?
I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took a rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinking bout you every day (every day)
Dreaming bout you every night (every night)
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darlin'
Let's give them something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let's give them something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let's give them something to talk about
How about love, love, love, yeah
