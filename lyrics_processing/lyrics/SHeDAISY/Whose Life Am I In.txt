And every divet in the ceiling
How many half slices of toast will make how many whole?
And how do I escape this feeling?
Some say that I can be just as hard as a rock
But I can be oh so much bolder
I'll look you in the eye and I'll take you by surprise
And I'll eat this chip off my shoulder
I'm so bored I could cry
And I'm so happy I could die
Do I really wanna learn to fly?
Feel like an android
Living in a Polaroid
Just another reject
Who gets a little seasick
Whose life am I in?
Feels like deja vu
Don't know how or what to do
I point my finger to the sky
Finally ask the question why
Whose life am I in?
Whose life am I in?
You might also likeNow the answer to this question is there really isn't one
Cause life is positively indecisive
It takes a lotta work having this much fun
Sifting through this beautiful crisis
I'm so bored I could cry
And I'm so happy I could die
Do I really wanna learn to fly?
Feel like an android
Living in a Polaroid
Just another reject
Who gets a little seasick
Whose life am I in?
Feels like deja vu
Don't know how or what to do
I point my finger to the sky
Finally ask the question why
Whose life am I in?
Whose life am I in?
Whose life am I in?
I'm so bored I could cry
And I'm so happy I could die
Do I really wanna learn to fly?
Feel like an android
Living in a Polaroid
Just another reject
Who gets a little seasick
Whose life am I in?
Feels like deja vu
Don't know how or what to do
I point my finger to the sky
Finally ask the question why
Whose life am I in?
Could this be my twist of fate?
A dollar short of living late
Could this all be just a dream?
Or something more than in between
Rebound runaround back in the playground
All-night never right let's go fly a kite
Whose life am I in?
Let's go let's go
Whose life am I in?
And it takes a lotta work having this much fun
