Tone deaf, tone deaf
Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh
Da da da da da da
You say you're gun shy
I say you're spineless
You think you're pensive
I think you're mindless
Such a busy little drone
That your heart beats in monotones
So loud you can't hear me
Repetition's what you need
Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself
Ahh-ahh, da da da da da da da da
You might also likeYou say you're complicated
I say too dramatic
You think I underrate you
I think I've finally had it
With you never having time
'Cause half the time you spend
Designing brilliant tragedies
And it's becoming your disease, oh
Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself
Won't let you unnerve me
(You try to sting me like a pearl)
Won't let you deserve me
(And toss me from your tilt-o-whirl)
And even if I kiss the dirt you're gonna see
How I don't hurt
And I don't hurt
I don't hurt
Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Um, let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself
Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Get over yourself, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself
Get over yourself
Get over yourself
