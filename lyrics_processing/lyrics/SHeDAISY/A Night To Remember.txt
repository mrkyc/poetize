Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
He promised a night to remember
Oh, and she knows it will be
A happy little celebration
For their seventh anniversary
Her new dress is cut a bit lower
Her lips a brighter shade of red
She spent all day setting those blonde curls
Tonight's she's gonna knock him dead
She's gonna show him how
The fire's burning now
Her heart beats faster as she thinks back on that day
(chorus 1)
When he vowed they'd stay together
To have and hold her in his heart
She promised him forever
Until death do us part
Sealed with a tender kiss
She can't help but reminiace and smile
No doubt, this will be a night to remember
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Oh, to rember
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

And pull up to the edge
They have dinner up above those city lights
WIth a bloodless moon overhead
There's a distance in her emerald eyes
Her voice is a little cold
As he takes another sip from his champagne glass
He wonders could she know
Hidden inside her coat
Are letters his lover wrote
Her heart beats faster as she asks him to remember
(chorus 2)
When he vowed they'd stay together
To have and hold her in his heart
She promised him forever
Until death do us part
Sealed with a final kiss
She can't help reminiace and smile
No doubt, this will be a night to remember
Bridge:
She whispers in his ear and tells him that she knows
She throws the car in gear, plunging to the earth below
She whispers in his ear and tells him that she knows
She throws the car in gear, it blossoms like a fiery rose
(chorus 3)
When he vowed they'd stay together
To have and hold her in his heart
She promised him forever
Until death do us part
Sealed with a fateful kiss
Love takes a fatal twist
No doubt, this will always be a night to remember
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Oh, to remember
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
Ooo, Ooo,Ooo
(a night, a night, a night)
To remember
Ooo,Ooo,Ooo,Ooo
Ooo,Ooo,Ooo
(A night, a night, a night)
To remember
Ooo,Ooo,Ooo,Ooo
Ooo,Ooo,Ooo
