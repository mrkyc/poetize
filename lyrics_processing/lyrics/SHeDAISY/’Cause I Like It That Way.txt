All those lines you're tripping
That's not who I am
It ain't that quaint
Your composure's slipping
Right into my hands
('Cause when - just a little bit, just a little bit) I smile
(Just a little bit) You fall hard
Stop listening to you
Start listening to me
I'll know when the lights are changing, you'll see
If you're liking the view
Baby, it don't come free - yeah, yeah
(Never, never, never)
I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
Time to undo
All your archaic thinking
We're supposed to share this cave
Bye, bye, tough guy
Won't know what hit you 'til you're down
Your heart is mine to save
('Cause when - just a little bit, just a little bit) I smile
(Just a little bit) You fall hard
You might also likeStop listening to you
Start listening to me
I'll know when the lights are changing, you'll see
If you're liking the view
Baby, it don't come free - yeah, yeah
(Never, never, never)
I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
Da, da, da, da, da - hey
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da - hey
('Cause when - just a little bit, just a little bit) I smile

I'll know when the lights are changing, you'll see

I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
I think you're gonna stay, 'cause I like it that way
I think you're gonna stay, think you're gonna stay
I think you're gonna - stay
