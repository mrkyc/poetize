I won't be bored
I won't be ignored, hey

I won't be your dirty secret
I won't be your cure-all pill
And I won't run to fetch the water
Just to tumble down the hill
I won't be your Friday paycheck
I won't be the prize you flaunt
And I won't be your Martha Stewart, baby
Or your all-night restaurant

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will, but

I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heels
And I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels
I won't be your obligation
I won't be your Barbie doll
And I won't be the portrait of perfection
To adorn your wall
You might also like
But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
Yeah, I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will, but (You know I will)

Hey, you know, you know I will
Alright, woo

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be the last in line

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
Yeah, I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will

Yeah, I will, I will, I will be your everything
I will, I will be the whole shebang
I will, I will be your everything
I will, I will, I will, I will, yeah
You know I will
You know, you know I will
You know I will
