I swear I'll care as little as I can
'Cause I've become accustomed to wearin' nothin'
But pink nail polish on my left hand
So many valuable lessons I learned from you
Like forgiveness and breakin' hearts too
Now that you're a goner in your honor
More of the silence is the least I can do
Cut the lines
Blow up a few bridges
Trim the fat
Trim the grass
Clean out the fridge
Then sweep up the mess
Put on my Sunday best
And burn down the house
Burn down the house
Toss an easy stride into this dance I call life
And Burrrn, yeah
I never did like your fantasy football friends
I'll never have to watch Caddyshack again
I finally started cookin' and if you're lookin'
I'm walkin' my new dog in front of my new house
Got a new job and the money's come in
See you need a new man and a world and a new life
Nothing's quite as right as a girl on the mend

Yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa
Tearin' down old walls
Puttin' up new ones
Have a little fun it's wreckin' ball night
Gotta little itchin' to get down in the kitchen
With my tall drink of water and some dynamite
Cut the lines
Blow up a few bridges
Trim the fat

Clean out the fridge

Put on my Sunday best

Toss an easy stride into this dance I call life
And burn, burn, burn
Baby, burn
Ah, burn it up, yeah
Don't know burn, burn
