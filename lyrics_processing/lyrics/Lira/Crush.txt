I met him unexpectedly
Something about him appealed to me
I could not figure it out or even put my finger on it
But I liked him found him charming
It could have been the way he spoke cause
The tone of his voice kept, kept ringing through my ears all evening
I just watched him I observed him
As he spoke, moved his lips use his body
He intrigued me, appealed to all of me
How could I let him know

Can you tell me what it takes (Takes)
For me to get a guy like him (Him)
Do I even stand a chance (Chance)
Oh, why am I afraid? (Oooh!)
I feel my heart pounding
My temperature is rising (Rising)
Cause never ever have I seen (Seen)
A man quite like him

Amazed by how I was feeling
I found that deep inside I needed to do something say something
What if I never see this man again
Didn't wanna be too forward
Yet I didn't want him to ignore me
What do I do where do I start
And what's the first thing I would say
I wish that he would just turn to me
And face his gaze upon my face
And relieve me of all of those things that I feel
How could I let him know?
