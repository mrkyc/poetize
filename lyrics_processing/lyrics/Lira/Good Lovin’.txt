Some real good lovin'
Some real good lovin'
Some real good lovin'
Some real good lovin'

I'm sick and tired of going around
Looking for someone to love
I know there are still good men around
Lord know I'm not looking for much
Just someone who will be kind and
Someone who will treat me right and
Someone who will be all mine and
A brother who won't tell me lie

You look like it could be true
Tell me could it be you?
To make all my dreams come true
Tell me could it be you?
You got me thinking of you
You got me tripping of you
And all the things I'd love to do

All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'
All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'
You might also like
I've been in and out of love
But still I could not find the kind
Of love that I've been dreaming of
But still my heart just can't give up
I knew somewhere out there
There'd be a man who'd understand my crying
Man who'd understand I'm dying
Won't you come to my rescue?

You
Tell me could it be true?
Could I be falling for you
You make me feel brand new
Tell me could it be you?
You got me thinking of you
You got me tripping of you
And all the things I'd love to do

All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'
All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'
All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging

You look like it could be true
Tell me could it be you?
To make all my dreams come true
Tell me could it be you?
You got me thinking of you
You got me tripping of you
And all the things I'd love to do

All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'
All I need is real good lovin'
Just a bit of love and hugging
Someone who will treat me right
Give me sweet tender lovin'

Just a bit of love
Some real good lovin'
Just a bit of love
Some real good lovin'
Just a bit of love
Some real good lovin'
Just a bit of love
Some real good lovin'
Just a bit of love
Some real good lovin'
