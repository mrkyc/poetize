I can't believe the things you'd do
To try and get to my man, but I'm watching you
I'll bet you think that you're so cool
What are you up to?
'Cause you're really acting like a fool, yes
Walking by here with your lustful eyes
Hoping to have him as your prize
Don't you realise
Deceit is written in your eyes
Girl, I've seen your type
And this will catch you by surprise

He's not into the typical (He's not into the typical)
Finds me irresistible
Doesn't matter what you do
He still remains my baby love
He's not into the typical
Finds me irresistible
Doesn't matter what you do
He still remains my baby love

It's always been me and it always will be
We've been together for so long
And our love keeps growing strong
He's my partner and my lover
Even closer than my brother
There can be no undercover love no no
I see it in your lustful eyes, u wish he were your prize and I
Yes I see, yes I see
The deception in those lonely eyes
Cause girl iv seen your type
And this will catch you by surprise
