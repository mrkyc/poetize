Chapter 7: Verses 16 and 17 (Yes, sir)
They shall hunger no more
Neither shall they thirst anymore (Preach preacher!)
For God shall wipe away (Yes, sir)
Every tear from their eye (Yes, sir)

Sick and tired of my brothers, killin' each other
Sick and tired of daddies leavin' babies with their mothers
So every man that wanna lay around and play around
Listen partner, you be man enough to stay around
Sick and tired of the Church, talkin' religion
But yet we talk about each other, make a decision
No more racism (No), two face-ism (No)
No pollution (No), the solution (No)
A revolution (Come on)

What you feelin', what you want, son?
Who you callin' to, son?
You know Jesus is the truth, son?
The second in the Trinity, I know you feelin' him
500 days left, until the new millenium
You hearin' him, trumpet soundin'
Christ, the last, the first, the first, the last, it won't pass
So don't be caught slippin' brother, don't be trippin' brother
'Cause when I see him, I'm givin it

Even when we go they say we move too much, we do too much
If you step against us, then you lose too much
Ain't no stoppin' what we doin' when the spirit is movin'
Don't be hatin' what I'm doin', I'm the vessel he's usin' (Say what?)
Everywhere I be they try to judge me
They try to shake me, they try to buzz me
But they can't break me 'cause I'm down with Christ (Ha ha ha ha)
DarkChild and Nu Nation make me feel alright
