Gimme that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, Give me that
Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, Give me that
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
But I'm here by grace
Oh oh oh
Through Christ by faith
