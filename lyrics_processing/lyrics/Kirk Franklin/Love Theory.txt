Oh!
Uh, brothers and sisters
I wanna welcome you back to life
Back to the one
That can make your next chapter
Your best chapter
Hallelujah

How can it be
That You love the most unlovable part of me, of me?
How could You see
Your life was the only gift I'll ever need to be free?
It's amazing with You, I win even if I lose
Everything's working for my good for always (Come on)

He saves the day, He will come through
He won't bow, that's not what super heroes do (Hallelujah)
No greater love makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make You proud of me

(That's why) I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but You (Let's go)
