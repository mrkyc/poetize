I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
Now I believe not who I was but still not what I shall be
You found me and gave me your name and
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
Deep in me reaches for you
How do you do
I am a beggar
Desperate for more
I hunger for your truth
See I am shattered
Though I may fall still you make all things new
You speak, the storm, it obeys and ..
There is no way to mistake
Though I still feel you continue to heal, look close and see, whoa
I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am
I am
I am
Thank God I am
I am, I am

I am a winner
I lost a few and life struck me to my knees
And now I am standing
Not by my power, but your life inside of me
Even through seasons and changes
No tear has ever been wasted
This under system it worked for my good look now and see
I am not the old me but still
I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am
I am
I am
Thank God I am
I am, I am
I'm here and I'm closer (closer)
My praise now is stronger (stronger)
Stood up to fear (fear)
By faith I'm still here (I'm still here)
Try to walk away (away)
God said not today (not today)
Cause eyes haven't seen
What God has for me
The hurt and the lies
Through the pain, through the night
I cried and I cried
Yet still I survived
I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am
I am
I am
Thank God I am
I am, I am
I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am
I am
I am
Thank God I am
I am, I am
