So many different religions and
So many different churches and
If God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer
Just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
Of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough
To wash away my sins
And it's pure enough
To cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough
To find me when I'm lost
Great enough
To die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
Ahora mis pecados son limpios
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough
To wash away my sins
And it's pure enough
To cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough
To find me when I'm lost
Great enough
To die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know

It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
It doesn't matter what color you are
As you are as long as your blood was red
It doesn't matter what color I am
