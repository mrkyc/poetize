Hallelujah
Come on

When I wake up in the morning love
And my heart is filled with pain (Lord Jesus)
The smile I had upon my face is gone
Can't see the sunshine from the rain (But Jesus)

When I think of You
Then the world is alright with me
Lord, just one thought of You (Hallelujah)
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Thank you, Jesus; come on, come on)

Jesus, You're the lover of my soul
(That's right, the fire that burns)
The fire that burns deep within
(I know that's right)
You are the joy this world can't take away
This Spiritual love affair it will never end
(Hahaha, come on, come on)
