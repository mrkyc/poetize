Whoa, it's your boy
Let's go
This is a tribute right here
And it's about to go down!

Do you remember, when it was like September?
Before you grew cold like December
And all you saw were cloudy days
And I remember, that day when you surrendered
You stopped hurting cause you remembered
The season it won't last always

Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like September
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away

Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(I can see clearly now)
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(The sun is much brighter now)
Ba doo doop ba doop
(The season it won't last always)

Seemed like forever
You said when will my life get better
I'm tired of stormy weather
But the sun always shines in May
So just remember
The next time you feel like December
Remember that night in September
When God wiped all your tears away

Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like september
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away
Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like september
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away

Everybody has a September in their life
You know that first time you heard God's voice
So you felt His love
So no matter what season you're in right now
After winter comes spring
So if you love my Jesus help me sing
Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like September
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away
Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like September
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away
