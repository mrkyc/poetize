C'mon
Brothers and sisters
I'm feelin' real good 'cause it ain't over
Right before I die, I gotta live-

Live out my dreams
So, I can be what He planned for me
Not just for me, but so they can see
Much more of Him and less of-
Right before I die I gotta
Love my enemies, forgive the past
And set 'em free so I can free
Free up the things
Every blessing God has for me
See it's for me, not just for you (Oww!)
I had to learn from what I've been through
I can't go through that way again (Uh)
Be hurt by You that way again
It's not the end (No, no)

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try (Used to be afraid)
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like (But the Son)
But the Son came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky (Ha, ha)
I'm ready if you're ready (Ha, ha)
If you're ready

Change
Change how I think
Change how I speak
I'm not the same
So, when I speak
You don't hear the pain
No longer weak
With no one to
Right before I die I gotta-
Become more like you
Take up my cross
To count the cost
'Cause I was lost
That's why I praise you (Hah)
You're the only God
I don't know what they do
But I know
I used to be afraid to die (I used to be)
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like (But here comes the Son)
But the Son came to give me life (Now I feel like)
Now I feel like I can touch the sky (Ha ha)
I'm ready if you're ready
If you're ready

Get up and live right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now (I feel so good)
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Hah, get up and live right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now (I see you, Shawn!) right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Haha, let the beat breathe

So, the next time you think of me
And you wonder where I would be
Without each blessing that helped me to see (That life)
Life is much more than things (Things)
And how you live is more than how you sing (Sing)
When I die what did I really mean, I mean (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ayy)
Say what now? Hah, say what?
Hah, say what now?
As we proceed, hah, to give you what you need
Somebody (Somebody), anybody (Anybody), everybody (Everybody), scream
I used to be afraid to die (Ayy!)
I used to be afraid to try (I like this joint right here man)
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like (But here comes the Son)
But the Son came to give me life (Thank you Jesus)
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready
If you're ready

Get up and live right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now (Have mercy) right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Hah, get up and live right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now (Eee! This day)
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now (Will be your best day)
