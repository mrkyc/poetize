The spring of April's gone
The leaves have all turned brown
The children are all grown up
And there's no one around
I'm looking over my life
And all the mistakes I made
And I'm afraid, afraid
(Listen)
Somebody told me that You would wash all my sins
(Hallelujah)
And cleanse me from the scars that are so deep within
So I'm calling to You
If you can hear me, I don't know how
(He's never too busy)
I was wondering, can you hold me now?

(You are the only one)
You are the only one that's patient when I fall
(And your angels)
Your angels come to save me every time I call
(That's why I love you)
You don't laugh at me when I make mistakes and cry
(You're not like man)
You're not like man
(You understand)
You understand me
See people change
One day they don't like you, the next they do
(You know that's wrong)
I wish that everyone could love me just like You
So here I am this sinful man peace won't allow
I was wondering, can you hold me now?
(Hallelujah)
I was wondering, can you hold me now?

I know it seems like the storm will never pass
And it seems like the rain will never end
The Red Sea is front of you, and Pharaoh and his army is behind you
But my brother, if you look your head up to the sky
God has not forgotten you, and His angels will camp around you
But He'll never leave you nor forsake you
His word is true
He did it for me, He'll do it for you

To every broken person that may hear this song
(Yeah, to every boy or girl)
To every boy or girl that feels their smile is gone
(See, I know)
I know exactly how it feels to lay in the bed at night
(All night long and just)
And cry (Tear after tear), and cry

(But listen)
Don't you worry, God is faithful and He cares
About the tears you've cried
And the pain you feel is there
(When you are weak)
When you are weak that's when he's strong
Even though you don't know how
(I wish I could get a witness up in here, say what, say it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah, yeah; yeah
God can and He will hold you now
(God can)
God can and he will hold you now
(No matter what you've done, God can)
God can and he will hold you now
(Don't you worry)
Don't you worry, He can hold you now
(Thank you, thank you)
Ho, ho, ho, ho-oh
(He loves you)
Ho, ho, ho-ho, ho-ho-oh-oh-oh-oh
