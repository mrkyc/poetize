I've been down so long
I've been hurt for so long
There were times I thought I'd never see the break of day
It was hard for me to see Your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always
But night after night
Night after night
Night after night
I pray Lord, don't take Your joy from me
Then late one night, then late one night
I read in Your love letter that it's gonna get better

Let's go
I've been looking for you
I realize nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

When my enemies tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was coming to an end (uh)
All the while You knew (that's right)
That I would make it through (uh)
I feel closer to You now than I was when I first began
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
You are my sunlight after the rain
Wherever You are
Wherever You are
I just wanna be near You
I'm so glad I can hear You

I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me (bless me Father)
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me (nothing)
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You
