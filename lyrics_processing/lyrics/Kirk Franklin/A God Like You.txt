Everybody wanna be like you they
Want power and praise like you but
See there is no god like our God

There's no one like
Who gave their life like You and
Who payed our price like You see
There's only one god that's our God

Who can touch like You
Or heal us like You do
We stumble and we stray
Til' You always get us thru
Who makes all things new
And comes to our rescue
Death, hell, and the grave
(They could not) They could not conquer
