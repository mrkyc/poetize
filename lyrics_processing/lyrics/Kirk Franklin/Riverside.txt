For those of you that are going through it
I want you to wipe every tear from your eye, hahahaha
'Cause Jesus said he'd meet us someday, haha
Down by the riverside
Can I get a witness up in here?

It's Friday and my bills are due
My three-month-old baby need some shoes
Can you feel what I'm going through?
Clock on the wall keeps tickin' tockin'
No stoppin' and somebody's knockin'
On the door tellin' me to go (Lord have mercy)
Brother, I can't take no mo'
So with my knees I hit the flo'
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus
(Well, come on, y'all)

Let's go down by the riverside (Woo)
Leave your problems all behind
You can rest your troubled minds
Down by the riverside

I don't think you heard me the first time
So then why don't I say it one more time
Everybody, Jesus is gon' meet us down there by the riverside
One time for your holy minds
Come on

How can the dark clouds ever pass?

Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning light
God'll keep your spirit right
So, no matter what the people say (Ow, hahaha)-
Ain't nobody takin' this joy away

In spite of everything I've been through, I can say

Everybody goes through the storm and the rain
But listen, weeping may endure for a night
But how many of y'all know that joy cometh in the morning?
I need a witness up in here, Lord
