The truth can hurt you
Or the truth can change you
What would truth do to you

I just wanna be happy
But if I keep on doing the things
That keep on bringing me pain
There's no one else I can blame
If I'm not happy
Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy is me
So I'm not happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It won't change a thing child
Until you understand

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say "Jesus take the wheel"
He knows the road that you need to take
(But it only works if)

If you wanna be happy
(Look at yourself and say)
Don't you wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy

But if I keep on giving my heart
For people to tear apart
The healing will never start
So I can be happy
Will I ever be happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It won't change a thing child
Until you understand (If I'm talking to you now say)

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way (You been there too long)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take (I feel this one right here)
It's so easy to complain
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away (But I got good news for ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let Him take the wheel
The love you need, he already gave (But the question is)
Do you wanna be happy (If you're tired of you then say)
I just wanna be happy (Now if you really mean that, open up your heart and say it)

Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah
(If you're tired of going in circles)
Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah
(Tired of making the same mistakes)
Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah
(But now's your chance)
Let me hear you say yeah
(Say yeah)
Yeah yeah

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way (Are you ready, come on)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel (What you doin')
He knows the road that you need to take (It's so easy to complain)
It's so easy to complain (Come on)
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away (There's somebody that'll never leave ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let him take the wheel
The love you need, he already gave (But the question is)
Do you wanna be happy (Took a long time but I'm ready)
I just wanna be happy (Thank you Lord, every day ask yourself)
Do you wanna be happy (Yes, pull over, let him drive)
