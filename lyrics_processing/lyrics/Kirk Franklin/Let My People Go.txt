Chapter 2, verse 1, listen closely, you'll understand the plan
Pharaoh, in the heat of his anger, plotted to destroy
The babies from Israel's belly, let the girls live but kill every boy
But a child named Moses was one that God chose to be
The vessel sent into Egypt to deliver Israel and set the captives free, ya see
God took a nobody, made him a somebody
Told Pharaoh (What'd he tell him?) to let my people go
(No matter what you do to me)
(No matter what you say to me)
(No matter what you think of me) What you gonna say?
(Let my people go)
(No matter what you do to me) That's right
(No matter what you say to me) That's right
(No matter what you think of me)
(Let my people go)
It's 1999, and unfortunately we still ain't free, ya see
Ya think racism is a ghost like Casper
Look what just happened down in Jasper
I ask you why the babies dying and daddies crying
From the east side to the west side
To the south side, genocide
You can't hide from the fact
All the modern day Pharaohs I attack
And I stack
The knowledge inside my mind
Packs heat like a nine
The power from above I find
Rise up, my people, 'cause it's time
Come on, come on

The moral of the story is while you playing games trying to survive
As long as you selling that mess, doing that mess, you keeping Pharaoh alive
Don't hide from the matter
Whose pockets are really getting fatter?
Some churches are quick to say Amen
But they ain't that quick to help a man
I don't understand
If that's your brother, love your brother
Know your brother, show your brother
No matter what color
Don't hate one and love the other
My people, victory is yours and Pharaoh's defeated
If you don't know the book, read it
(No matter what you do to me)
(No matter what you say to me) What you say to me
(No matter what you think of me) Oh oh no
(Let my people go)
(No matter what you do to me) No matter what you do to me
(No matter what you say to me) What you say to me
(No matter what you think of me) No matter what you say to me
(Let my people go)
(Let my people, let my people) Pharaoh, can you hear me?
(Let my people, let my people) From the white house to the black house
(Let my people) From New York to L.A. (let my people)
Let my people go (Let my people)
This song is dedicated to everybody who's still in bondage
By the system, by the powers that be
Break those chains of ignorance
Recognize who you are and whose you are
And if you don't know
Now you know
Can I get a witness?
I said, can I get a witness?
Can I get one witness?
Come on
I figured
Let's get out of Egypt, come on, come on
