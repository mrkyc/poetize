Hello
(Hey, it's me, Kirk, I need to speak to Bishop)
Sure, hold on...

(Hello?) Hey, I got some stuff I need to talk to you about
Lately, pastor I've been having all these crazy kind of dreams
It's hard to sleep, I can't eat
Scary, you know (I know what you mean)
I mean, ever since that Tuesday
Seems like life's just getting real strange (I hear ya)
Anthrax, terrorist attacks and
I ain't even trying to get on no plane (I feel ya)
And you know when I try to pray
There's a voice that telling that God's not real
(You know that's just the enemy)
Yea, but you ain't feelin' me (No son, I know just know you feel)
(See, just because I preach and teach)
(Don't mean I don't get scared sometimes)
Yea, whatever, but you T.D. Jakes (Well, then I don't make mistakes)
Well (Now, let me tell you what's on my mind)

When your smile is gone (He cares)
{Yea, but I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
{See, but you don't know my} (my pain)
{And I'm getting so sick and tired of all} (this rain)
{I just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due}
{So tell me what I got to gain?}
Well, see, trials come to make (you strong)
Storms won't last (last long)
{But how can I trust God in all this mess?}
Well, see that's the reason for the song
See, wherever you go there's one thing ya got to know
God, is right there by your side (weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you everything
(Everything's gon' be alright)
See Kirk Franklin LiveGet tickets as low as $53
So thank you for calling, it's always good to hear from you
(Yea, but) but I gotta go now
(Wait a minute) I got another call on line 2
(But I ain't through)

See I'm sick and tired of all these church folk
Talking about stuff ain't as bad as it seems
See, y'all don't feel my pain (I don't have pain?)
I don't see how, you on the cover on Time magazine
(See, but you're looking at now and you don't know how I struggled)
(And what I've been through)
Yea, whatever (Now, you crossed the line)
I'm just speakin' my mind (Okay so let me speak mine, too) (Hmmmmmm)
(I've made some mountains, I've seen some valleys)
(I've even had to cry sometimes)
(Like when I lost my mother)
Your mother? (my mother) I'm sorry (No son, that's fine)
(See life is full of ups and downs but God said)
*singer* the storm won't last long
But how'd you make it through? (Boy, I thought you knew)
(It was His) *singer* love that kept me strong

When your smile is gone (He cares)
{But I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
{Yea, but see y'all don't feel} (my pain)
{And I'm getting very sick and tired of all this} (this rain)
{Just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due}
{So tell me, Bishop, what I gotta gain?}
Didn't I tell you trials come to make (you strong)
And those old storms won't (last long)
{How can I trust God in the midst of all this mess?}
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something ya got to know (God still cares)
(Weeping may endure for a night)
{And he told me to tell you}
(Everything's gon' be alright)
Thank you pastor (Any time)
I think I can make it now, just tell me what I need to do
(Just pray this prayer with me)

Say Father (Father) forgive me (forgive me)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry) please help me (help me)
I love You (I love You) I need You (I need You)
Hold me (hold me) Jesus (Jesus)
My heart (my heart) my soul (my soul)
Please take (please take) control (control)
Right now (Now) now
(Now) now (now) (right now)

When you ain't got no smile (He cares)
{And even when you feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
{And even in the midst of all ya} (pain)
{And when you're sick and tired of all the rain} (this rain)
{Remember that the rain won't last always}
{And in Christ Jesus, you got so much to gain}
You see your trials come to make you (strong)
And the storms won't last (too long)
{Remember my brother, my sister, it's only temporary}
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go {there's something you've got to know}
God is still there (weeping may endure for a night)
{And He told me to tell you}
(Everthing's gon' be alright)
