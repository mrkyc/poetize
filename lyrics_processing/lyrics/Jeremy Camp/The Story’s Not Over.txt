It's been a long road, long road
And I've been through so much through the years
I've had a heartbreak, heartbreak
I kept reaching for You through the tears

Thinking, I don't know what's up ahead
I don't know how it'll end
But I know that You've got a plan for me
Stepping out onto the waves
Haven't stopped walking by faith
Whatever comes I will still believe

The story's not over yet
You've got it under control
Why would I fear when I know You've designed?
The story's not over yet
You've written every word
Can't wait to see where You go with my life
The story's not over yet

I found Your goodness through the pain
Found Your mercy down upon my knees
I've learned when life goes sideways
You still got me where I need to be

Don't need to know what's ahead
Don't need to know how it ends
I know that You got Your hand on me

The story's not over yet
You've got it under control
Why would I fear when I know You've designed?
The story's not over yet
You've written every word
Can't wait to see where You go with my life
The story's not over yet
The story's not over yet
The story's not over yet
The story's not over yet

I believe what You started You will complete
I believe every broke thing will be redeemed
I believe 'cause You've always been faithful to me
To me, to me
I believe what You started You will complete
I believe every broke thing will be redeemed
I believe 'cause You've always been faithful to me
To me, to me
The story's not over yet
You've got it under control
Why would I fear when I know You've designed?
The story's not over yet (It's not over)
You've written every word
Can't wait to see where You go with my life
The story's not over yet
The story's not over yet (I believe You've got a plan for me)
The story's not over yet (It's not over)
The story's not over yet
