Always running always hiding from the heartache
Don't wanna face it
Look for a way out
Try to hold it all together so it don't break
But if I'm honest

Some of the hardest things in life brought me closest to You
And walking through the fire made these eyes brand new

How's a garden ever supposed to grow
If there ain't no rain, there ain't no rain
How am I gonna ever learn how to feel
If there ain't no pain, there ain't no pain
If I never fall
If I never break
How can my heart change
How's a garden ever supposed to grow if there ain't no rain?
No rain

It's the hope I needed kneeling on a cold floor
It's when I let go
I find the breakthrough
It's a cleansing for my spirit when the rain pours
Yeah, if I'm honest

Some of the hardest things in life brought me closest to You
And walking through the fire made these eyes brand new
So I'm wondering

How's a garden ever supposed to grow
If there ain't no rain, there ain't no rain
How am I gonna ever learn how to feel
If there ain't no pain, there ain't no pain
If I never fall
If I never break
How can my heart change?
How's a garden ever supposed to grow if there ain't no rain?

I found heaven when I went through hell
I found healing when I wasn't well
And when my heart was a desert
It was Your love I remember
I found heaven when I went through hell
I found healing when I wasn't well
And when I went through the desert
It was Your love I remember

How's a garden ever supposed to grow
If there ain't no rain, there ain't no rain
How am I gonna ever learn how to feel
If there ain't no pain, there ain't no pain
If I never fall
If I never break
How can my heart change?
How's a garden ever supposed to grow if there ain't no rain?
No rain
If there ain't no rain
There ain't no rain
Rain
There ain't no rain
