I try to hold on to this world
With everything I have
But I feel the weight of what it brings
And the hurt that tries to grab
The many trials that seem to never end
His word declares this truth
That we will enter in this rest
With wonders anew

But I hold on to this hope
And the promise that He brings
That there will be a place with no more suffering

There will be a day
With no more tears
No more pain
And no more fears
There will be a day
When the burdens of this place
Will be no more
We'll see Jesus face to face
But until that day
We'll hold on to You always

I know the journey seems so long
You feel you're walkin' on your own
But there has never been a step
Where you've walked out all alone
Troubled soul, don't lose your heart
'Cause joy and peace He brings
And the beauty that's in store
Outweighs the hurt of life's sting

But I hold on to this hope
And the promise that He brings
That there will be a place with no more suffering

There will be a day
With no more tears
No more pain
And no more fears
There will be a day
When the burdens of this place
Will be no more
We'll see Jesus face to face
But until that day
We'll hold on to You always
I can't wait until that day
Where the very One I've lived for always
Will wipe away the sorrow that I've faced (Wipe away the sorrow)
Oh, to touch the scars that rescued me
From a life of shame and misery, oh
This is why, this is why I sing

There will be a day
With no more tears
No more pain
And no more fears
There will be a day
When the burdens of this place
Will be no more
We'll see Jesus face to face
There will be a day
With no more tears
No more pain
And no more fears
There will be a day
When the burdens of this place
Will be no more
We'll see Jesus face to face
There will be a day
He will wipe away the tears
He will wipe away the tears
He will wipe away the tears
