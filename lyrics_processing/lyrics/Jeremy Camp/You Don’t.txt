No, I don't have to be afraid
Oh, when this storm is in a rage
You won't though, be around, get your minds on the ground
When I seek You, You alone are my strength

Earth shakes, hearts break, things change, life fades away
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh-oh)
Days and stars burn out like men, like kings died
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)

You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)
You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)

The world is pulling me apart
When I am treading in the dark
When my feet feel abound
When I need to be found
That's when I'll remember who You are

Earth shakes, hearts break, things change, life fades away
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh-oh)
Days and stars burn out like men, like kings died
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)

You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)
You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)

Yeah, You're the King of Kings in control of everything
My sin doesn't make You afraid, Your love doesn't change
I spent most of my life just tryin' to run away (Uh)
But You never gave up and quit, that's why I'm here today (Yeah)
And every day I get it wrong, I need all of Your grace
You took the shackles off my feet, I'm no longer a slave

Stop protectin' what's hurtin', you can't heal if you run (Stop)
I'm getting better every day when I rest in Your love (Uh-huh)
And I'm moving at the pace that You're gracefully
Used to be ashamed, but You took all the blame for me
When the storms came, You covered me from the raging sea
Inside of the secret place You made for me, You stayed with me

Earth shakes, hearts break, things change, life fades away
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh-oh)
Days and stars burn out like men, like kings died
But You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)
You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)
You don't, You don't, You don't (Oh, oh)
You don't, You don't, You don't
