Locked up and I'm so in my head
Heart starts racing and I can't slow it down
Hands shaking and I'm losing my breath
Paralyzed with a mind spinning out

My strength has grown weak
No words left to speak
I fall to my knees
'Cause I know what I need

You are the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)

Wrapped up in the arms of Your love
Stilled by the silence above all the noise
Burden's light when You're lifting it up
Fear is terrified by the sound of Your voice

'Cause You don't grow weak
Your word is peace
I fall to my knees
'Cause I know what I need

You are the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Anxious heart)

You know everything about me
You come and surround me
And everything that holds my soul
Falling is surrender
Learning to remember
You're the One who's in control

You are the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart (Eh)
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Yeah)
You are the life when my breath is gone (You are)
You are the hope when I'm stuck in the storm (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
And I know this is still who You who are (Yeah)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
