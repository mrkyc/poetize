I've been thinking about time and where does it go
How can I stop my life from passing me by, I don't know
I've been thinking about family (Family), how it's going so fast
Will I wake up one morning, just wishing that I could go back?
I've been thinking about lately, maybe I could make a change
And then it could change me, so with all of my heart
This is my prayer

Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Keep me in the moment, oh keep me in the moment
Keep me in the moment, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me

When I wake up in the morning, Lord touch my heart
Don't let me stray, I just wanna stay where You are
All I got is one shot, one try, one go around in this beautiful life
Nothing is wasted when everything's placed in Your hands

Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Keep me in the moment (Keep me in the moment), oh keep me in the moment (Keep me in the moment)
Keep me in the moment, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me
