When I've met my match and there's nowhere to go
Heart under attack, no hope on my own
I break and I tear (I break and I tear)
Spin out of control (Spin out of control)
The burdens I wear (Wear)
Like weights on my shoulders

So, find me here as I surrender

I need You to do what only You can
Only You can
Fight for my life when fear's got me surrounded
Only You can
Only You can
Keep me believing when doubts got me drowning
'Cause there's no one else who can calm this storm
And there's no one else who can save my soul
Only You can
Only You can, God
Only You can

When all that I face is face to face with Your power
The enemy silenced as my praises get louder
The battle's been won (The battle's been won)
The darkness will hide (The darkness will hide)
The dead things in me (Me)
Are starting to rise

So, find me here as I surrender, oh

I need You to do what only You can
Only You can
Fight for my life when fear's got me surrounded
Only You can
Only You can
Keep me believing when doubts got me drowning
'Cause there's no one else who can calm this storm
And there's no one else who can save my soul
Only You can
Only You can, God
Only You can

I lift my hands up to the only unstoppable King
The One who can see far beyond the things that I see
And in the moments when I've lost the strength to believe
I won't give up on the only One who won't give up on me
I lift my hands up to the only unstoppable King
The One who can see far beyond the things that I see
And in the moments when I've lost the strength to believe
I won't give up on the only One who won't give up on me
Lord, find me here as I surrender

I need You to do what only You can
Only You can
Fight for my life when fear's got me surrounded
Only You can (Only You can)
Only You can (Only You can)
Keep me believing when doubts got me drowning
'Cause there's no one else who can calm this storm
(No one else who can calm this storm)
And there's no one else who can save my soul
Only You can (Only You can)
Only You can, God (Only You can)
