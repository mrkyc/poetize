I don't wanna waste just another day
Tell me where I should go, and there I will go
I don't wanna miss 'cause I'm too afraid
Of what I don't know, oh, I don't
Even in the desert
I'm scared, and I'm tired, and I'm feeling alone
'Cause I don't wanna wait just another day
Tell me where I should go, and there I will

I'm wide awake
I hear You calling my name

After all the things I've been through
Every scar and every bruise
You remind me every time
You're still alive, You're still alive
In me, in the beat of my heart
In the light, in all of the dark
All my hope will never die, 'cause
You're still alive, You're still alive

(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
You're still alive in me

I just wanna face what I tend to fear
What I can't control, I give You control
I don't really know what You're doing here
But I give You control, I give You control

I'm wide awake
I hear You calling my name

After all the things I've been through
Every scar and every bruise
You remind me every time
You're still alive, You're still alive
In me, in the beat of my heart
In the light, in all of the dark
All my hope will never die, 'cause
You're still alive, You're still alive

(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
You're still alive in me
You're still alive in me
You're still alive in me
I stand here in Your presence
I'm safe and secure, and I'm never alone
You're still alive
You're still alive

After all the things I've been through
Every scar and every bruise
You remind me every time
You're still alive, You're still alive
In me, in the beat of my heart
In the light, in all of the dark
All my hope will never die, 'cause
You're still alive, oh, You're still alive

(Woo-ooh-ooh) You're still alive
