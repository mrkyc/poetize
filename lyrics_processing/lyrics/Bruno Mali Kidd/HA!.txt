Uh, so you this little nigga gettin' that bread ha
Head bustin' off top
Just to show 'em you ain't scared, ha
Keep two highlighters by your bed, ha
When they hungry feed 'em lead
Know exactly how to play it, ha
Can't stop fucking with your nose, ha
Do them shows, ha
They know you all across the globe, ha
Keep it 100 with your woes, ha
Had to twinkle up your doors
Finally tighten up your drawers, ha
You keep it gangsta' with them hoes, ha
That's a Lambo not a Rolls, ha
She comin' out her clothes, ha
This street shit got you on your toes, ha
You on the road, ha
Been a g since Reebok's and Girbaud's, ha
Your brother told you not to buzz, ha
Get it in blood, ha
Fuck the prosecutor and the judge, ha
You had got it out the mud, ha
While champagne fill the tub
You well connected with the plug, ha

You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is, to make nothin' out of somethin'
Take care of them kids, it ain't no crime if you hustlin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is, to make nothin' out of somethin'
Take care of them kids, it ain't no crime if you hustlin'

Better run for it, run for it, run
