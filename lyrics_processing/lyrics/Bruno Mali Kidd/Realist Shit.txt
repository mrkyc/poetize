They say they want the real
I'm 'bout to give em some of the realest shit a nigga ever...ever wrote, man
R.I.P. Capo, you already know, my nigga
These niggas be asking for that real life shit
Shit, I stayed ten-toes down, even when these niggas changed
Let's go, come on
Whoo!

You ain't my dog, for real my nigga stop fakin'
I remember shit got crazy on me, you got flaky
Shit got shaky, I'm ten-toe, can't let these niggas take me
I'm paper chasin',bitch,  I made a plan to  bring my cake in
These niggas hatin', I'm focused on where I'm trying to go
I told my dog, it 'bout that paper, then I'm down to go
Who trynna know?
He said he wit' ya', then that time will show
You a sucka if you hatin' on that man behind a hoe
You dying to know, like how the fuck I ain't knocked off my pivot?
I put my tunnel vision on, I see my future, vivid
These niggas timid, shit I'm rapping 'bout, I really lived it
Still unforgiven, I had beef with one of my closest niggas
But now my only thought, "I can't wait 'til I could scope this nigga"
Or put that infrared beam on top of that Glock, so I could smoke this nigga
I wrote this shit here, knowing my back was up against the wall
I found out when it's real, ain't too much niggas I can call
This for my dog, I made one phone call to my nigga 
He said, "it's beef and niggas don't come through, that's just what niggas do"
It's been a few, I got some sticks right now, I'll bring 'em through
And if you need some extra man-power, I'm gon' bring a crew
I'm slangin too, I ain't no killer, but I'm gettin on it
Watch my surroundings, I can't sleep, I'm up 6 in the morning
Paranoid, cause even in the crib I be keeping it on me
These niggas phony, you go through it, the gon' joke all on it
I heard my hoes with my dawg, and that's my so-called homie
I only put my trust in God, these niggas hatin' on me
Been in the kitchen cooking like I got a apron on me
My so-called boys can't make a play, them niggas flakin' on me
They skatin' on me, I been thuggin' while off in that paint
I asked the Lord to give me the strength, to accept what I can
R.I.P. to Capo, man, my mental it tend to go blank
Don't cross that line with them loose lips, your ship what you sink

Demons in my dreams, it be so hard to sleep
The  from these Percocets make it hard to eat
Promoting violence, code of silence, gotta' play for keeps
Slanging narcotics to put Jordans on my daughter feet
Life of a mobster, kill a rat if we know that he snitchin'
 who did it, show no love for a sour defendant
Super-charged on a HEMI
Lawyers for charges that's pending
Cheating on all of my women
 my father forgive me
Glock on my lap when I'm driving, try me, I'm catching a body
, la familia, militant soldier we 
For those who slept on, owe me an apology
Can't capture me, I'm Master P, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Everyday I play it safe, can't leave the house without it
Problem Child and Bruno Mali, bitch, I'm stepping proudly
This the type of shit make a nigga catch a body
