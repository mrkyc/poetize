I wake up from the dream
This lil' thing of ours is special
F.B.T.Y.C
But now they got me spazzin'
I came out the gravel
Louie luggage, my bitch pack it every time I travel
If you could take it out my pockets
You could fuckin' have it
Shooters just like Dirk Nowitzki
Play for Dallas Mavericks
Hundreds in that cabinet
BMBMG
We ridin'
But these niggas fragile
I guess they not that agile
I drop the pack off in Orlando, let me work my Magic
You just can't imagine
It's a feeling in that Phantom
You just couldn't fathom
Migos got me dabbin'
In a bucket full of crabbers
They just couldn't grab him
Uppercut and jab 'em
I got bullet scars to show
So tell me where the scab is
Blowin' hundred dollar blunts
Purple like Aladdin'
Momma gave birth to a pimp
I got more game than Madden (huh)
Shit, legends never die
We sellin' out the Garden
You thought I couldn't do them numbers
Bitch, I beg your pardon
I bring that food right out the jungle
Right back to my squadron
I spit that real
And they gon' choke me just like Eric Garner
They gon' keep scoring them touchdowns
If ain't nobody guardin' him
Larry Fitzgerald got me on my Arizona Cardinals
Put my helmets on, 
We bought to kick off in this bitch
Like Adam Vinatieri

Yeah...
Get money don't get mad
I said
Get money don't get married
Only wife of mine, is this life of crime
When I start flirting with death
I almost got fired (huh)
I remember head shots fired
In that hospital
Doc said he thought Pac came back and died
I'm up now and I ain't backin' down
It's Blocc Money 'til my casket down

If this is how it's gonna be
I make a hundred in a day
I couldn't see them lil' niggas hatin on me
Cause the moneys' in the way
I'm Ray Charles with the flow
I'm Michael Jordan on the J
The way the Maserati cuttin'
Have your boy feelin' certain type of way

BMB
Let's get this money
Ain't no glitz and glamour
Suckas killed  in his own hometown
They tried to leave me in that desert
Stranded like a camel
 told me
Let it rip, 'til I run outta ammo
Five flame spitta'
I be spittin' 
Them haters see my face on TV
And they change the channel
 backpack with the black hat back
Just to ask me what them  on
Two mac's strapped, with the 
Get right back in the booth like that
Can't tell you what my 
Knowing me, I'm not seeing these niggas
Im'ma just keep my visors on
Whole team getting that cream
That stand tall like Hakeem Olajuwon
Screamin' shit don't stop
If the beat don't build, ya'll niggas gon' feel me now
If any of you fuck niggas fear a living legend
You might as well kill me now
R.I.P to , you gon' live forever
'Cause your music gon' still be ridin'
And when its ash to ashes
And dust to dust
'Cause a nigga still gon' be down
Shit, me and my momma at the cemetery
Two gold bottles and a couple Rollies
I should have been lost it on these niggas
But I don't know how I'm keeping my composure
Keep on thinking that a nigga pussy
'Til you find me in a nigga bushes
Can't let these suckers trick me up the street
Too much to lose, to let a nigga push me
You call my name and step into the center
Three-quarter mink on for the winter
R.I.P. to 
I love the twins, you know I can't forget 'em
Them niggas don't know that was 'bout to hit 'em
If it's fourth down, was running up the middle
 'til a nigga get acquitted
That Presidential lookin' like a Skittle
You either with us or you wasn't with us
Though we told you,  the money in the middle (yeah)
Yeah...
Get money don't get mad
