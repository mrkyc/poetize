Remember players and haters, have no common denominators
It gets greater later, if you stray from perpetrators
I pull mo' stunts, than Evil Kenivel
Cause I'm on that chase, for the root of all evil
Trying to thread the needle, making hits like the Beetles
This is just the first chapter, of the legendary sequel
Yeah man
You know me, I'm just coming down
S-U-C style

Screwed up
Thought I told ya, legends never die
Now you notice, all the real niggas livin' through 'em
Once you start applying pressure, never give 'em room
Making sure the shit raw when you give it to 'em
Can't forget the first time that nigga H.A.W.K
King, legendary freestyle 
Tombstone say, Southside 'til I die
If ya boy deserve the props, 'gon give it to 'em
Tombstone say, Southside 'til I die
If ya boy deserve the props, 'gon give it to 'em
He's the reason why I pour up, getting screwed
Real niggas wasn't born with a silver spoon
Is you fi'n represent or what you gonna do?
Couldn't stop God plan, if you wanted to
You gon' make it or you die, either one or two
This one here for Fat Pat and big homie Screw
Real niggas who are never giving up the phone
Big Hawk, said give the people what they want
See the candy paint glisten, when it hit the sun
Still tippin' 4-4's, lifting up the trunk
Screwed up bumpin' in the Wraith dog
No matter fact, that's a case dog
Cash Money, Bun B, I'm the '97 Facemob
And I'm 
Don King
Knocking suckers out the park, like it's baseball
You new?
Come and check your place dog
The way the Southside niggas put it down
Couldn't be rich dog
Oh man....you heard that?
Shit...

Gotta watch me put it down for the hometown
Ain't no way they feelin' tell a nigga ease up
Bet you when them niggas see me they gon' freeze up
He's up, call him baby Jesus
Hands dirty, so I had to roll the sleeves up
Let me throw big B's and them C's up
Couple killers in the crib with the mask on
Pussy nigga lay it down, give them keys up
Won't stop all night, MJ
Reason why I put them  23's up
Twenty-five thousand out in Dubai
Another five-thousand for the Visa
Still screaming hoes down, G's up
I remember when nobody ain't believe us
Condo full of divas
Bunch of  bitches just to please us
Continental all white, looking all set
Pull up in it, bet my niggas getting one too
Sauced up, hit 'em with a little one-two
They gon' show me love every time I come through
Art of war, when it hit her with the Sun Tzu
Bet your girl gon' kick it like Kung fu
Little shorty pulled up bumping old 
Remember when they used to call a nigga Young Spook
Kinda hard to let it go and let a nigga grow
Some folks still call a nigga Young Spook
Bumpin' Lamborghini Dreams and the beach house
Wish my niggas was alive cause of 
R.I.P. to Capo and my nigga  too
Representing 'cause he from where I'm from too
Real niggas put it down, it ain't nothing to it
Feel the pain
Cause he comin' from the slums too
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it
