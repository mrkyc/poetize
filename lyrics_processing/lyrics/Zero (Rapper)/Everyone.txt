Wake up every morning, fucking up my money, trying to make it happen
Started off with nothing, trying earn a dollar off this fucking rapping
Hate when people try to play it cool like we've been friends but fuck the acting
Never 'bout the action, pussy, you a faggot
All up on my dick, why the fuck you trying to grab it?
Hate when motherfuckers try to tell me how to act
Y'all been throwing this shit up on your back
Its bigger than your rack
Figured I've been bigger and you're whack
Put the black hoodie on backwards with no mask
Look at you, an artist
Fuck is rap doing?
Beat the fuck down and
Keep your pass, use it
Pussy, stop talking
Fact that y'all doing
Rap is not working
Axles start moving
Fucked up that you can't get over with this
Hundreds, I've seen at the flick of the wrist
I've done seen gangsters get pain when they snitched
Ain't in a bitch
(Ain't in a bitch)
Funny how I get them in they're front
Never been the one
Trying to be the best to ever come
Got a problem with it? Y'all can suck up on my dick and if you really want to scramble, get it done
I really fucking had it with the rest
Main static when I'm rapping
I'm snapping it by the neck
Got a list of shit to do, I'm a savage and I'm a threat
Put this dick up in a model, Snapchatting it to my ex
Bitches won't get it, I'm ethic as fuck
Are you testing us?
Talking that shit ain't impressing us
We only worry 'bout our father blessing us
Recipes, dammit, I feel I ain't blessed enough

Now who the fuck y'all think you're talking to?
You could get hit just for walking through
Outside the stu when you get out your whip you might have someone run up and let 'em go off on you
Off on you, I do this shit for my mom
That's why I snap all the time
She want to see me get millions, I split that shit with her so that's why I'm out on my grind
I'm fucking bitches on bitches
These haters are liking my pictures, my pictures
Me, Andrew fucking up shit in Team Acura
Aiming his Acura, we never missing
We never fall off, the fuck is you on?
My ex probably left me cause she couldn't handle my flaws
She took a loss, but aye
You know that bitches be drawn, aye
You know that nobody want to come and get 'em all up, I'm the motherfucking king of this shit
If y'all don't be the one to stu- whatever you spitting, you better pray that I don't step into the ring of this bitch
You probably thought a motherfucker only got them girls until they started, switch this shit and had to sing in this bitch
Have you  on a little that I'm better at killing anybody who's even going to try and swing in this bitch, no
All of you rappers are pussies
Yeah, fuck everbody who still overlook me
But do what you do I got people supporting, I really don't give a fuck for how you took me, ah
Do not be talking a mess to us
Jimmy come out with that strapped to the chest for us
Is it just me? Cause our father ain't blessing us
Recipes, damn and I feel I ain't blessed enough, damn
