I feel your hands latched on my throat
Why do I keep you close to me?

How many times do you think I'll swear
That I'll keep coming back
Even though you won't care

Until I'm gone
I'll watch you wish upon a mega star
And in the end we'll fall
Across the sky to give you everything
You fucking wanted all
Is this the part where you keep begging me to just accept your flaws
Your motherfucking faults

And when I hide behind a closed door
I'm sorry that I just don't wanna know more
Don't tell me you think I could fucking show more
I'm anxious and I'm so sure
That I'm better when I'm left alone
I know I'm better when I'm left alone
I said I'm better when I'm left alone
You might also like
I do better when I can forget about you
That's the deepest cut I won't cover
No need for love, I won't suffer
I don't bleed the same as no others
So what the fuck you want from me
People loss the company
But I won't smile when you sit in front of me
Expecting love right after what you've done to me
The day you die you'll the one you see
Is it love or?
Blurring up the same lust
Can read it with the pain draws
But we were living on the same laws
But that shit don't matter now does it?
Remember how they were trying to save us now fuck it
I can keep on and on about nothing
'Cause whenever you was trying to change me I was it

Gonna leave me to grace you
We need to face truth
Breathe deep escape you
Knees weak I made lose
Off of fucking fate to break you
But I
Never gonna make it through the night
I don't give a fuck about a fight
And I wouldn't ever win my whole life
So you need to keep the fuck away from light
And when I hide behind a closed door
I'm sorry that I just don't wanna know more
Don't tell me you think I could fucking show more
I'm anxious and I'm so sure
That I'm better when I'm left alone
I'm better when I'm left the fuck alone
I'm better when I'm left the fuck alone

(Feel your hands latched on my throat)
I'm better when I'm left the fuck alone
(Why do I keep you close to me?)
