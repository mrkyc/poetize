Alright (x4)

End with the fake shit
I'm sick of these rappers and basics
Sick of the fact that these haters keep on trying and pulling this "great" shit
Pussy, you finna get face-lift
Definitely hated
We hate shit
Most these new artists are only replacements
Creating brainage
Trying to get my bitch to match my bracelet
That's flawless
But some of you probably weren't understanding that statement
Complacent
But knowing that I'm gonna be making it out of this basement
Just face it
Y'all rappers make me nothing but irritated
A legend since '97
Stepping to every veteran
I wish I had a dollar for every bitch that I slept with
I wish I had a dollar for every race that I stepped in
I wish a motherfucker would try me and get beheaded
I've been
The nicest rapper by far and it's undeniable
The words from over-hyped dick-suckers is unreliable
So who am I to know when the highs are low and it's time to go?
Cause people only fucking with you now because it's time to blow

Aye, and tell them rappers bring they're writtens with them

One of the nicest motherfucker
I really couldn't care if you don't like me, motherfucker
We running and ducking these rappers like we fighting, motherfuckers
I swear to God my feet just look like Nike, motherfucker, that's
Haul checks
We next
We Corvettes
Put your money on the table, we taking up all bets
All battles, and all threats
And personal calls, texts
No letters, no emails, if you talking we'll cause deaths and that's real
So tell me, that shit you was talking?
Tell me that you wasn't stupid enough to be running your mouth with no caution
Tell me that you wasn't one of them people
I heard about, rapping 'bout guns, when I see you
In public and suddenly you don't have nothing to say to me
Shit, cause it happens so often
Funny how shit can affect y'all
That rapping shit doesn't impress, dawg
You never been posing a threat, dawg
You a mess dawg, and I'm set, dawg
One of these days you will learn
That you can not fuck with my set, dawg
Go get you a check, dawg
I really do hope that you keeping your desk job, pussy
Aye, and tell them rappers bring they're writtens with them
Aye, and tell them haters we ain't getting with them
Aye, and tell them labels bring they're millions with them
Aye, and tell your bitches bring they're bitches with them
