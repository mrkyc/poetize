'Bout that time you stop bragging on records
For the record, I'm back and I'm better
Give a fuck if I act hypocritical
Y'all can't do shit about it, whatever
Put that work into talk when I write it
I got work, but it works cause I'm biased
Got to make it, I heard I'm the nicest
18 with a mid-life crisis
Lately all they want to talk about is how I talk about the same shit in every single song but fuck it
Every single bitch I hit, I tell them that it's over, wouldn't leave them, they ain't never done me wrong but fuck it
Back to move inside of them while I'm in, out in public
Then this is on the internet, showing you're just a puppet
My foot on the Devil's neck, when they talking I change the subject
You ain't heard about me yet?
Then you really ain't heard enough yet

Hate to be the one talking down but I learned the work, we're all frauds
On and on and on (x2)
Swear that all of y'all talk
Way too much about what I do and I ain't never taking no loss
But they don't know me at...
They don't know me at...
(*They don't know me at...*)
You might also like
They don't know me at all (x4)

Once again, y'all can't do nothing with me
Even off of these songs I get busy
Walk up in your house like I'm Kimmy
I don't trust a soul
Even those who would go ride or die for you sometimes can start to be iffy, you get me?
Hate when they start acting shifty
Dogs, they just bitter  acting too thrifty
I caught them off swiftly
Now, fuck a blog post
We gon' let the blogs know
If y'all ain't finna write my shit, I'm getting all
"No, pussy, you can keep posting bullshit up but when the bullshits up, I ain't helping none of y'all hoes"
That's real rap
I'm hoping you feel that
When the wave is all over, them rappers are still whack
I ain't acting like I'm winning, I'm telling them real facts
You ain't never gonna last while making them ill tracks, motherfucker

Hate to be the one talking down but I learned the work, we're all frauds
On and on and on (x2)
Swear that all of y'all talk
Way too much about what I do and I ain't never taking no loss
But they don't know me at...
They don't know me at...
(*They don't know me at...*)
They don't know me at all (x4)

Uh, yeah
Imma make this shit a little easy for you (listen)
Imma tell you everything you need to know (here)
I'll serve it up on a platter, even feed it to you
I spill it all out, y'all don't even read it, though (what the fuck?)
I was born in a place you don't wanna go
Learned a lot of shit at an age I didn't wanna know (woah)
I saw things that I wish I had forgotten since (shit..)
Years later and I still ain't forgot them, though
Motherfucker, never forget if they call me Chatterbox
Used to be a different name until I was sabotaged
Done a lot of shit in the game and I've been around
Till I switched aliases and suited up in my camouflage
Started rapping instead of being behind the keys
And started buying the powder instead of buying trees
Look, I've really been in the hustle with thirty trunk-fulls
Rock-bottom, back to the top, tell them what's up, Zero

Hate to be the one talking down but I learned the work, we're all frauds
On and on and on (x2)
Swear that all of y'all talk
Way too much about what I do and I ain't never taking no loss
But they don't know me at...
They don't know me at...
(*They don't know me at...*)
