It's way too much
And I never get away too much
Same bitch, always play too much
I done drove two hours out the way too much
Keep it, on the low on the run up
But you be always talking 'till I'm tired and the sun up
I never really asked you for nothing, cause I don't want much
Just keep our secrets quiet, it's starting to kill the come up
I asked about your feelings, you don't know right?
You been bitching like the whole night
I disagree you start a whole fight
That's some shit I really don't like
So time and time I start to see
All the hurt you feel and I don't think
That you could deal without the kid the way you telling me you could
I notice every time it's hard, you don't believe
:
I don't want to stay down
In the same spot, with the same crowd
I don't want to stay down
But you and I know this ain't all that we got left of this
:
I don't think about the way that I could leave and get away but you just always seem to play and I don't like that
Give a fuck about a place that I could stay inside the city, if you leaving here without me then I'm right back
If it's something you don't like about it I could kill the distance, I could move inside together, would you fight that?
Why the fuck you always fight that?
You even killing me, despite that
Cause somehow in someone there's something that's different and
Just how do you feel when I make a difference?
And all of those broken rows created distance
Between us and now we're just stuck in this reverse position to leave
Pick up the piece
You say that you hate me, I love when you're mean
I guess that just tells that I'm stuck in between
I live my whole life in that fucking routine
I'm just saying...

And I don't know
I don't know
No I don't know, I don't know what to do with you (x2)
I don't know what to do with you, no I don't know
