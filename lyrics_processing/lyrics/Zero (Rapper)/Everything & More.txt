I hate the way that you've been talking down on me
Every single word has been surrounding me
Every single tear you drop is drowning me
Every single time I think you never doubted me
I was wrong, so wrong and put it off to the side
Off on the ride, offer time while you just offer your thighs
Off in disguise, often cross you, crossing, cross, you would lie
Don't hit my phone I swear to God, I'll decline
But this is not another song that I'm writing for her
This for you, the one I never bring around in my crew
Don't ever meet 'em but we fucking every week when it's through
Don't ever tell 'em what we getting into
So put that dress up on the dresser while you dress up for this
You only call me after 12, I know you're better than this
But we don't love eachother, I ain't ever stressing a bitch
Just leave your feelings on the floor when you come in to the crib, I'm saying

You got, you got everything and more
I don't know your name, but I think I'm finding out for sure
So now, so now take the time you need and keep those clothes and feelings laid out on the floor

Remember that one time
And that one song that we fucked to
Was on repeat
And I drove around
To your side of town
With you sitting there in your front seat
And we went home to your mom's crib and I ain't even get the chance so I could meet her
You ain't want to take me in, I know your mom has heard about me
And the way I one on one is getting deeper
But me and you had the same connection, how did we get it
You tell me not to look at your texts and now I'm regretting
You said that I'm "the only" that's such a perfect digression
Cause when I start to question you seem to make me forget it
I don't even want to talk about it
I just want to get you off about it
And we can do whatever you want
But everything that you want I always seem to cause a fucking problem 'bout it
Now put that dress up on the dresser while you dress up for this
I love the way that even stars can't impress you for shit
But we don't love eachother, I ain't ever stressing a bitch
Just leave your feelings on the floor when you come in to the crib, I'm saying
You might also like
You got, you got everything and more
I don't know your name, but I think I'm finding out for sure
So now, so now take the time you need and keep those clothes and feelings laid out on the floor

Don't talk too much
Never been a giver, never call too much
Me and you ain't never been apart too much
Fucking on the weekend starts you up
I can never fill your heart with love
I ain't never had none, I can't trust
Anything about you I won't budge, that's why you only call so I could fuck
Only call when it's way past 12
Only partying and I can't tell
If it's me or is it cause my name
Babygirl just tell me, be straight
Way too sick of all these goddamn games
Hoping, get up, is it way too late?
Take it off I got no complaints
It ain't your fault, I got myself to blame..

You got, you got everything and more
I don't know your name, but I think I'm finding out for sure
