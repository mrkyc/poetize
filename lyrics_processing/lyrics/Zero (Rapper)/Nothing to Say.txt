Never love to be the underdog, it's Funny how I'm never under y'all
Skipping all the shit that you drop now, y'all should go and drop out honestly I'll rather hear another song
Hollar from the city to the west (side), call me with the business and I  press (nine)
How to get a deal in a house in the hills if you thinking i was bout to go except
I'm not fucking with the same shit y'all doing, we got the ball
Moving
I think y'all should focus on your mother fucking selves
??  Anything that we got, selling from the crib we don't need shots, aiming at the 1, 2 and 3 spots
You gonna take the plea ot, coming at me for some shit that I can't control just like brandy at a bar, thats a cheap shot. (biatch)
Grew up (grew up) with my home got invaded, moved then got a crib and had a basement
Fucking never say shit, you don't know the life that really made this, you don't know me, now than mother fucker say it
Look me in the face and tell me that you know about me, you don't know about the shit that made my father o d, you don't know about the tricks that I've been taking o t, feeling like I'm 03 code b. (better drop that)
Spending all my money on the stream, (better cop that) now I cease $1000 jeans, (and I could cop that) y'all don't like the shit that you've been seeing. (then you can stop that) aiming in the cock pit, fall at, drop at
(Chorus)
"I don't got nothing to say", (I got nothing to say, I got nothing to say)
"until you come look at my face"
(until you come loot at my face, look at my face)
"I don't got nothing to say", (I got nothing to say, I got nothing to say)
"until you come look at my face"
(until you come loot at my face)
(Verse 2)
Now you want to know why I'm angry, but don't want to have conversations
Y'all just keep judging and basing
Your opinions on hatred, well suck my dick
I hate all of you, I do better in my solitude
I'll do better off if all of you never
Got into never got into my shit that ain't involving you
I've been on the way up, in the last year
Don't judge my success in the past year cause this is past due
This is 10 years in and I'm at 1% of what I'd should've had here
Let me breathe now, the shit that go before I'm senile
Before I'm 25 i better feel the breeze out, buy my mom a beach house
Talk to in these free styles, throw across the water, make the beat proud. (I'm upset)
Collect cheques and I bet you love to see me fail and never get through much
When I'm trying to send my nephews up, I put my best two up, I keep thinking in my head too much. (or should i give it up)
Been enough, stressed and getting under my skin and just living up under conditions thats probably gonna limit us but living love will make us question like is it love cause it don't feel the same as it did before this got into us
Been a long time no limits nobody gonna bring me down
Oh my God is it off limits to tell y'all that y'all sound like clowns
Swear to God that I am not the one y'all should try to play with now
Fuck all peace, I'm keeping all my piece and leaving y'all with nothing, I'm gonna keep my crown

"I don't got nothing to say", (I got nothing to say, I got nothing to say)
"until you come look at my face"
(until you come loot at my face, look at my face)
"I don't got nothing to say", (I got nothing to say, I got nothing to say)
"until you come look at my face"
(until you come loot at my face)
