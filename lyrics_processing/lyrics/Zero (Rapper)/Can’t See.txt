I've been fighting for a plan b
If you lived like this then you would understand me (yeah)
I let the bands speak
No I pull up with a  so you can't see
Tryna do it for my family
If you lived like this then you would understand me (yeah)
I let the bands speak
No I pull up with a  so you can't see

Take the light away from me, being honest, they can't  me much
I battle through the shadows, I've had to or else they get me stuck
Working towards a crib for my mom and a couple Bentley trucks
You wanna try your odds against stopping me, shouldn't press your luck
You don't know how I battle through losing parents, don't you compare us
My story and yours isn't two to pair with, this too apparent
It seems that we grow in two different eras
I'm ruthless where it seems you motherfuckers are too generic , They
Can't ever step on our toes
I move too quickly, I'm too risky, ain't no X's and O's
For you bitches  now let's check how this goes
I'm the next one to blow, come on the check, it explodes
It's all I got, I know my nephews are trying to grow it properly
It's time, it's gotta be, rip the roof off this fucking property
The truth is always hidden in lies, so now tell me honestly
If you got what I need 'cause I'm breaking whatever's locking me out

I'll never leave this alone
I nearly spent my whole life with never leaving my home
My momma working all the time
All the time I done need the hope
That I'll make it out of this whole and put her all across the coast
I got, I got this heart inside, the type that's hard to find
The type I know that you don't have in you because your heart ain't mine
And if you listen when I talk, you'll tell I'm partially dyin'
I'm more than partially trying, bitch I'm working on being partially fine
That shit that you can never run the play unless you putting 22 hours on every fucking day
You'll never get it 'less you keep grindin', a hundred months to date, then another 33, I can't even keep it all fucking straight
But whats the point of a 
If I keep damaging myself before it works, then I'm lost
If I don't make to the point where I'm heading I hope that y'all understand that I gave my all and I never meant this to fall
What you saying?
