Never come out of my room
I learned to walk once I came out the womb
Learned to say "Fuck You" by 18 months old
Them words are likely to be on my tomb
This is not something I make up in songs
Living my life like I never do wrong
I only trust but I feel in my gut
If you fuckin' that up then you gone
Listen
I don't got to be apart of anyone's politics
And I (?) with the fact they got accomplishments
I don't get acknowledgement, with all of this really
I don't give a fuck about that story that you're tellin' bitch
If you can spit a rap then that's irrelevant
Stop rapping for the hell of it
This music shit is (?) developing
(People told me onto one)
They put me all up on a pedestal
Though their music is terrible
Oh, their rhymes need a medical
I am not here to partake in these games
I ain't switchin' on shit but these names in a room full of lames
You can't shoot with an accurate aim
Never change on my life (I'm the same, mother fucker)
You might also like
They tell me I've been changing on the low
And I don't act the way I did before
But you ain't know me then and that's for sure
So wanna talk about me switching
Gotta go

Don't say that I'm changing cuz I'm simply growing
Astonishing crowds with these skills that I'm showing
These haters are praying, these sceptics are hoping
That soon I will fall, the success keeps approaching
I swear to you
You won't want to be opponents
I'm building my empire feel like the Romans
You fuck boys are bitches, I swear ya'll are rodents
I come through and leave your bitch frozen
I'm flowin incredible, I stay on point like a decimal
These days these rappers are far from respectable
Zero and I yeah we're far from forgettable
We heard your music, it's far from acceptable
I don't work way too hard, I don't work way too hard
Started with nothing, now look where we are
This shit did not just appear
Invested blood, sweat and tears
So much more coming, this year is my year
I told you we rare, now you can see it so clear
All of my life never took no for answers
I'm climbing the ladder, changing the standards
I swear this game is full of these actors
My pockets are looking like (?)
Oh, shit where are my manners?
I'm serving these verses to you on a platter
I'm working so hard, man success coming faster
Jerome is a factor, these fuck boys don't matter
Facts, speaking the facts
Swear that I will do this till I collapse
Going through changes
But quick I adapt
Telling my stories through raps
So get the fuck back
They tell me I've been changing on the low
And I don't act the way I did before
But you ain't know me then and that's for sure
So wanna talk about me switching
