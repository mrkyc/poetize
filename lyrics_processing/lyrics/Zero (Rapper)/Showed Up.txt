Everybody acting like they know us
Sick and tired hearing we should grow up
Everything ain't always what it seems
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Waiting on someone that never showed up
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Cause everything ain't always what it seems
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up, yeah

Ain't gotta talk about it anymore or the past
I'm on the borderline of a break then get attached
From being completely wrong to so close to a perfect match
We knew that none of this would ever last
You ever look in the wrong place for the right one?
You ever work for a long day 'til the night comes?
And then you start reminiscing when in the mix of decisions
You gotta hope that who you waiting for just might come
But never show up, you know what, ain't taking a part if it's no love
Forgetting the times that I waited for someone who never existed, it's so dumb
I took the easy way and I left it right where I found it
My mama always told me "Be cautious of your surroundings"
I learned my fucking lesson no matter how long it felt
But not around for you, no matter who it tells
Don't ever try to find what you want inside somebody
Who doesn't even believe in the person they are themself

Me and you never meant to be on the top of this
Cause we were polar opposites, watch the time, we clocking it
Fuck this conversation, I honestly feel like dropping it
It's obvious that you had a feeling while we were stopping this
No more long nights, and I'm wondering 'bout the same
Even face to face, I can never tell if you changed
The diamonds that I got were supposed to be on your finger
And now I'm putting all these diamonds in my pinkie and chain
It's like where'd I go wrong when everything going was so strong?
And all of the meaning, it headed in different directions
I never could go on
I been around the block with these bitches but it's been so long
Since I cared at all, but I thought I did no wrong
So who are you to tell me if I never showed up?
You broke the only person that you used to show love
It's kinda crazy how you feel when you been feeling so numb
Nobody asked you how you felt cause I don't give no fucks, just saying
Everybody acting like they know us
Sick and tired hearing we should grow up
Everything ain't always what it seems
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Waiting on someone that never showed up
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Cause everything ain't always what it seems
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up, yeah
 (x2)
I would count the days that you would change from being you
But you played too many games and got confused between the two
And it's been so long, so long, so long
And it's been so long, so long, so long, yeah yeah

Everybody acting like they know us
Sick and tired hearing we should grow up
Everything ain't always what it seems
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Waiting on someone that never showed up
I'm just waiting on someone who never showed up
Cause everything ain't always what it seems
