Shit is getting out of hand
Every week a couple grand
I just flew out from the west side
And bought a hoodie from Japan
Y'all don't know me, we ain't friends
Stop telling people you my man when
You ain't fuck with my last week
So don't hit me on the 'gram
You wanna hate and debate who I sound like so y'all just continue to lose
While you been beating your dick off to some shit in your spare time Your girl keep on sending me nudes
Two-hundred-thousands plays
Every-other fuckin day
Those are literally the stats so
There ain't shit that you can say
I know I get a little bit excessive with talking my shit
Grinding since I'm young and there ain't nobody talking like this
You ain't even got the type of bread to come walk in my kicks
Balling is often my shit
Walk in my crib*
Like I own this bitch my guy
I've been on my shit one time
You don't gotta fuck with none of my music but I'ma do it And truly you really gon' respect my grind mo'fucker

Got a lot of new money
Still can't afford a Benz
Got a lot of new bitches
Don't got a lot of new friends
Don't give a fuck what you thinkin'
Let me try this shit again
I'm making whatever the fuck that I want to make
Bout to set a new trend
You might also like
Whole money on your head-top*
Squad deep up in the fans now*
Black and red on red and black*
And my dad pull a Deadshot*
Fuck the feelings and the guest-spots
I've been mapping out my next plot
Rap isn't dead, when I resurrect it y'all just stay connected like some deadspots
Running through the years, a hundred moves to get it
Fumble, lose, impressive, run the play again
On my way again
Vintage Bape again
Whatever y'all rocking I'm not impressed with
I mean if I got it I gotta flex it
Hey y'all shit is corny, I gotta stress it
You'll never make it, y'all probably stressin
The music you're making is not the best shit
Outta pocket with the times, I've been looking out
Got the profit from the rhymes I've been cooking Now
Y'all should stop it with the lines you been putting out
Got it popping off the grind and you shouldn't doubt
Anything I'm about to do next
Me and your bitch are about to do sex
I was only waiting on the come-through text
Bitch I dance on the beat like the one-two step
Let's get it
Got a lot of new money
Still can't afford a Benz
Got a lot of new bitches
Don't got a lot of new friends
Don't give a fuck what you thinkin'
Let me try this shit again
I'm making whatever the fuck that I want to make
