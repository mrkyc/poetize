I don't give a fuck
About the people you hit up
And I never gave a shit
About the way you said you flip
Oh no, no
Been the same OG
Never change from the name, my G
Tell them "play my beat."
So I can lay my heat

I'm the greediest, motherfuckers can't get it if they need it
I'm never from the bottom, y'all honestly never seen it
Only time I've been dependent is looking out of the screen of the studio like "what do you people think I believe in?"
Never with the fake shit
Two fists, make a face lift
Work long nights, I play the great shift
Got a shorty in the studio to take dick
Ain't a ride or die I got a hundred bitches to replace with
 you're right
And when it's on, it's on, it's on tonight
Been a boss all my life
I don't take an example from anybody
This is never what I thought of life
So y'all can say that shit
Got a hundred motherfuckers that will play that shit
So y'all can hate that shit
And forever everything is for the better, when you suckers is working I'm on my lay back shit
And that's life, cause...
You might also like
I've been on my own
In the world I'm all alone
I swear to God this shit can't stay the same
If y'all know what I've done
And y'all know I'm the one
All y'all lies been really fucking up my name...

Cause you know that's the way it goes (x5)

Whatever y'all talking 'bout, never we need it
Fuck all your visions, I see it
Pussy, believe it
I do my stunts, not a double been needed
I run this bitch, checking myself for breathing
I give a fuck, I'm conceded (x2)
I took it for the trip and I'm never gon' let it go
Standing on the top, I've been up on the pedestal
Make a hater sickened, we drop it
"No watch him", we bomb it
You motherfuckers really should get me and get it, bro
The boy snap on 'em
The boy back on 'em
Make the boy manic, put the mask on him
I'm not a lover or hater, a generation where motherfuckers concerned about paper, front with they're straps on 'em
There's a lot going on in my head
There's a lot  roles that I said
Put it on my life, got a checker on it 'til I'm dead
Who the fuck want to put it up and bet?
Not even from the eras
We spitting the terrorist
Written, encrypting all rappers
A scarier witness
We carry you bitches
And bury you bitches
We dare to be vicious
Who the fuck are y'all? Could be very suspicious
You can say that shit
Got a hundred motherfuckers that will play that shit
So y'all can hate that shit
And forever everything is for the better, when you suckers is working I'm on my lay back shit
And that's life, cause...
I've been on my own
In the world I'm all alone
I swear to God this shit can't stay the same
If y'all know what I've done
And y'all know I'm the one
All y'all lies been really fucking up my name...
