But I don't need you, I'm reminding myself
And it's funny how I wouldn't die for you, cause
My life's so lit I wouldn't die for myself
I don't wanna flip this  house now
Can't believe they used to put me in the background
Heard some rumors telling people I was backed-down
So I had to put their bodies in the bag now
And then they aim at me
Tell me I don't got the shit it takes to hurt somebody
Selling souls around my way and I ain't with it
That's the opposite of ownership
I'm building on the fucking highest floor of every place 
I don't know about y'all
But I'm definitely gon' make it
You said that I'm not then you definitely mistaken
I said it before, put respect on my name
And you dumb motherfuckers get chest and 
I don't like to be the hype one, telling people that I like guns
But I think that you should buy one, and put it in between your eyes 'cause
We don't need you, it's surviving
Oh my, me
Me and censorship have always had a hard feud
Cause we always tend to argue
'Bout who's right and wrong
But aren't you
Supposed to shut the fuck up
When I'm tryna get the bars in
Listen back and I'm nervous
Cadillac and I'm swerving
Hundred-thirty on the surface
From a city to the curtains

"If you're good at something, never do it for free"
"How much you want?"
"Uhh... Half"
"You're crazy"
"I'm not, no, I'm not"
I never notice when they taking a shot at me
You would never realize it with these bitches
But Follow me
Like I gotta be
Cause they tell me I'm the only one that got it
I couldn't disagree
I'm making history
Let anybody ever hit the fucking list with me
I heard somebody was calling out
Now nobody is talking, no disrespect
 dissing me now
I heard 'em saying  no way that they ain't competition
I haven't seen no one in here and I guess its suspicious
Slightly too vicious
Might be a sickness
Likely to rip shit
Hype in this business
Height of the pick-list
I got your lies on the rip-list
Well  I'ma spot from these bitches
So leave me alone
I don't like to come out much
I hardly leave the house much
Ain't scared of the people who doubt us
Cause we finna bury 'em, bout uhhh
Six feet
Put 'em this deep
Rap money, let me cop a motherfucking six-speed
I was turning two and yelling "bitch please"
I ain't never had a fucking limo
While I'm giving all the haters all of this heat
We can really take this shit from bar to bar
About the wounds we cause
I'm talking scar to scar
I mean you partially hard
And if that lets you rest, you can't consider going off of second-best
I ain't never scared of a person if he is breathing
I'm murdering all my demons
