I got, I got, I got hella ice
Flexing on them, bitch look at the price
I been grinding, grinding all my life
Bitch I know myself so don't don't give me No Advice
I got, I got, I got hella ice
Flexing on them, bitch look at the price

Bitch I know myself so don't don't give me No Advice

I been stunting for a while now please look at the ice
Walk up in the mall never look up at the price
Bitches see my swag, they be look ohh he nice
I don't really give a fuck, don't you see I roll the dice bitch?
And you know we running it, never gave a fuck bitch
Every time they see me guarantee we always dumb shit
Tell them what my name is, now they say I'm famous
Bitches who ain't fuck with me, now they always brainless
Damn you know I'm living up these shows
Throwing up this money and fucking all these hoes
Always getting high and always dodging laws
They say JDAM you a rookie, motherfucker I'm a pro
Better know that shit

And them VVS inside my Cuban ring
You know I dipped it in a fountain
Anytime I leave the crib with J
You know a motherfucker is surrounded
Run it up, you got a problem with it?
You ain't saying shit, I really doubt it
Water really got us looking like we bout
To fuck around and start drowning
I don't got no option but to flex, one time
Bet your favourite rapper tell me that I'm next one time
Stacking bread, taking every rappers bet one time
Fuck your set one time, we the best one time
If you really with it, tell em pull up on me
I ain't never scared of any one on ones
Running low, we pulling other funds
We got a hundred ways to get them hundreds up
We could tell you fraud, you motherfuckers sus
I got a lot to say, but I'mma hold my tongue
If you ain't sending feature money to me
I don't got a thing to say, it's time to run it up
And that's facts
I got, I got, I got hella ice
Flexing on them, bitch look at the price
I been grinding, grinding all my life
Bitch I know myself so don't don't give me No Advice
I got, I got, I got hella ice
Flexing on them, bitch look at the price
