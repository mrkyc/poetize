Can't let you in even though you're here in attendance
A partial memory is just leading me to forget this
I keep it moving, your feeling is near neglected
Don't got to give you shit, but you're acting like its expected
I picture perfect, your losing your whole perspective
I wish it's worth it, but lower numbers projected
You sit and worship these people you haven't yet met and decide to live your life by the people, not what's your best bet
I give a fuck, fully honest to hate
The hottest to date
So fuck the being modest debate
Im honored, and great
And you just bitching at me all the time, saying not to take this shit too serious, its too late
For you to call me out, acting like you offered out some help
What you talking bout, stalling like they put me on the shelf
Now the dogs are out, locking up they jaws and you been dealt
With a hand you couldn't play, you oughta kept your self
Cause who the fuck are you to tell me i shouldn't be chasing dreams
While you waste away your time, and its basic as what it seems
Rule breaking by any means, run obstacles in routine
But y'all can't never tell me you'll be in the ending scenes
With me, i got a lot on my chest and not an influence
Patience is a virtue, i'm not the one that it's cool with
I want that shit up front, what you waiting on motherfucker?, i got shit to do, and people to see and youre not included

You thought you were sent to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that ill be just like you
You might also like
I keep my vision straight
You know my time ain't free
You swore you had it all
Don't trust what i can't see
You know i lost my way
I found where i should be
You wrong if think that you'll be just like me

You said i need you
You never needed me
Now i know my mistakes
Was never listening
You took my energy
Your path wasn't meant for me
Sat back rolled up some piff
Had an epiphany

Everything you ever did for me, held it over my head
Like a puppet, now fuck it, that shit is dead
Why you wanna push a nigga while I'm so close to the edge?
Try to stand strong so you start aiming right at my legs
When your love is unconditional motherfuckers are quick to take advantage
Poker face so you can't even tell I'm taking damage
Meanwhile, deep down, yeah a nigga really be hurting
Drugs used to help a little but lately this shit ain't been working
All I ever gave a fuck about was the music, and all you ever gave a fuck about was figuring out how to use it
Never wanted a hand out, but I kept accepting your two cents
Kept my mouth shut until i felt like my voice had been muted
Now its fuck the bullshit, I ain't stupid I know my worth
It ain't nobody on this earth thats gon' come up off of my work
I done made it out from the dirt, now a nigga riding a wave (Shy)
I'm not a slave, nigga
You said i need you
You never needed me
Now i know my mistakes
Was never listening
You took my energy
Your path wasn't meant for me
Sat back rolled up some piff
Had an epiphany

You thought you were sent to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that ill be just like you

I keep my vision straight
You know my time ain't free
You swore you had it all
Don't trust what i can't see
You know i lost my way
I found where i should be
You wrong if think that you'll be just like me

You said i need you
You never needed me
Now i know my mistakes
Was never listening
You took my energy
Your path wasn't meant for me
Sat back rolled up some piff
Had an epiphany
