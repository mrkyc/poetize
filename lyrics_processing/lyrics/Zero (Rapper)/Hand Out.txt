Fuck whoever's hating
Cause we've been trying to win
Started off with nothing
It's time that we begin
I've seen her at my show
Grabbed me, said she off the liquor
Got a bad bitch out in L.A
Skipping school to be a stripper
One time that I had to stunt
I've got heat, now they mad as fuck
I heard your bitch listened to my CD from the front to back
Then back to front
Then front to back
Then back to front, again
I've been going up, again
I heard that all my old hoes want to fuck again
I've heard all the local rappers, I don't fuck with them
I mean, I ain't trying to be stuck with them
And she's been at my concert
Acting like she knows me
Sent a couple pictures
Said she couldn't wait to show me
Hell no
No, I don't need you
Tell your bitch that I need room
And you mad as hell that your girlfriend's a groupie
Taking pics in the green room, motherfucker

I see the ones that used to hate, they want to hang now
And when I'm walking by, y'all acting like my maid now
So let me make it very clear, and by faking
When a mirror's going to keep you in the same place that you stay, now

Dick only thing a bitch want from me
Money only thing a bitch want from me
And all y'all haters better run from me
Cause I don't want y'all company
I said, dick only thing a bitch want from me
Money only thing a bitch want from me
And all y'all haters better run from me
Cause I don't want y'all company, oh no

I heard your mixtape's a broken lighter, you've got no flames
Chains stay  when it's gold time
I don't play no games
Tinder flows, just swiping right
Soul-searching for some fucking stranger
This Adderall, up in the bathroom stall got me off the walls
I'm 'bout to go insane
Trying to get rich, man, why they look over me?
Back in your bitch and I'm all in the ovaries
Chills down the spine, man, ain't no one as cold as me
Say what I want, there ain't no one controlling me
Really say whatever I want
Your grandma  my nuts
Grabbing on her butt while we hit the blunt
Like "Please shut up"
Glaucoma got her all fucked up, sorry!
These other girls,  , yeah they're decent
We can drift off every night, every weekend
Be our little secret, I'm being facetious
Saying "use your head" she thinks I'm thinking with my penis, oh man
I see the ones that used to hate, they want to hang now
And when I'm walking by, y'all acting like my maid now
So let me make it very clear, and by faking
When a mirror's going to keep you in the same place that you stay, now

Dick only thing a bitch want from me
Money only thing a bitch want from me
And all y'all haters better run from me
Cause I don't want y'all company
I said, dick only thing a bitch want from me
Money only thing a bitch want from me
And all y'all haters better run from me
Cause I don't want y'all company, oh no

Back up (x5)
You ain't fooled me, yet, always
Acting (x4)
Like you know me, yeah
Fuck it, bout to drive and drunk
Driving like a winner
Always in the cut, don't slow it up
No time for write-ups
Feeling like the man, goddamn
Cause y'all  the shit, goddamn
But your girl's asking me for a pic
I can tell by your face, there's a  in the sake, goddamn
Cut you off, it don't mean nothing
Getting money and it keeps coming
Never cussing cause she's team oven
Stop hating, bitch, do something
Ain't a rapper but I'm spitting facts
Most of y'all don't know how to act
Scratch that, y'all are whack
Y'all be hating right behind my fucking back
I go and get it and I never sweat it
Cause I live for it and I die by it
So keep quiet cause me and Jerm and Zero
