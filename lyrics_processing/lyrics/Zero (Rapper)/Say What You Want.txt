Never been a one to back down
Put 'em out
Look around, where they at now?
I said
Fuck y'all hoes, put the money back now
2015 is the year of the rap clown
Someone get this bitch up off of my dick
I know I should never gave her my number
Texting me 24/7 and shit
I was just trying to fuck you for the summer
Talking cheap, cause all that talk is irrelevant
Better than veterans
Go knock it off like we selling shit
Flow never celibate
Talking that shit out your mouth and we going to go elephants
How would I fuck up, might bury a skeleton
Take your hoes, part of my selfish
It's part of my Jordan's, enact like we parting these bitches
I got in my section, I knew it would get like this, facts
Then a little bit too hyped
We get fucked up like Kimbo Sliced
And never been too nice
All these bitches turn away too tight
I protect myself, better protect your rights
I can break your neck just like Busta Rhymes
Better get your shit and better get your life
Before this all 17 gets you left on sight
And you ain't even gon' be able to reflect that height, uh
You might also like
I might not know much, but I know one thing
And you can't tell me who I should be
I do my own thing, don't care what you think
I'll go my own way cause that's just me
You can say what you want now
You can say what you want now
You can say what you want now (Now)

Yeah (x3)
Like fuck that
Been around my city where they bust backs
Been around too long, trying to lead this bitch
And hell no I ain't never trying to come back
Only move first, never run back
All that Twitter talk bout where the guns at
Seen a hundred tweets and never one strap
So that's for the birds, I never trust that
I took a million losses
Fuck all that shit you were talking, you lost it
I only sit at a table with women who look like Rihanna
Who thinking like bosses, awesome
More than the coffins
Selling they bodies and put them for auctions
Headed, my bitches go up to the scene and they wrapping it up with the caution
They do it often, right
You ain't never been this nice
Like you ain't never been this tight
I got the kryptonite
I got that so many flows and a deadly disease that it might leave you cribbed tonight
I mean, you get that right?
I thinks I spit that nice
That I can literally damage a rapper
By giving them verses, their verses, they couldn't compare to my word shit cause bitches I spit that tight
The murderous mannequin
Lyricist-handling
Damaging bitches, turn Pamela Anderson
Bringing the camera and
Talking that shit and we leaving the candle in
Not for discussion
We come through with hammers and
Fuck who the man is in
I've been the one making moves, in advance with it
Needing my shit with advances and
Fuck what your stanzas is
Ain't been a fan if you really can't stand this shit
I might not know much, but I know one thing
And you can't tell me who I should be
I do my own thing, don't care what you think
I'll go my own way cause that's just me
You can say what you want now
You can say what you want now
You can say what you want now (Now)

So all that talking ain't getting you any place far
We hitting fast like shells out of that AR
We hungry for the top spot, we the top shot
You wishing, but I will not stop
Your whole song ain't fucking with my 8 bars
I've been around a couple times and I'm back
And yeah bitch, its a fact
All your music ain't shit
You're better off quitting rap
And if you want to throw knuckles
Don't want to get into that
We got too much going on
Cause we too focused to scrap

I might not know much, but I know one thing
And you can't tell me who I should be
I do my own thing, don't care what you think
I'll go my own way cause that's just me
You can say what you want now
You can say what you want now
