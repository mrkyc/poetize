Girl, I fucked up by the minute
But I need to know if you're with it
There ain't no games, games, games from here on out
You been by my side since beginnings
But now that you see that I'm winning
There ain't no way, way, way this gonna bring me down
I need to know
If you'll be here, be here with me
And I need to know
If you'll be here, be here with me

Am I everything you thought I'd be?
I figured not when I saw you leave
All the bullshit I dealt with, it's all your fault
It's fucked up, bitch, I would have got down on my knees
Now these fucking inconsiderate bitches that I've been dealing with
It's funny how somebody's all you got when you've been feeling it
Bitch, you were my everything, I'm not trying to get into it
A slut will be a slut, when I think about it I'm sick as shit
Life's fast, it will change you quick, change your script
Come back around and make you bitch, it's dangerous
My whole life I've been faced with shit
Like am I going to be nobody or go make this shit?
The flow's dope, I've been harder at it
Yeah, I'm problematic
Couple pairs of Jordan's and a starter jacket
A harder passion with this rapping, I know it's hard to match it
The heart-attacking, bar assassin
I've been the best and bitch, I've hardly practiced
There's a lot of controversy in my mind
You could put one of your verses up to mine
I guarantee they'll laugh and say the shit that you're spitting just isn't mine
I've been gifted with the writtens, you've been bitching all the time
What's that?
I make a call and get a run back
All up in this chick, the same place you keep a gun at
Trying to get these memories, a waste, I hear them suck at
I used to love you, baby, but, baby, I'm yelling fuck that
Cause I've been too real
I'm from the 90's, I feel like fucking opera's ill
Wrist game that swings, kind of  game
Pussy rappers bitch, man
Man, ain't shit changed?
How it feel (x3)
You're double my age but I know that you're half as real so
Y'all can tell and come and get me
I don't care what you think, my favorite rappers fuck with me
Fuck y'all

Girl, I fucked up by the minute
But I need to know if you're with it
There ain't no games, games, games from here on out

There ain't no way, way, way this gonna bring me down
I need to know
If you'll be here, be here with me
And I need to know

I'm a motherfucking problem
In Miami, I've been wilding
I forgot about the shit that you did when I wasn't looking
A couple memories that I wish I'd really forgotten
Same shit, ass, bitch, fuck it, you've been a hoe
Game, switched that quick, wished that you let me know
Aim with that grip, cock it and let it go
I ain't stopping this at the door, with the top at the second floor
I've put my best shit out
Don't stress shit, second guessing
Trying to get rich now
You can't get no better when you're the best at this shit
Destined to win, S on my chest, come and check this out
I've been on it since '97
Hunting in my profession
Stepping to veterans, nobody's walking in my direction
You better leave to the exit
Checking me ain't your best but I'm guaranteeing the slaughter of anybody who's flexing
That shit is a fucking joke
Grabbing the mic and choke
We having the right to grab you and stab you right in the throat
You talking that shit in public
Calling that shit in abundance
The project you dropped is garbage, I'm sick to my fucking stomach
No wonder your shit will plummet
Your shit is turning redundant
Overdosing on culture, not bending the rules and run it
Making paths in advance, don't talk about it just do it
You rappers are trash, stop trying to copy off of influence
Be yourself and go and walk yours out
Don't come back, take a shit and don't talk out your mouth
You really want to know how I got these scars?
Because the stories ain't prettier than these things are
I've been fucked a couple times by some bitches in life
Stitches from knives
Ironic, but it's giving me life
Learning this was easy, I grew when it put me on
This what keeps my heart alive but the beating ain't very strong
Goddamn
Girl, I fucked up by the minute
But I need to know if you're with it
There ain't no games, games, games from here on out
Been by my side since besides it's beginnings
But now that you see that I'm winning
There ain't no way, way, way this gonna bring me down
I need to know
If you'll be here, be here with me
And I need to know
