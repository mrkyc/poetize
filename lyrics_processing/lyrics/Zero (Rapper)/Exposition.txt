I never been around to play the nice guy
I came to take what's rightfully mine
I knew you wouldn't understand, but I never expected you to

Hello bitch, I'm back
My ex still hit my phone, I'm 'bout to switch my jack
About 100% of these rappers out in the city
Been tryna steal the kid's flow, please give mine back
Why you all on my dick like this?
Is it cause I make hits like this?
Is it cause I never made a single song
About the way that I'ma go n flick my wrist like this?
Probably, I don't play with the fuck shit
Skinny, white kid and I still never tuck shit
Swear to God that all day I'll be sussin individuals
Bet you all my residuals, everyone of you will suck dick
And that's the worst shit, yeah we're vets
All of y'all wear skirts, that's that
We're next, never popped a single perc but yet
I will still fuck around and put 30 on your set

It's real simple
I was down to play the game, but there's one thing...

Mothafucka better act like you know, but who knows
Bitches try to do me like they Juno
I ain't fuckin' raw, especially not for you though
I'm cool though, I'll still take her down like judo
I ain't a pacifist, but boys in it I'll pass a fist
I'll put a  to whip past all of your passes in
Now who the toughest 'n which is gettin y'all asses kicked
I don't give a fuck if y'all point 'em out, that's adequate
For me at least I may not be a G at least, never seemed to me
Or even get played on the TV screen, your CDs weak
Yo  you see these freaks? Stop dming my promoter to see if the feature's cheap
Fuck you and fuck that, you buck, we buck back
Who's what and what's that, too tough, what y'all act
Too sus I must add, you suckas y'all lack
Everything you actin', bein' is a wrap n don't come back, mothafucka

I wholeheartedly believe you picked a fight with the wrong one
It's never easy to explain, so I advice you listen

Hello bitch once more, we cannot trade features, I do not want yours
I do not need a video 
Cause me and Deb been fuckin' shit up and the draws all yours
Me n him been livin' life, yes
Hopped up in a Maserati twice, yes
Catchin' planes though we had to switch a flight
We was out in Cali eat salmon over rice, yes
Somebody tell me how I'm not on top
Half a million plays on my song with Rock
Double XXL leavin' posts to ya boy, I'm close to annoyed
When the fuck am I gon' pop
I did a song with Tory, got a beat by Play
Got a Futuristic feature sold out at the TLA
The  just wants to harm me, and hearin' we did a song
