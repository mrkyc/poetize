And we will never be the same, feel the same
Cause you would always point the blame, point the blame
You don't need to say it, it's better left unsaid
I know you hate it when I
When I fuck your friends

I know you hate it when I (x6)
When I fuck your friends

Came back for her
Said I never would have read another track for her
Think I still want to have her
Cause her friends ain't nothing but a backboard
But where the time go?
Stuck around on the time, low
Looking for a dime hoe
In a different time zone
Futuristic tell me Arizona got some fine hoes
So, all of the shit that I state in my raps
And shit that I've really done lived in my past
If you hear me telling you this bitch cheated on me
And you ask if it's true, never mind that
Where your mind at?
Got to go and get the grind back
Funny how I put the whole relationship on my back
Never been the one to think our time last
Rewind that, you'll find that and I'll never get the time back
She probably thought that I never would know
She probably thought she would not get exposed
I really do not get offended too often
Bitch, tell me why you were thinking so low
Fuck all that shit that you're texting me bitch
Suddenly, now you're upset with me bitch?
Remember them times you were next to me, bitch?
In the bed with your friends, you can't get to me, bitch
You might also like
And we will never be the same, feel the same
Cause you would always point the blame, point the blame
You don't need to say it, it's better left unsaid
I know you hate it when I
When I fuck your friends

I know you hate it when I (x7)
When I fuck your friends

I don't got time to talk
I'm fine without you, it's time that you walk
What is the type time that you always on?
Never said I wanted you, why are you drawn?
I don't need your peace
Should have been obvious that I need to leave
I should have seen you're weak
Bitch, go and cheat again, it's senior week
Last time that I love hoes, fuck hoes
I don't ever love those
We could fuck though
Never been a sucker for the love, yo
Bring them to the studio this flight
Never going to bring them while I stay
Last time that I did that shit I ended up with a girlfriend
What can I say?
I could say fuck that
Never play trust that
If they taking this name and they asking me "What do you do?"
Imma say bust back
Fuck all that shit that you're texting me bitch
Suddenly, now you're upset with me bitch?
Remember them times you were next to me, bitch?
In the bed with your friends, you can't get to me, bitch
And we will never be the same, feel the same
Cause you would always point the blame, point the blame
You don't need to say it, it's better left unsaid
I know you hate it when I
When I fuck your friends

I know you hate it when I (x7)
When I fuck your friends

I know you hate it when I (x7)
