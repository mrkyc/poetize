I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I never knew what to do with you
Every time I wake up, I feel lost in space, love
Dreaming I was laying next to you

I know that I'm not the one
I want to be there when you got to love
I know it ain't the first time in this bed with you
There really isn't anything for me not to love
And I'm selfish, I can't help it
I can't let you leave like I'm helpless
And I'll take the hand that I'm dealt with
I need all of you to myself, shit
I dream about you and me
I had a lot of girls, none of them are you, to me
I'll stay true with you, just stay true to me
And I would never ask for you to leave
On my mind a lot, there's not a time, a time
I've been around my way, but not away from mind
I keep in mind, you're mind
You're always crossing mine
But never cross the line
I keep your heart with mine, and that's real
You're the perfect match
Perfect face with that perfect ass
And them heels you got, with that purse that match
I've been in love since the first we laughed
I've got a lot to say, but know I'm not to say
So is you with it?
I want to lay you down, don't want to play around
So let's get it
Baby that's written
You might also like
'Cause we've been on the same shit
Don't ever want to change shit
And you've been on my mind, it's all entire night and day shit
You're the one I want to lay with
The one I want to stay with
Your body on my mind and baby I

I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I never knew what to do with you
Every time I wake up, I feel lost in space, love
Dreaming I was laying next to you

I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I never knew what to do with you
Every time I wake up, I feel lost in space, love
