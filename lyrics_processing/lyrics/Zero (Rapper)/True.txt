Some people like me and some people won't (true)
Give a fuck? Well bitch, no I don't (true)
And you can hate me all the fuck you want (okay)

Need a whip with the engine in the back
So I can stuff you in the fucking front
I take no talking and no fuck-shit
You coming at me, that's a dead man walking
Y'all ain't never spitting nothing that's above this
Say I sound like so-and-so, well I don't know
At least it get's the people talking
I mean I don't got a problem with it
All I know is all I am is me and I don't gotta copy people
Because a lot of people like to think they know a lot about me but
They don't even know my first name, and
They always rap and I could merk 'em on my worst day
You heard me rap? Well then you must've heard a first-place
I'll sing it back, make sure you motherfuckers heard me
You heard me rap? Well then you must've heard a first-place
And the day you come in is the day I'll take you out, like
Like you got buried on your birthday, no way, I'm not fucking 'round here
So how could you fuck this up
I just snapped, they know what the fuck is up
I hope you, jumping from a hundred trucks
'Cause oh God, you need to get up off my nuts
Don't got a mother-fuck to give to these critics who think they know me
These bitches better get off my dick then they better blow me
Ain't giving out any debt to these people who think we homies
I ain't talking 'bout no  so come and show me

Tryna rock the business bet Jehovah witness
How I cross the oceans just to feature this shit
I ain't playing around with no one else in this bitch
I've been laying it down, the instrumentals and shit
Feel like I'm Lil' Uzi Vert, I'm bringing hell in this bitch
Yeah, I'm selfish as shit
To my haters, hope you fell in a ditch
And I ain't fucking with you no more
I'm getting so bored
These rappers nowadays are seeming so forced
I know more than y'all
Literally impossible to keep my opinions cause y'all trash, man
So on and so forth and uh
Fuck that shit y'all talking
Y'all gon' be salty once some blood spill on 'em
I could wash my hands but the bloods still on 'em
And every single beat gets beaten down and killed off, and I
Got that V8 drive, never left behind
In no time, I'm living in everyone's dreams
I'm living a lie, and fuck
I made this bread off my fucking stream on the side
From the features, I need this shit that I know that money can buy like
Happiness and a new necklace, if you disagree then, you don't get it
You ain't even levels away from my presence
Y'all could keep the talk, you stacking up my checks, bitch
Some people like me and some people won't (true)
Give a fuck? Well bitch, no I don't (true)
And you can hate me all the fuck you want (okay)

I am not the one to fuck with any beat or subject
