And I started off on my own
No help when I work now
Put the verse out, it's like
Everybody want to come and work now, I put that work out
I got big dreams, couldn't take that shit
My love, couldn't fake that shit
Thought about a couple ways that I could break that shit
In the city where nobody's going to make that shit
I've seen friends die by the age of twenty
Guns drawn in the name of money
Fuck whoever's trying to hate on me
But my heart couldn't take that from me
I know right where I belong
And no, church couldn't ever right my wrongs
Fuck pain when I write my songs
So I write my wrongs, I know my life's not long

People could always doubt it
But no one could ever take it from me
Funny how everybody ain't nothing when I was working
But suddenly everybody loves me

But that ain't what you'll never do
Then they say how they look up to you
But if you weren't with me there
Fuck you now, cause I really never felt I had shit to prove

I don't doubt shit
I've been around shit
That could have fucked me up
It ain't about shit
So you can never tell me nothing
Correct it if how you're coming
And something about you stunting from the clout shit
Things change by the minute
Lights, fame and the bitches
Y'all stay with the gimmicks
Bring that shit around my way and then it's finished, I don't get it
Cause I'm off too quick, they put you off the list
I've never lost this shit, so get up off my dick
The boss is in, don't cross the line
I cross my hip, and target hit
When they be starting shit
And I know I've been fucked up
Cause my girl made me all fucked up
But the songs I made from her bullshit
Is the same songs that all of y'all love
It ain't safe for you to make a move
Can't make it through
We night to night and day to day
It's safe to say I've paved the way
I make my fate
It came from you, we stay the truth
From me and me, to you, to you
Just keep the times we had alive
Don't let it die
Cause at the end I wouldn't be the person that I am today
If I ain't had all the times that I spent with you
People could always doubt it
But no one could ever take it from me
Funny how everybody ain't nothing when I was working
But suddenly everybody loves me

But that ain't what you'll never do
Then they say how they look up to you
But if you weren't with me there
Fuck you now, cause I really never felt I had shit to prove
