Everybody fucking cares
And I don't give a fuck who doesn't
Andrew Meoray

They wanna know, how I keep selling out shows
Think I should go into more
They wanna know, where am I calling my home
P.A,L.A to New York
They wanna know, how I keep selling out shows
Think I should go into more
They wanna know(yeah)
They wanna know,they wanna know

Double doors, a motherfucker like me just do it
Tell 'em "Mind yo' business"
Fake shit, I can see right through it
I leave God as my witness
I don't got no answers, no manners, no standards
I black out like closed cameras
Came from the bottom to the top like pole-dancers
I'm the boss bitch, I'm so  I caught now so put yo' hands up
Yeah, I done came up boss, claim that you flames but
You ain't gon' pop
And you ain't from SA but you claim you my guy
Who the motherfuckers, you motherfuckers then that's high?
I don't even seek a limit to living of all of y'all
I've been itching every minute, no getting them dollars off
You ain't get it bitch, I said that I'm caking in every wall
The shit gets so popping off
You live it, you not involved
Let's get it

Yeah, why you ever wanna go there?
It's no fair, I'm an animal with no care
You won't dare step to me in your city or yo' hood
Or the place you grew up, you ain't stepping to me nowhere
Made racks, still playing us though
Got fans from the way that I flow
Sold out shows, still got millions to go
And they never could comprehend
