Throwin' on the shit to make you hate me, lately
Tryna pull a couple on the daily, lately
Hundred in mufuckin' 45
Now I got 2 points up on the license like a safety, lately
I been tryna tour around the states
Tryna make this money off my motherfucking name
Tryna hit Japan and drop some bread up on the Bape
Feels like I get every piece of thing they have ever made, damn
And y'all do not know me, I am not tryna impress you
I run through these rappers in Japanese sweatsuits
I fuck up these whack rappers' beats when I'm not tryna talk
Bout my problems, cause I gotta flex too

How the fuck you gonna blame me
Usually helpin' all these other kids with their problems
None of y'all could ever never play me
Cause I get too violent, and all of that shit in the tuck now im wildin
So fuck what you heard, I'm bout to blow up
Send me your location and bet I'm gon' show up
But do not sing shit to me about your vibes, or ill throw up
Bitch, now grow up, for real

Walk around the middle of the city
And I'm good in every part so motherfucker never try it, no lying
No guidance is here, so we riot
Couldn't ever see the team, cause they in hiding
We bombin, feel like a kamikaze pilot
I swear to God, im the man, dont need anybody to buy it
The facts are really the facts, it ain't any way to deny it
I promise you I'm gon' kill it, it's just a matter of timing
And I been up on these beats, born in 97, was rhymin', uh

You can not fuck with me dog
Y'all couldn't even keep up with me dog
Runnin' through a check like every week
Man, it must suck to be y'all
I don't fuck with nobody cause most of y'all snakes
Man I never came here to explain
I just came to say shit that's been weighing me down
It's the only way that I could push this weight off my chest
I don't wanna seem so stressed
Gotta make the whole entire team progress
We need those checks and I don't mean no threats
But don't you let me catch a motherfucker, seem so tense
(cause thats iffy)
Y'all throw my nerves out of line
Don't be taking no words out of my
Mouth or my dialogue
I will solve any one problem
You bring us, and cloud all y'all shine

Man I swear to God I gotta set the tone
When I step in, I got a fuckin metal suit, and on my side are the weapons
So throw a shot at me? You gotta be stupid because I'll check 'em
And I'll dance around this bitch like you trynna choose em in Tekken
I reckon that y'all don't really wanna fuck with a real one
They just wanna join the team when the deal come
Sending shots at everybody yall can feel some
And y'all gon feel some!
Fuck y'all, it's been the same damn thing
Put repect on my name name name
Catch shots like bang bang bang
And Y'all was never with the gang gang gang
Yeah, it's been the same damn thing
Put repect on my name name name
Catch shots like bang bang bang
Y'all was never with the gang gang gang
