(Yeah) Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang
Spend 5 racks on these newer rings, yeah they like to hate
Mad because I'm prolly getting paid
Do a feature spend that money on some bape
And I need deals
Promise I'm back to giving the real
When these singles start dropping I'm giving you every feel
Your wounds will be getting healed
Some music giving you chills and every rap motherfucker getting killed (no bullshit)
Pulling every angle I'm stuck in this little bull pit
Aiming at you rappers with bullets looking to pull it
Foolish, you verse me, what is you doing?
Cool it, that type of thinking was never cool bitch
I, I been on the rise times 10
And uploading my shit as Eminem but I'm him (Yea, yea, yea, yea)
I'm him, guess I haven't said it enough cause they doing it again now (now)
Don't you play bitch, bout 10 mil plays on that new fake shit
Get about 1 mil when its under my real name in 1 year
Someone owes me new bank bitch, I'm
Being honest but fuckers is out of pocket
They better come out of pocket
If I find you I'm gonna rob it
That's pretty generous of me
You really should get that bank up (You, you, you should get a shot in the head for fucking my name up)
(Real) Real rap, I don't
Feel that, I don't
Give a fuck if you
Still clap for me
Get a look now
Take a snap of me
I ain't on yet
That's a tragedy
Cause I'm gonna be famous as shit
While you sit there and remain a hating ass bitch
I look at the top spot like you got to be kidding me
Ain't no one hot even aiming at this no
Momma never raised no quitter
Since I ain't poppin' I may be a little bitter
And since I'm rappin' on another mans beat
I just wanna say that Lil Pump honestly fucked your sister, damn
