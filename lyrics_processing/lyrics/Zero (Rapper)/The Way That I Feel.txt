Grass on the ground is as green as can be
Birds in the sky are flying so free
And the taste in my mouth is as sweet as can be
But it still don't change...
No, it still don't change the way...
The way that I feel

Been about a whole year, shit changed
Tell me, wait, I'll try to explain
I've been hitting coast to coast like each month, and when I'm home I find a bitch and get laid, but this
That don't change the way that I feel
I'm on my way to get rich
And you will never see one cent
Saw your Twitter page and I see that you're sick
I ain't trying to brag or boast, I saw your post
It starts to show that you were better when your heart was broke
But your dumbass should've thought the whole thing through before your thought provoked
Because of you
I don't have no more raps
Backing over body and put under floor mat
Hating only, only make me whip up more crack
If I front you a little, bring a little more back
I see a hater all on my dick
But I see you favorite all of my shit
Cause everybody knows that the kid about to go
And you ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking 'bout this
There's jealousy inflicting the man
We getting busy, did he really think he's sick as I am?
Cause in my city ain't no pity, better pick up the plan
Then end it gritty, never giving
So go get what you can, motherfucker

The way that I feel

So I'm working and laying low
But this music ain't paying so
We gon' break down the door in this office and tell them to do what we saying
Feel I got a murder on the front of my mindset
To execute is easy, I ain't  the time yet
Show me to the race and Imma double the time 
Cause I'm next, waiting for the songs I'll win on next
Beyond flex, I see you motherfuckers suck
All of y'all raps, they beyond fucking suck
Heard you on the beats, never profiting, a bluff
When a tough call's crazy, deal is on, fuck is up?
Got a long list of names I could call, buzzing
And along, all the names been a fraud, stunting
I won't let you hold nothing
Why'd I let you hold something?
I ain't never had a reason all of y'all frontin'
Fuck that, I been around Two-Face
Fuck a label deal, all you sound too fake
The way that I feel ain't the way that I feel
When the way that I feel brings around you snakes
So talk another word, your jaws will see muzzle
Bring a whole half, that half will be doubled
Never getting close
I can already tell that you the type to go and snitch and go mad like D. Russel, oh no
Grass on the ground is as green as can be
