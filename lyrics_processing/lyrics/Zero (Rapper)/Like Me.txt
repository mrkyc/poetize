Woke up in the morning, I'm feening to go and get it
Got 'em body to body, probably got bodied when I spit it
Forget it, you gon' regret it
Pathetic you better quit it
The mannequin, half-masked murderer, that's the gimmick
It's a lot of talking
Better proceed precautions
Cause also carvers come up on us
Often, these rappers, they get forgotten
But boss ain't gon' be the boss
Better learn to walk or you're crawling
Heard them saying my name
Let them say it in vain
Cause ain't a reason why I'm getting any play in this game
It'd be the same ironic reasons we turning narcotics, easy
For the fact of the matter is love is stronger than hate
I have a death wish
On my ex bitch
I pray to God that she's nothing like my next bitch
Cause when it's all said and done I'mma have the last laugh while you're working for your boss up at a desk bitch
I'm taking millions
Banking and banking like seven digits
We anxiously waiting for the spot and you better give it
Or we'll come and take it, I really don't give a shit if you hating
It's my time, you are sadly mistaken
I got the deadliest flows
And the sexiest hoes
Well that's a lie but I'm working on it
And you can't even be a hater
That shit don't even make no sense
There ain't a song that I ain't perfect on it
And they be looking like, "Boy, that's bold"
But damn well knowing they be saying, "Boy, that's cold"
And they try to talk shit, but that don't work out
Cause they be sounding just as good as Ave-Troye and Soul
(I mean)
Let's get real
Go and talk that shit
Y'all can grab your guns
Go and draw that clips
But y'all ain't shit behind the mic, so y'all should call that quits
Motherfucker, I done heard enough of all y'all shit

Yo (x2)
Y'all ain't never met a nigga like me
Rising like yeast
Flyer than a couple bees
I want everything, nothings ever leased
If it's beef, have a feast
I'm a beast, need a leash
Crease beats in my sleep
Y'all niggas softer than fleece
Boy, you Kanye East
Smoking weed by the leaf as I sip my drink
Been on tour for three weeks, don't speak unless I rap
You sweeter than tea, and me, I'm spitting facts
Zack is back, a platinum plaque
I'm grabbing that, like back to back
Don't have to ask, I'm out here
Aftermath of bashing tracks is cashing that
The fattest asses, tap them all around me
I'm swimming in the money, don't drown me
No frowning
Happy ass nigga, you an actor
Bugs Bunny, Daffy ass nigga
On every track I snap, Laffy-Taffy ass nigga
You can't do it like me, bro
This shit is easy like a free-throw
Give her the bone like a wing, though
You can't see me, I'm on the other side of the peephole
Yes
Way up, got me feeling real blessed
No stress, me and Zero 'bout to cash in them checks
This a zone where you probably shouldn't flex
Got a show in New York, about to hop on deck
