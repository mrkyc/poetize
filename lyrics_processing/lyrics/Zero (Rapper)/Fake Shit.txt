Hit a lick, I've been down one time
Like they haven't put me down one time
All I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit
Don't come around when I make it
If you ain't showing love when I ain't shit
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit

And I ain't down with the fake shit
I ain't' down with the-
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit

I've been waiting on a break like that
Momma told me get a break like that
If I fucking gotta say, God, I made a fucking way
Tell me, momma, why they hate like that?
You will never understand my mind
You will never understand my flow
You will never understand my grind
Bitch, I promise that you will never know
You might also like
Hit a lick, I've been down one time
Like they haven't put me down one time
All I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit
Don't come around when I make it
If you ain't showing love when I ain't shit
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit

And I ain't down with the fake shit
I ain't' down with the-
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit

I don't know nobody else like me
Momma said nobody else's like me
When I hear another speak, all I hear is slurred speech
Ain't nobody who could help like me
You will never get a second chance
Til I get a fucking check advance
I can promise if you hating, no debating
I'll be winning in a minute, you can bet this and
Feel like my life has been underwater, in pressure tanks
I'm looking down at your pen and pad and it's extra blank
I'm speaking down to you rappers who never get to rank
You can give your two cents, but bitch, I bet the bank
It ain't even about the money, especially
Breaking beats up is my specialty
When I sleep, I know my father's spirit's next to me
Said he's protecting me, ain't here but ain't neglecting me
When I started, it's something I never thought could've happened
It's something I never caught
But coming at me, I'm curious if you fought yourself a little more than I saw
But we ain't gonna get into it like that
A little beaten, but ain't broken, I ain't ruined like that
You ain't ever seen nobody ever do it like that
Cause all you knew is the facts
Yeah, all you knew is the facts

Hit a lick, I've been down one time
Like they haven't put me down one time
All I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit
Don't come around when I make it
If you ain't showing love when I ain't shit
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
I don't want you showing love, I ain't down with the fake shit
And I ain't down with the fake shit
I ain't' down with the-
Cause all I know is I don't really give a fuck
