I made a lot of money this damn week (goddamn)
Tryna count it all up now I can't sleep (goddamn)
Don't you worry bout my raps, that's hoe shit (goddamn)
Now they worried 'bout five racks, that's broke shit

On the top of the world and I'm straight coastin', oh shit
Bitch, you motherfuckers been the sus' type
I would bleed for this shit, whats your blood type?
I'ma leave the doors locked and you ain't got the right key, kinda similar to Lil' Yachty one night
I'm a boss, all my homies carry pumps, right
Type of dudes to put your body in the trunk, right
Put my heart in this game, that's my love life
Know I'm gonna win, I can feel it in my gut
That's  life, fuck life
Working cause the whole gang needs this
Spend racks on Gucci, off Gucci Gang remix
All you lil' bitches need Jesus
Being down on your knees is not preaching, see bitch?
I don't know what kind of drugs that y'all on
I got no plan in my life I can fall on
If I don't make it I promise that y'all won't
I do not speak in my , like
Thanks for my business I'm taking it all
I ain't into making money, y'all fakers and frauds
I keep it rollin', never had any practice involved
Late to the paper, you lost
They ain't ever breaking our walls

'Bout to put this whole game into Motion, notice
We ain't ever gonna be compared in the same lane
I hate Lanez, buddy had  on my bank 
You ain't sane thinking you can play in the same game
I can't be sure that you'd ever be safe
Aim for headshots only, no trophies
I'm the best rapper ever, don't quote me
Don't you call be my cover if you don't know me
Get slumped if you standing too closely
Ain't nobody gon' hit me like that
Swear that y'all rappers don't know how to rap
Tell me, whats that? Literally gonna be stuck in a trap
Look where I'm at, live down the block
'Cause of the way that 
I'll never stop working my life away, hitting the top
How many people are getting that spot?
Not many, I'm deadly
These motherfuckers wanna play me, but they not ready
I know there's so much talking, it's so often
Need a king , you'll get tossed
I made a lot of money this damn week (yeah, this week)
Tryna count it all up now I can't sleep (goddamn)
Don't you worry bout my raps, that's hoe shit (stop watching)
Now they worried 'bout five racks, that's broke shit
