Can't wait til I win
Oh God, I can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
It will be too late to win the race that I'm in
Can't wait til I win
Motherfucker, can't wait til I win

I don't stand for shit
Young man, got plans, never planned for shit
Not the type of person you would want to look up to
Slit necks, then slit wrists, then I gram that shit
They don't want to see you win unless you're giving them a piece
But fuck them man, we're only trying to eat
Belly of the beast
Running and ducking from the police
We stumbling and we rummaging
Fucking up all the beats, lets feast
Had to man up quick
Dad died, get the fam up, quick
16, New Years Eve, had to stand up quick
So I'll fight in my life, keep my hands up, bitch
Put me in the middle of the city
And even from this bitch, there's nobody that's fucking with me
I'm telling you I'm fit and I belittle the rest
Put the strap to the hand like a Mitchell and Ness
The fuck out of here

Can't wait til I win
Oh God, I can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
It will be too late to win the race that I'm in
Can't wait til I win
Motherfucker, can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
Motherfuckers always hate when you win

Star Wars, we living in our course
As a youngin' we ain't had too much, but car ports
And we grew up quick, like we knew this shit
That one day we'd be having them open our car doors
Our force got hearts
Forced to listen to our sport
This rap game, hacks aim, listen to our stories
Suddenly I'm going to be our source
Hundred generation, you ain't never breaking in our force
Had the gate on lock
We gauged our watch to play
Ya'll blocked, we safe
Y'all not, don't hate our plot
Maintain and take names when we aim y'all squad with these K's all propped
They all stable, cocked
And got aims, so we save our shots
Put your brain on top of your street while the neighbors watch
They can't save y'all ops
I run game, never play, y'all blocked
The fuck out of here
Can't wait til I win
Oh God, I can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
It will be too late to win the race that I'm in
Can't wait til I win
Motherfucker, can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
Motherfuckers always hate when you win

The body drop and
We kind of hotter than all of y'all
Holofrost, claiming they're balling
Never been crossing gaurds
Put their money up and I'm taking it from their hand
Thinking 'bout doin' the Chris Brown
And shut it down from wall to wall
To hell with that
I'm a hellish act in the Devil's mask
Fuckin' meeting up and coming straight to where you're selling that
Money never make a motherfucker
But motherfucker, I could make this money make a man
Now, who can tell you that?
Rip y'all off, make a quick drop off
You been soft, break your neck and go and kick y'all jaw
To begin, been raw
Have a Pit-bull dog bite your ass if you're thinking 'bout a quick sprint off
I will run you pussies
Half-tab, put the gun to your pussies
I don't front with you pussies
It's like I knock the bitch up the way I go and make a song for you pussies
I've been a veteran, its evident we running these rookies, I'm seasoned
I don't front for no reason, bitch, I'm a demon
We feening, aiming and squeezing
We fucking bitches and leaving
I mean it, the nicest breathing
We sight, then leaning for peace
But the easiest rush to cease
And we fuck until they see that we the meanest
I don't talk shit to talk shit
I talk slick, motherfucker, what you call this?
Me and Ty rolling in four cars and Skywalkers
I'm the definition of getting us to be all rich
Me and Ansu been fucking shit up every week
You touch and then I'll swing, if vice-versa you'll rest in peace
And best believe we next to be the greatest stepping from the East
Who you know that's this ill?
That's given it from the streets, bitch it's me
Ain't no body else that sick
Need a new girlfriend, I'm tired of fucking black chicks
Put my feelings on a piece, they put them on a mattress
In different cities every week, I can't commit to that shit
I mean, you need to get shit straight
You're like 25 with 6 mixtapes
Don't got a wifey but it's funny cause you're still bitch-made
And all you rap about is money but you get min. wage
Hot as hell, I guess I'm lit, motherfucker
I could lose a hundred times and never quit, motherfucker
I mean, you don't even have a hit, motherfucker
Want to brawl? Then we can brawl and throw your shit, motherfucker
Can't wait til I win
Oh God, I can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
It will be too late to win the race that I'm in
Can't wait til I win
Motherfucker, can't wait til I win
Wait til I'm in
