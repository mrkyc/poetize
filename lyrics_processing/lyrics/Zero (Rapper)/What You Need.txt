I ain't putting my foot in this game to break it
It's been a long way, coming out of my Mommas' basement
Got a long way to go before haters start to embrace it
It's the only route, I'm starting to doubt if I'll ever make it
I know the city getting with me
They ain't supporting, they still stopping to take a picture with me
Been on the porch for like an hour
I'm trying to write another record but evident that I'm better when they didn't get me
So I've been watching these rappers
And been on top of they dudes
I've seen them walking in circles
They've been watching me, too
So if they're getting to close
Tell them to watch for the shoes
Cause I don't need nobody stepping on my toes when I move
But you already know
That's just the way it goes
I've got to dumb it down, what?
I've got to say it slow?
Is there a certain point in fame when it's impossible to lay it low
Cause I'm just trying to get to that, I'm not ashamed to let you know

When them lights go on
And they call for your boy
And them curtains will drop
Yeah, they fall for your boy
So if I make a mistake
Don't drop the ball for your boy
I know some girls who'll give it all for your boy
I'm saying
You might also like
Cause I know I know that this ain't right
And I know you know that this ain't right
And I guess you weren't the one for me
And I can't give you everything you like
So tell me what you need (x2)
So tell me what you need, what you need, what you need
Tell me what you need, what you need, what you need

We had a talk about what we wanted accomplished
And neither of our goals were the same
You told me how excited you were, and ready for college
I told you that's the road I'm never going to take
I want this famous life
Cameras flashing, walking with a famous wife
And then you said you doubt it's going to happen for me
So I'mma take my life, devoted, and turn it to what I aim in life
And watch you tripping, cause you won't get half the story
I want that seven salary net worth
For me not to get it, I must be dead first
I'm catapulting towards it, going headfirst
Unless it's my family, I put this bread first
I still talk cocky like it's my best verse
I'm saying
I got this team behind me
They're the people that you've seen behind me
Breaking down with everyone I said I would
I got this need inside me, never keep my dreams inside me
Going out and getting everything I ever said I could
So when them lights go on
And they call for your boy
And them curtains will drop
Yeah, they fall for your boy
So if I make a mistake
Don't drop the ball for your boy
I know a couple girls who'll probably do it all for your boy
I'm saying

Cause I know I know that this ain't right
And I know you know that this ain't right
And I guess you weren't the one for me
And I can't give you everything you like
So tell me what you need (x2)
So tell me what you need, what you need, what you need
