These rappers, they don't understand me
Hoes, they just don't understand me
Bitches do not understand me
No you can not understand me
Rappers, they don't understand me
Hoes, they just don't understand me
Bitches do not understand me
No you can't understand me

You can never, ever, ever, ever understand me (x4)

Had money coming
Was fucking up the paper like I had more money coming
But I didn't have not a dollar to spend on promotion
In studio time, I made songs in the basement
Now I got songs that they're motherfucking favorites
And my motherfucking favorites
The flow is so sacred
And bitches never played me
That's just something they didn't do
They knew that the flow was the truth
They knew that one day I'd be making these moves
They knew that I'd get it and now that I'm starting to get it they through
Into my DM's like "I know you remember me from our school"
But shit, that ain't true
We weren't even cool
But we could still fuck, man
A million bitches hate me when I started my progression
Then they asked my why we never, ever kicked it
Don't got a single minute to be wasting on some bitches
If it ain't about us fucking, I ain't with it
I don't ever get committed, you tripping, fuck, is you kidding?
Explicit with all these writtens, I'm never gon' hold back
Staying on my pivot, that shit is a given
Let someone to tell you that this shit isn't easy to hold rap
Hold that, I got bars for days
I'm about to raise the bar a whole bar away
You couldn't keep up with me if I start tomorrow
And you start today, I mean
Sad shit but it's real
Bad bitch in some heels
Ass, tits in the real
Got mad sex appeal
She'd give it half of the wheel, you don't understand me

These rappers, they don't understand me
Hoes, they just don't understand me
Bitches do not understand me
No you can not understand me
Rappers, they don't understand me
Hoes, they just don't understand me
Bitches do not understand me
No you can't understand me

You can never, ever, ever, ever understand me (x4)

Had money coming
I thought I was balling from features, but shit it was nothing
My man told me: "Fuck it, spend it while you're a youngin'
Shit, why you bugging?
You're about to get a deal and be richer than you ever wanted
I don't promise for nothing
Low bro, that's a hundred"
You never gon' break so many balls and put it all in their face
Me and Sweenz eating lobster and steak
Got a lot on my plate
And it's figurative and literal bragging, in case you didn't know
Working since a motherfucker turned to double digital
I've been writing this digital, trying to make reciprocals
Of Dr. Dre, whether May weather intervals
Bitches throw it to me like a given
Gonna fucking run, I'm bout to find out why they saying fold
So I break that down, I'm in a steakout now
I break bank with my brother, Ty, then take that out
We on a flight right now
Bout to land in Cali, trying to find some extra pussy after I perform with them stage lights out
I'm the man out here
Got no plan out here
Looking white as fuck to all these other people with they're tan, out here
But the bitches love me, thinking like I stand out here, man
How's it feel to be a motherfucker like you?
Knowing you could never be somebody like me
I've been balling, this the twenty-fifth hour like
Spiked lean, knock them out, Ali, think I might, gee
Said he mobbing, bitch, I might be, got your wifey
All up on my line saying: "Bite me"
Trying to be the other man
Throwing dollars in my rubber bands
I'll be broke before tomorrow, but just fuck it
