And all I ever wanted was a crown
Gold around my neck and put my feet up on the ground
And all I ever wanted turned to everything I needed
Now I got no fucking way to put it down

Yeah (x4)
And I can't put it down

And I can't put it down
I've been moving here without a single sound
You can't swim up in this water, bet you drown
We can tell you don't belong and get from round

I've been fucking with these bitches
I get caught up way too much
I ain't called you in a minute
I should probably say: "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go on tour with Futuristic in a month
Now these hoes be acting different
I feel I should say: "What's up?"
Cause they talk a lot, but don't say shit
I run tracks here, and relay shit
Tell the West Coast from my basement
For my future, I go ape shit
Better yet I go Nate Smith
You ain't from here? Then don't claim shit
I got hits, motherfucker
Me and Andrew Meoray
You might also like
And all I ever wanted was a crown
Gold around my neck and put my feet up on the ground
And all I ever wanted turned to everything I needed
Now I got no fucking way to put it down

Yeah (x4)
And I can't put it down

I'm here to do what really nobody else tried
Me and my crew pull up, you would think our belt's high
I ain't really too concerned 'bout the hand they dealt
I know it's sink or swim but I've been feeling like that Phelps guy
Crazy how they slept on me, kind of like a futon
Now these labels trying to give me deals like a Groupon
I'm a dog, I'm a beast
Blowing up the Middle East
And my verses kill it every time, that's word to the deceased

Who's the top, one of us standing?
Top shots and we're landing
Ain't asking for it, we demand it
Taking over shit and expanding
New school, I can't stand this
Our torch, they won't hand us
Y'all art form has been damaged, I put holes all over your canvas, bitch
And all I ever wanted was a crown
Gold around my neck and put my feet up on the ground
And all I ever wanted turned to everything I needed
Now I got no fucking way to put it down

Yeah (x4)
And I can't put it down

Run it up and don't talk
My dawgs here, they don't bark
Got Jimmy here, he holds spark
Better watch your back when you walk
We don't fight fair, there ain't a fight there
Who the fuck you think that we are?
Don't play dumb, you want to play some?
We'll end it right there, where it starts
I've got a long list of my sins written
And I've been getting my shit off
But a motherfucker want to pop shit
And it keeps making my list long
And they way you talk, it all sits wrong
Philly scene is so fucked up
One of us should go lock up
It makes it too hard to go and get it off
But we settle that
Take it first, get that medal back
Born insane with a Devil's mask
Put your body where the pedals at
Understand I'm more leveled at
All this rap, I need several stacks
You must forgot, like you're mental ex
I'm the best, you can tell I'm that, motherfucker
And all I ever wanted was a crown
Gold around my neck and put my feet up on the ground
And all I ever wanted turned to everything I needed
Now I got no fucking way to put it down

Yeah (x4)
