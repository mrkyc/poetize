Gotta' be the one to put us on 'cause I ain't waiting for nobody else to make it
Breaking through the game and I don't want the fame but if the money comes with being famous
I might have to take it
Please don't tell me when you read my face and I won't have complaints
I never been complacent when this shit procastin'
I don't do no third or fucking second places, oh god!
Te-, tel-, Tell me what's happening
You ain't liking the fact that I'm back again
And I'm godly as fuck cause you live at the Vatican
No other rapper is matching this
Lotta' talking, lotta' checks from lotta bums and lotta' necks
And see your conversation when you bring my name to death or lotta' flexing
I don't do no change and I ain't never change up
I need only one
Take you out with just a single shot
I guess that you can call that shit a hole in one
If you got the money better show me something
You need my name up on the dotted line
Then you dont know me some
Better hold me son
Cause I got shit to do
If you ain't talking bid'ness then this shit is through
I gotta go because
You might also likeI work a lot
Earned my spot to get a certain drop on how these rappers move
You never heard a lot real rap
I felt like I shouldn't merge to pop
But I ain't get no buzz back
The fuck's that
Six points to the run back
You won't smoke but you know don't want that
Dont give a single fuck about the way your gun clacks
And more woah hoe rows than a ten toes down
On floor selling Em shows out
Get dough when the pen goes down
Bend those routes and extens those droughts
Set fire to the booth or something
Cause the truth is nothing to the dudes who frontin'
'Less star wars and the chosen buster
Kooks from Russia know that I'm newly comin
Rain league let the rain speak and replace big
Cause I make ether
Make way for the main teachers
Who pay features and break meters
Of all sorts no way can the game leave us, nah
On track for the number one
The most skilled no fellings from them other ones
Got no chill, no deal that is done
One hundred percent of my favor better not become
An enemy, sending me every single chance to break
Ima break through ima change your hands to make muse or make moves
Ima take a chance to stake your fans
No way can this stay in their hands
I'm in the best shape
No way you can stop me
The best rapper in the states
You can't top me
Got this money in L.A. feeling cocky
No one in this age had forgot me
Too complex lets do this stress again
Use your chest I'm proving threats a sin
Lose your best your choosing set of care
Me or any dooer can't pretend
That you don't ever ever wanna bear
Truth of me cause I won't wanna end
Any chance to get the upper hand
