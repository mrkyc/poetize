If we don't feel like y'all do, that's probably cause we winning
We stepping to the finish, you stepping to start beginning
We take em' by the neck, and string em out like violinists
We fucking vicious, you bitches ain't shit to the demolitions, Ahh
You ain't heard about the team though?
On point from the 3, screaming "Fuck a free-throw"
I could have your shorty on me practicing the Tebow
Run it like Debo, or D-Lo, yeah we know!
Its L6, and its OBH
Don't you speak up in our presence cause you know we hate
I got my Philly brothers with me, if you passing through the city
Keep that "Trinidad James" cause you "Don't Be S.A.F.E"
(It's that easy!)
To get your life wrapped up
We put em 6 feet deep, and dig em right back up
These mufuckas start a war, i pass it off to razor
Cause we body y'all for trynna bring that hype back up
Motherfucker

George Bush to this shit, i bomb everything
Ain't doing nothing on the fly, time everything
Time is money, you could be a minute late
Watching everybody eat, stuck with an empty plate
You stumbling in the race
I keep a couple shots
Since you wanna dick eat, i'm dumping it in your face
We could clip up, and ride nigga its nothing
My niggas is coming, yall niggas is bluffing
Me and Raz, 3 fine chicks and we fucking
2 bricks on the stove, 5 chickens we plucking
It's not a game, its an OBH thing yall
I put the gloves on, i ain't trynna swing dog

Have a man stingy tucked, fuck nigga what?!
You can fake it like you ready to die
I'll make it happen you ain't ready to try
OBH!

Team tight, we don't fuck around with loose lips
Fuck 2 Chainz, we got 2 clips

Got this money coming now, got my buzz off the ground
Got my shit sky high, and these haters got a frown
Fuck y'all though!
I ain't hard to find, I ain't waldo
More money brings more bills, auto
Ride so hard, you don't ball like Pargo
Strap in the trunk and my hip i pull the car load

Ain't a nigga breathing taking me off!
Imma ride till im gone, and i promise imma kill every song
