You're not the only one
Not the only one
And you say you want to run
You're not the only one
Not the only one
You will never get over me
I'll never get under you
Whenever our voices speak
It's never our minds that meet
You'll never get over me
I'll never get under you
Whenever our voices speak
It's never our minds that meet
You say you want some
You're not the only one
Not the only one
And you, you say you've come undone
You're not the only one
Not the only one
