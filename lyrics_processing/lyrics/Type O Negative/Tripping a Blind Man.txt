Say the word, and I'll be healed
Opened eyes, grease my wheels
Since my vision's been restored
Trip me once, shame on you
Trip me twice, I'm the fool
Though it's hidden, I've been cured

Patience is divine
But the virtue is not mine
Turn your cheek, gets ripped off
That's why God gave you four

This is how you spend life
Amused by another's strife
Makes me so sad and confused
Someone's pain, your leisure
Can't explain sick pleasure
I'm so glad I'm not you

Patience is divine
But the virtue is not mine
Turn your cheek, gets ripped off
That's why we're given four
You might also like
Throwing wrenches gave a false sense of power
What started sweet will soon turn sour
Oh so sour, yeah
You think it's your place to dispense justice
Well, I've been sent to judge the judges
You've done well, so well

Goddamn love 'cause it's breaking my heart
And if I had one wish
I'd see in the dark

Tripping a blind man
So easy to do
Tripping a blind man
Why can't it be you?

You want to play God and I know you will
If that's the case
I'll be the devil
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Now who the fuck are you to discipline me?
Innocence condemned
By the guilty
Oh no
Goddamn love 'cause it's breaking my heart
And if I had one wish, I'd see in the dark

Tripping a blind man
So easy to do
Tripping a blind man
Why can't it be you?

Losing grip on his seeing-eye dog's spikey collar
Panicking, the startled pet ran to the street
Sanitation truck skidding, unable to stop
Shoveled up what was left of his canine spot
Canine spot
As they left, the ground turned muddy crimson
"Where's my mutt?" the victim requested
EMS responded, "He had to say bye"
Teary-eyed, the old man cried, then died, he died
Died, died, died, died, died, died

Patience is divine
But the virtue is not mine
Turn your cheek, gets ripped off
That's why we're given four
Patience is divine
But the virtue is not mine
