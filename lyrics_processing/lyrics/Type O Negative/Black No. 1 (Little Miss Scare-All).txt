I went looking for trouble
And boy, I found her

She's in love with herself, she likes the dark
And on her milk-white neck: The Devil's mark
Now it's All Hallows Eve, the moon is full
But will she trick or treat? I bet she will
She will!
Happy Halloween, baby

She's got a date at midnight with Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster ain't got nothing on you
Well, when I called her evil she just laughed
Well, cast that spell on me, boo bitch-craft

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one
You might also like
Little wolf-skin boots and clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral for which she's dressed
Her perfume smells like burning leaves
Every day is Halloween

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)

Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Sacre bleu!

Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like fucking the dead

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one, ooh yeah)


Black, black, black, black number one
