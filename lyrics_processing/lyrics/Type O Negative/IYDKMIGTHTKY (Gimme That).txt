It's been doing some thinking
It felt fair that she should know
All actions in which partake
Are far beyond its control
Whether it was born or bred
(Genetic, environment)
I wouldn't bother to ask it why
Simply concentrate on when, when

Making plans but it won't tell
So longs to hear her final words:
"I brought this on myself"
The theory of futility
Now you'll learn, so be prepared

I'm going to have to kill you
You-who
If you don't kill me
I'm going to have to kill you
You-who

Crawl into line and wait your turn (Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)
Remember Jesus slaves (Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)
Department of Probation: (Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)

Held therefore unaccountable (Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)
Since it's clinically insane (Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)
What a shame again" (Gimme)
If you don't kill me

I'm going to have to kill you
You-who, you-who, you

Your choice, not mine
You must decide
