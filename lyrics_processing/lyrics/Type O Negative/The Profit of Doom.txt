Goodbye cruel world

Of this shape, a star of five
Also applies to the one with six sides
Against the sun and against the moon
I warn you that these two combined
Will be man's doom
Of ten horns and seven heads
Count your fingers and the continents
On your head or in your right hand
This new moral code that the media commands

Believe not in their clever words
Because faith enacted are the loudest heard
All these things I say are true
Understood sadly by a chosen few, you

April 2-0-2-9
The final time
The end, my friend, is not near
The hour, in fact is quite here
When the moon becomes red to guide the risen dead
This means God's turned his back on you
It's a Friday the 13th, of course you won't live to see noon
You might also like
I am
A prophet of doom
I am
The profit of doom

So now the star has fallen
Washing away the seas
The seventh seal now opened
It's raining your fears
Are you paranoid the coming asteroid
Has got your name tattooed on it?
This stone's called Apophis
It brings apocalypse

I am
A prophet of doom
I am
The profit of doom

Speak the name of He created thee all to be which should not be spoken
No laws broken
Now light and love
The stars above which fall upon thee all that worship the beast
Influence ceased
My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire

My faith is an ember, burning ever
Working towards a greater reward
Serving my lord
Built his home upon the rock
Not of the flock, but coming as a shepherd
Guarding his herd

My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire

My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire
My soul's on fire
