Hey, check, one, two, what it do?
She say she lookin' for love
I told her it's on the cart
I told her Cupid was dead
That nigga dearly departed
I seen the casket, it's true
I left that nigga some markets
I need to go see your hizzle
Take me to ours, I'm heartless
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
I went and bought me some ball cleats
The one when he played in the 'lympics
They put 'em back on the market
I am a star, I am a star
Tell that bitch, "Roll out the carpet."
Pull up that foreign and park it
I do not shop at no Target
I went to bed and sex
I woke up in Neiman Marcus
Designer got me dressed to kill
I'm turnin' niggas to 
I am a thug when corporate
Trappin' like I'm in a office
Watchin' my back for them snakes
They on my Guccis when I'm walkin'
Dead, stick 'em in a coffin
Sippin' codeine like I'm coughin'
I ain't sick, I'm just sleepin'
I'm on the beat pillow talkin'
This is the life, married
Money, now the bitch is my wife
Signed up, bringed up, now she want a divorce
Caught me cheatin' with my hand on the mic
Yuh

Yuh
She say she want a commitment
I told her, "I ain't got the time."
She say it's a Roley, I say it's a watch
I bought that bitch for the shine
I'm concentratin' on the money
That's all I got on my mind
For all them days I was broke
That's why I got on my grind
Gotta get paid, gotta get paid
Everyday Friday, I feel like Greg
I'm low on carbs, I need some bread
Chasin' that paper, work on my legs
Like I'm in the gym, liftin' them weights
I gotta eat, fix me a plate
Make sure it's , plus I'm from Houston
Where that old wine? Fix me a steak
Bitch, it be leanin', bitch, it be leanin'
That my excuse if I was late
I'm makin' money, I don't make mistakes
I ain't a stripper, but I make it shake
Fans like Ricky Bobby, shake and bake
I take that , make some cake
Flip it and put some diamonds in your face
Shinin' just like the roof up in the wraith
