Ha-ha made it ma, top of the world nigga ha
I hear these bullshit ass raps, y'all calling hip-hop nigga
And I must say, I am not impressed one bit nigga
Nope, let's get to bidness though Killa hey

I'm a heat maker, no not a beat maker
I write fire do you get it, I'm a heat maker
I'm a grinder not a binder, but I keep paper
That's why them freaks chase us, we turn em to skeet tasters
I'll skeet taste ya, but not a whole lot
So don't confuse Killa for a trick, I give a hoe not
Zip zero, stingy with that dinero
Say it ain't my demeanor, I'ma leave that up to FEMA nigga
I'm a heat maker, no not a beat maker
I write fire, do you get it, I'm a heat maker
I'm a grinder not a binder, but I keep paper
That's why them freaks chase us, we turn em to skeet tasters
I'll skeet taste ya, but not a whole lot
So don't confuse Killa for a trick, I give a hoe not
Zip zero, stingy with that dinero
Say it ain't my demeanor, I'm leave that up to FEMA nigga
I do the beats, like Ike treat Tina
So I do a bitch bad, and treat a nigga worse than that
Step up your verses black, get on my level hater
But you gon need a staircase, and two elevators
I keep some'ing on my waist, that'll levitate ya
And decapitate ya, want me to demonstrate ya
When that Glock nine, give you a facer
Straight shot to your dome, like Patron with no chaser man
