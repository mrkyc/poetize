Yuh
Check, one, two, what it do?

Ain't no Cinderella story
Ain't no glass slippers here
Ain't no knight in shinin' armor
Just they dad livin' here
Ain't no Prince Charmin' 'bout to come around
And take my girls out the po' house
You don't need his castle, Daddy built your own
Tell them suckers, bet they know now

They tellin' fairy tales very well
Manipulatin' girls with the bullshit
Mark Twain, even King James version
Lyin' to 'em in the pulpit
Make makin' women look dependin'
Need it like they need a prisoner itself
Glass slippers ain't gon' change the way you look
Baby girl, you need help
Ba-barely women like they mascots
Fake hair, titties, ass shots
Waist trainers 'bout to pass out
To look the part, she'll cash out
They playin' off your insecurities
It's affecting the maturity
Mama thottin', daddy wasn't 'round
So she run to niggas for security
Mama told me, "Niggas ain't shit"
'Cause she never can or could find one
Thirty-five, daughter eighteen
With a grandkid, nigga, I'm done
Kings need to make queens
Them the facts I know, nigga, I'm one
Matter fact I'm '83
And a king that was my son

Ain't no Cinderella story

Yuh
Ri gave me my oldest
Vicki gave a nigga Cupcake
Care gave a nigga Cayden
Them the reasons why I'm up late
Brooke gave a nigga Austin
But Daddy baby up in heaven
Think about my son daily
Night and day, and I regret it
God sent another blessin'
Matter fact, he sent me two
Took away a nigga stressin'
But I'm still missin' you
Hate the world they growin' up in
It's gettin' bad, shit lookin' fucked up
Young niggas gettin' shot down
By the police 'fore they cupped up
Li'l girls goin' fire, strippin'
Any hoes tell me what's the focus
Kim K's and Amber Roses
Just some hoes, where the Oprahs?
Food for thought, this some okra
Lookin' bad, shit hopeless
Queen of clubs, played her cards wrong
For the night life, she a joker
Baby could have been a broker
Sellin' stocks, streets broke her
Not the dentist, anything other than
A hoe strippin' off his 
I guess the money what provoked her
Sellin' pussy for some tokens
'Til them four letters came into her life
Bein' sick, shit woke her
Ain't no Cinderella story
Ain't no glass slippers here
Ain't no knight in shinin' armor
Just they dad livin' here
Ain't no Prince Charmin' 'bout to come around
And take my girls out the po' house
You don't need his castle, Daddy built your own
Tell them suckers, bet they know now
Ain't no Cinderella story
Ain't no glass slippers here
Ain't no knight in shinin' armor
Just they dad livin' here
Ain't no Prince Charmin' 'bout to come around
And take my girls out the po' house
You don't need his castle, Daddy built your own
