Life
I wonder, will it take me under?
Check, one, two, what it do?
Let's go

Now, who do you turn to when the love is all gone
When all the bridges been burned through
And the road feels so long?
The bruises, I've earned a few
But I know I've got to stay strong
So, tell me, who do you turn to
When the love is all gone?

Yuh
Check, one, two, what it do?
Fifteen, situation got her actin' grown
Home alone, daddy dead, and her mama gone
She too busy doin' her, she ain't got time for
Nobody got her back, plus she ain't got no spine for
Eviction notice, empty fridge, so she missin' food
Baby brothers got no sitter so she missin' school
So she the mama, daddy, sister, and the caregiver
Mama too busy in them streets, so she don't care, nigga
Mama got a boyfriend, but he a fuck nigga
When mama sleep a night around, he try to fuck wit' her
Now she gotta protect herself, she under mo' pressure
That only add to her problems, makin' it more stressful
Told her mama, and her mama accused her of lyin'
Later confronted him about it, she knew he'd deny it
'Til one day she said she no longer could look at life
Got a gun, turned it on herself, and then she took her life

Who do you turn to when the love is all gone
When all the bridges been burned through
And the road feels so long?
The bruises, I've earned a few
But I know I've got to stay strong
So, tell me, who do you turn to
When the love is all gone?

She hate reality but love them reality shows
Audition a couple times, but didn't go, I suppose
Even shot to Hollywood for a couple roles
Then cut her ass so she can look like Amber Rose
Mama died when she was 12, but now she 21
Left her some bread, a couple thousand, I think 21
Family stressin', what she left her was her college fund
But she decided to get her titties and ass done
Smart girl could be in college gettin' her grind on
But her obsession with these stars got her mind gone
Hollywood flop, now she broke, stuck trippin', school
And work ain't a option, now she tryin' her luck strippin'
Got her prostitutin', sellin' ass, suckin' dick
Funny how that fast life took her quick
Caught up in a life she wasn't ready for
That's the one she chose, but ain't the one she gotta settle for (Settle for)
Damn, baby girl
Who do you turn to when the love is all gone
When all the bridges been burned through
And the road feels so long?
The bruises, I've earned a few
But I know I've got to stay strong
So, tell me, who do you turn to
