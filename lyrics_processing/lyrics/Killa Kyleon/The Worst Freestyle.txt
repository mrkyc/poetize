Run It
Looking At Your Instagram Shocked
But I Can't Be To Surprised
I Should've Known You Was A Thot
That The Consequences You Suffer
Fucking With A Bop
You Should Work For UPS
As Much As You Giving The Box
Take A Look The Pudding?
You Get Proof
When You See The True Colors
You Get Truth
Thats A Hard Pill To Swallow
With No Juice
You Just A Liability Baby
So What The Use
Women Thou Art Loose
You Ain't Had Your Folks In life
That's Your Excuse
A Couple Dollars , New Boots
Got You Giving Up The Cooch
Different Nigga Everyday
Hoppin In And Out Coups
Freak In The Streets Not The Sheets
How That Sound
I Was Thought That's The Other Way Around
But We Get On Our Knees
And Still Praise Em
Put On That Suit And That Cape
And Still Save Em
Yeah
I'm Guilty Of That Behavior
Chasing Hoes Womanizing
Been Through Those Phases
Splurging Tippin Strippers
Throwing Money On Stages
I've Had That Addiction
I Testify Its Contagions
So I Fished In That Trash
And Got Litter
Didn't Realize What I Have
Until I Hit Her
That's Suicide Without Pulling The Trigger
And WhatChu Get For Thinking With Your Dick Being A Nigga
I Don't Need You
I Don't Need You
I Don't Need You
I Don't Need You
But I Want You
I Don't Mean To
I Don't Mean To
I Don't Mean To
I Don't Mean To
But I Love You
Run It
I Ain't Ready For Good-Bye
So You Can Keep That
I Tried To Make It Last Forever
Damn Keith Sweat
Now I'm Drowning In My Sorrow And My Regrets
I Gotta Go Through Hell
Just To Get Too Heaven
Devils Reject
You Was Bonnie
I Was Clyde
Until The Wheels Fell Off
I Knew That We Would Ride
I Made A Few Mistakes
You Wouldn't Let Em Slide
Now I'm All Alone
Swallowing Patron Like Pride
Good Girl Gone Bad
Scorn Woman Tied
Her Happy Face Fake
She Wear It Like A Disguise
Text Messages In Paragraph
Waiting For Reply's
Mourning Over My Lost
But Ain't Nobody Died
Hi's Turn To Goodbye's
I Got Myself To Blame
Now You Got Hate In Your Heart
I Can't Accept The Change
Through Out My Sunny Days
I Didn't Expect The Rain
Yeah I Put You Through It
But I'm Selfish I Can't Accept The Pain
