Hello, Good morning, America
I'm in love with the view, I just see a bunch of money like a hustler do
Do the same thing if you're a hustle of to
Scared money make none and you're looking like boo
Brokes not a style I ain't looking like you
But to them bad bitches I'm looking like owee
My whips a new born the rims is 22
I gotta bad bitch with me, yeah she's 22
Addicted to the fast life I got expensive taste
I'm on a cloud higher than my interest rate
Stacks steady growing fast like a inch a day
I'm a hustler I know what you need
I can get you straight, everybody's eating over here
Homie fix a plate... I'm offering you cooking
But I ain't fix and steak
I'm sitting here getting rich in the hood
What broke nigga told you all money ain't good
We're living the lifestyle of rich and famous
Money, cars, clothes, diamonds
I just wanna live rich or die trying
My hustle never let's me down
I'm not... to the fans and life of the flash and lights
I'm... kind in, I just wanna live it rich or die trying
My hustle never let's me down
Hey, everything look better from the top floor
Even the bitches look better when you got doe
Body like a Maserati quadtro
I just beat the pussy up like a macho
And like a Cosco, I'm selling everything
Watching my back for the niggas tellin everything
When you're getting... so launched like a...
Can't get an...
25... I go get it run the clock
As long as the make... the shit don't stop
I'm just shooting for the number one,..
The haters wanna block my shut like my...
You can't catch me like in the mix like gambo
Never sleeping 'cause I'm strep like a gancho
Yeah, I keep that heat on me, pancho
'Cause niggers ain't to see me eating...
We're living the lifestyle of rich and famous
Money, cars, clothes, diamonds
I just wanna live rich or die trying
My hustle never let's me down
I'm not... to the fans and life of the flash and lights
I'm... kind in, I just wanna live it rich or die trying
