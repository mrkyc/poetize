Uh, yeah
Pullin' the gat too long
Crazy, floor on my head
Scotty, you goin' too strong
They wanna ask you why
Never to X us out
I got a stone for a heart
Waitin' to prove me wrong
Feelin' uncomfortable
Who do I turn to when
That is on the creep
Now we hardly speak
Now, Mizaka was my boy
Now we can't even stand and chatter
We been boys and we were stackin' hunnid copper
Now ya two cent got me too bent
I was too cool, nigga, too slick
On my two feet, nigga, too lit
Nigga lied to me, got me too ripped
But forever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Smokin' good weed
Rollin' wood and leather
I'm M-L-K with the shit
In the old school with my nigga Killa
Yeah, uh

Yuh
Check, one, two, what it do?
Swingin' the caddy coupe
Candy without the roof
Watchin' my back for laws
Said if I stop, he shoot
Hate that I'm black and proud
Smell like a pack of loud
Now he got probable cause
Whippin' his Magnum out
Mad that I'm ridin' clean
Wish I was ridin' dirty
I ain't chameleon now
Close to a million now
Niggas with attitudes
"Fuck the police" and shit
Feel like I'm Dre and Cube
Tell 'em to eat my dick
They killin' us for sport
Lookin' like we some deal
Niggas die every day
Used to be once a year
This lookin' like the Sixties
Car lookin' like the Eighties
They wanna see me dead
I wanna feed my babies
Tryna get out the hood
Don't wanna see me win
They wanna see me lose
That ain't the life I choose
I'm tryna eat some food
They wanna see me starved
I ain't gonna let that happen
I'm takin' them to war
Yuh
I just really wanna know
In my life
I just wanna know, God
Will I ever see the dream
Will a nigga have some mo' money in these streets?
In the mind of a king?
I just really wanna know
Ain't no hope for the real niggas, my nigga
In my life
So, by any means necessary, we gon' do what the fuck we gotta do, go get some money
Will I ever see the dream
In the mind of a king?'
Check, one, two, what it do?
