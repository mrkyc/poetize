I thought of this when leaning in my Cadillac
Smoking on me some kush to clear up my cataract
Dead End, South Park, Southside, habitat
Looking for some trouble, get your issue, we ain't having that
Candy on them Cadillacs, where them 4s? We slabbin' that
Duece to baby mommma's in Maine you know we stabbin that
Wood wheel grabbin' that it guide the way
Stay strapped up on my back seat don't hide the K
Stash spots in  where I hide the yay
Obituary on my dash, homie died today
Pop my trunk so you can see me when I slide away
Pour up and taking sips while  pride away
Laid back on that leather feel like I'm on a sofa
Checkin' all of my mirrors, in case a hater approaches
Get sprayed, keep raid, I'm on alert for the roaches
It's a must to keep it player when in the presence of coaches
I'm coasting, chilling feeling like I'm in the 
Call it the love potion, stay pulling bitches like it's a tug pole
Clean like a love song, so whipe it with my shammy
Getting to the bread, like moons over my hammy
Keep heat like Maimi, 'Bron, Wade, and Bosh, it's hot
So I hit a button and I laid the top
Life's like a box of chocolate never know what you get
Till I'm in that slab sitting shotgun with your bitch
You might also like
Roll up like fruit Coupe, looking like fruit juice
Kevin Bacon kush so I'm coughing them up on my foot loose
Deuce Bigalow in my beverage, lettuce and broccoli
Over flowing my pockets, so boppers wanna climb on top of me

Like K2 Killa Kyleon do you get it bitch
Are you illiterate, you're not listening to a lyricist
Two cup kill when I toast my drank
I'm gonna sip until the day I overdose on drank
Sippin' my pineapple Fanta,  smoking my Christmas trees
You could call me Bad Santa, bad manners, shitting on the beat
Can't make it to the toilet, diarrhea, no pepto bismol
And I record it, bitch I go the hardest
And yall going  kill it I leave it heartless
I'm fucking up the game bad cartridge
Slabs? Yall hoops, yall might as well park it
You crippled niggas couldn't walk a mile in my Barkley's
Paint so wet I'm on these butter seats snorkeling
Woman on my grill got her looking like a sharp-man
Candy  dog, trunk popped barking
Killing scenes, just put up the yellow they been jocking
