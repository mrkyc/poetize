One more semester left
She ain't gotta trip
She gon' get a job
She ain't gotta strip
Plus she got a brain, that means she got a gift
Gotta walk to class, she ain't got a whip
But God got her, that means she got a lift (Lift)
Her mind made up, she gon' be blessed
And be successful 'cause she prayed up
All them sleepless nights grindin' 'cause she stayed up
Soon as she walk across that stage it done payed up
That's what ambition get you
The benefits of beneficial actions
Get it yourself without you even askin'
LOL from all your dollars, you the last laughin' (Laughin')
Made it through that road successfully without the traffic
You knew not to question God so you forgot to ask him
For help through hard times and struggles
'Cause you knew you'd pass it
That's what ambition get you (Get you)
Strong black woman, yeah, she focused
Strong black woman like she Oprah
Never gave up when she goin' through the motions
When life threw her lemons, she made lemonade potent (Potent)
I know times changed and got you frustrated
But here's a song to let you know you are appreciated

Hey
Two kids, single mother, you ain't cry 'bout it
Knew you wasn't perfect, you ain't lie about it
Did everything you could to secure your home
Kept God first, you wasn't alone (Lone)
Daddy wasn't around, but you filled the void
You made men outta lil boys
Taught us everything that a man didn't
Bought us everything that a man didn't
"Superwoman" ain't just a song that Karyn White wrote (Wrote)
I been around Superwoman all my life, bro (Bro)
And she was Superwoman to her kids, nigga
I ain't gotta watch the show because I lived wit' her (Lived wit' her)
It's only right that she get acknowledged
Thirty years later then she went to college
That degree, she finally got it
Ain't no doubt about it: She a strong black woman
