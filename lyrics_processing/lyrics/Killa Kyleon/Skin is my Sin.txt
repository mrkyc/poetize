Hey, check, one, two, what it do?
They say a change gon' come, but I'm still waitin'
Gave 'em my two cents, but I'm impatient
Politicians only add to the frustration
Ain't helpin' so we help us, nigga, fuck waitin'
Called the laws, but for what? Ain't shit stop
Pull us over, go to jail, or we get shot
Don't even ask, yeah I mind, I ain't gettin' out
Here my license and insurance, nigga, kick rocks
It's all because I'm a nigga, it's all because I'm a nigga
That's why you scared, nervous so you pull the trigger
On camera, now we got an issue
Drivin' while black is my beef with the system
They tried to warn us but we didn't listen
Kaepernick said he ain't stand so they trippin'
I don't understand, what's the point that I'm missin'?
They tryna make me accept they conditions
God bless America, say that they Christian
White versus black, they just hate that we different
Obama in office, it don't make a difference
H.N.I.C, fuck him, he a nigga
What's crazy he black and he in position
But they actin' like he ain't influential
Crackas hate us, they ain't bein' sentimental
Fuck 'em

They say my skin is my skin
They say my skin is my skin
God, could you help us?
Feel like I'm never gon' win
Man, will this shit ever end?
When will it stop?
Can't understand why they hate us
Kill us to go meet our maker
Just 'cause I'm black
Color my face with no makeup
Can't understand why they hate us

They puttin' Donald Trump in the office
Like, we ain't never seen Donald Trump in an office
I'm tired of seein' young black men in a coffin
No charge and no offenses, life what it cost them
Ain't shit change, and I'm getting exhausted
This ain't work, and you're horrible bosses
Outlined in chalk and surrounded by cases
They openly racist, I'm tryna escape it
Caught in a matrix, a victim of hatred
I'm numb to the bullshit, but I ain't complacent
Knowin' I can't, but I'm tryna take it
I can't accept it, I won't let 'em make it
I see they sleep, but I'm tryna wake 'em
I see they demons, I'm tryna shake 'em
I keep it real, I ain't tryna fake 'em
They don't get the point, but I'm tryna make 'em
Look at the news, they just tellin' us lies
Killin' us dead, but ain't tellin' us why
The government, police, they all in disguise
Devils stay busy, but I ain't surprised
'Til my dead demise, do what I got to survive
It's been that way since the Sixties, Forties and Fifties
Thirties and Twenties, no mystery
This black American history
They say my skin is my skin
They say my skin is my skin
God, could you help us?
Feel like I'm never gon' win
Man, will this shit ever end?
When will it stop?
Can't understand why they hate us
Kill us to go meet our maker
Just 'cause I'm black
Color my face with no makeup
Can't understand why they hate us
They say my skin is my skin
They say my skin is my skin
God, could you help us?
Feel like I'm never gon' win
Man, will this shit ever end?
When will it stop?
Can't understand why they hate us
Kill us to go meet our maker
Just 'cause I'm black
Color my face with no makeup
