I'm just a ghetto experiment
I'm just a ghetto experiment
I'm just a ghetto experiment

Yuh
The ghetto my hood, not understanding' why it's glorified
Livin' conditions got us horrified
Kids used to play, now they don't go outside
Quick to be victims of a homicide
Too many deaths, too many mamas cryin'
Man, it's a blessin' sayin' I'm alive
Not sure if I'ma live or I'ma die
Prayin' I make it out, but I'ma try
Used to be focused on what I'ma buy
Bein' a nigga not prioritized
Seen so much talent throw his life away because of dope
Seen niggas make somethin' from nothin' on that same note
Different strokes with different folks
They both a chance that you takin' just to survive
And have a better life, the plan we was makin'
Either way it's a dice roll, you're gamblin'
Even that beats scramblin', you're either damagin'
Or hit a lick, take care your family
The streets are Grambling, you got options, nigga
Jail, death, or self the only thing that's gon' stop a nigga
Or pride, so be mindful of that time on your watches, nigga
You in the driver's seat, get off your ass, get it poppin', nigga
Your life in your hands, so don't be clumsy and drop it, nigga
Floodlights on the gram gon' turn that shit to a private, nigga
Can't settle for losses, I concentrate on my wins
Fuck all that stress and frustration, I take that out on my pen
They wanna see us locked up, I got too many that's in
I'm tryna help 'em get out, too many family friends
Incarcerated with jersey numbers like they on a team
Put 'em to sleep like a dog, put four shots in us like lean
Feel like my country at war, I'm shellshocked as marines
Yeah, they might hate that we black, but look at us and see green
We just a private, they pocket watchin', we live off our means
We not in touch with reality, we too stuck in our dreams
Somebody shake 'em so we can wake 'em and realize the truth
They just gon' live for today, like fuck tomorrow, we through
Yeah, that's the youth (Yeah, that's the youth, yeah, that's the youth)

I just wanna Mary J. Blige the situation, no more drama (No more drama)
I'm just a young black king tryna get some zeroes and more commas (Zero, commas)
Tryna survive in these streets, I feel like I'm Tarzan in the jungle (in the jungle)
But ain't no change, just pain, my legs hurtin' 'cause I'm tryna run from it
Ohh

Gave us a day just to celebrate and congratulate 'em
Just to find out they why he assassinated
They take the truth and flip it, rewrite it, 'xaggerate it
Then they gave us a month, I ain't that fascinated
They killed Malcolm, they killed Medgar, they killed Emmett
They hung people, they bombed churches with kids in it
He shot nine, went to Burger King after mass killings
Just to know they rewardin' 'em such a bad feelin'
They say the devil's a lie but flip it, and say it's true
Trumpers with Hillary Clintons, look at the shit they do
Created laws with they pockets to take our fathers from us
Jealous, enslave us, we soldiers, sent us to war for nothin'
If you gon' fuck us, let me enjoy it, I never came
The times did, but y'all people won't ever change
They still got us in chains, locked, they scared of change
We still in pain, we goin' through it, our head in rain

I just wanna Mary J. Blige the situation, no more drama (No more drama)
I'm just a young black king tryna get some zeroes and more commas (Zero, commas)
Tryna survive in these streets, I feel like I'm Tarzan in the jungle (in the jungle)
But ain't no change, just pain, my legs hurtin' 'cause I'm tryna run from it
Ohh
No more drama (No more drama)
Zero
