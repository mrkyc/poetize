Look
Who a prophet? Who a king?
Who gon' stop us when we sing?
These are hymns that done stemmed down on us
Times ain't changed, we still slaves
Who gon' rock the boat?
Who gon' ride the wave?
They asked me not to vote
Let's put our money together
Stop braggin' the price of coke
Slave trade not just a professional sport
We comparin' niggas daily
I'm never hearin' white folks
Argue who the greatest
They just wanna cage us
Gave us the bible
Get a whoopin', hope it save us
Granny up in heaven, pray she feelin' what I'm sayin'
It's a slant every episode
Cry watchin' Facebook
Live as he died, hope this video never load
Daughter just 5, it's some things she will never know
As a black man, I'm just battlin' the devil do'
Ah, he gotta love me, oh Lord, he gotta love me
We dyin' in the streets or just chillin' at bible study
Man
You might also like
I love niggas
Street niggas, drug dealers
All the lost souls and the thug niggas
My G-D crip and blood niggas
Spend-his-last-dollar-on-bullshit-just-because niggas
Got it, want it, flaunt it, out-the-mud niggas
Rappin', trappin', hustlin', get-it-from-the-plug niggas

If you can read it, you can learn it
The hood on fire, yeah, we burnin'
Timmy Turner ain't the only nigga hot as a furnace
Smile on me, pistol packin', nobody got a permit
Yeah, that's how they make a nigga, that's how they raise a nigga
To throw away, untraceable, like drawin' on some paper, nigga
You can't be afraid in this dirty world
I was only afraid of a dirty girl
If she had the cooties, I was movin'
Get pulled over, and you pretty much was cruisin'
For a bruisin', they'll leave you with contusions
Switch the story up to make confusion
They'll do it to you, I seen it happen first-hand
They don't us to hold hands, they want us to fight like Conan
Where the love? Romance, they speed us up
Let's take our time and slow dance
But they don't give us no chance
So we breakin' in your crib, bro man
In your fridge, makin' sandwiches
Turkey, no ham, do anything for your fam
Black man, I'm in last place
Ain't shit changed, and I ain't had faith
Mind gone in a bad place, gettin' fucked over like a ass rape
Hung high from the tree limbs, gettin' previewed by the white folks
Locked up in the jail cell, no bell here 'cause of white dope
Prison wall just a plantation, here to make some new field niggas
Ward master, yeah, the man racist like his mind up how to kill niggas
Psychologically, time changed, no apology
Black president, that's poli-tricks, he a nigga too, no acknowledgin'
Instagram got us followin', ain't no leaders, weak sheep
Poppin' Ambi, boy, drinkin' codeine, gettin' leaned on, we sleep
Spendin' black dollars with the white folks, not the black folks, we cheap
Watchin' our shit deep bleed, 'til it's all gone, delete
Goose eggs in that red zone, just agony and defeat
Po', broken on welfare, killin' ourselves, we weak
Black man kill a black man, now the black man deceased
But a white man kill a black man, and the white man go free
Yuh

They wanna see niggas fold
Devil want these niggas' soul
Black Friday, if the price right, these niggas sold
Niggas kill a nigga, these niggas cold
Not knowin' they worth these niggas' gold
What happened to these niggas' goals?
These niggas told
Get caught, snitch, what happened to these niggas' code?
Ignorant niggas, yeah, they mind gone
Doin' whatever to get they grind on
Wrong, still kill other niggas to get they shine on
Skip heaven for hell and a jail cell
Take a number, 'cause the line long
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter
Fakin' it 'til they makin' it, but not-makin'-shit niggas
Kings treatin' our queens like hoes, they bitch niggas
Sell they souls for the cheap just to be rich
Niggas
