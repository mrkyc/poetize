Product of my environment
Niggas ain't workin' like they retirin'
Hungry, not eatin', but they ain't dietin'
Barely on his feet like they testin' him for sobriety
Law's killin' unarmed men, so now we ridin'
Lootin', dodgin' bullets, everybody shootin'
They ruthless, heartless, Devil I rebuked him
Baton Rouge, Dallas, that ain't far from Houston
Blue on black crime, we need a solution
What's the resolution?
Rewritin' history like we ain't make a contribution
Actin' like we stupid, racism
That's a disease worser than lupus
I do not understand
Got me quotin' Confucius, sweatin' niggas profusely
Niggas, usin' the word loosely
Lorraine Motel, the dream died, now it's useless
Cookin' up bullshit, spoon feedin' excuses
Ain't shit changed and we look elusive
Niggas

Let's have a toast for the real niggas
For all the house niggas and the field niggas
Take a shot for how these white folks deal with us
Remindin' us that we still niggas
Run, nigga, shoot, nigga
Protest, loot, nigga
Sing, nigga, rap, nigga
It's a trap, why you think they call it trap, nigga?
You might also like
They say a change gon' come so here my hundred dollars
How we marchin' with no one to follow?
That's my two cents, po' up my one, then swallow
Ain't no Malcoms, no mo' Dr. Kings
Them niggas sleep, woke up, forgot to dream
Searchin' for freedom that we never seen
I must've missed it when they let it ring
But camera phones recordin' murder scenes
Shot him in cold blood, no legal action
Just another nigga dead, he got a leave of absence
They make us suffer and they don't suffer the consequences
They cops killin' they cop killas, that's contradictin'
We black men and black women, shot niggas
They justifyin' with no justice, the plot thickens
Just get me out this hot kitchen 'cause they cookin' niggas
Bookin' niggas, need visitation to look at niggas
Life for a bullet, the Grim Reaper, he took it, nigga
Over the edge where they pushin' niggas
Fuckin' us quicker than some pussy, nigga

Let's have a toast for the real niggas
For all the house niggas and the field niggas
Take a shot for how these white folks deal with us
Remindin' us that we still niggas
Run, nigga, shoot, nigga
Protest, loot, nigga
Sing, nigga, rap, nigga
