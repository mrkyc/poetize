Write this shit so crazy my mothafuckin' hands need straight jackets homeboy
Yea! H-Town's best!
Killa!
Run it!

The game full of trash ass niggas
Fuck a booth, they should be rapping in trash bags nigga
Boosie locked up, I'm the last badass nigga
Bebe Kid on the beat, I'm a badass nigga
I hear the naysayers but I don't pay them no mind
My street credit great, why the fuck I need a cosign?
So I'mma shine on these pussy niggas 'til they go blind
And keep it real while you fake niggas do some more lying
He better than me? You high - go do some more lines
You know it's a wrap when the clock's saying showtime
Presidential Rollie, yellow gold day day
Time money, everyday payday, even today date
Hotter than a May date, that's the reason they hate
It's sick to they stomachs - what the fuck they ate?
Been the nicest in the city since The Grey Tape
And my flow so dope, I should wrap it in gray tape
Brick nigga, used to wrap bricks nigga
Now every line is cocaine, I rap bricks nigga
Diamonds in my chain, I can rap bitch nigga
They let Killa in the game, it's a wrap bitch nigga
That's a burrito, they ain't fucking with me no
I came to save the day - I'm the rap game hero
Wolverine, Texas, not the Michigan nigga
Pockets looking extra puffy like the Michelin nigga
Bad bitch, pretty face, ass ridiculous nigga
Nasty bitch - I call her black licorice nigga
I know they sick of me nigga, my presence got them throwin' up
(?) long as Uncle Muddy pourin' up
H-Town wordplay, flow like the Hudson River
Niggas can't fuck with me lyrically no discussion
I hush them, they can't touch him, barely (?)
You rap niggas just a bunch of clowns, Steven Carell
40 year old virgins, they ain't fucking with me
Killa got it covered, (?) fucking with me
Upperclassman, I done already graduated
