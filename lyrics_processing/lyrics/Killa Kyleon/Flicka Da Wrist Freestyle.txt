I need a doctor
I done fucked up my wrist 'round here playing with forks
Seen a hundred 'round here playing with chalk
VVS, they gon' play in the dark
Fuckin' with Killa, that's suicide
You done jumped in the water to play with a shark
I'm from the port, got a bad bitch out the car
Slab full of wood like an ark
Know what, nigga? I can show a nigga, way better than tell 'em
Chopper get to yelling if your loose lips get to snitching and telling
Don't got no love for no bitch
I don't think Cupid exists
Eyes on the prize cause I'm focused on rich
I'm 'bout my money like Mitch
Play with that check cause I just hit a lick
Contracted nigga, I play with them bricks just like Dwight at the line
Niggas that hate, I'ma play with his bitch
Beat up that ho like she mine
Watch full of diamonds, I can't see the time
I bought this bitch for the shine
Heart of a lion, y'all niggas pussy like cats
Real getting too hard to find, fake, I don't pay it mind
I am legend, nigga, real shit
I am legend, that's Will Smith
All these bitches on it, I should deal dick
I ain't got emotions, I don't feel shit
I'm the MVP, Steph Curry
Too much money, I don't get debt worried
Want King Johnny just to get my jewelry
'fore the bank open, I'ma get that early
Dez Bryant, I be catching plays
Tell the Pyrex we can catch a fade
Dick-riding rappers trying to catch a wave
I'm too busy balling, tell her check my page
I see 'em running them likes, got 'em all in my DMs
Nigga, better get his BM before I take a nigga bitch like Liam
Real nigga, street credit, I ain't got no limit like PM
I got the game doing life, tell 'em free my nigga CM
No seal, no deal, when I'm all going in, I ain't got no chill
Fuck that, 'bout to kill 'em, gon' write that will
What's that? Gotta get it, let me eat my meal
Just that, blue hundred my bitch cop that
Pussy whip out the money, everybody hush that
Be quiet, broke nigga, we done heard enough that
Plug late with the work, tell the nigga rush that
Flush that if the law's in my spot, I'm running
Fucking up a sack, tell the money I'm coming
Get a ride with the blue, get it running in my hand
Keep it one hundred, I be thumbing through a grand, understand?
I do
This ain't no verse, this a eulogy
Murder, murder, murder, pop, pop, pop, pop
Chrome's out the bezel like top out the watch
I ain't drawing no numbers, I'm snatching the box
Treat the booth like the block
In it like I'm selling rocks
Got your bitch giving me top
The baddest bitches, still treat 'em like thots
