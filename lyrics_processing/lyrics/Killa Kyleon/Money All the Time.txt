Cory Mo
I'm in this motherfucker chillin
Listen to a Cory Mo production
Finna rock out with my nigga
Killa!

The game's so cold, bitches and hoes
Niggas is the same, sometimes I don't know
All I knows the grind, gotta get mine
Money in my hand, hope you understand
The time waits for no man
I'm getting money all the time
Cause time waits for no man

Mic check 1 2, I got my mind on the lick
 about to hit ya,no time for dumb shit
If it's money on the mind, 
I can feel it in the air, 
I stuff it in my waist, as I break, I hit the highway
And If I gotta die, ain't trippin, I did it my way
Mama I got bills to pay, I'm on my own now
 wishing me well, I'm going all out
Cause I ain't got nothing to lose, I hate to see you cry
Anybody responsable, 
59 I'm flying, I pull up to the spot
When I ball get out, grab the strap and 
Had every entention 
From the looks of it, somebody beat me to the punch
And just like that, my plans halted
I lost it, 
You might also like
The game's so cold, bitches and hoes
Niggas is the same, sometimes I don't know
All I knows the grind, gotta get mine
Money in my hand, hope you understand
The time waits for no man
I'm getting money all the time
Cause time waits for no man

 real or fake, authentic or counterfeit
I'm off this shit, 
Real niggas, I lost a few
Fake I hate the sound of it
Elergic to those type of guys, I get breakouts around this shit
I get money all the time, 
Paper over pussy, when I get rich I might lounge a bit
Till then I be chasing bread like pidgens in a park
This rappin or this trappin, 
 dealing with the dark
Don't asoashiate with hate, so I'm not dealing with 
See my war wounds, they caused by the struggle
Got my weight up with my hate up, oah that all to my hustle
Sucka Free died, hater burn in hell, suffer
Military , getting payed, motherfucker
R.I.P. to Nut, 
Before it hit the floor, I'll pour a 4 up in my piture
The game's so cold, bitches and hoes
Niggas is the same, sometimes I don't know
All I knows the grind, gotta get mine
Money in my hand, hope you understand
The time waits for no man
I'm getting money all the time
Cause time waits for no man

Since I was 
I'm been tryna get the route of all evil
And make a believer out of anybody whoever doubted me
Sticks and stones, 
I got the chroam for the jackers, 
Competition don't exist, cause busters be running backwards
I got credit I give them, the green night
The loons gon bust your head, 
Representing the ,  where I live
Claming gon get you killed, beg, boro or steal
Imma win for some money, Imma bust if they send me to the pen
Mama said I shouldn't sin
 thanks for the feedback
Struggles a drug, mama and I ain't tryna relapce
The godfather of bangers, I need more green
That's why I wake up with the roosters and the dope feends
The game's so cold, bitches and hoes
Niggas is the same, sometimes I don't know
All I knows the grind, gotta get mine
Money in my hand, hope you understand
The time waits for no man
I'm getting money all the time
Cause time waits for no man

Money, more money
I gotta keep my hands on some
Show me where the fuck it is, I want some
I need my money, ain't no working for free
And if the bitch is flat footed, she ain't working for me
Seem like every other week, they be searching a G
I'm a street king, high school wasn't working for me
I had to get up off my rump and get on my hustle
Money over bitches, be straight out the muzzle
Wonder why I gotta die with it, man
I be dambed if I leave this bitch the way I came
 all this green
Either that or Codeine
It's all love if my fans attack me
And if I'm tense, I let the money relax me

The game's so cold, bitches and hoes
Niggas is the same, sometimes I don't know
All I knows the grind, gotta get mine
Money in my hand, hope you understand
The time waits for no man
I'm getting money all the time
