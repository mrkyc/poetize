Freedom (Freedom, freedom)
Freedom (Freedom, freedom)
Freedom (Freedom)
Check, one, two, what it do?

They used to tell us lies, read us stories
I seen Roots, I watched Glory
We've been beat, killed, and we've been slaved
Starved to death 'til we ain't ate for days
We couldn't read, they wouldn't let us learn
First in line, they said, "Wait your turn."
They used to take shit that they ain't earn
Set fire to crosses, let that burn
Hang niggas like ornaments, it ain't Christmas
50 years later, ain't too much different
Grown ass men, used to give us whippings
Cuts in his hand from the cotton he pickin'
Can't get a job so it's freedom he riskin'
We ain't really free, still got us fistin'
We don't stick together man, we so distant
Welfare, taxes, I'm kind of indifferent
Black in America, we sheep
Hunted by the wolves, can't get no peace
Flood a nigga city, can't get no relief
Murder, death, kill, just grief
Seven days a week
Doin' what he gotta just to eat
Niggas dyin' as we speak
I'm lookin' at the tweets, see it on the ground, ain't nobody safe
Killin' niggas dead, murder was the case, all of our race
Blame it on hate, another hung jury spittin' in our face
Modern day Holocaust worse than the Jews
Come with the game, ain't playin' by the rules
Red and blue states, now we gotta choose
Buyin' up the hood, now we gotta move
Ain't no justice, now we gotta lose
Fuck the police, that's a nigga mood
Freedom

Now
It's comin' with a price
They don't give a fuck about your rights
One more stripe
Judge say, "Nigga, take a hike."
Prosecutor comin' for your life
Bein' in the streets like playin' with some dice
Niggas turn mice
Now you need 50 just to fight
Yikes
They expose niggas on Vice
Three hots in the cock, commissary in the kite
23 hours on lockdown
Put a nigga in a field do work for 'em
Even though they claim it's a nigga punishment
They work niggas like a slave, get a purse for 'em
They shoot niggas like targets in a gun range
Now his niggas gotta go and make a shirt for him
A tombstone, wood box, and a hearse for him
Obituary in his grandma church for him

Yuh
Lord, I'm sick and tired of bein' tired
Apply for work but still will get denied
Turn the set and dope to get me by
Lock me up, feel like to sit and die
Obama came in office, changed the law
But lawyer took the case and found a flaw
Took the shit to trial and won the case
Fuck the system, tried to do me wrong
