Yeah that's right, Killa ay

You know I roll up, with the purp' po'd up
Bucket of ice on my chest, got me froze up
I got the fifth down, top fold up
Yeah bitch I'm riding around, with my nose up
I'm switching lanes mayn, what it do
I got my hand on the grain mayn, what it do
I'm pop trunk full of bang mayn, what it do
My Cadillac on swangs mayn, that's what it do

Bullets'll push your T, when Killa empty the clips
And that's for real, no not for real no that's the steel
I'm from trillville, for real where niggas will kill
For a hot meal, they'll show you how that Glock feel
Cop a chopper, put a boy in his place
Fuck fifty you cheap, without the scar on your face
They say actions speak louder than words, but I ain't talking to ya
I just put one off into your eye, bring your coffin to ya
Lights out, meet the reaper sing your lullaby
Slow singing flower bringing, watch your mother cry
I'm a smooth criminal, I'm not Mike Jack but some'ing like that
But I don't want your dope or your dollas, I want your life black
The Mac'll have you running back, we call it craw-fishing
Not a bar missing on a mission, to meet the mortition
I make a movie out him, meet your audition
Run the clip Rogers, now the boy twitching

The boy Killa spit infection, through your ear lobe
He's nothing like them, so they label him weirdo
Y'all spit it so sloppy, but I speak it so clear though
H.D. fuck with me, your wife'll be a widow
Stacks on deck, lay your head on my pillow
I hear you getting money, well dido
Flow sick, so label it hot spitto
Y'all softer than Spongebob, the boy Killa brillow negro
Show stopper brick buster, and a blow rocker
Pull up on fo' choppers, get your bopper
I do the beat smoke chronic, but I'm no Dr
Speak bad english, yeah but my flow proper
Bullshit walk, money do a fo' and a forty
Fucking with mine, and you can get your four out of forty
Killa's a winner, you just a zero and a forty
Think you fucking with me, you must be on dro and Bacardi
