Hey
Yeah
Check, one, two, what it do?

They say, "Make it great again."
Just to make us hate again
Use a couple rappers
That's the way they bait us in
Hateful ass crackers
That's the way they play to win
Evil ass bastards
I can't put my faith in them
Used to be our masters
That's why I can't fuck with them
Business men and pastors
I can't put my trust in them
They campaignin', we complainin'
Ain't no damn changes
Then they the judge and the jury
We just the damn plaintiff
They feed us bullshit like a danish and we digest it
Manipulate us, we process it, no progression
Our obsession is spendin', so that's their objective
Apply pressure, bust us, fuck us in our rectum
We elect 'em, they don't protect us, then sell us dreams
Then they neglect us, then they infect us with plots and schemes
What happened to that March on Washington with Dr. King?
I guess it died the same day the feds shot the King

Do it for the 'Gram, do it for the 'Gram
Do it for the Vine, do it for the Vine
Tell our vision, tell our vision, tell our vision
They just fuckin' with your mind, fuckin' with your mind
Yeah, do it for the 'Gram, do it for the 'Gram
Do it for the Vine, do it for the Vine
Tell our vision, tell our vision, tell our vision
They just fuckin' with your mind, fuckin' with your mind

Yeah
Black lives don't matter, you see the casual diss
Niggas say they ain't votin', slave mentality
They still unfit from all those years of brutality
I call it mission accomplished, that's my analogy
Go alone and get along, you get a salary
Trump and Hillary just a Mickey and Mallory
Natural Born Killers, I see the signs
Use a few niggas, they love 'em, and they complyin'
Brainwashin' you niggas, yeah, they beauticians
They plant that shit in your mind more than extensions
House niggas love master, that's tradition
Now niggas scared to speak without permission
The most powerful women like Oprah Winfrey
She ain't supportin' no woman, that bitch missin'
But these niggas ain't focused on no election
These niggas tryna pop bottles and get a section
Look at what we livin' in (Livin' in)
I can't even trust my best friend, damn
A pool full of blood what I'm swimmin' in (Yeah, yeah)
I can't even trust the president, damn (Man, damn)
They shoot a nigga with no evidence (Yeah, yeah)
They just killin' young niggas, goddamn
Our hands in the air and it's evidence (Don't shoot!)
