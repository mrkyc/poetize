Do you want me to try and go deeper?

They done killed a nigga dream, Dr. King
Now I'm certain that a change won't come
Gave 'em a hundred dollar bill, bill
Fifty, no tip, I hope my change gon' come
Heart heavy, it's been fuckin' with my mind
So long I think my brain gone numb
So I'm on my knees, prayin', hopin', wishin'
God listen, that a change gone come

It's like we marchin' for nothin'
Fifty years, same topic, that's the shit we discussin'
Racism, gettin' killed, we ain't accomplishin' nothin'
Still takin' a fuckin', they still callin' us niggas
They did away with the rope, now they pullin' the trigger
Segregated and separated, we still in division
They Willie Lynchin' us daily, still, we fill up the prison
The dream died in Memphis, we ain't for feelin' this vision
Demoralizin' our women, leave us with fatherless children
Force me to live in hell, acceptin' demons
Only time I escape in dream and nightmares
They only my mind, clingin'
Hard coat without a soul, how a nigga feelin'
Cause ain't no justice when you witness killings
Exonerated out the penitentiary
Knowin' we innocent and far from guilty
It's been that way, it's in our black history
His story how they tell it to you
Manipulate it, exaggerate it, then sell it to you

Searchin' for change, I'm a couch diver
Young, black, and successful, I'm still an outsider
You pussy cottons Mrs. Doubtfires
I just tell the truth, put out fire
Then promote it like I put out flyers
Our hands up but they still shootin' like we provoked 'em
Smokers, we hopeless, ain't seein' change, we losin' focus
Posted on corners to catch us slippin' while we in motion
I swear they roachin', pull out they toasters when they approach us
Drivin' while bein' black, guilty for bein' that
Penalty DOA, the world seein' that
It's hard to hide the facts, 'specially when it's blantant
They justifyin' every situation
Dead to the wrong, them crackers still right
They playin' God how they steal life
This ain't a movie, G, this real life
Man, where Obama when you need the nigga?
He leave us hangin' like death right when you need the nigga
Yeah
They done killed a nigga dream, Dr. King
Now I'm certain that a change won't come
Gave 'em a hundred dollar bill, bill
