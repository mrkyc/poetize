Cory Mo, hey, Cory Mo
You niggas killin' over J's
Them niggas killin' over J's
Where Michael Jordan when you need him?
Niggas killin' over J's
Yeah
Check, one, two, what it do?

Bell rung, he couldn't wait to get out
Today was Friday, tomorrow when them J's come out
Them Bred 1's, he got every color
Except the Banneds, too expensive, so he copped the others
Ninth grader with a hustle, he worked with his brother
After school and weekends he did some yard cuttin'
A couple dollars every week and he worked hard for 'em
Just to stack, he missed some lunches, even starved for 'em
Honor students' day, drippin' so they stayed hatin'
The bitches love him, niggas didn't, never fazed Nathan
A different pair every week
Kept somethin' fresh on his feet
Soon as he walked through them doors
You seen they face in defeat
That only made it worse
Now they plottin' to see him hurt 'cause of jealousy
Envious niggas so quick to commit a felony
Three o'clock, bus stop
Tryna leave school, two dudes
Asked for his shoes, he ran
They shot they tool for his J's (For his J's, for his J's)

They get in line for a fresh pair
These niggas dyin' for a fresh pair
They killin' niggas for they next pair
They say, "11 was the best pair."
Them Concords but ain't no jet there, neow
Used to be once a month, now they drop once a week
Same shit, different color, we buy 'em on repeat
Spender's insanity, brainwashin' our vanity
Label us top consumer, the verdict: poor money management
Last year we spent a trillion and they make a dime
Ain't make a profit, got 'em poppin', got our pockets lined
No gun, no mans, they robbed a nigga blind
Stevie Wonder couldn't see it comin', laughin' more, just cryin'
Yeah, that's a nigga for you, stuck in his ways so
Ain't pay his rent, but he got them J's though
Camp out for days, hypebeastin' just to get 'em first
Got every pair, but not no ride to work
But he got them J's though
These niggas killin' over J's
These niggas killin' over J's
These niggas killin' over J's
Where Michael Jordan when you need him?
