D-1-F Gang mayn (I want the cake)
It's Killa nigga, ay

I'm feeling like a pimp, let me brush my shoulders
Call Killa cobra, I spit venom through my molars
Candy do' shutter, 84 spoke roller
Spreading through the streets like ebola, peanut butter
Top folder, big knot of guac-ola
The G you come see, when you trying to cop cola
How dare you say, that Killa not colder
Than all these other boys, well you dudes not sober no
(*talking*)
Naw naw Storm, I don't think they know what the fuck going on
Purple Punch the mixtape, bring that shit back Storm run it
D-1-F Gang mayn, (I want the cake) it's Killa nigga ay

I'm feeling like a pimp, let me brush my shoulders
Call Killa cobra, I spit venom through my molars
Candy do' shutter, 84 spoke roller
Spreading through the streets like ebola, peanut butter
Top folder, big knot of guac-ola
The G you some see, when you trying to cop cola
How dare you say, that Killa not colder
Than all these other boys, well you dudes not sober no
Open up your ears, pay attention and listen
The agent double-O Flow, on a money making mission
I'm on that play pitching, a thousand grams plus
No less than 2-20, if you need em hit me up
Pockets overweight, cause I'm eating
The corner's my buffet line, when I'm hungry the streets treating
I'm bout the (money) want the (money), need the (money)
Get's the, gotta have the (cake)
Might be sliding through your sector, with that hard white texture
I'm the best, I suggest you address me no lesser
I'm a pro not a Yung Joc, a veteran slanging
Snow bis' not your bis', I'm into block entertainment
So approach me wrong, I'm cocking and aiming
Stainless and raining, and leaving you brainless
I'm bout the (money) want the (money), need the (money)
Get's the, gotta have the (cake) I need that money mayn
