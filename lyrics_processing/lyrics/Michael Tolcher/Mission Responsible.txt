Lead the way in a revoloution
Wear a wig and a permanent smile
Be a part of a celebration
Make the plans or the cancelation
Quick descisions
Lets change our minds
Well there's people out there
But it's people we are
Were just faces from different places
Drinkin juice from mason jars
I'm on a mission responsible
Say your good-byes
Be a father of no realation
Or be a symbol for procreation
Strike a match and theres sure to be fire
Be a part of your situation
Blame yourself for your frustration
Dig a hole till you lose your desire
Well there's people out there
But it's people we are
Were just names playing different games
Drinking coke and eating candy bars
You might also likeI'm on a mission responsible
Say your good-byes
Well i'm finding anything's possible
Closing your eyes
Closing your eyes
Closing your eyes
Be a part of your own descision
See your future with tunnel vision
Take a chance if you want to survive
You do want to survive, don't you?
Be the talk of a conversation
Your a superstar out of isolation
Get the keys
Its your turn to drive
Well there's people out there
And it's people we are
We're just voices with different choices
Smokin dope and rockin out on guitars
Im on a mission responsible
Say your good-byes
Well i'm finding anything's possible
Closing your eyes
Well i'll put it all to rest
Now this shit is off my chest
And everytime i turn around
I don't see trees falling down
And there's someting that we can buy
Well i'm sure you would agree
Although you seem to fight with me
But there's a situation here
That doesn't seem to want to dissappear
And it doesn't no it won't go away
And we must do something
Now you see we can't go along
Cus i can see it in the swollen eyes of the story tellers that they're wrong
And every single word that they write
And thats what i'm goin' to fight
To survive
And its my only desire
To elevate the spirit and cultivate the higher
Rhythms and rhymes
For living
Is blind
And in and alternate reality its trapped up in your mind
Freedom!
Im on a mission responsible
Say your good-byes
Im on a mission responsible
