Before you realized your maps were wrong?
You're turning up in places
Where you don't belong
And the walls have something to hide
Well i could be way over there in a minute
If i had enough strength bear and grin it
If the measure of the match was fair
Then you'd win it
But you're bound to lose
Well It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you
Well it hardly seems worth the time you spend complaining
If you're bitching at a world full of people
And explaining yourself
And how their life could be so much better
If yous ain't so good
Well i can leave it all up to the presidents
Relying on the people
To believe false evidence
You could fight your way into a permanent residence
In the big house, with free food, but no trees
You might also likeIt doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you
It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you
I could my voice out across a great loud speaker
And attempt to give strength to the folks feeling weaker
Yeah you could call yourself
A genuine truthseeker
But watch out because it might be found
It's kinda hard cause things ain't what they seem
But it sure feels good to row gently down the stream
And it all makes sense, life is but a dream
So go merrily, go merrily, yeah
It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you
Yea, it doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you
Change is gonna happen to you
So how long had you gone
Before you realized your maps were wrong?
You're turning up in places
Where you don't belong
