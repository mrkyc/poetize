With some poetry we begin
Get loose while the record spins
I could be your new best friend
And then even more
We could click
No games, no lies, no tricks
No problems we can't fix
For love
Or just for kicks
I like the way you touch me in places
I heat up
My heart races
Deeper i'm falling in love
I go crazy
Cus you want me
No questions
I whisper a secret confession
It's you
There's no one above
No one above
Whatever it takes
I bend the rule book 'till it breaks
I'll be a true love
No mistakes
I'll be with you
As long as it makes sense
With patieince
I know
My way your wind will blow
Two heart beats and one glow
Ready, set, go
You might also likeI like the way you touch me in places
I heat up
My heart races
Deeper i'm falling in love
I go crazy
Cus you want me
No questions
I whisper a secret confession
It's you
There's no one above
No one above
No one above
Come on
Take a chance
Feel free to let your spirit dance
Spark, flame, fire, and romance
Its a brand new circumstance
To enhance
Who you are
No bruise, no cuts, no scars
It's painless
No broken heart
Baby trust me
I like the way you touch me in places
I heat up
My heart races
Deeper i'm falling in love
I go crazy
Cus you want me
No questions
I whisper a secret confession
It's you
There's no one above
I like the way you want me
No question
Whisper a secret confession
"its you"
Theres no one above
I like the way you touch me in places
I heat up
My heart races
Deeper i'm falling in love
