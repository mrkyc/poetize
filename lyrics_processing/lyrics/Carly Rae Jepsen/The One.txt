Truth is I never thought of us together
You're just a friend of mine
We should know better, this can't last forever
But kiss me one more time

Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny, but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

While cookin' dinner, I'd wear your socks and slippers
It's been a long, long day
It's just so easy
Love the way you read me
I never have to say

Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
