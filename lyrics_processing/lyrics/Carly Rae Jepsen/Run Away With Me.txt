You're stuck in my head, stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh
This is the part you gotta say
All that you're feelin', feelin'
Packing a bag, leaving tonight
While everyone's sleepin', sleepin'
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be drivin' you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby (Hey)
Take me to the feelin' (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby (Hey)
Every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
