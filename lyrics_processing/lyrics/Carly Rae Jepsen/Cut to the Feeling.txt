I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on, we crossed the line
It was on this time
I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want, you want from me
Talk to me, baby

I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars (Hey)
Just like ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah (Woo)
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on, can't make it stop
Give me all you got
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your everything to me
Let's get real, baby
