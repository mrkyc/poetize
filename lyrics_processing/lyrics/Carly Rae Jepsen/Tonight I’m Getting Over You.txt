I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry, as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm beggin' at your feet
It's been a real hard night, and I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I
