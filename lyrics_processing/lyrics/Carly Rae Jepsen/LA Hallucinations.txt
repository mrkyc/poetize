I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to LA
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever

But money makes your whole world spin
'Til everything is dizzying
And suddenly...

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations

Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night, he and I
Filling up each other's pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes
See Carly Rae Jepsen LiveGet tickets as low as $112You might also like
We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game
'Cause suddenly...

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations

BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?
BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, then will you let me go?

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations
Take me into your arms again
