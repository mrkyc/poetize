I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best so you want more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
I'll be the magic you won't ever see (Ever see)
You can always rely on me to help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend

I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea (Lost at sea)
I'll keep my light on, baby
You can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home (Call your home)
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
