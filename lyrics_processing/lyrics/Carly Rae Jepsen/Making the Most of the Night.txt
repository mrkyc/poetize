You and me
We've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down (Down)
Know what you need to get you high
Top down (Top down)
Let the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside
All of your fears, leaving them behind

Here I come now
Baby, I'm speeding and red lights, I'll run
What I got, you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding
I'm coming to getcha, to getcha, to getcha, oh

I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'mma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
We're making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'mma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
We're making the most of the night
