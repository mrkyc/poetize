I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
And I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling, falling
You catch me when I'm falling, falling for you

I saw myself tonight
Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
Warm blood, underneath my skin (For you)
Warm blood, my heart is pumping (For you)
Warm blood (Warm blood), underneath my skin
Warm blood (Warm blood), my heart is pumping (Warm blood)

Warm blood, warm blood
Warm blood, warm blood
Warm blood, warm blood
