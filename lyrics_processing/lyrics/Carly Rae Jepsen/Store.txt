Sunlight moves upon my skin
Wake up, and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
But you know me, and...

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going
Oh, I can't talk about it
Can't talk about it, 'cause...

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
