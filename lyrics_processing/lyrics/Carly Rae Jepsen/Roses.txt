Knock on the door
Leaving it open
It wasn't you
Why was I hoping?
Said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend

I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move
All that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons, and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take you back

Cat got your tongue
It's been forever
Have you been good?
Have you been better?
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend

Burnt out cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
Baby, cover me
Hold the afterglow
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
