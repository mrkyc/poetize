So I've been tryin' hard to open up
When I lost someone, it hit me rough
I paid to toughen up in therapy
She said to me, "Soften up"

I'm sorry if I push your good away
Especially when I'm needin' you to stay
I know you hate that I still test your love
I'm tryin' not to fuck this up

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you
My not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart (I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer (I'll believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open, I wanna be honest with you

I used to soldier through my hardest days
I used to switch it off, ignore the pain
I craved to feel it all entirely
In your arms, baby

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you
My not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart (I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer (I'll believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open, I wanna be honest with you

I'll believe in you every night (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Every night (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Every night (I'll believe in you every night)
I'll believe in you every night (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Every night (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Every night (I'll believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart (I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer (I'll believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
