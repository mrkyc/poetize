For some time, I've been
Waiting for your star to shine so bright
I should say that it's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn't cruel
And for some time, I've been
Singing you a lullaby each night
Whispering that it's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn't cruel

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Who could believe that you're holding my hand now?
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love isn't crazy)

For some time, I've been
Pillow-talking in my head, my heart's vulnerable
But in my bed, I want you, baby
And all you put me through, oh, but love isn't cruel
Another night I swear I saw you in my dream, dream
We didn't say too much, but I understood everything
That you could hurt me, baby, and I could hurt you too
Oh, but love isn't cruel (Hold on, hold on)

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Gimme the seasons, I'm holding your hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
(I know it) And I want you bad
(I feel it) And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it and) Every day, want you more
We were so insecure
(This love, it isn't crazy) Every day, learning more
We were so immature
(I know it) I want you bad
(I feel it) And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it and) Every day, want you more
We were so insecure
(This love, it isn't crazy) Every day, learning more
We were so immature (Hold on, hold on)

That's why we got to hold on, baby (I know it)
I can believe that this love isn't crazy (I feel it)
This loving could save me (I know it and I feel it and)
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy, hold on, hold on)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand (I know it)
I can believe that you're holding my hand now (I feel it)
This loving could save me (I know it and I feel it and)
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
