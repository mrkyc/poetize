I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

It's your fault
Baby boy, 'cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light
With your eyes onto me in the darkness

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see

If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
