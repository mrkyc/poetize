I was lost
Alone, and searchin'
For someone who understands me for who I really am
Didn't know that I was hurtin'
'Til you lift me up inside
Finally opened up my eyes, oh

If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

You take me higher than the rest (Hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey) hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher

Took some time
A few mistakes, but
You quite didn't show me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound, yeah
