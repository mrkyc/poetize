I look at your face, I know I'll never be safe
Cause you're my favourite mistake
Oh you're my favourite mistake
I'm just a victim of fate, ain't got the words to explain
This kinda stupid behaviour

This is a bad idea, it's the fuck up of the year
How'd you end up here (Yeah I seen you hanging around)
And you're no good it's clear
Only gonna end up in tears
It's a bad idea, oh no no

Look what you made me do
I'm tripping up over you
It's so predictable, don't you know
It's typical me, I tried to leave you behind
But I'm a fool every time, it's so typical, typical
It's typical me

I know you're not the one for me
But it ain't easy to let you go
It started off as fine
But in the end it won't be , no
