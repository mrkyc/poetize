They say that imitation is a form of flattery
The way you copy-paste them goes unflatter me
And I'm losing patience and I'm sick of saying (sick of saying, b-b-bang)

And I don't need a mirror, I just look at you
I guess you're kind of figured, that you could wear my shoes
They're just a little bigger and I'm sick of saying (sick of saying)

It doesn't work, it isn't you
I don't know who you think you're fooling
You never learn, I won't get through
And I just can't get rid of you
Who you fooling

So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
I told you no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
You might also likeYou got you're own feet too
You got you're own feet too
So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
Don't make me say it again

B-b-bang-bang, b-b-bang-bang, bang-bang, b-b-bang
Don't let me say it again
B-b-bang-bang, b-b-bang-bang, bang-bang, b-b-bang
B-b-bang

Don't know just what you're proving, but it don't look good
I see just what you're doing and I wish you won't
I can't help you, you're just so misunderstood

It doesn't work, it isn't you
I don't know who you think you're fooling
You never learn, I won't get through
And I just can't get rid of you

So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
I told you no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
You got you're own feet too
You got you're own feet too
So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
Don't make me say it again

Don't make me say it again
B-b-bang-bang, b-b-bang-bang, bang-bang, b-b-bang
Don't let me say it again
B-b-bang-bang, b-b-bang-bang, bang-bang, b-b-bang

So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
I told you no don't follow, no don't follow
No don't follow me
So I said no don't follow, no don't follow
