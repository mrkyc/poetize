Been thinking 'bout the little thing you said
Doesn't sink in, and you fought above my head
'Cause I'm scared, I can't lie
I don't feel the same inside
I can't decide if I have the heart to confess

And I don't think I'm ready to go in this heavy
I thought we would take it slow (Woah)
And now you got that feeling
You say that you mean it
But for me, I just don't know (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I can't see it, I don't feel it
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can't say that I won't say it back
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
You might also like
There ain't no contract
And I go when I choose to leave
And I don't want that
That's not something that I need (Dig a little deeper)
And you know that it takes two
And I don't feel the same as you
And when I think back on
I see now I always knew

And I don't think I'm ready to go in this heavy
I thought we would take it slow (Woah)
And now you got that feeling
You say that you mean it
But for me, I just don't know (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I can't see it, I don't feel it
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can't say that I won't say it back
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
Dig a little deeper
Got no feeling in my soul
For you, I just don't know (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Dig a little deeper for you)
I just don't know, yeah (For you, you, for you, you)
Got no feeling in my soul, yeah
(Dig a little deeper for you, you, for you, you, for you, you)
For you, I just don't know, oh, know
(Dig a little deeper for you, you, for you, you, for you, you)
(No, no, no, no, no) I just don't know
(Dig a little deeper for you, you, for you, you, for you, you)
I can't

I can't see it (See it), I don't feel it (No, no, no, oh)
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can't seem to (Seem to) foresee it (See it)
I need to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Dig a little deeper)
Dig a little deeper
For you, you
For you, you (For you)
