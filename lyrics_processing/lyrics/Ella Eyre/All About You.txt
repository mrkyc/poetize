I've been down the same road
For too long I stayed
No, I can't do this
I don't want this no more
About time the bird flies
About time that I tried
Going my way
Go my own way without you

I gave my life, I gave my soul
Gave you my heart but you want more
I gave my life, I gave my soul
And you gave me nothing back at all

You know I worked so hard to give you all that you need
And from the start you never gave a shit about me
And from all I did, you were too blinded to see
That it doesn't matter who I am, no
Doesn't matter what I do
It's all about you
You, you, you, you, you (3x)
It's about you (3x)
You might also like
So mad, so bitter
Well, go ahead and just sit there
I can't change you
I don't want to, I don't care, oh
But look what I started
I know I made my mark here
Won't forget it and you're forgetting about me


You know I worked so hard to give you all that you need
And from the start you never gave a shit about me
And from all I did, you were too blinded to see
That it doesn't matter who I am, no
Doesn't matter what I do
It's all about you
You, you, you, you, you (3x)
(Baby any time of day)
It's about you (3x)

Lesson learned, I was in your shadow
I got burned because I never settle
Can't say nothing cause it won't get better
Can't say nothing cause it won't get, no...
I'm turning on all the bridges broken
Do you know which side is burning
It won't get better for you, no
It won't get better, no
