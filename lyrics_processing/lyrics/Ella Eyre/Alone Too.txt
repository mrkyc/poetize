Taken a hold of your heart, in a way you never knew
Put your faith in a man with a past
That kept catching up with you
You drew a line, made a hole, then you jumped in
And now you're heart, now you know you'll never forgive
'Cause you're broke inside, broken soul, nothing to give
And nothing to feel with

I've been behind the walls you've made
I've been in all the rooms you've paced
I've hidden where you feel safe
'Cause I've been alone too
I've been behind the doors you've closed
The darkness that you've made your home
I know the things you think I don't
'Cause I've been alone too

Can't find the heart to reclaim
There's a hole here left inside
Can't find the parts to replace
You're afraid to look behind
Crying out, but you found that you can't speak
Shutting down, shutting out, all I can see is that
Looking at you is like looking at me when I was you
You might also like
I've been behind the walls you've made
I've been in all the rooms you've paced
I've hidden where you feel safe
'Cause I've been alone too
I've been behind the doors you've closed
The darkness that you've made your home
I know the things you think I don't
'Cause I've been alone too

And I know, and I know
That you don't have to fight the dark
You don't have to wear those scars

Taken a hold of your soul
And that was the hardest part
Taking back your control
When you find the place to start

I've been behind the walls you've made
I've been in all the rooms you've paced
I've hidden where you feel safe
'Cause I've been alone too
I've been behind the doors you've closed
The darkness that you've made your home
I know the things you think I don't
'Cause I've been alone too
