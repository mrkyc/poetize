Worry about, worry about, worry about me
No you don't need to, no you don't need to, no you don't need to
Worry about me
No you don't need to, no you don't need to, no you don't need to
Worry about me

Going home, had a hell of a day
And all I know is I'm happy to see your face
I said it before, and I'll say it again
But all the time you worry yourself
You loose your mind, think I'm happy with someone else
Said it before, and I'll say it again

No you don't need to worry about, worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know
I said you don't need to worry about
Worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know

It's so gold in our little world
And all I know is there's nowhere that I would go
I said it before, and I'll say it again
And I can't tell what it is on your mind
I know it well, cause we've been here a thousand times
I said it before, and I'll say it again

No you don't need to worry about, worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know
I said you don't need to worry about
Worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know

It's in your head, don't need to be scared of
I'm only fair to you
Ain't got a swear oh, till I'm dead gone
I only care for you
No you don't need to worry about, worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know

I said you don't need to worry about, worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know
I said you don't need to worry about
Worry about, worry about me
Cause I ain't going nowhere, nowhere I don't know

Going home had a hell of a day
All I know is that I'm happy to see your face
