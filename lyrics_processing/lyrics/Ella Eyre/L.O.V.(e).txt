L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E, O-V-E

There's a ghost in my heartbeat
And it knows my pain
Reminding me I should be cautious (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
But, oh, how my heart aches
To be whole again
A feelin' I can't be ignorin' (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

It's a rollercoaster I swore I'd never ride again
But I think that I'd like to try
Think that I'd like to

I need that L-O, L-O, L-O-V
Even though it runs from me
Say, L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E
O-V-E
I need that L-O, L-O, L-O-V
Even though it's hard to keep
Say L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E
O-V-E, yeah

There's a light in my shadow
And it's blinding me
Reflecting the person I could be (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
There's a voice in my nightmares (Nightmares)
And it disagrees
Saying it's not like the movies, nah (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

It's a rollercoaster I swore I'd never ride again
But I think that I'd like to try
Think that I'd like to

I need that L-O, L-O, L-O-V
Even though it runs from me
Say, L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E
O-V-E
I need that L-O, L-O, L-O-V
Even though it's hard to keep (L-O-V, L-O-V, L-O-V)
Say L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E
O-V-E, yeah

Lowkey, I need some attention on me, yeah (On me, eh, eh)
Lowkey (Eh, eh), I need that connection so deep (I need)
I need that L-O, L-O, L-O-V
Even though it runs from me
Say, L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E (Ooh, yeah)
