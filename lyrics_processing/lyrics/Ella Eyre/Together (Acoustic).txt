So many times it has all been said and done
But in the end it's the fight that's just begun
Understand that it's days like these
When the world is so hard to please
In you my heart has find a home

It's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two

Cause we are, we are, we are, we are more
Yeah we are, we are, we are, we are more
Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
Together (It's all right, all right)
Yeah
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
Together

Playing games that will always end the same
Neither you or I will take the blame
Sometimes we go too far
But I like the way we are
Right here I give your heart a home
You might also like
No It's not about me
It's not about who I wanted to be
It's not about you
