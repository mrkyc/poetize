Yeah, I'm cold
Everything seems to be fine
On the surface, I look good
But I don't feel the same inside
Something's wrong
And I know you can tell
But I never have to say
Because you know me too well, oh

Don't need to worry, there's no emergency here
I'm all good, I'll be on my way, oh
And I'm too proud to say I need anyone else but me
But then I'm right back on my street

And I find myself at home
No, I've never be scared
Home's where my family's at
I'm home
No, I'll never look back
Hold on to what I have
Not afraid to use the phone
'Cause I don't have to be alone
No, I've never been scared at home
When I find myself at home
You might also like
And it's alright
If there's one thing I know
To get that good feeling, I know just where to go
'Cause everything is easy
Everything falls into place
And there's somewhere I can hide
When I just need a break, oh

I don't worry, there's no urgency here
I'm all good, I'll be on my way, oh, yeah
And I'm too proud to say I need anyone else but me
But then I'm right back on my street

And I find myself at home
No, I've never be scared
Home's where my family's at
I'm home
No, I'll never look back
Hold on to what I have
Not afraid to use the phone
'Cause I don't have to be alone
No, I've never been scared at home
So I need to get home
Oh, take, take me home
To the place I know
Oh, take, take me home, oh, yeah
Take, take me home
Take, take me home
To the place I know
Take, take me home
Take, take me home

And I find myself at home
No, I've never be scared
Home's where my family's at
I'm home
No, I'll never look back
Hold on to what I have
Not afraid to use the phone
'Cause I don't have to be alone
No, I've never been scared at home
