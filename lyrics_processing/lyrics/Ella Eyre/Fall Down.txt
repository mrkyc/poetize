Well you see
I built these walls between
The world and me, because it was easy
Because it was easy to be that way
But you, you're the only one to see through
So you can be my second shadow if you want to
But only if you want to

Would you ever give up
When times get tough
Could you ever give up
When you've had enough
I would never give up if it means that much

But if I'm about to fall down
(Would you try and break my fall)
If I'm about to fall down
(Would you follow me at all)
Cause I know I would
Take the wrap, cause if you stumble
I will be right by your side
If you fall down, I fall
With you
You might also like
Do you know
How far that you could go
If I needed you there for me
Need you to care for me
Right now I see you
That's how it is
You got under my skin
You found a hole and you're filling it in
Filling it in

Would you ever give up
When times get tough
Could you ever give up
When you've had enough
I would never give up if it means that much

But if I'm about to fall down
(Would you try and break my fall)
If I'm about to fall down
(Would you follow me at all)
Cause I know I would
Take the wrap, cause if you stumble
I will be right by your side
If you fall down, I fall
With you

Yeah, but if I'm about to fall down
(Would you try and break my fall)
If I'm about to fall down
(Would you follow me at all)
Cause I know I would
Take the wrap, cause if you stumble
I will be right by your side
If you fall down, I fall

But if I'm about to fall down
(Would you try and break my fall)
If I'm about to fall down
(Would you follow me at all)
Cause I know I would
Take the wrap, cause if you stumble
I will be right by your side
If you fall down, I fall
