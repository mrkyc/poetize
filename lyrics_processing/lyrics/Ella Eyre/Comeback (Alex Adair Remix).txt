And you might think he doesn't care that much at all

Yeah, they always come back

Oh, when he returns he puts you in a situation
But it's too late to have that kind of conversation

Just take that pain and let the motherf-cker burn

They're all the same, they never learn
Just take that pain and let the motherf-cker burn
And you know that in time you will find that
They'll always come back, yeah they'll always come back

But they'll always come back
Yeah they'll always come back, oh
