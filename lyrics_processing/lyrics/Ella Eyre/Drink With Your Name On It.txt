You said you'd be here by the hour (Hour)
It's close to midnight and you still ain't shown your face
Think I'll be leaving by the hour?
Think I'll be leaving if you don't care either way

I'm on the ground, I'm fucking wasted
I can't stand this crowd, yeah
Music's too loud, I've hit the pavement
And I'll be here waiting
I'll be here waiting for you

I've got a drink with your name on it
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've got a seat that I saved for you
See, I'm on the ground, I'm fucking wasted
I can't stand this crowd, I'll be here waiting for you
I've got a drink with your name on it

You said you'd be right on over (Over)
I'm seeing double and I'm just not thinking straight
Said, I'm not getting any younger (Younger)
So hurry up before my feet don't operate

Sticking around, hope that you come save me

I've got a seat that I saved for you
See, I'm on the ground, I'm fucking wasted

I've got a drink with your name on it

Just want you to know
That I can take it
You cannot take me home
