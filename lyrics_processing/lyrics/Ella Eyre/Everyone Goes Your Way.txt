Everyone goes your way
Following whatever path you take
Hear every word you say
People crawling at your feet
But I won't fall naturally

Don't why everyone goes your way
You've got them on a leash and running, running
Got them on their knees they're wanting more
Everyone tied their chains
Treat you like a saviour
Following the leader
Never gonna leave you

How much deeper can you dig that hole
'Til they realise that it's all your fault
Cover a lie, with a lie, with a lie
How much darker can you paint your soul
How much deeper can you dig that hole
Ain't much longer 'til I see you fall
'Til I see you fall

Everyone goes your way
Everywhere you go they're, going, going
No one even knows just who you are
Can't read your poker face
You've got everything to hide
No one ever asking why, only I can see inside you
You might also like
How much deeper can you dig that hole
'Til they realise that it's all your fault
Color a lie, with a lie, with a lie
How much darker can you paint your soul
How much deeper can you dig that hole
Ain't much longer 'til I see you fall

How much further can you push that way
Holding on is gonna be too late
Better let go, let it go, let it go
Ain't much longer 'til I see your true face
How much deeper can you dig that hole
'Til they realise that it's all your fault

Bones in your back are see-through
Bones in your back, bones in your back
I don't know how you're standing so tall
Fool everyone that meets you
Got nothing to give, but so much to say
Jump off a cliff and they go your way

How much deeper can you that hole
Realise that it's your fault (all your fault)
Lie, with a lie, with a lie
Darker can you your soul
Deeper can you that hole
Longer 'til I you fall
How much further can you push that way
Holding on is gonna be too late
Better let go, let it go, let it go
Ain't much longer 'til they see your true face
How much deeper can you dig that hole
'Til they realise that it's all your fault

It's all your fault
