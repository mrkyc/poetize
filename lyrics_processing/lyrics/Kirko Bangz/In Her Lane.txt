Girl, keep shitting on all these hoes
Won't let another nigga get too close
And can't nobody tell you nothing
Gettin' money is all we know
Just be yourself
She knows how to stay in her lane, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, she knows how to stay in her lane

Uh, uh
She know about a couple bitches I'm fucking but never ask no questions
I'm like, yeah, girl, that's how it gotta be
And she can come around me and my niggas even if we got bitches
She orderin' food and rollin' up the weed
Shawty like to keep it real low
She sip some drank, she chill, she smoke
Shawty keep it real G
And I don't need a lock up on my phone
If I'm talking to some bitches, don't be on my shoulders let a nigga be
And that's how she do it
She don't be on my page looking for bitches I'm following
Pictures I'm liking, nah, she don't do it
And every time we fuck she'll never spend a night
When I fall asleep she hit the front door
And I ain't gon' lie sometimes I get lonely and I wanna lay up a little bit
She like, "Boy, you better stay in your lane and save that simp shit for another bitch"

Uh
Shawty keep it real low-key
She focused on the money, she ain't trippin' 'bout me
She pay her own bills and she do her own thang
And her name ain't never in the streets
Her girlfriends gon' to the club every week
But she don't never go, she got deadlines to meet
And she don't never bring up shit she heard about me
Goddamn, this girl so thowed
I fuck with her when I got some free time
She never ask a nigga for some me time
Invention in that pussy body divine
She don't never take pictures, I don't meet moms
It's been a year since the last time she seen the club
To keep it trill, shit, I only seen her three times
I met her through a friend I used to be down
She say, "It's cool shit, y'all only fucked three times"
Girl, keep shitting on all these hoes
Won't let another nigga get too close
And can't nobody tell you nothing
Gettin' money is all we know
Just be yourself
She knows how to stay in her lane, oh-oh-oh
