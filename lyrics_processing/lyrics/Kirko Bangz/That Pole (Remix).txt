Say she in King of Diamonds Monday (Monday)
Ain't scared to get that money (Money)
And back in church by Sunday (Sunday)
But we all know she's in love with that pole (Pole, pole)
She's in love with that pole (That pole, pole, yeah)
Uh, say she in school (Uh) Tuesday through Friday (Friday)
Friday night, that's my day (Your day)
But Saturday through Sunday, she 'bout money
She ain't scared of that pole (Pole, pole)
She ain't scared of that pole (Pole, pole, oh)

Uh, said she in love with that pole, she's so in love with that pole
She love wakin' up, love wakin' up, wakin' up with that dough
I love it when she come home all the way drunk and all the way throwed
Said, "Boy be on that way," so you know I be on that road
Got that drink up in my cup, but that don't mean that I move slow
Drank up in my cup, but that don't mean that I fuck slow
She got a tattoo on her ass, you know it say "Kirko"
She tattooed to her cash, shakin' that ass and lettin' it go
She like, "Baby boy, don't trip about it, everythin' you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneakin' 'round on the low and I'm just out here gettin' my dough"
I'm like, "Baby girl, don't trip about it, everythin' you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneakin' 'round on the low and knowin' they wanna get on that pole"
