Aw, yeah (Yeah)
Now when you're rollin' through your motherfuckin' hood, what do you see?
I see some motherfuckin' Gs (A G)

Step out on my corner with my box of rocks
Drama covers my hood for blocks and blocks
See my homie that I hang with
Hit him up with the deuce thumb thang shit
Back then it came with the love and niggas wasn't trippin' over scratch
'Cause we took turns and we both stacked stacks
And if you had a customer, you had him for life
'Cause Brad the true hustler granted you rights
'Cause if we gonna stack Gs then we gotta get along
And he who disagrees then gotta get him gone
'Cause they be startin' to get paid and niggas wanna flex
And ain't no squabbling these days, so niggas up on the TEC
And when they find you, they sending you to immortal ground
And ain't no coming back from that shit, you going down
Now you history with the quickness 'cause you was fuckin' up the business
Now what a way to end a friendship, shoulda been there
'Cause ain't no love for pawns in this game
Nigga, I'm relentless, leaving your mom in the pain
If your ass had to be got, then I got your ass
Rude boy mishandled the stock so I popped your ass
I'm so for dough that my mind flows in it for life
That I'm down to let my mind go get it tonight
No understanding when I'm hustling
Because in life all I understood was hustling 'cause I was struggling
Muscling anything in the way
Of me seeing first motherfuckin' light of the day
You might also like
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave

There was some niggas selling dope down the street I know
You make a left, they on the right, third white house from the liquor store
You can't miss 'em 'cause they be cappin'
Pretty cars in the yard, walkie talkies and security guards
Them motherfuckers had money out the ass and it was evident
By the way they dressed and flashed
Meanwhile I'm on the outside looking in
I got to get them motherfuckers, how can I win? (How can I win?)
Three a.m. coming from the club caught the pussies
Me and four niggas hiding in the bushes
Jumped out like the jumpout boys with them Glocks and gauges (Whew)
You should've saw them niggas faces
"Bitches, get butt naked," is what I ordered
Open the door, get on the floor, they was slaughtered (They was slaughtered)
'Cause once inside, we didn't need 'em
We knew where the scratch was located six months before we raided
And ain't feel nothing for they families
'Cause in this life you take the bitter with the sweet or your gambling
Nigga, I'm busting anything in the way (Anything in the way)
Of me seeing first motherfuckin' light of the day
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave

Now you can say what you want 'bout my persona
But don't let me hear you, 'cause I'ma freak you out like Madonna
Sneak up on you, put my gat to your stomach, squeeze the trigga
So close them eyes 'cause you's a dead-ass nigga
Motherfuckers say I'm wrong because I feel this way
But my environment taught me how to deal this way
And if I kill this way, then that's the way I got to go
'Cause everything you reap in life you got to sow
But I don't care if I have to pay down the road from a fool
I'm living for today, but if tomorrow comes, cool, nigga
If you think you want to meddle with this
Bring your ass to the square and we can settle this shit
I'm going pop-pop-pop 'til your head start swelling
Pop-pop-pop 'til your ass start smelling
You cried when your grandma died, that was real
But you ain't got to cry no more, you going to see her
And newcomers get dealt with
'Cause you can't get paid if you ain't part of my clique, nigga
I'm bustin' anything in the way
Of me seeing first motherfuckin' light of the day
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last motherfucker to leave
My pockets ain't hurting, that's for certain
You see a broke motherfucker, it's a burden
I'm the first motherfucker on the block for the cheese
