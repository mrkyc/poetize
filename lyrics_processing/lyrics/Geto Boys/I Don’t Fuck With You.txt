Flip flop ass Niggas
Ah Yeah
Geto Boys and Outlawz
Recognize the mob Nigga
I don't Fuck with you
So put your hands on me
Yeah best said by homeboy Willie D
Triple cross to Mexico
I don't fuck with you
That's some smooth hidin'
Lowdown dirty motherfuckers
That you thought was cool
Do you know me
I don't fuck with you
I know what's happenin' with that
All the hoes
Let me take y'all Niggas back to this incident

Nigga you full of shit
Bitch now what is this, trick
Some new shit
Straight from yo hottub piss
Nigga I don't do it
Fuck around here with you
Oh, I smell puke, do
That's on you, true
You hit's 'em hard dog
And ho went hard, thought
You betray hard, lord
You straight fraud, brought
Now on means, things stay out my face
You oughta play, like outta space
This niggas foul, runnin' off at the mouth
He talkin' loud, all of infront the crowd
Dog, I knew this Nigga, what
We used to roll, roll
I saved his life, right
But he was shot at, trife
He burned his greed, deep
I spit his wig, shit
He met the gravedigger
Cause I'm the realest Nigga

You Niggas came here ridin' through
(I don't fuck with you)
Heard the lavish thing we do
(I don't fuck with you)
Shook a finger to my crew
(We don't fuck with you)
For suck a dick until you blew
Cause we don't fuck with you
Hey bitch, you like the things we do
(I don't fuck with you)
Scared if I hit you, you might sue
(I don't fuck with you)
You swear you gang can bang a new
(I don't fuck with you)
But best keep doin' the shit we do
Cause we don't fuck with you

Now everytime I see yA ass
I see the bitch in your eyes
And wanna lie
Ain't no surprise now you fuck with that side
It's a cold thing, you got the whole game fuck up
Brown nose and every other nigga rich like a broke bitch
Excuse me miss, yeah you
You need to sit when you piss
I'mma get rich
While you stuck in that fuck shit
Thug shit is what I claim and bang and never change
While you change, suckin' and fuckin' for every thang
Yeah, I see some Niggas come and go
With a fifth of Hennessey to show
When we toss hoes, we share hoes
And Niggas be frontin' where the clothes go
(?)
What you spinnin' like Young Po
You hang around with the studio time
But nigga, what the fuck is you here fo'
Can you listen, please
Since you got your Glock, let it squeeze
Try not to fuck with you
Hope I don't have to bomb on you
Pull it with your punk-ass
No heart, no light, no bitch and no care
We some Bad Boy killers
When we see 'em, niggas snatch cash
Chorus:

These Billy-teen-ass Niggas
Pullin'-scheme-ass Niggas
Fiend-ass Niggas
Shootin'-dream-ass Niggas
I mean, why anybody sound like Pac nowadays
But switch it up they own way
Y'all gay that's on anything
Stay tuned to the saga
Drama bring Karma, Karma bring charges
Whipin' y'all
Completely off the job did
Darkness, fuck y'all shit
Cause we the hardest
Nasty new street regardless
Two heats to your noggin', faggot
Beg down, I truck a young bug
Don't get it fucked up
Hit the strip, get a grip Nigga
And blow some shit up
Talk fast and all ass, nigga
You ain't got no nuts
Don't trick yourself out your life
You need to hide in the cut
What's up
Come and holla at your boy, real quick
I swallow hard times
And make it come out when I piss
Nigga pop pass the Mac and I ain't black
Picture that
The same nigga that'll die for you
When you fall get your back
It's me, drunk as can be
On your bitch ass
Singin' ?Stagalee?
Worry free on your bitch ass
Blast back, ask that
Snap back like some whiplash
Young cash is back, back-slap your raps with a big gat
