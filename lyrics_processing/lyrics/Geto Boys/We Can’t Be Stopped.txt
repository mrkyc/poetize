You know in 1989, we knocked on the door
In 1990, we beat on the door
Now it's 1991, we finna kick this muthafucka in
Let's talk about a scandal
The album Geffen found too hot to handle
Fucked up the minds of you and yours
The last LP from the Geto Boys
Can you believe those hypocrites
Would distribute Guns n' Roses but not our shit
And they say we're a racist act
Ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black?
Man fuck them hoes
We got new partners and got shit done regardless
'Cause our fans are eveready down to die hard
Around the globe to 5th Ward
I read a news report
Some lawyer in Florida wanna take us to court
Somebody tell that country-ass hick
To go suck a dead man's dick
You might also likeYou scream obscenity, but it's publicity
You want hoes so don't act like you don't know
Better fuck with somebody else before you get popped
'Cause we can't be stopped!
Geto Boys Geto Boys
Geto Boys geto Boys
People are frightened when they hear the Boys
'Cause we ain't just a bunch of noise
None of that 'me-me' rappin'
We let your mothafuckin' ass know what's happenin'
Bitches get raped, niggas get murdered
Adults fuckin' kids in numbers unheard of
It's on the news every hour
Why can't I talk about it?
Everybody seem to be after us
Even the manufacturers
Wouldn't press our disc, you know it wasn't fair
Fuck everybody who work there
And every mothafuckin' reporter
Across every mothafuckin' border
You said the album wasn't coming out fighter
But when it did you couldn't find your typewriter
Keep lettin' the government dictate what you hear
Next they'll put stickers on your ears
Even with that move we got 'em in anguish
'Cause we'll learn sign language
We can't be stopped
Geto Boys Geto Boys
Willie D is the gangsta of love
Some of my friends sell drugs
I sell knowledge that you can't get a ho
'Cause the game is sold, not told
Promoters took away our tour
Negative press made them insecure
And you wonder why you never see a video
Of the boys from the ghetto
No radio, talkshow, or magazine were we in
And we still in the top 10
You can't beat that with a bat
Huh, Hammer can't touch that
We from the mothafuckin' south
Now what was this bullshit about?
That we had to be from Cali or New York
Anybody can make it that got heart
Trenchcoats and gangster hats got my back
Any nigga around me got to pack
So come on mothafuckas, come on mothafuckas, FUCK!
We can't be stopped!
