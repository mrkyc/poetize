Too Black Records
Yeah, this is Jay
Hold on, Jay
Hey Jay, long time, no hear, man, what's up?
Say man, people been kickin' around a lot of ho shit in my ears
Is that right?
Yeah, and it upsets me to hear a World Class Wreckin' Crew
Homosexual, disrespects real soldiers (Haha)
What time it is then, man?
It's time to mix 5th Ward, South Park and 69th Curbs
And really let a mothafucka know

Action speaks louder-
Action speaks louder than words
Action speaks louder than-

Roll 'em up, then I smoke 'em
Tried to break, so I broke 'em
Busted his ass in the head
That's when I grabbed him, and choked him
I'm on a vengeance, a psychopath, the master of wreckin' shit
Comes back with a body blow, hittin' hard as a fuckin' brick
Don't fuck with the mastermind, I'mma tell you like that
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll steal you with a bumper jack
Better yet, grab a bat, apart from the pack
Then commence to beatin' your head to the mothafuckin' fact
I'm ragin' like Manson, I'm a mothafuckin' thriller
Friday the 13th's my birthday, so I was a born killer
Brought up as a troubled kid, devious shits what I should of did
Mom had an abortion with me, but a nigga lived
I don't fear losin' life, 'cause life just lost me
Shadow of death keeps followin' me, and I can't get him off me
2 years of my life were spent in a mental health
I'm a threat to society, then again, to my fuckin' self
I'm losin' my fuckin' mind, my veins begin swellin'
"Kill that mothafucka!" I hear voices in my head yellin'
Me get caught in a cross, that's absurd
Your head is a tennis ball, and I'm about to serve

Body bag's in the bushes, see, I tried to tell 'em
I just hope pretty soon that somebody smell 'em
My lyrics get deeper and deeper
Mack 10, 12-gauge, Tec-9, plus a Street Sweeper
Nigga, Ganksta NIP's in the house
Time I see a mouse, automatic spaghetti sauce
Been poor all my life, so I reach for the sky
I regret I was born, I can't wait till I die
And leave blood on the curtain
Fatal thoughts of death, suicide is certain
I kill for a quarter, lyrics deep as the water
Peace to Rodney King, I got they ass in Slaughter
Insane is what I am
I'm like Silence of the mothafuckin Lambs
Ganksta NIP ain't no bragger-boaster
Migraine headaches made me sleep in a toaster
Step in my face, I'll commence the hittin'
(*gunshots*) 9 milli' ain't bullshittin'
Down with Seag' from the 69th Curbs
Tell 'em, Triple Six (Action speaks louder than words)
Action speaks louder than-
Action speaks louder than words
Action speaks louder than-

Well, first of all
I shock 'em, and clock 'em, and pop 'em, and drop 'em
Flop 'em, then I mop 'em
In they mothafuckin' tracks is where I stop 'em
Unless you down with a bloody nose
Save the cussin', and fussin'
And pointin' fingers for them hoes
Talk is cheap, I catch your ass on the sneak
And hit you everywhere, but under your feet
Think it's a game, when it ain't
I'm lettin' you talk, but, bitch, I'll knock yo lips off
And get ready for your kinfolk
Your lil' sister be the first one to get smoked
Then I grab your grandma by her weave hair
And whip her old ass with that wooden leg she wear
I'm from the Bloody 5th, and that's it, trick, bitch
You don't know who you're fuckin' with!
I'll plant this 10 1/2 so deep in your ass
That you'll be lookin like a faggot on the rag
I'm goin' for bam, like Scarface and NIP
What they leave of your ass, Willie D gonna rip
All of that mothafuckin' talkin' is for the birds
I do this (*gunshots*)
'Cause action speaks louder than words
Action speaks louder than-
Action speaks louder than words
Action speaks louder than-

Time to be accounted for the all-words spunk
Counterfeit gangstas, pranksters, and chumps
Talkin' real loud in front of a crowd, failure
I show your punk ass, nigga, better than I can tell ya
Signin' checks that your punk ass can't cash
Got your album cover full of punks wearin' ski masks
Who ain't never felt froggish, you won't leap
Barkin' like a bear, and bitin' like a flea
Bustas, straight suckas, mothafuckas
Donald Goines-readin-ass wanna-be hustlers
It's Seag' from Oakland, the one who lays order
Quit lyin' to kick it, and make a run for the border
Willie D, Bushwick, Scarface and Ganksta NIP
Gave me the tip on the niggas yappin' lips
Too Black hooked me, Lil' Jay booked me
Shakin' 'em, breakin' 'em, makin', and takin' 'em
Fakin' fuckin' rookies
And all that loud shit, nigga, don't start
They'll find your ass chopped
And stuffed in a shoppin' cart
Fools awake and give praise to the dark lord
Bring on the chalice, voodoo dolls and the Ouija boards
Straight from the alleys of Cali, 69th Curbs
Izz actions sp-izz-eaks l-izz-ouder th-izz-an w-izz-ords

Action speaks louder than-
