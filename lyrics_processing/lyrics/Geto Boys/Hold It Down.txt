I'ma fix this shit in '96
Uh
FACEMOB in the motherfuckin' house, the G.B
Come on
For the 1990-3-3
Heh heh
You know what I'm saying?

Gun shots rang out, niggas ducking, what the fuck?
Seen this nigga bite the bullet, it (Damn) fucked him up
Put him outside his innerself
Took his lifeline from him
Never got the chance to see who done it
Just niggas running, breaking to they shit
Befoe' the gun, put they ass up in the mix
And all I seen was him, laid out choking
Eyes to the back of his head, wide open
And I'm hoping that they don't find the killer
Because this nigga crossed a whole bunch of killers
But still a bunch of motherfuckas stand dazed
As they gaze at the corpse
Before they drop him in the grave 
That's all he spoke, lights out at your part
That's all she wrote
Everybody got a time and a place they die
But if your out there crowdin' up your space, it fly

Way down in the south, deep, on the creep
There was a monkey tried to step on big ol' lion feet
Nigga, peep the monkey was the runner and the runner did the dirt
Came up short on my skrilla and got his monkey-ass hurt
What it look like? On the south side it be hopping
Respect grew with the four-five if ya popping
I got him on the camera, fuckin' thief, wanna check mail?
Shot him now another bitch is waitin' just to exhale
But oh well, it's murder, tell me have you heard her?
Four-five knucklehead from the mob ready to serve y'all
Meanwhile, I'ma tell y'all all just what I hate
A fool that want to pop lip to turn and shake and gyrate

Up in the set you see me mobbing
Sipping on the Hennessy
Look up in the cut, damn, here comes my enemy
Eyes met, and you best bet, she got a bitches deep
Slowly, they moving closer so I taps my peeps
I'm 'bout to take this hoe, break this hoe down like a fresh O
But never let go, up in this game that's how the best rolls
I test those who ain't never seen me jump
Light they ass up like funk 'cause I ain't scared of you, punk
Motherfuckas that think I'll pull this trigga and blink
Leave they ass to stank, then I down a whole drank
Understand, I'm out the do', tag they toe, and leave 'em rotting
'Cause up in this game focus, aim, and you forgotten
I'm mopping on these hoes like they waxed floors
And I catch those tryna escape
Where they going? Up out the back door
And I'm at your head, with a thirty-eight
Ready to murder straight through your chest
With no time to waste I

Look at him, bleeding from the mob
There goes another nigga gone
Blood all over the rug, shoulda stayed his ass at home
Niggas can't get along, 'specially at these clubs
Trying to fuck these same bitches
Strange niggas, trying to check nuts
I just look as I drink my drink and I'm blowed
All of a sudden down to nothing
God damn, there they go with all that shit
Shankinh and shootinh and squabblinh
But you know I'm holdin it down
Gang type mobbing

I'm having bad luck Willie
I'm feeling like I lost my dog
Looking sick 'cause my motherfucking scratch is gone
Ain't no tommorrow, I gots to get some more today
Spray, all that's in my way if he don't mob this way
I'm sick of window shopping, eavesdropping
And hearing that you holding what we did
Up to yourself and tryin to fuck me on my end
Come again, come-come niggas get toasted
Oven roasted, evenly burnt, I pour the syrup
And leave 'em turned up
Is this that motherfuckin P-A-Y?
Back City and it's shitty but for show they time
You get what you got surely coming, the latex pipe
You see it and start running but can't run all night
Sooner or later you'll curl up, hit this sure shot shit
Ass naked for that motherfucking shit you did
[It's a dog nation and a dog time, everything must rewind, recognize
What you do with time]
And I'm
