Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

I've never been played by a ho
If the bitch is acting stupid, she's gotta go
So motherfuck a Miss Sad
If she fucks with me, I'ma kick her little monkey ass
See, you hoes got it wrong
Thinks if some nigga say he love ya, he ain't strong
Bitch, you're taking shit the wrong way
And I can tell right now it's gonna be a long day
I got to educate you brothers
If the bitch won't give up the play, fuck her
Move along to the next trick
See, I'm the type of nigga tell a ho suck dick
What if she's not sucking?
That's a waste of time, conversation and my fucking
I just put my fuckin' pants on
And tell the idiotic freak to take her tramp-ass home
'Cause I don't need a fuckin' dummy
I need a bitch to lick my nuts until my dick is cumming
And after that, you'll earn your gloves
Haha, just call me the gangster of love

I like bitches, all kind of bitches
To take off my shirt and pull down my britches
If she got big titties, I'll squeeze them and hold 'em
While she sucks my dick and lick my scrotum
And if she's got a friend, I'll fuck her too
Together we can play a game of switcheroo
I ain't the type who gets all mushy
I like to sit back and watch them eat each other's pussy
Weak people might say we're insane
But that's the other fuckin' level of the game
I'll turn your sister out if she fucks with me
You want to know my identity?

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

Bitches look at me like I'm a faker
Knowing goddamn well I'm a motherfucking heartbreaker
I'll have them crying for months
'Cause I done fucked their best friends and put a whipping on their cunt
They have their mothers to call
But if you fucked one mom, you done fucked them all
And I really don't give a fuck
'Cause if your mom offers me the pussy, she's stuck
Now that's what type of nigga I am
I'm always game to run a train, goddamn
Six different hoes a night
I use lubricated rubbers to make the pussy feel right
Better safe than be a victim
If ya got a jimmy hat, go 'head and dick 'em
I put the pussy in its place
And right before I nut, I pull it out, then to the face
And tell the bitch to keep suckin'
And prepare herself for her first butt-fuckin'
And when I'm done straight to the tub
Just call me the gangster of love
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie (Just call me the gangster of love)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

I'm a motherfucker, I put a bitch through a test
If she don't pass, she don't get blessed
If the test consist of fucking my whole crew
Well, bitch, goddamn, that's what you gotta do
You say you want to be down with Willie D
But yet you find it difficult to listen to me
Every time you fuck up and skip a class
I'ma put my goddamn foot in your ass
And if your father wants to buck up
I'll beat the wrinkles out the old motherfucker
I'll treat a bitch like a queen
But she has to realize I'm the goddamn king
Some jealous punk in town
Told my girl I was fucking around and she's still down
To do the same, you gotta have game
You want to know my name?

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Say, B
What's up D?
All the hoes mad at us 'cause we ain't paying for the pussy
And fighting over their asses and shit (Hahaha)
Yeah, but that's that other level of the game again
Damn straight
Say, man, while we on the subject of hoes
Whatever happened to the ho you used to fuck named Cathy?

Oh, Cathy, that ho was hot
The first piece of pussy that I ever got
She fucked me 'til I was coming
Put my nuts in her mouth and started humming
I said, shit, commence the checking
She started scratching my dillbag and said, "Hold up a second"
Turned me over on my back, gold
Opened up my butt cheeks and started licking out my asshole
That's why I guess that I'm the gangster
And, uh, Kathleen Johnson, sweetheart, I'd like to thank ya
Little hoes out there are getting stuck
By niggas like me and we really don't give a fuck
Big-ass titties and a sexy switch
Whatever you got, you deserved it, bitch
See, uh, I like to take 'em fast
Act like I love 'em and dog their motherfucking ass
Like for instance Ms. P
The bitch ran a game and tried to fuck over me
But I sensed it in the making
Talking about she's pregnant ("From you or that Jamaican?")
She said me, of course
So I drug her little ass like a motherfucking horse
That's what you get for trying to play me
I'll kick the bitch smack dead in the ass if she ever say we
Made a kid when I make it
I'll grab her by her motherfucking neck and try to break it
'Cause I know I wore a fucking glove
You know who you fucking with, bitch?
