Since he, one perfect of his kind
The Casanova of his time
Crowned himself to conquer the land
In craving for lust
Lust, one of the seven deadly sins
Punishment he has suffered
Look at him
What did he become?
Who is he now?
My mind is burning like fire
And my evil heart stands still
All the time they put me in a wheel chair
And their meds give me the thrill
Hold on
What's going on?
Am I alive or dead?
What's reality?
Come on
What's right or wrong?
Am I stumbling through the streets or
Is it just a stupid dream?
You might also likeI'm so lost, no, I'm not fine
I am close to borderline
Cause I'm sick, yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
I was out for not long
Three lusty women walked me home
When they left
They called me Mr. Madman
My head is constantly spinning
And my world is going down
All alone
I'm staring through the window
Cause the white men took my crown
Hold on
What's going on?
Am I alive or dead?
What's reality?
Come on
What's right or wrong?
Am I talking like E.T. or
Is it just a stupid dream?
I'm so lost, no, I'm not fine
I am close to borderline
Cause I'm sick, yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
Hey, you listen, I can sing
Those evil white men got me in
When they left here
They called me Mr. Madman
I am done with my tricks
Cause, yeah, the straightjacket fits
When I'm out, you will get
Who's Mr. Madman
I will take my last pill
Getting ready for the thrill
When I'm out, you will know
Who's Mr. Madman
I'm so lost, no, I'm not fine
I am close to borderline
Cause I'm sick, yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
Hey, you listen, I can sing
Those evil white men got me in
When they left here
They called me Mr. Madman
I am done with my tricks
Cause, yeah, the straightjacket fits
When I'm out, you will get
Who's Mr. Madman
I will take my last pill
Getting ready for the thrill
When I'm out, you will know
Who's Mr. Madman
