I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why I'm feeling so down

Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens, they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight

Oh, where did I go, how could I know
Defies all reason now

I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back to find my way home

Hey, little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you
Help me find what goes on in your captors mind
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
You might also like
We're twisting, we're turning, we're running, we're burning
Out on the run through the maze
On through the madness, no time for sadness
And no one can show us the way
Through Hangar 18, the tension now grows, we're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky, the stars are bright, they'll shine forever
On and on we fly so far away

Hey, little alien, what have they done to you?
Are there survivors here or have they all just disappeared?

I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back to find my way home

The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls and the world you know comes crashing down
When the sky falls and everything is changing
Changes came across the sky, welcome to the other side
