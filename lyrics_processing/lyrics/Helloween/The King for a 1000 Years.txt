Forgotten in his reich of shadows
Banned forever, one thought
The Lord of Evil was given name and place of the seventh sea
Shelter of the seventh key
Who was betraying us? I guess you know
There would be more than one name to name
Now he, whose name is many, searches for the one
The one strong enough to survive as his terrestrial hand
Enticement and promise will crown a king
A puppet on a string for a 1000 years
So they sing
Wouldn't it be nice to plunder with your eyes?
Whatever there's for you to see is yours to be
Let me be there, just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me afterlife, however high the price
I know your secrets
I know it all
I know your secrets
I see the hidden without light
I am your sickness
Biting you right behind your eyes
You might also likeDon't try to kill me
I cannot die a death you know
You and I will be
Heaven above and hell below
Brother, believe me
Father, conceive me
Brother, believe me
Perceive me
Time will be a turning wheel, we shove or retard
Time will be a toy, time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever, minus one day
Say you will obey and I
I will show, I will show
I will show your reich of gold
And I will show, I will show
I will show you friend and foe
Wouldn't it be nice
To reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you
Will give its due to you
Let me be there
Just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand
Just be my human hand
I know your secrets
I know it all
I will show, I will show
I will show your reich of gold
And I will show, I will show
I will show you friend and foe
No believers, all deceivers
No illusion, executions
Alienation, elimination
Chaos, no exoneration
No believers, all deceivers
No illusion, executions
We are king for a 1000 years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are the king for a 1000 years
Ages of fire
Aeon of darkness, fear and hate
Wake up my creatures
Stand up you bringer of man's fate
No one can kill us
We cannot die a death one knows
Mankind is sleeping
My victory near, their end so close
I know your secrets
I know it all
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Release me, believe me
Goodbye sorrows
Never more you have to fear futurity
Ohh
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Conceive me
Time will be a turning wheel, we shove or retard
Time will be a toy, time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever, minus one day
Say you will obey and I
I will show, I will show
I will show your reich of gold
And I will show, I will show
I will show you friend and foe
We are king for a 1000 years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king, we are the king
The king for a 1000 years, ohh
