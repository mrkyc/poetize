Step right this way
The dark ride is leaving soon
Just sign your name
On the dotted line
All I want is your soul
So tighten your belt and let's go
Standing in line to get into the fairground
Heading to the wicked side
One way ticket, there is no returning
Leave your soul at the gates
Out of doubt, no hope
Satan feeds our madness
Insanity confirms where we stand
Spit the red vile breath and wrath is our gift
That leads direct to Armageddon
Take a place on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up
Quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
Way too far from the other side
Step inside and take this final journey
Your fantasies will come true
Inclination without liberation
Life's carousel is catching you
You might also likeEven through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Driven to our final fate
Jump out of this game
Can we ever stop this ride to Hell?
Take a place on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up
Quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
Way too far from the other side
Is there any wonder
Why we came about?
Was it for love or to let sin abound?
Isn't it a wonder?
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
We must all believe
Will we find a way to the other side?
Heading for a light
Who is holding the key?
Why we can't see the dark ride
I force the engine of your deadly sins
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
I know too well you'll follow me
You'll follow me down
Is there any wonder
Why we came about?
Was it for love or to let sin abound?
Isn't it a wonder?
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
