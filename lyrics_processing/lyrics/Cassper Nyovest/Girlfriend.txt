She tellin' me she gon' leave (She tellin' me she gon' leave)

Wow, I think my baby wanna leave me
'Cause when I'm in the studio she never see me
So when I get back to the crib, she's smelling my clothes
She probably think I'm on the round with all of these hoes
And wiling up in the club and wilin' out with my thugs
The thug life is killing my love life
And she don't want to show me what love is like
I'm just hoping we can work it all out
Only because I think I know the main difference
Between a side chick and someone with significance
What's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do with a little bit of ooh?
That sound crazy I know
But if you tell me you don't get it then I'm letting you go, uh
I think I'm letting you go
If you tell me you don't get it then I-, uh

Eish, got a lot on my mind
I see the agony when I look in your eyes
I try to reassure you mara o'pallwa keho ntshepa
Of all the things in the world, I just had to be a rapper, right?
You kinda moved that my ex is a celebrity
I won't Karrueche you, my baby let it be
I won't lie ke rata dilo love
But I'm just hopin' we can work it all out
Roadblocks send a lesson if you don't get stuck
My nigga said it ain't cheatin' if you don't get caught
The other day my mom asked me if I missed my ex
I told her time heals all as I fixed my step, maar fede
We headlining enkare Khabonina's pose, don't
Mess up the picture like Khabonina's toe-oh-oes
This is KKD, I'd play you if you could play B!
Eintlek fede!
