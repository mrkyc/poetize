Oh boy, I'm back in the building
Like I'm looking for keys
Tell em I'm right at the top
If they looking for me
My money stay on my mind
But now it's part of my brain
I'm always late all the time
I'm sorry pardon my way
Papa told me I should get em and that's what I'm gonna do
And I be spending this money, like I got something to prove
When you start winnng awards, they start believing in you
It's double S in the name, like I am Sizwe n Scoop
I just got back from Atlanta, kleva you feelin the pressure
I'm looking at all these rappers
In my country tryna catch up, to all the shit that I did
They used to think that they were big, until I got in the pic
Got these rappers pleading the fifth
I'm the truth!

We the most popular discussion, cause we came up from nothing
They ask me why double S, I tell em I'm Superman's cousin
And that's the reason I'm fly
I bring the people alive
I hear subliminal lies, but I will never reply
If you ain't up on this level
And platinum lookin' like medal
I let you murder yourself, boy we gon' call you Brett Kebble
You niggas think that you on, I blame that shit you on
You niggas sniffing and sniffing
You using key like you dumb
It's hard to see talent perish
Cause you careless
Could've been baddest
Cause you money on 
Instead of spoiling your girls
Don't know the difference between, industry tings and the queen
Little man there's God in the scene
I know you know what I mean

Nigga I just got my head right
I'm in the studio errnight
I'm not the one to go at man, nigga that's just not a fair fight
That's a match-fix
You need practice
It gets that lit
Nigga I'm that big
You should call the cops to come fast quick
I just put the game in a casket
I'm a bad man, not a scared man
With a pump gun, from the block man
With exhaust pipes going rraa rraa
When the bass kick, it like van Damme
It's exciting
How I'm writing
Know, It's striking
I'm like lightning
Man I grew up listening to kwaito
But I love rap, I'm a hybrid
I'm like whoo!
I'm getting money like we supposed to
(I'm like whoo!)
I know the game boy, I could coach you
(I'm like whoo!)
But I'm in love with the dough though
(I'm like whoo!)
It's all love, but I'm prepared to go to war though
