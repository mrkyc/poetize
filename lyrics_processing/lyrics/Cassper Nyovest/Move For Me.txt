Don't change the islands
We fly you ride it
It's all reviving, the vibe is, delighting
Girl I love that TikTok timing
Put you on SnapChat to hide it
Then I get deep down inside it
I get, excited
Boka-boka give me love everyday
Girl I love the way you move, I just see you when you
Boka-boka when you mash up the place
Girl your body is a juice
Same coz a dem socka, suger mama, and another, and another
Flex on your broda, bab shoda, we go harder, and harder
