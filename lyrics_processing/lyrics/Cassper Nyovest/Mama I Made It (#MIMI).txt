Mama I made it
Happy belated
I drop the top to the Porsche and I stick out
My head and scream Mama I made
It (yo, yo)
Mama I made it (Yo, yo, yo)
Happy belated (Mama I made it for real)
They call me the greatest (Uh huh)
I drop the top to the Porsche
And I stick out my head and scream
Mama I made it

Mama ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to make you proud
I know I put you through a lot of shit
I'm sorry the calling was loud
But you, you let me drop out of school
All of your friends used to call you a fool
Now when I go home I pull up in a coupe
And ask all my lawyer cousins what it do?
What it do? How you feel?
You like my car? Check the grill
Don't worry I got it, I paid the bill
The papers is lyin', I just made a mill
But aye, I should play you my new song with
Talib, man that shit is sounding amazing
And I

Eish, mama I just read the papers
They wrote a whole lot of fake stuff
I hope that it didn't affect you
We got this far through the power of prayer

That's why they're trying to break us
We broke the rules so they hate us
