I think I need to slow down
I think the money got me zoned out
I mean how many Rolexes do I own now?
Maybe I should start acting broke now
Cause my success turned the game into a cold heart
It got too personal, I can't handle the energy
I can't go out no more I got too many enemies
I get the feeling that all my niggas is scared of me
Everything changed when I started paying them salaries
Ain't fun anymore
My bodyguard don't leave his gun anymore
Me and my dad never have one-on-ones anymore
Man, hago tshwan' anymore
My mom is proud but she says she feel like she don't have a son anymore
I don't enjoy the shit I got anymore
Can't even turn up with the squad anymore
Endorsement deals got me living like I won Idols
I'm squeaky clean, I don't wanna piss the companies off
But I ain't worked this hard to be a prisoner
Lord send me an angel, I need a miracle
I need answers I tried to remain good
When Pac died, I'm one of the people that blamed Suge
Why we so quick to judge?
Why do we think we know everything?
Why am I so scared of the wedding ring?
Why do I drink this Hennessy like it's medicine?
I mean it's pretty clear my success offends niggas
Y'all really try to catch up, I commend niggas
I know taking me down is the plan niggas
But y'all ain't half as dedicated as I am niggas
Look, growing up I never had nothing
So I'll never get used to the fact that I have money
But you motherfuckers will never get it though
