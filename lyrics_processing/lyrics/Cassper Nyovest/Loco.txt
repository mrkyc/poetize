Ah, tseding tsona ha di  etse sense
Ha re ka bua nnete hela ka pela ha Ntate Modimo
(Bua nnete) Huh?

Ayo, I give my heart and soul to this, but yo these niggas never notice it
I don't take long to decide, I just go for it
I am not controlled by my pride, that's my approach to it
Put my whole hood in the side so they could grow from it
But niggas couldn't tell a blessing if it hit them
They only know how to measure the money that you give them
The only help they really want is help that has money in it
You offer another option and then they hardly willing
But how about I help you think so you could grow?
Or help you use the little that you have so you could know
I'm not saying that I don't wanna help you with the dough but that's temporary
I'd rather teach you ways you can invoke
Like teach you how to fish instead of giving you fish
Wanna help you become self-sufficient cause you my nigga
But all you wanna hear is "How much do you need?"
Fuck outta here nigga, you know I got people to feed
My mama been feeling ill, sister can't pay the bills
And you want me to worry 'bout how other niggas feel?
This shit crazy, I guess it comes with the fame
I got niggas who never met me telling me that I've changed

Y'all can go and claim that I'm a bad person
I don't give a fuck, I know I'm good people
Y'all can go and tell all the stories until I look evil
Seen it all and done it all, sometimes I don't believe people
I'm just careful of how I treat people
'Cause I know pride can kill a man
Too many been the best then they fell off so bad
They wish they could cut their head off
Depression kickin' in, le borderline ya botseno
Nagana motho asa tlhola afford-a le di-Kellogg's
Moer, ba ka itumela
Dira di ka ipulela like "O wele die-moerskont, o reka ka di-coupon!"
Damn! Just the thought of it is crazy on its own
I mean, think about it maybe on a daily when alone
Like eish, maybe if I didn't blow up this big
Maybe if I didn't make history
Maybe if I didn't sign myself and told 'em to beat the system
Maybe all the pressure would be different
But then again, I will be remembered as the guy that settled
I gotta take the punches, new level new devil
My mama ain't famous, but journalists harass her
The joke ain't funny, they laugh cause it's Cassper
The retweets be mean as shit, they be like "Voetsek-tsek"
But then they claim I'm harsh and arrogant when I clap back
I feed my family and I use my gift
Man, what you buy with that fuckin' matric?
Oh for real?
That shit mad, loco, that shit crazy (Ayo I can't take that shit)

Niggas who don't bath (I can't take that shit)

I think niggas who don't bath are the worst
Actually I'm lying they come right after the Hip Hop hero's
You know them niggas who know Hip-Hop more than everybody, the presidents of Hip Hop, you know, the prime ministers of punchlines?
Them niggas, know bo pap'aka o owner Hip Hop
You know those niggas? I hate them niggas, man
