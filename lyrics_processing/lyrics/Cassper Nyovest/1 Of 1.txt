Yeah
See I be going through some things, got a lot on my mind
I made it out, but still feel like I'm on the grind
I thought about, taking my life a bunch of times
Used to get this feeling when I was, still on the grind
I thought that money fixed everything, but it creates more
I thought they loved me for my money but they hate more
This ain't what I came for, I came for a great cause
You think that it's rapping but my movement create jobs
I can't relate to this
I wasn't made for this but I had to adapt cause I'm guessing this what greatness is
A bunch of lames predicted I would lay the faith for it
I'm just the greatest kid, don't tell me who your favourite is, yeah
Usually calm but lately I been belligerent
Thuto is a classic though they try to belittle it
All you niggas rap about is metaphors and punchlines
But somehow, they never recognise me as a lyricist
How many times you gon' rap about your skills?
It's getting boring now, that shit sounds like a drill
I wrote about my father and some shit I really feel
When I loved the way I did it man that shit was sounding ill
But they turn a blind eye on it, they never notice me
But praise some niggas for rapping 'bout smoking weed and groceries
I just want the money and the power
The money to change my life, the power to save ours

Let's take it, let's take it back to basics
An A4 page and a pen, get creative
I fell in love with poetry, my skill was okay
But I was just writing how I feel that day
Now fastforward, shit changed, big deal, my opinion matters
Used to be an opener, AB de Villiers batting
Still as brilliant as was, wait, minimum effort
My pockets healthy, but I'm still illy as ever
With less effort, easy does it yeah
I don't even think much
Team no sleep, fuck it man, I don't even blink much
Who on my level? Not too many I can think of
They either dead or retired like Eric Tinkler
Ka mafoko ke sele man! Nigga I'm really far
Jacob, bona bana ba Zuma aw'leth' umshini wam'
I'm cold-blooded le mathi aka a tsidifa
You spit midget raps, all your albums full of mini-bars
We ain't the same tsotsi, hayi relax
Y'all niggas lie on my raps isn't tidy, facts
You see, I don't give a fuck about these titles
In fact, I had my middle finger up when I was writing these raps, yeah
I changed the game forever, really and truly
And fucked all my celeb crushes instead of groupies
Had to remind y'all who the fuck y'all are to me
Cause all of your favourite rappers wore Cassper Nyovest hoodies motherfucker
Only me, there's nobody, (nobody else)
Who could do it like I do it (ey yo)
Only me, there's nobody, (there's nobody else)
Who could do it like I do it (no body)
Only me (yeah) there's nobody, (nobody else)
Who could do it like I do it
