I don't even smoke cigars but I'ma light up a cigar for this one
Just talk my shit yo
This wasn't originally on the album, it just made it 'cause I just had some shit on my mind
Yeah

Laughing to myself thinking about it all
I'm amused by seeing platinum plaques on the wall
Niggas wanna talk, I just wanna ball
If you ever lose it, it was never yours
All I ever wanted was to make my mom proud
And now we flexing on them, see me with the guns out
She say she can't shout, we fucking in her aunt's house
Prrrrrrrrra
I only make one sound
We was once poor as hell, but who could tell
I smell pretty fucken wealthy when it's Bleu Chanel
No evidence, you know we maneuver well
You can tell she wants me if you knew her well
I'm just chilling while my haters working overtime
Ciroc boy, but I got a sober mind
We don't drink to get drunk, we just celebrate
Winners like seeing winners so we never hate
Record labels still scheming, tryna control me
Taking me off the radio just to show me how much power they have
But dawg as you know me I got a letter from Zuma
And bought a Presidential Rolex like mama I made it
(Mama I made it)
Nah really mama I made it (ma I made it)
They won't say it in public but I'm the greatest
Women and men lie, numbers are never mistaken
Highest selling still looking for validation
I dropped "Skelm" just to show them that I rap still
Then I came and killed the game with an adlip
(Sha-sha)
Ha, full court friendlies at the mansion
Oh y'all thought it was a game? Shit is mad real
You might also like
Bentleys and diamonds young niggas shining
Everyone that's running with me is some young niggas grinding
Pull up to my old yard, yeah nigga Maftown
Selling out my shows I'm making rack now
Yeah we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now
'Cause we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now

Yeah, first we finger fucked the game now we penetrating
You switch sides, we gon' kill you with no hesitation
You know it's pineapple Ciroc when we celebrating
AG Mobile half a billion from association
(Stats)
When the corporates need their numbers they come see us
Ghetto-ologist, they know we got the streets locked
They don't think that we see it but nah we smart
Niggas ask for forgiveness in public just for the PR
But I just play along, work and get my prayer on
Let's get this money all the funny shit is for later on
I need mad money, brown paper bag money
You gon' end up dead if you try and take this cash from me
Yeah, this the shit that make me miss the Full Clip
Rappers talking I just hit 'em with a blue tick
It's just tacky hating on me at this very point
Flying private, writing raps in this Bentley noise
It's a Tree my nigga, we on a mission
I got one question, what happened to your predictions?
Besides these two niggas that's Nasty and Emtee
The game ain't really changed, you niggas don't make a difference
It's time we take we this shit back to the streets
I made sure that all my niggas get a piece
They probably thought that "Shebeleza" was my peak
Diamonds dancing, see the watch and a chain got a routine
Bentleys and diamonds young niggas shining
Everyone that's running with me is some young niggas grinding
Pull up to my old yard, yeah nigga Maftown
Selling out my shows I'm making rack now
Yeah we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now
'Cause we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now
We living good

As soon as I wake up in the morning
I kick the sheets and I start hustling
There's someone on my side ain't no way that I am going back to nothing
I used to dream about the fancy cars and diamonds chains, oh
I'd rather get inspired than hate 'cause I want the same

I don't know about you but cash rules everything around me
(Cream)
I don't know about you but cash rules everything around me
(Cream)
I don't know about you but cash rules everything around me
(Cream)
I don't know about you but cash rules everything around me
(Cream, dollar, dollar, dollar bill y'all)

(Cream, dollar, dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Bentleys and diamonds young niggas shining
Everyone that's running with me is some young niggas grinding
Pull up to my old yard, yeah nigga Maftown
Selling out my shows I'm making rack now
Yeah we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now
'Cause we riding, looking for bad ones
We having mad fun, we living good right now

You know a lot of people come up to me and say
"How many times are you gonna rap about cars?"
"How many times are you gonna rap about Bentleys?"
I say, "all my life"
Yeah I'll never get it
If you've never been poor you'll never understand my pain
If you've never been rich you'll never understand my joy nigga
We made it nigga
This is real life nigga
Check my watch nigga
But I'm just hoping that you guys are inspired you know what I'm saying
Don't just watch us man, don't just watch us
Get inspired, do something
Stop waiting on the government, get off your ass man
Dreams come true
Don't ever listen to losers telling you that you can't do anything in this world
Dreams come true
And that's true shit
I'm a living testimony of that
God is good all the time, all the time God is good
We living good right now
