I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but
I won't, I won't let it crush my vibe
Giving my all, and I
Push through the pain
One day I'ma ball
Doing my thang
I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but
I won't, I won't let it crush my vibe
Giving my all, and I
Push through the pain
One day I'ma ball
Doing my thang

I make this shit look easy, I make this shit look easy
Went from hu kopa lift-i, to driving a Bentley GT
But trust me my nigga I went through the most and I dealt with so many emotions
My mama was crying
I told her I'm trying it's tough but don't ever feel hopeless
Told her wipe your tears mama
It's nothing to fear mama
As long as I'm here mama
You a millionaire mama

Yeah
Half of the time it's a war
I don't know what's going on
I knew it would rain but it poured
I don't give a fuck anymore
I almost lost my confidence in making music
They used to love me now they make excuses
Can't fuck with everyone I'm very choosy
Bipolar attitude I'm very moody
All my niggas got on and they changed
Too much money too much fuckin' vein
Too successful I'm stuck in a cage
Too successful there's nothing to gain
I feel like I hit the pinnacle, drove all the cars and I fucked all the women too
And I did the things that they couldn't do
But still they find something to ridicule
Can I fuckin' live?
Before you critique me in anyway
Please do all the things that I fuckin' did
Who woke up the game if it wasn't me?
Who woke Hay-Hay-Hay!
Who woke up the game!?
Who put niggas on?
How far would you niggas have gone if I wasn't involved?
Ask Chad Da Don
My intention was to build niggas
Y'all forcing my hand, I'ma kill niggas
At least all my haters were real with us
I gave you your shine but you still bitter
I can't trust anybody
Though I love my niggas, though I love my niggas
But we used to do this for the love my niggas
Where the love my nigga?
I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but
I won't, I won't let it crush my vibe
Giving my all, and I
Push through the pain
One day I'ma ball
Doing my thang
I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but

I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but
I won't, I won't let it crush my vibe
Giving my all, and I

I know, I know it gets hard sometimes but
I won't, I won't let it crush my vibe
Giving my all, and I
Push through the pain
One day I'ma ball
