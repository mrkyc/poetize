Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
(When you're destined to be higher)
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher (Oh)
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher

You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need (Yeah)
And you are my destiny
You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need
And you are my destiny

Look, I know you heard a lot of things about me
I mean most of it's true, I'm an asshole
I've hurt women, I'm kind of rude
But I ain't that broke and I got issues but I've improved
Really had hope my big heart was bulletproof
I was under the impression that people just engineer love
But lately these are thoughts that I steer from
I lived a couple years with out a teardrop
I don't wanna die for love like Reeva Steenkamp
I keep it safe, but you make me wanna risk it all
And I get a little sad when you miss my calls
And that's childish, I never act like this at all
I can't be catching feelings when there's so much of this shit involved
Like how my niggas will react if I wifed you
You think my fans won't accept you so I hide you
Hate that I have to lie to people and say I like you
When I know that it's deeper than that
And this is my truth
I love what's inside you way more than your pretty face
I don't usually go on dinner dates
I prefer to stay at home but you got me doing different things
And I'm really loving this exchange
I just need you to be patient
I'm getting done working, on all my trust issues and my pride 'cause you worth it
I'm learning about commitment and turning down all the curses
I know buying you gifts don't make me a better person
You might also like
You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need (Yeah)
And you are my destiny
You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need
And you are my destiny

Look, I've also heard a lot of things about you
And I know half of it's true
Don't you try and act innocent like you ain't done some wicked shit
But I'm still here treating you like I'm your first
Pretending that loving you can never hurt
Like I ain't bothered when you party with my enemies
But honestly I'm not as strong as I pretend to be
You know how niggas be
We like acting all tough when we know that deep down this shit affecting me
Looking for Cupid 'cause I think I got shot with an arrow
Love is risky so we choose to be safe and we settle
Cause every secret that I tell you can turn into ammo
Loyalty is rare as an AKA and Cassper collabo
It's crazy 'cause we were done before I finished this
I knew I never should have trusted that you innocent
'Cause now you out here, leaving me for a business man
How am I supposed to believe that you was genuine?
I mean does he open the door for you like I do?
Do you think that he will risk it all for you like I do?
Will he get on his fucking knees and change your title?
In simple terms do you think that he would wife you?
And maybe this is karma for my wrongs
I know I broke a lot of women's hearts before
I really thought that we would prove my niggas wrong
But they not, so we love and we learn, I used to think
You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need (Yeah)
And you are my destiny
You were and you are and will be
The soul in the air that I breathe
My heart and the love that I need
And you are my destiny

I can feel it, I can feel the magic
Tell me if you can imagine
Don't you dare resist the power
'Cause love will take you higher baby
Can you feel the magic? (I can feel it)
Tell me if you can imagine (Oh)
Don't you dare resist the power
But love will take you higher baby
Yeah, yeah, woh

Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
(Will)
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
(Will take you)
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
(Oh, you are my destiny)
Love will take you higher babe
Love will take you higher
You were and you are and will be
(Love will take you higher)
The soul in the air that I breathe
(Love will take you higher)
My heart and the love that I need
(Love will take you higher)
And you are my destiny
(Love will take you higher)
