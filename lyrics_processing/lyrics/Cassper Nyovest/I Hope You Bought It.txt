Who ever thought that I would make it
This far but those who hated?
They saw potential in a boy and they delayed him
Went from wannabe, to little nigga, to celebrated
Reality kept sayin' "You're fucked", ambition saved him
Now I'm their favorite
I could have stuck to school but how is it my life if I play by your rules?
Euphonik told me that rap don't make money wanna prove him wrong
Wonder what that's gonna take from me
Mom and dad were both teachers
Imagine tryna sit them down on some "Uhm, ke jinda sgela."
Leaving a system of safe 'cause I'ma rap
It broke their hearts and I felt kinda whack
But I got history to make though
In a booth like a pay phone
Ever since sixteen I've never spent a day home
I'm on the grind for gold-earth
The broke have no worth
Welcome to the city of Joburg
I'm in a city where things is mad different
When you show love, they say you ass kissin'
Or dick ridin', they hit on us 'cause we illy
It's just a blueprint, there ain't no love in the city, hah
Ntwana Maftown, kyo kai mamela
Pha'misa kasi, let it grow, climb the ladder
I just wanted to spit dope rhymes
My man I-
Never thought that I'd get a co-sign from Jabba
(And) And ever since I did a song with J'
Shit changed, you'd swear I wasn't hot all along, it's great
And the money is a small issue
We big shots, who gives a fuck about a small pistol?
Scoop told me I should take down names
Ya'll should thank him, I was about to take down lames
Break down games
Pull the trigger, who's on blast?
My advice come from niggas who don't rap
They believe in the man
Which is part of the reason I believe that I can
Compilers making me struggle, they ain't feeling the man
Wish the media would treat me like Kiernan and 'em
I hope you feeling this passion
These dreamers whom capitalist
Flow is irrationally
It's known to be hazardous kiss
Bronchilis spasmous bliss
Rose from weak lazarous bits
Overly fashion and sling
No-one can fathom the kid
I'll make you cheeky show love
Still regret the day me and TP broke up
We were suppose to be leaders
Ntwana tsa lefika
There was a need for it, re ne re ba feeda
But anyway that's what the green figures do
I'm glad me and green fingers cool
'Cause man, what's Nyovest without music?
Whats Nyovest without music?
Perseverance and hard work, that's all it took nigga
RIP Brown Dash, that was one good nigga
You saw talent in me, lala kahle pantsula
Middle finger to bohle be na mo papula
People like actin' immune
To the bullshit of the world till it happens to you
The biggest killer in the country ain't HIV
Man it's Twitter, now give me the hate I need
It's the same kid, who never used to be your favourite
And now you on my dick, you tryna prove that I'm the greatest
I entertain the niggas who work behind me like gay sex
But I dont give a real fuck, my attitude on latex
Everyday is the same shit, same script, different cast
Dont care what you say if I didn't ask
They used to say "Quit", didn't budge
Now I got the same pricks giving love
He la titina

They said my kind don't fit and so I forced it
First classic in a bag, I hope you bought it
They said my kind don't fit and so I forced it
First classic in a bag, I hope you bought it

They said my kind don't fit and so I forced it
'Cause I believe if I don't quit I'll get a portion
And like these other lames, they want comfort these days
If you, change to be loved then you love to be changed
It's hard to be brave
I understand but think about it
You can never lose your mind if you are honest
You ain't shit without your decency
So bitches never get shit from me
I buy his and his, uh
No homo though
The boy spit like I overdosed
'Cause I be bringing gifts to the hood, I'm like a door to door
I really hope you reigned forever
Its amazing how we came together
Everybody is curious
They probably wanna know, "How does he live?"
I got these yellow bones politicin', but fuck that
Proud to announce that I just bought my mama a crib
