Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Cassper
I'm a young nigga from the streets
Dumb niggas say I came up cause of beef
Hood niggas listen to my songs every week
They say every single line give them hope to believe
That they dreams is in they reach
So every single time I perform in the hood, they don't clap they say "Preach"
Nigga I wouldn't come out, with a scratch on my sleeve
Even if you attack in my sleep
It's a fact, I'm a beast
I just laugh at these G's tryna compare themselves to Cass
I'm like "Please, ain't no man in my league"
Took twenty four awards at the age of 24 with one album
When will you understand that you weak compared to me?
Don't act like you don't see him
Dropping classics like kids at the museum
I work my ass off but some days is carpe diem
And I'ma cop a Bentley the day you cop a BM
(Whoo!)
You might also like

Yeah, uh
See right about now nigga
You already know who the man is
And if it's not clear come and see me at the mansion
And chances, you might find bad bitches dancing
Ignore my nigga, let's get straight to the action
Azishe tsotsi!
Now that I have your attention, let me tell you why I always floss like a dentist
I came a long way I used to distribute pamphlets
So ain't no way in hell I won't act outlandish, yeah
This for my gangsters, we made it way up
And I ain't never lost a battle since day one
I try to keep it humble like "Eish tjo, kea e zama"
But everybody knows I done fucked the game
Nigga I'm major
Nah, I'm really major you should check the stats
Even on stage I bring the hits out back to back
I'm in the stu' everyday tryna perfect the craft
I know Bridge got me I never gotta check the cash, whoa!
