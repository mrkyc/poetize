I just want to do God's will
And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain
And I've looked over
And I've seen the Promised Land

I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
(Let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky
(Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up)

Turn up (Woohoo)

You might also like
These niggas were hoping I loved it
But lately I've been on my boss shit
Not the car bitch but the cop shit
The crib is looking like a mosh pit
Bitches everywhere, bitches everywhere
You married baby you should stop this
We can't be fucking on the couches
We can't be fucking on the couches
I'll be killing every single nigga
Never miss him if I pull the trigger
Bet I hit her if you seen her with us
Diamonds flick I got the city lit up
We the new government
They treat us like Zuma 'n'em
Act the fool I could Luda on 'em
One obatla huchoonagaleng?
If you thinking I'm lucky
I'm walking so I get to keep the money
I know you niggas tryna get it from me
But I ain't budging, I ain't fucking budging
I ain't budging, I ain't fucking budging
I'm the king
Sexy nigga I go hard in the gym
Why do women show you love when you win?
I just spent a quarter milli on the rim
I go too hard
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
(Let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky
(Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up)

Itla mpona le Malaika
Ain't nobody on my break up
And I'm busy getting shaped up
Been wildin' since the break up
Three piece and it's tailored
Who dat in a Maybach?
Who dat with a Datejust?
Never seen a real nigga with a fake watch!
Who dat with a Datejust?
All my niggas 
You be looking like you tryna do the Nae Nae
I'm too much for them, I make it rough for them
I got so many bitches I bought a bus for them
If she ever fuck my nigga then I fuck her friend
Dem a watch me, me I never watched for dem
Nigga I be counting money everyday
This life is only for the brave, make no mistake
They be dabbing through the phase
Calamari with the stakes
Hop in the Range
Driver, driver take me to my jeweler
I got diamonds dancing ka re mapantsula
I got bitches hoping for 
I fuck 'em all that's the 
(Hands up)
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky
(Hey, hey, hey let me see your hands up)
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky

But it really doesn't matter with me now
Because I've been to the mountain top
