Well the streets are all crowded
Lots of people around
And there's music playing
But I can't hear a sound
Just the sound of the rain
Falling silently down
Livin' ain't been livin'
Since you put me down

Yeah life goes on around me every day
But it might as well be half a million miles away

It's like a ghost town (Ghost town) without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town)  without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town) , baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town (Ghost town) , until you come back to me
Oo, oo, till you come back to me

Well, I wish I still had you
Had you here next to me
Baby, where did you go?
Baby, why did you leave?
Oh the world, it keeps turnin'
But it don't turn for me
Without you in my life
My life ain't no place to be

There's only lonely days and empty nights
Ain't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' right
Nothing's feeling right

It's like a ghost town (Ghost town) without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town) without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town), baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town (Ghost town), until you come back to me
Oo oo, till you come back to me

Darlin', I wanna leave this town
Don't wanna be around
I'm gonna leave this town
It's like a ghost town


It's like a ghost town (Ghost town) without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town) without your love
Like a ghost town (Ghost town), baby, can't you see?
A ghost town (Ghost town), until you come back to me (Ghost town)
Oo oo till you come back to me (Ghost town)
It's like a ghost town (Ghost town)
It's a ghost town (Ghost town)
Hey hey, it's like a ghost town (Ghost town), can't you see
It's like like a ghost town (Ghost town)
Til you come, till you come back to me (Ghost town)
Oo oo oooooo (Ghost town)
