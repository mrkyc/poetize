Clock strikes ten, it's a Saturday night
Money in my pocket, and it feels all right
Not stayin' home, gonna stay out late
Gotta hear some rockin' music - it feels just great

Clock strikes twelve, Saturday night
All the creeps are sleepin', all the cools in sight
All the kings and queens, they're out tonight
Lookin' for some action till it feels all right

Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight

Clock strikes two, I'll be out all night
All my money's spent, but that's all right
Not goin' home, gonna stay out late
Get ready for some action, want some action tonight

Clock strikes four, I want some more
Everybody's layin' on the floor
Not goin' home, gonna stay out late
Gotta get rockin' before it's too late
