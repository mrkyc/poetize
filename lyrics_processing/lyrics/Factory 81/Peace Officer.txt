Factory 81 cutting their first full length
Here's a little message about the fucking pigs:
Hey you find yourself, you're walking down the street
Every corner you turn you're just another freak
Catch yourself and jump back again
And don't believe; the cops can never be your friend
Now you'll see when you're down on your knees again
Their fist in your back and their knee in your neck
They're there to serve and protect, huh?
It's more like beat and fuck with zero
How can I be free?
Slap these cuffs on me I'm just a freak zero
How can I be free?
Slap these cuffs on me I'm just a freak zero
Now you'll see when you wake to another day
It always starts out with the freaks
Catch yourself and jump back again
And don't believe; the cops can never be your friend
Now you'll see when you're down on your knees again
Their fist in your back and their knee in your neck
They're there to serve and protect, huh?
It's more like beat and fuck with zero
