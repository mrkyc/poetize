Right

I, I've been so good so you are
Rise right in me
I have suffered in the light
With no one to help me

Leering at yourself, I watch you walkin' with that pop again
See you backhand yourself, rich white bitch
Leering at yourself, I watch you walkin' with that pop again
Send me off to the boys in blue, rich white bitch

I'm losing my mind, but I'm so alive now
I'm laughing inside, and I try to fade away

I need you to see, I don't wanna know
I have my own mind, I don't wanna know
I need you to see, I don't wanna know
I have my own mind, but I don't want

Leering at yourself, I watch you walkin' with your pop again
See you backhand yourself, rich white bitch
Leering at yourself, I watch you walkin' with your pop again
Send me off to the boys in blue, rich white bitch
You might also like
I open my eyes and I'm so liked now
I'm laughing inside as I watch you fade away

You could see me suffer, whatcha thinkin', whatcha think of me
Watch me suffer, I am trying
You can call me stubborn, watch me suffer, whatcha do to me
You can watch me suffer, let you cry

Mad at yourself you punk, you'll still be lyin'
You watch me suffer, just to bring it back again
I don't wanna find the things that never let off me
Watch yourself, livin' a lie
I open my eyes, and I'm so liked now
I'm laughing inside, as I want to fade away
I hear my own voice, it feels so familiar
I'm losing my mind, but I'm so liked now

I'm just a lover, I want to find out
I'm just a lover, I want to find out
I'm just a lover, I want to find out
I'm just a lover, I want to find
This is forever, I watch you fry again
This is forever, ah
This is forever, I watch you fry again
This is forever

Leering at yourself, I watch you rock it with your pop again
See you backhand yourself, rich white bitch
Leering at yourself, I watch you rock it with your pop again
See you backhand yourself, rich white bitch

You can see me suffer, you can watch me hit the moon
You can watch me suffer, I am trying
You can find me suffered, fuckin' with the clear moon
