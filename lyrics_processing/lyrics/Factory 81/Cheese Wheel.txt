I believe in no one but me
All eyes on me
Pointing at me
Falling you see
Your words deceive
CHORUS:
I say what I want to say
Doesn't matter what you think' cause I still live this way
& then you come into my life
Stick me in the back with your knife
& now as I look at you all these things that you would put me through
I won't let you look away
Won't you fuckin' watch me bleed?
I can see I'm not free
I believe in one but me
Now you take a look at your life for a while
& you see yourself, you're just like a child
Preach about things you've seen
Ignoring all the things that you're supposed to see
While you watch your watch as time wastes away
& you feel the need to feed on others' pain
Brag about the things but you fuckin' lied
Brag about the things but you fuckin' tried
You're just a slave
Now you take a look at your life once again
& you see the fuckers supposed to be your friends
Brag about the things but you fuckin' tried
Brag about the things but you fuckin' lied
Now you sell your soul
You sell your life away
You sign your name
You even sell your pain
Brag about the things but you fuckin' tried
Brag about the things but you fuckin' lied

I say what I want to say
Doesn't matter what you think, what you got & all that you do to me
All these things that I could never see & now as I walk away
All these things I could never say I won't let you look away
Won't you fuckin' watch me bleed?
You're a slave
Weak inside you're a slave
Feeding you mind you're a slave
Selling your pain you're a slave
Signing your name you're a slave
Open your doors you're a slave
Weak inside you're a slave
Feeding your mind you're a slave
