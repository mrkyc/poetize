Until it hits me
And I bring it back now
For all you to see
Now, we've been crucified
Just to cover a lie
That would burn them alive
Now you sit there and try
To pretend it's alright
When they fuck with your heart, yeah
Watch your back don't do the things that you won't wanna see
You're wacked yourself cause you're living out your pocket, dream
Not your face as you wanna take away again
Get your back. Living out your pocket dream
Catch yourself as you look again
The offers slipping in the fast lane
Hit yourself as you hit the wall
It's that time to fall
Hit your back and you'll be what you wanna see
You're wacked yourself cause you're living out your pocket, dream
Hit your back cause you wanna take away again
Hit yourself, living out your pocket dream
What's up now you fucking hoe?
I am a wanna-be
Let your sleep and the dreams that are never good
Do watch yourself but i wanna make someone a part
Off the box as you wanna take away again
Watch yourself, getting off your pocket dream
Hit yourself as you lose can go (control?)
You were sitting in the fast lane
Hit your back as you hit the wall
Now it's that time to fall
Not yourself cause you'll be what you wanna see
You are the one who's been living out this pocket dream
Hit yourself as you wanna take away again
Watch your back, living out your pocket dream
I
Yeah I fight, and i'm blacked again
I
Nothings what it seems
The way you work, the way i listen, you are present
And I'm mellow when i'm fine
Never meant i never been to all
You wouldn't want your sole
You only wanna know the things that i say
And you're the one in front of me
Now, do hit me, i lie
Now, you hit me, i lie
Oh yeah
Yeah
I
Yeah
I
I don't hear or know what you say
All through the year and now i melt down
I watched it all as it rinsed away
I love the things that i've called you
I fake it all and now i wash again
I have the pains again in side me
I paint it all as i strip away
All of the things that are riling
And I forgive you for all the lies
Enter my face and see through me
And all the pain that i tucked away
The things that i thought defy me
And I will fear as I will see
And i will fear with you once again
I thank myself and live forever, and ever
No, thought your gonna bite right through another friend
Are the one who's been living with some (redneck)
I'm suprised that you wanna take away again
Hit your back, living out your pocket, dream
No, we've been through so fine
Just to cover a lie
Different friend i'm alive
