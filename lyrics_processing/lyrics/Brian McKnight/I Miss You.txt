When she said bye-bye
That's when I realized that I wasn't so tough
I had to get over it
At the point when I needed her so much
Then three months later my cell phone rang
From a number that I'd never seen before
Never thought, never dreamed, didn't know who it could be
I should have let it go to voicemail instead

I said hello and she said
(I miss you)
She said (I miss you)
She said (I miss you)
I said hello and she said (I miss you)
She said (I miss you)
She said (I miss you)
Now what am I gonna do?

She said she stays busy, asked how I've been doing
I said, "I've been getting by"
She said that's she's sorry and if it's all possible
Could we give it one more try
I hear she's crying and I, I can't deny
I'm conflicted more than I've ever been before, oh oh
Never thought, never dreamed, can't believe that this is real
I should have send her on to voicemail instead

Now what am I gonna do?

No way to know what tomorrow might bring
But I'll be lying if I said I don't feel the same
I've been silently standing on the sideline
Watching the time go by
Not even sure if I was back in the game
I did my best to get you out of my heart
Only managed to get you out of my head
Well, I wasn't ready for the celly to ring
I took a breath and

I said hello and you said
(I miss you)

Oh oh (I miss you)
