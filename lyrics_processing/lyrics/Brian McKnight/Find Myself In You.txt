I was so lonely
Though there was so many someone's waiting
I'm so glad that this ain't that
See girl you're the only
Reason I can make it through the long day
And that's a fact

Baby, I can't wait to get next to you
Girl I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body
Baby I can't help but to tell the truth
Girl it's so hard to wait till no one else is around

I'm gonna try to keep myself together
Till I find myself in you (Baby no no)
Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you (no no)

I hate to keep you waiting
But there are some things that need my attention
Before I can get back to you
I'm anticipating
My hands all over your body, baby you know
I know just what to do
