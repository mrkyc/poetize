Brian McKnight, Trackmasters
Here we go
(Woooooo!)
Kobe
Brian McKnight
G Star
Red hot baby

Honey listen up
The lies and pain, it's enough
End it
Exit
Leave homes' alone
Rock wit Tone
The New York giant, ya man's the client
I'm the president
Money long like jail sentences
Sentences poetic
____ him and forget it
Amnesia, I need ya
I need a woman like you
I know you wanna go
Your girlfriend said
That you wanna leave
Pinch my chauffeur
And give him these keys to the V's
And honey you can ride me

Remember way back when
When I first met ya
Didn't wanna sweat ya
Wanted you to put me on
1-5-5 at the Rucker
All them other suckas
Tried the game
I knew you were the one
Oh yeah

Girl I know you think about me (You think about me)
But I don't know what you're waiting to see
Girl I want you in my life
Let me show you right
You're the only one that matters to me
Girl it's about time

It's time you put me on
Right here's where you belong
Don't be afraid to hold me
I'm here and it's okay
There's nothing else to say
Don't be afraid to hold me
When you were alone that night
I called you from Jamaica
You were listening to "I'll Take Her"
And I know I made you smile
But I ain't on the shiny tip
But I know you like that flossy (shh)
I just want to hold you for a while, oh girl

And I know you dream about me (I know you dream about me)
But I don't know what you're waiting to see (What you're waiting to see)
Girl I want you in my life (Hey-ey hey)
Let me show you right
You're the only one that matters to me
It's about time

It's time you put me on
Right here's where you belong
Don't be afraid to hold me
I'm here and it's okay
There's nothing else to say
Don't be afraid to hold me
KB, Kobe
Your love's a sword
Slicing gently through my body
Burns so sweet
Blood boils when you speak
Makes me weak
But I refuse to weep
Yet when I sleep I feel tears trickling down my cheek
Stay strong, pride telling me move on
My heart's fighting me forcing me to hold on
Yours forever, fell for you beyond measure
Pure as ever, unphased by sins of treasure

Tonight's the night, tonight
Let's make it tight, tonight
Leave all our cares behind
Tonight's the night, tonight

It's time you put me on
Right here's where you belong
Don't be afraid to hold me
I'm here and it's okay
There's nothing else to say
Don't be afraid to hold me
