Look in my eyes, take a good look
Tell me what you see
Because of you, I'm only a fraction
Of the man I used to be
I didn't want to fall in love
I didn't really have the time
I didn't want to let you in my life
I wanted to run and hide
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
What I been waiting for, hmm
The smile on my face
Says I'm exactly at the place that I want to be
Girl, you're like my fire
You're my one and only desire
You can have everything that you want from me
I didn't want to fall in love
I didn't really have the time
I didn't want to let you in my life
I wanted to run and hide
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Baby I'm going through it
I really don't know what you did
But I'm glad you did it
I never thought I would feel this way
But I'm so with it
All things are possible
And we're gonna fall together
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
Now I don't want to live without you
Can't be without you
Ever since I let you in the door
Girl, I don't want to sleep without you
Can't breathe without you
I think I found what I've been waiting for
I know what I've been waiting for, and it's you
