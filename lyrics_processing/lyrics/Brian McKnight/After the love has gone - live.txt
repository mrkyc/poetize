But nothing could break my fall
The moment when you left my side, oh baby
And now there's nothing left to say
Ever since you went away
I been yearning for you deep inside
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on..
Can I go on
CHORUS
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours (yours)
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know that
It's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
If I had only had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart, oh girl
Taking for granted you'd be mine
Til the end of time
Has torn my world apart
