You say you've seen too many things
That turn out to be too good to be true
Against your better judgment, opened up your heart
'Til you found the joke was on you
Looking out on the rest of our lives
If we're gonna be together or apart
About the only way I know how to come
Is right straight from my heart

I want you now, I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around but now I've found
That you're the only one for me

Say you'll never fall again
You won't subject yourself to such pain
If you give me half a chance
I will never leave you standing out in the rain
But if you think that
I could look you in your face
And lie right through my teeth
Then turn around and walk away
Cross my heart, girl
I care for you
And when I look into your eyes
I must say

I want you now, I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around but now I've found
That you're the only one for me

I need you so, I can't let go
Gonna be all that I can be
I want you still, I always will
'Cause you're the only one for me
