It's mostly bad its sad, but true
I realize how close the end is near (mmm)
The world is sinking down so low
More wicked than the days of Noah
Lord we need you now that much is true
Lord you said that you would come
And wipe away all tears, oh Lord (oh Lord)
It's been two thousand years since you were here
Lord since you've been gone, everything's gone wrong
Just like you said that it would do
But Lord I still believe
You're comin back for me
To take me home to live with you
Waitin day and night, for you to crack the sky
We're comin to the end, tell me when
Will I see you again, my Lord
Tell me when, will I see you again...
So many have no place to stay
Our children have no place to play
It's against the law to pray in school
I'm waiting for the day to come when
Every eye shall see the sun till
Then I'm gonna do what I gotta do (ooh)

You died for us, wants before
Sacrificed your life upon the cross
Oh Lord will you be comin in
The noon day sky
Or will you arrive like a thief in the night!
