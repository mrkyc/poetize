Every time that I'm with you girl
Can't believe you share my world
But it's real
And every time that I hold you close to me
Forever is all that I can see
How it feels
See I don't give a damn
What my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never felt this way before
You leave a brother wanting more
Chorus:
I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Every time you go away
Verse 2:
From the very first time that I touched you babe
Couldn't find the words to say
You set me free
And every time that I kiss your lips
Nothing ever tasted quite like this
Or got so deep

You're the sunshine of my day
You brighten up my life
You take of piece of me with you
Every time you say goodbye
