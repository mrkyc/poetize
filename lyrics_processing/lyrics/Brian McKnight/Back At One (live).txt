It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The places you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel

That you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me

I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just in the nick of time

And one, you're like a dream come true

That you're the only one for me
