Hey
Oh yeah yeah
Oh, oh oh oh, hoo

Every night I lie awake
Wishin' I could love you with all my heart can take
Tell me my love this time, do you want me to stay?
You say you're in need of a little love
And baby it's me you're thinking of
And nothing in this world could keep me away

Darlin' finally, I've waited so long for you to come to me
Darlin' with each passing day, there's nothing left to say
But I'm so glad we waited, it was worth the wait so

Love me (Love me), hold me (Hold me)
Don't hesitate, let's celebrate
Our love together
Love me (Love me), hold me (Hold me)
Don't hesitate, let's celebrate
Our love together
Let's make it last forever, for always

Can I open the shades? You ask me why
So we can have the moon and the stars as our only light
Cherish the moment, let's take our time
Passion flies across the room
The sweet aroma of true love in bloom
Softly I whisper, "Forever be mine"

Oh now I see, you're everything I dreamed of
Now it's reality
Oh love's so rare, now it's ours to share
It's me for only you and only you for me so

Love me (Love me), hold me (Hold me)

Our love together
Love me, hold me
Don't hesitate, let's celebrate
Our love together

You'd be mine for always
What would I do, do without you?
Know that it's true

Our love together (Love me, baby)
