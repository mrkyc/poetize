What's up, girl?
I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playin' myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay, or should I go?

It's not my fault that you made yourself a regretful past
But all I know is it makes me look bad
When I'm holding your hand and you see old friends you knew
And they walk away laughing calling me a fool

Now baby I can't change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl I love you
So tell me what am I to do

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
(Should I let it go?)
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
But you gave your attention to someone across the room
I should of known right then that things just weren't right
But I couldn't see it 'cause love had me so blind

Now tell me how can I be so secure in loving you
When everybody's calling me a fool?
I can't keep holdin' on to broken promises from you
And I can't take no more from you, yeah

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last can I erase the past
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know?
Should I stay or let it go? (Let it go)
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be can you live faithfully
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Baby, time and time again I tried to overlook the pain
Couldn't think of losing all we had to gain (All we had to gain)
Girl, if it takes me losing you for happiness in me
I think that I might just have to let you go
Don't know
So you like playin' those games, huh?
I'ma see how you do when I walk out the door
I'm out

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
(Should I stay or should I go?)
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know (I don't know)
Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
(Stay or should I go?)
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
Should I stay, or should I go?
