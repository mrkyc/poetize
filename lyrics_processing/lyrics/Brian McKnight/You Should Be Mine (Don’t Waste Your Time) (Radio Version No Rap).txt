If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
Don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like he should
Then you should be mine

Can't understand
How he can treat you the way that he does
Give me the chance to show you, baby
You're better off with me

Oh, so baby, let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right (Oh baby), don't waste your time
(Don't waste your time) Don't baby
If he don't treat you like he should (No, baby)
Then you should be mine (You should be mine)
(I can make it better) Yeah

Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
