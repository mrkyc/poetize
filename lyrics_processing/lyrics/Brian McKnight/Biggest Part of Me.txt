If you've ever had
A broken heart
You promise yourself
To never let it happen again
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna dream about it
But it finds its way back into your head
Pre-chorus:
The 'I love you' 's
The 'I need you' 's
They're only words that people say
They're just words
When they're hand in hand
With the games that people play
Chorus:
But, If I never see the top of a mountain
If I never set one foot in the sea
I promise you I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will follow
You've changed the way that I used to think
I promise you I'll love you forever
You'll always be the biggest part of me

Take a look at me
I let you have my heart
I swore I'd never let it happen again
I'm not mad about it
I'm kinda glad about it
But I know on you girl
I can depend
