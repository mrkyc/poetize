When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
'Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart

When you talk, I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do

And you're the kind of girl I think of (Yeah)
And you're the kind of girl I dream about (Yeah)
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
'Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl

When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby, I'm counting the moments 'til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me
Every night, every day
