I wanna know
Is this the way love goes?
Oh oh
Oh woah oh

I remember how you used to wait by the phone
Counting every minute that I was gone
And you used to call me sweet things in the morning light
You would love me so tender each & every night

Lately you've got so much to do
And you're never at home
By the time I get to see you
You need your time alone
I'm too afraid to ask you
But I need to know

Is this the way love goes?
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes?
Or is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes?
See Brian McKnight LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like
Staring at the photograph of you and I in a frame
When I blink my eyes you start to fade away
Oh I recall that day in fall
And all the things you said
All of the promises that you never kept

Lately you've got so much to do (So much to do)
And you're never at home
When I finally get to see you
You need your time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you (So afraid baby)
But I need to know

Is this the way love goes?
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes?
(Is this the way our love should go?)
Is this the way love goes?
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way
Is this the way love goes?
Oh everyone needs a love they can count on
I'm the kind of man who needs to know exactly where I stand
(Hey hey, hey hey)
Oh... oh...
Is this the way?
(Stayed up day n night I wondered how can we make it right)
Is this the way
Love goes?
Oh oh oh
(I don't wanna say goodbye, I'm cryin
Find a way to stay alive)
Got to find a way
I hope n pray
This ain't the way love goes
(Stayed up day n night I wondered how can we make it right)
How can we make it right here tonight
Come on baby is this the way?
(I don't wanna say goodbye, I'm cryin find a way to stay alive)
Right before my eyes
(Hoh)
Whats this disguise
Is this the way love goes
