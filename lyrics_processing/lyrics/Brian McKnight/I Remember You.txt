How, how we carried on
How I used to walk with you, and talk with you
Until I moved away
Oh, although somethings may change
Others stay the same
We're not four anymore
But can you come out and play?

You wore pigtails and hand me downs
I bang the piano, played the clown
And though time slips away, it can never replace
How you'll always be here in this heart of me
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh, how Snoopy he never left the ground
Oh, that is true
You remember me like I remember you

Oh, I wonder where you are
My heart said your not far from me
It's so hard for me to leave those years behind
Oh, cotton candy, carousels
Got to find the wishing well
To wish you back to me
That's the way I feel inside

And though time slips away it can never replace
How you'll always be here in this heart of me
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh, how Snoopy he never made a sound
Oh, that is true
You remember me like I

How we laughed in the face of danger
Tonto and Lone Ranger
There were no mountains we could not climb
We soared like eagles across the sky
Heaven knows how I miss your little toes


You wore pigtails and hand me downs
I bang the piano, played the clown
And though time slips away it can never replace
How you'll always be in this heart of me
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
How Snoopy he never left the ground, oh that is true
You rememeber me like I, you remember me like I
You remember me like I remember you
