Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, ahh, ooh
Hey hey

I thought that love would conquer all
But nothing could break my fall
The moment you left my side, oh baby
And now there's nothing left to say
Ever since you ran away
I've been yearning for you deep inside

I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on
Can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours (Mine and yours)
Will I ever get over
'Cause I've come to know that
It's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

If I only had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart, oh girl
Taking for granted you'd be mine
'Til the end of time
Has torn my world apart

I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
(Where you belong)
When I think, think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours (Mine and yours)
Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong (Where you belong)
When I think of all the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

(And after the love)
After the love is gone
Life must go on
Life must go on
Life must go on
Life must go on
Life must go on
Life must go on
