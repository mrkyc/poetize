It doesn't matter if it is slow or fast
The beat is for us to feel
Our choice is always for real (oh)
It doesn't matter what type of color it is
One thing that girls want to know (uh-huh)
Is the way to go
Formality, you may like it probably
Life is here, oh, here to stay
Monsieur DJ, we're gonna ask him to play
Track would be a funky beat for all the fellows

We'd be doin' nothin' but girls things
And for the Ecstatika that we are
Better not to wait, don't make things so complicated

Show me what you got, baby
Tell me if it's hot (oh yeah)
I can feel the heat from the depths of your heart
Show me what you got, baby
Give me if it's cool (oh yeah)
All the girls, ready to turn you on

It doesn't matter if it's tiny or huge
Guess what you have inside you
The massive one which I knew (oh)
It doesn't matter where you're from or who you are
One thing we ask you is that
Why don't you come together? (woah, woah)
Now it's the time
I wanna see all of your dance
Full on the floor and move your body
Nights are so long, oh, you should not be alone
Tonight's gonna be a party, the beat goes on
You might also like
We'd be doin' nothin' but girls things
And for the Ecstatika that we are
Better not to wait, don't make things so complicated

Show me what you got, baby
Tell me if it's hot (oh yeah)
I can feel the heat from the depths of your heart
Show me what you got, baby
Give me if it's cool (oh yeah)
All the girls, ready to turn you on

Pass me the microphone
Wicked MC is hittin' the tone
Now my DJ, turn the bass up
At the party, everybody is lookin' for the best match
The lovely vibes that you can touch, ooh baby
Through the night 'till the beat goes breaking down
Close your eyes in the precious moments
And listen to your heartbeat
Baby, now you can realize what you got inside
Ooh yeah, the girls come and sing like this

We'd be doin' nothin' but girls things
And for the Ecstatika that we are
Better not to wait, don't make things so complicated (no, no, no)
Show me what you got, baby
Tell me if it's hot (oh yeah)
I can feel the heat from the depths of your heart
Show me what you got, baby
Give me if it's cool (oh yeah)
All the girls, ready to turn you on

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
