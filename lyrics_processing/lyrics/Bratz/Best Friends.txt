Put your hands up, raise your hands up
Put up a hand for your best friends
Some friends come, some friends go
But there's no one like you
You're the only friends I would tell my secrets to
We got a special bond that no one can break through
We're just like sisters
And we stick together like glue
Girls you know that we can read each others' minds
And we've got each others' backs all the time
So we just thought that we would let you know
We'll be your friends for sure
Best friends
Girls, they never let each other down
We're best friends
No matter what we'll always be around
When you need someone to talk to, girls
You can count on us to be your best friends
When you're glad, when you're sad
We will be right here
Anything you go through, call us up and share
That's what friends are for, we will lend an ear
Any burden that you carry will be ours to bear
