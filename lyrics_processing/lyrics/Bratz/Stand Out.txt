You're the one and only you
Express it any way you want
Style the way you feel inside and rock this world
Daring to be different
'Cause you don't wanna be the same
You're totally unique, an independent girl

Show yourself as you really are
(You stand out)

You gotta stand out, be proud
Time for you to shine
You're special, beautiful, you're one of a kind
You stand out from the crowd, everybody knows
Individual, original and it really shows
'Cause you stand out

Funky fashion, get reaction
You know how to be yourself
Own it 'cause you know it when it's feeling right
Confident inside your heart
You know exactly who you are
Go ahead and do your thing the way you like
You might also like
Show yourself, you know you're a star
(You stand out)

You gotta stand out, be proud
Time for you to shine
You're special, beautiful, you're one of a kind
You stand out from the crowd, everybody knows
Individual, original and it really shows
There could never be another you
You're like nobody else
A style that's all your very own
Be happy with yourself
'Cause you stand out, be proud

Dress the part of how you feel
Be the one you know is real
'Cause you're perfect just the way you are
Stand out (stand out), stand out
Don't you know you really gotta

Stand out, be proud
Time for you to shine
You're special, beautiful, you're one of a kind
You stand out from the crowd, everybody knows
Individual, original and it really shows
There could never be another you
You're like nobody else
A style that's all your very own
Be happy with yourself

'Cause you stand out, be proud
Stand out from the crowd
Stand out, be proud
Stand out from the crowd (stand out, be proud)
Stand out, be proud
Stand out from the crowd
Stand out, be proud
