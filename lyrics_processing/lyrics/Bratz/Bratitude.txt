It's not that attitude
We got that bratitude
Yeah, come on
There's a voice inside of me
Set it free, set it free, set it free
And it lives way down deep in my soul
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Come with me on this ride
Sail with me through the sky
You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide
Everyone listen up
They say my bratitude
Is just an attitude
Gonna take the latitude
To say that it's okay
It's not a platitude
To feel some gratitude
So show your bratitude
To the world today
Express yourself and you'll see
Set it free, set it free, set it free
One on one, all together, you know
Let it go, let it go, let it go
