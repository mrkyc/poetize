Sitting here and feeling strong on top of the world
You know you gotta be your best friend
On a solid ground independent girl
You know, it's your time, girl
You know where you stand
So don't you stop now once you've got it
Baby live your life
'Cause now we're here to remind you
That no one lives life twice
E X P R E S S
All my girls shout it and express yourself
I said, "E X P R E S S,"
Girls, if you feel me, just express yourself
Come on, girls
Everybody get it started, load your mind
Before you go and put on your shine
Close your eyes and feel the heat
'Cause now is your time
You got it, we got it
Girl, we're first in line

Let it go and feel the flow now, oh oh
Just let the music take control now, oh oh
Let it go and feel the flow now, oh oh
Just let the music take control now, oh oh
You make the temperature rise, turning up the heat
You make the temperature rise, boostin' up the beat
You make the temperature rise, turning up the heat
You make the temperature rise rise rise
