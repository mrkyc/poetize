We know how to dare
We know how to dream
Tonight is the night
What we wanna be, we'll be
We're gonna make it through
Let's conquer the fears
Take every chance
Hold back the tears
What we wanna be, we'll be
We're gonna make it through

Out of our heads
Into our hearts
Close to the edge
Ready to start

And it's so good
Dancin' on the air
It feels so good
Nothin' can compare
'Cause the beat in our hearts
It's the beat of the charts
Like a spotlight, we're cutting through
It feels so good
Shining here in front of you
You might also like
Give everything
And don't be afraid
Be true to yourself
If you wanna live forever
You're gonna make it through
You're gonna make it through

Out of our heads
Into our hearts
Close to the edge
Ready to start

And it's so good
Dancin' on the air
It feels so good
Nothin' can compare
'Cause the beat in our hearts
It's the beat of the charts
Like a spotlight, we're cutting through
It feels so good
Dancin' on the air
It feels so good
Nothin' can compare
'Cause the beat in our hearts
It's the beat of the charts
Like a spotlight, we're cutting through
It feels so good
Shining here in front of you
It feels so good
Shining here in front of you
Shining here in front of you

Dancin' on the air
It feels so good
Nothin' can compare
'Cause the beat in our hearts
It's the beat of the charts
Like a spotlight, we're cutting through
It feels so good
Dancin' on the air
It feels so good
Nothin' can compare
'Cause the beat in our hearts
It's the beat of the charts
Like a spotlight, we're cutting through
It feels so good
