Let go, let yourself be free
Show how you feel inside (Inside)
Let go, let the whole world see
'Cause you never know if you never try

Did ya ever wonder (Wonder)
If you could reach the stars? (The stars)
First you gotta let go
Take the time, listen to your heart and know that

You can dream, any dream, any possibility
Believe what you really feel
It could become real so

Let go, let yourself be free (Yeah)
Show how you feel inside (How you feel inside)
Let go, let the whole world see
'Cause you never know if you never try

Let go, let go, let go (Let go)
Let go, let go, let go (Ooh)

Did ya ever picture (Picture)
Yourself dancin' in the clouds (The clouds)
If you really want to
Then you know you can go there now

And just imagine it, you'll go far
In your world, being a star
Make a wish, close your eyes
You feel like you can fly, so

Let go, let yourself be free (Let go)
Show how you feel inside (How you feel inside)
Let go, let the whole world see
'Cause you never know if you never try

So let go
It's easy if you try
Just close your eyes and let go
You can do anything you like
You can even fly, oh
Let go, let go, let go (Let go)
Let go, let go, let go (Come on, you've gotta let go)
Let go, let yourself be free
Show how you feel inside (Show how you feel inside)
Let go, let the whole world see
'Cause you never know if you never try (Never know, never try)

Just believe in you, it will work out right
