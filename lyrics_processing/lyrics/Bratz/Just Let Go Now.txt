Hey, you've gotta move the way you feel
We play the rhythm that takes you there for real

Come on and turn it up 'cause now is the time (The time)
You can do whatever you like

Just let go now, here's your chance
Express yourself the way you dance
Just let go now and feel the groove
Do what you want the way you want to
Just let go

Oh-oh, hey, just let the music take you there
Fly away, leave all your worries and your cares (Oh-woah)

Come on and turn it up 'cause now is the time (The time)
You can do whatever you like

Just like a dream, you can be

Just close your eyes, you can see
(Another world)
Just imagine it, make it real
Let yourself go, let it go, oh
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Just let go now, here's your chance (Here's your chance)
