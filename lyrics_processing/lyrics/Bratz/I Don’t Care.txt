When we met, I knew then
There was something cool about you
Even though some of my friends didn't notice it at all
You and me all alone took a walk and started talking
We stayed out all night counting all the stars

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
'Cause they all fade away when it's just me and you
Well, it's more than a crush
An impossible rush
I don't care what they say
When you're there, I don't care

All my friends think you're weird
But they don't know much about you
Why we just disappear when you're hanging out with us
So your hair is a mess?
They don't know how good you treat me
I pay no attention 'cause I know who you are

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
'Cause they all fade away when it's just me and you
Well, it's more than a crush
An impossible rush
I don't care what they say
When you're there, I don't care
You might also like
Tell me stories paint a picture
Hang it in the sky (in the sky)
Tell no lies and keep no secrets
Time stands still as days go by
I don't care (care what they say)
(Care what they do) Oh no, no, no

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
'Cause they all fade away when it's just me and you
Well, it's more than a crush
An impossible rush
(I don't care what they say)

I don't care what they say, oh yeah (care what they say)
(Care what they do)
(All fade away) Ooh yeah, just me and you
And it's more than a crush
An impossible rush
Oh yeah (I don't care what they say)
