Here we go!

I feel so alive, ain't afraid of nothing
The timing is right, we're getting ready to roll
Grab the mic, turn it up, gonna make it a rock thing
All my girls go

Our hair is long, our boots are high
The fashion's right, we sparkle and shine

Here we go (oh-oh-oh-oh)
They see us coming down the street (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Here we go (oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're gonna knock you off your feet (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're so incredible, unbelievable
How we sparkle and shine
Here we go, here we go

We're all having fun and the place is jumping
It's like a dream coming true when the crowd goes
"Oh, oh, oh, woah"
Everybody gets wild with the fabulous Angelz
Sing along now
