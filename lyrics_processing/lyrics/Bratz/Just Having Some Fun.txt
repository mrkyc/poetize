You ready?
Here we go...
Hey hey hey
Nothin' like a little sunshine
To start out a perfect day
Everybody is feelin' alright
Let's hit the road, get on our way
Never better, all together, just how we like
Drivin' out to see the world
Everybody laughin', havin' a good time
I'm talkin' 'bout me and my girls
Just having some fun
Everyone
Hit the road, headin' out, lettin' go
Just having some fun
That's how it's done
Start it up, let it rock, let it roll
We're just having some fun
We're just havin' fun
So many new people to meet now
So many places to go
C'mon and fasten up and turn the key now
Rev it up and get on the road
