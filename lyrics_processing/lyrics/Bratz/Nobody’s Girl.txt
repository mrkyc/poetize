I want your love but yeah there are limits
You gotta know my plans every minute
Baby its like you wanna own me, and it isn't right
Just cause it feels so good when you hold me
Now all I want, You want to control me
Baby in case you don't remember, this is still my life
I'm not gonna do whatever you say
No no
If that's what you need I'll be on my way
CHORUS
I'm nobody's girl
No boy's gonna tell me what to do
I'm nobody's girl
Don't treat me like i belong to you
I'm nobody's girl
Oh baby fun with you is cause I choose to be
Nobody owns me
I'm going places, I've got ambitions
Thank you but I don't need your permission
Baby before you give me your love, give me your respect
You might also likeI'm not gonna walk a few steps behind
No no
If that's what you need then this is goodbye
CHORUS
I'm nobody's girl
No boy's gonna tell me what to do
I'm nobody's girl
Don't treat me like I belong to you
I'm nobody's girl
Oh baby fun with you it's cause I choose to be
Nobody owns me
No
Here's a new idea just treat me like I treat ya
If you don't know how than baby I don't need you
It's a simple thing baby
Oh yeah
Don't try to tell me what to do
Nobody
This is my life baby
Nobody
Oh yeah fun with you is cause I choose to be
You don't know me
CHORUS
I'm nobody's girl
No boy gonna tell me what to do
I'm nobody's girl
Don't treat me like I belong to you
I'm nobody's girl
Oh baby fun with you is cause I choose to be
Nobody owns me
I'm I'm body's girl
No boy gonna tell me what to do
I'm I'm body's girl
Do don't treat me like i belong to you
I'm nobody's girl
Oh baby fun with you is cause I choose to be
Nobody owns me
