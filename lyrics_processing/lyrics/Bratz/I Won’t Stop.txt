Gotta work gotta drive
Gotta search till i find what i want
Cuz thats what i need
(what i need)
Theres a will theres a way
I'll be strong
Not afraid
Cuz i beleive in me
Never holding back cuz i know i can
And nows the time to start
Cuz i realize that i can find
The strength inside my heart
I won't stop
Never slowing down
I'm never giving in
I won't stop doesn't matter how
What it takes till the end
I know i'm gonna win
I won't stop
Gonna find a way
Give it everything i got
I won't stop
I've got what it takes
Gonna reach for the top
And i won't ever stop
