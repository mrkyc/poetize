Hey ladies, let 'em know where the party at
Do your dance on the floor, now what's up with that?
Step up the game, show 'em how a girl act

Jeans, sneakers and a fresh top to match
Don't be ashamed, go ahead and wear that
Uh-oh, uh-oh, ooh-la-la

This is the way we tarantella twist (And why not?)

We got the whole place steamin' like a boilin' pot, I kid you not
Somethin' 'bout the style we got
We got the boys poppin' up with the question (Wazz up?)
If they're nice, we might give 'em a lesson
'Cause when we do a dance like it's our profession, we do the hop
