All the boys go, "Hey," when the Angelz play
And the girls go, "Hey," when the Angelz play
Everybody go, "Hey, hey, hey" when the Angelz play
(One, two, three, four)

You wanna see how it could be
With something new like when we strike
We're ready to try (oh, oh, oh)
So come on, let's fly (oh, oh, oh)
No one can stop us when we're sliding by

And, oh, it's getting stronger and stronger you know (oh, oh oh)
So drop everything, watch us here with the show

Come on, hey, can you hear it all around you?
Then get on down with the Angelz sound
Come on, hey, hey, can you feel it running right through you?
All the boys go, "Hey," when the Angelz play
And the girls go, "Hey," when the Angelz play
Everybody go, "Hey, hey, hey" when the Angelz play

You feel the groove, you wanna move
There ain't no stopping when you do (oh, oh, oh)
We've found our own track (oh, oh, oh)
No need to hold back (oh, oh, oh)

'Cause now, when you taste it you want even more (oh, oh, oh)
Oh yeah
And so, if you've got it, hold on, here we go
(One, two, three, four)
