I want you right now
Said I'm feelin' you right now (Yeah)
You need to pipe down
You need a wipe down (Yeah)
Live in the right now

What's your name? Pleasure to meet you
Interested, I love to teach you
Ways to love and how to trust
Like maybe, baby, this is more than lust
I'm not the type to stress you
Come close, you feel that pressure?
Get your number, can't lose love and wonder
Push back,  I feel that thunder, yeah
Said I'm feelin' you right now
Heart thumpin', you need to pipe down
See your body sweatin', you need a wipe down
Where your mind's at, live in the right now
'Cause I want you right now, come here dance with me
'Cause I wanna see your dancin' feet, romance with me
Hold hands, slow dance with me
My heart is callin', could you answer me? Huh?

I wanna let you under my skin
I wanna let you under my skin
You might also like
Bring me back to life, breathe me in tonight
You could live here underneath
Open up your eyes, take a dive inside
Hold me tight here underneath

Under (Yeah), under, I give in to you
(I want you right now)
Under (Yeah), under, I give in to you

If you fall, I got you
Your body rock and I rock too
Eyes locked in while I watch you
Dirty dancin' like ooh, ooh
You got good reason
To keep your guard up, yes, you do
I'm your puppet like voodoo
You're in trouble like ooh, ooh
Said you wanted the real thing
Protect yourself, you not one of them quick tings (You not one of them quick tings)
You're not for sale, you not up for the tasting (You not up for the tasting)
You want respect, you no time for the wasting, yeah (You no time for the wasting)
You're not basic, throw around when the bass kick
You got voids, I'm fillin' up the spaces
You got pain, I peel away the traces
You're in deep, it's too deep, just say yes
I wanna let you under my skin
I wanna let you under my skin

Bring me back to life, breathe me in tonight
You could live here underneath (Come on)
Open up your eyes, take a dive inside
Hold me tight here underneath

Under (Yeah), under, I give in to you
(I want you right now)
