We're going when the wind blows
Like we trail blaze
Blow up when the wind blows
And the night will come and fade away
Said we should probably go
Cause it's getting late
Too late to stay
But then, before we know
We're tripping from the fallen
Feeling like we're floating
Laughing in slow motion
We're standing but we're leaning
Caught up in the feeling
Wonder if we're dreaming
But we're still up from yesterday
Ain't no way that we sleeping
Stay we up 'til the daybreak
We're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
But we're still up from yesterday
Ain't no way that we sleeping
Stay we up 'til the daybreak
We're still wide, wide awake
But we feel like we're dreaming
You might also likeWe're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
But we feel like we're dreaming
We still wide, wide awake
We still wide, wide awake
We still wide, wide awake
But we feel like we're dreaming
Hey, Jay
Don't take me back home
Tell you I came
Here to see the fall
And the sun will rise and every time
It comes before we know
Said it's getting high
The morning sky
Is mirroring us all
We're tripping from the fallen
Feeling like we're floating
Laughing in slow motion
We're standing but we're leaning
Caught up by the feeling
Wonder if we're dreaming
But we're still up from yesterday
Ain't no way that we sleeping
Stay we up 'til the daybreak
We're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
But we're still up from yesterday
Ain't no way that we sleeping
Stay we up 'til the daybreak
We're still wide, wide awake
But we feel like we're dreaming
We're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
We're still wide, wide awake
