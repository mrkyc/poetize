At fourteen I used to talk to myself
Paint my bedroom with stars
One for each time my dad flaked out
Got a galaxy of scars
You know that feeling that you get when ya
Start to run out of breath and ya
Pass out, wake up, wig out
Not knowing where you are

I'm safer here inside my submarine
'Cause when I'm underwater you can't say anything
I can't hear anything

Ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need Ohio
I've never even been there
But I'd rather fall asleep in an open field in Ohio (Ohio)
Ohio (Ohio)
Ohio (Ohio)
Ohio
You might also like
Last time I saw your face
You were screaming that I don't have a clue
I'm not a deadbeat piece of shit
Dad, I never learned that from you
You know that feeling when you're weak and ya
Wish your brain could delete for ya
All the toxic, twisted contradictions that I worked so hard to lose

I'm safer here inside my submarine
'Cause when I'm underwater you can't throw words at me
I'm just learning how to leave

Ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need Ohio
I've never even been there
But I'd rather fall asleep in an open field in Ohio

Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
We're all growing up and we're all dying
We're all growing up and we're all trying
We're all growing up and we're all dying
We're all growing up and we're all trying
We're all growing up and we're all dying
We're all growing up and we're all trying
Ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need Ohio
I've never even been there
