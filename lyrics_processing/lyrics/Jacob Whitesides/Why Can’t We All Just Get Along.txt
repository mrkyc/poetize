(Why can't we all just get along?)

Hey, you, the world is on fire
I'm so sick and so tired of this blood in the water
Blood in the water

Words turn into explosions
I'm so up in emotion
I thought we were brothers
Thought we were brothers

Love and forgiveness
Love and forgiveness
How we forget it?
How we forget?

Why can't we all Just get along?
Do we wanna be here ten years later
Singing the same sad song?
It don't have to take our last breath
To admit that we're wrong
Why can't we all Just get along?
You might also like
We blow in like a hurricane
We kill all of the good
And we hurt one another
Hurt one another

Don't take this life for granted
We need second chances
As hard as it is
(C'mon, people, now)

Why can't we all just get along?
Do we wanna be here ten years later
Singing the same sad song?
It don't have to take our last breath
To admit that we're wrong
Why can't we all just get along?

I see a city where the hate is gone
I see a city where we're all still talking
I see beautiful lights that turns battlefields to paradise
I'll be the first one to lay down my gun
And I will be here waiting for you to come
There can be peace and love can be found together
There's got to be common ground
Why can't we all just get along?
Do we wanna be here ten years later
Singing the same sad song?
It don't have to take our last breath
To admit that we're wrong (I know that I've been wrong)
Why can't we all just get along?

(Anybody hear me?)
Why can't we all just get along?
Do we wanna be here ten years later
Singing the same sad song?
(Can anybody hear me?)
It don't have to take our last breath
To admit that we're wrong
(Yeah yeah yah yeah)
