I'm gonna take a small break
From all of this heartache
Man there ain't no doubt
I'm sitting this one out
I'm gonna play this one safe
Repeat no mistakes
Man there ain't no doubt
I'm sitting this one out

Maybe I'll come around someday
Maybe good love will come my way
Right now all I've got to say

Loneliness lights the heart up
La, la, la la la
I feel it deep inside
La, la, la la la
My friends say they all found love
La, la, la la la
Well I'm doing just fine
La, la, la la la
We've got jaded love
La, la, la la la
Me, myself and I
We've got jaded love
La, la, la la la
I'm doing just fine
You might also like
I ain't no prince charming
So you can save your wishing
Cause I'm alone tonight
And I feel alright
So come on darling
I'm no strings attaching
And I'm alone tonight
And I feel alright

Maybe I'll come around someday
Maybe good love will come my way
Right now all I've got to say

Loneliness lights the heart up
La, la, la la la
I feel it deep inside
La, la, la la la
My friends say they all found love
La, la, la la la
Well I'm doing just fine
La, la, la la la
We've got jaded love
La, la, la la la
Me, myself and I
La, la, la la la
We've got jaded love
La, la, la la la
I'm doing just fine
La, la, la la la
Hands up
Forever alone and never been happier
Hands up
Forever alone and
Hands up
Forever alone and never been happier
Hands up
Forever alone and

Loneliness lights the heart up
(Do you feel it babe?)
I feel it deep inside
(Do you feel it?)
My friends say they all found love
(But what did you really find?)
Well I'm doing just fine
(Yeah I'm so fine)
We've got jaded love
(Jaded love)
Me, myself and I
(It's just me babe)
We've got jaded love
(Jaded love)
I'm doing just fine
(I'm too fine)
