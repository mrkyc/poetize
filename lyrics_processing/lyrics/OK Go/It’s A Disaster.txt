Patience is the hallmark of the old and the infirm
Lived and learned, lived and learned, lived and learned (lived and learned)
Outlived their lust and traded want in for concern
Singin' "that's all right
Yeah, that's all right
Oh that's all-all-all"
So come on down, come on down, come on down (come on down)
Get out your pestilence and vice and pass around
We'll blow this town, blow this town, blow this town (blow this town)
Jump off this ship before the shit just runs aground
Singin' "that's all right
Oh, that's all right
Oh that's all-all-all-all"
But, It's a disaster
It's an incredible mess
But it's all we've got now
Yeah, that's all we got
Howling with laughter
Panic, alarm, and distress
But it's all we've got now
Yeah, that's all we got
Oh heads or tails, heads or tails, heads or tails (heads or tails)
You dumb enough to break the mold
Are you smart enough to fail?
Oh happy trails, happy trails, oh happy trails (happy trails)
Can't beat a little bit of envy in your sails
Singing "that's all right
Yeah, that's all right
Oh that's all-all-all"
