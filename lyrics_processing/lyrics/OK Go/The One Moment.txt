You're right
There's nothing more lovely
There's nothing more profound
Than the certainty
Than the certainty

That all of this will end
That all of this will end
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So while the mud
Reclaims our footprints
And while our bones keep looking back
At the overgrowth that's swallowing the path
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of time and chance
And entropy's cruel hands
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me
You might also like
And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands
So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build us some temples
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
And burn them all right down

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

(And this will be)
(The one moment that matters)
(And this will be)
(The one thing we remember)
(And this will be)
(The reason to have been here)
(And this will be)
(The one moment that matters at all)
So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands
(This will be the one thing we remember)
So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build us some temples
(And this will be)
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
(This will be)
Build us some temples
(The one moment that matters)
Build us some castles
(And this will be)
Build us some monuments
