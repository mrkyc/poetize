Livin' with the things you do to me, ah ha
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see
OH, I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact his eyes are red as the sun
And the girl in the corner let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one
Oh Yeh, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing, and they all started grooving
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz x 4
I'm reaching out for something touching nothing's all I ever do
I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you, ah ha
And the man in the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is ev'ryone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye
You might also likeOh yeah, it was electric, so frantically hectic
And the band started leaving, cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

Oh Yeh, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening

And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz x 4
It's, it's a ballroom blitz, it's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz, Yeh it's a ballroom blitz
