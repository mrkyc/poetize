Do dat, do dat, do da da dat

I start my rhymin' with maneuvers like a Heimlich
As I resume to autopilot and lay back up in the climate, hey!
I wanna travel to the spots where the ladies lay
Catchin' sun up in the sand there ain't no rainy days
As I parade through your scenery, the greenery can get you faded
Elevated comprehension toward the words I stated
When I'm at my peak, I bust styles as I speak
Suckers, they runnin' up, that's butt-mad because they're weak
Ya never ever thought that I would bust a rap
Ya never ever thought that I would get to snappin' on ya
Representin' westside California
Girls they runnin' up to get shook coz they're a goner
I'mma bomb ya, flippin' lyrics like benihana
Youz a bomba? I'll put you on my guest-list
Coz I'd like to invite ya to pick up the mic and fight ya
Bite ya tongue if you proceed to need a beating, then I might just...


It's ya death-wish, kid, once ya enter my fortress
I pass the torches to the henchmen so they can scorches ya
This lyricist leavin' nothing but blemishes
Please sweep up their ashes and wipe 'em off the premises
They been dismissed images from the emphasis of apostles
That I had de-moleculed down the fossil
Set up as art work in Roscoe to floss the nostrils
Leaving the wack MCs dehydrated and they hated
You must be faded off the ginseng weed and fuses
Poisonous incense that was lit to get you bent
Boom Bap, won't pull a heart-attack just like that caused by the rhyme
So if you can't hang, you best recline
Sitting down in your lazy-boy chair, while I'm there
Classical rear up on your TV
Put on your 3-D glasses or else how could you see me
Or wanna be me the mic- genie, invisible?

Back in the day I used to be a lad of ten
It didn't matter then but my friends
So my pop thought I was madder than my mama giving a birth
Shaking the earth or the whole planet
When it came to drop bomb
He was a Buddha with them slanted eyes
And now, another word I'm wise
Why you need a visine?
You can't see me as I'm rising like the sun
Have you fallen like the sunset
Go back and practice your wackness
When I kick this on time when I...
