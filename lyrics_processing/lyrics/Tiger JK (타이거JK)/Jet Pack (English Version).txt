I got rockets on my backpack blast off
I got rockets on my backpack take me away
I got rockets on my backpack back pack
I got rockets on my backpack take me away

I just blast off I'm a rocketeer
And I get spaced out when the block is clear
I'm a comet I come thru once in a lifetime
Take one trip it's as long as your lifeline
An astronaut until the casket drop
Acid rain the coup get an acid wash
Asteroids that come in my atmosphere
Get blown to smithereens cuz its active here
I'm actually floating in galactic borders
Classic to the death, Star Wars disorder
With a vulcan grip I'm choking this
But still I blast off my emotion is...


I wanna make a little bit a milli or two
I'm just gettin sick of this, I ain't a silly or fool
I went to high school little bit of college too
But what did mathematics and knowledge do
I sold platinum and plus another platinum and gold
But all i got is getting old some story untold
That nobody cares cause I ain't a beefer
I ain't even good enough to hang wit ether
I ain't never shot nobody never bang neither
Wanna make a little bit a little wee money
Got a million here and a million there
But the game gettin rougher than nigerian hair

Oh, I'm running out of grass
I mean out of gas I gotta call my boy out
I got that cash talk so fast and hung up
I don't wanna call my lawyer
Got a good one I already hire
That's why the rockets keep taking me higher
Taipei, Bangkok, Seoul where to fly out?
Where should I spend this weekend night out?
Or up in the hideout?
Laying in a coconut tree shade fucking a C.A
Two shots on my Pina Colada
Light another kush If u wanna flow further, cuz
