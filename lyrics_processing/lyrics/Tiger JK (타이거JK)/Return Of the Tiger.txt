You W-A-C-K who? Come back home See me tapping your boo*
I engage for the battle, feel the wrath Niggas hesitate, Move
Over, Make a path for the Drunken Tiger, son We walk with a
Glare Niggas call us the Enlightened Ones Not the nirvana Always
Smoking my Havana Duba Spreading my skills from Cuba to Aruba
Now all these MCs taking them overseas with my Drunken
Techinque Niggas flee Doing my deadly combos I'm the law like the
Tekken 3 You can't mess with me Now comes the birth of shine
Murdering MCs is my crime in a world of rhyme, though Yeah so
I'm never hitting nasty chicks And only when they're fine But
That's a lie' Cuz I be even hitting hoes So to all the earth from
Birth until now I'll flow like Niggara Falls For this is what I vow
And all you wack artist dodging my bullets to the fullest We're
Coming equipped, never fake and only to the purest*
That's amazing the way I get you dazed With only thoughts Be
Paper chasin' after you who claimed you're this But in fact you
Misbehavin' like the twenty dozen E-heads at the rave, and The
Syllables incredible like Whith Elephant that you're cravin' Ay, you
Make me nauseous, Too many niggas Johnny-blazing Mad rhymes
Off my anuses embarasses the dope MCs The sessions be so
Torturous The poisonous incense that was lit to get you bent
Boom Bap I punctuate your lung accurately till you collapse My
Rap's original like Gun Claps Your strategy is no strategy when I
Come to attack it Don't get distracted by my abstact rap tactic
Lntoxicated Tiger J. I battle inter-galactic like Lucas dinematic
Retum like Jedi Bust mind tricks up in your red eye My flow be
Like Conobi I decapitate your head I Be like optical confusion or
Is it an illusion?*
Now light my fat club up, what up? With the intoxicated Tiger
Style I rock a Rollex worth 24 thou Now calm down Just touched
Ground Stroll aroun espionage When I'm down I'll leave town Get
More watch for the stakeout Fuzz think there smart But we're
Smarter so we fake out lntoxicated Tiger dropping topics
Hypnotize in illogical melodic sonic Boom up your optic Sippin' gin
Without tonicUnder the disco light I rocked it it ain't no optical
Illusion It's only logic Oh meditation, rhyme travel All you rebels
With no mics are goner So stay in your comer* **
Put your hands up Put your hands up All the players in the house
Put your hands up Put your hands up All my Crown-sipping niggas
