I engage for the battle, feel the wrath Niggas hesitate
Move over, Make a path for the Drunken Tiger, son
We walk with a glare Niggas call us the Enlightened Ones
Not the nirvana Always smoking my Havana Duba
Spreading my skills from Cuba to Aruba
Now all these MCs taking them overseas
With my Drunken techinque Niggas flee
Doing my deadly combos I'm the law like the Tekken 3 You can't mess with me
Now comes the birth of shine
Murdering MCs is my crime
In a world of rhyme, though Yeah so
I'm never hitting nasty chicks And only when they're fine
But that's a lie' Cuz I be even hitting hoes So
To all the earth from birth until now
I'll flow like Niggara Falls For this is what I vow
And all you wack artist dodging my bullets to the fullest
We're coming equipped, never fake and only to the purest
(chorus)
( JK )
That's amazing the way I get you dazed With only thoughts Be
Paper chasin' after you who claimed you're this
But in fact you misbehavin' like the twenty dozen E-heads at the rave
And The syllables incredible like Whith Elephant that you're cravin'
Ay, you make me nauseous, Too many niggas Johnny-blazing
Mad rhymes off my anuses embarasses the dope MCs
The sessions be so torturous The poisonous incense that was lit to get you bent
Boom Bap I punctuate your lung accurately till you collapse
My rap's original like Gun Claps Your strategy is no strategy when I
Come to attack it Don't get distracted by my abstact rap tactic
Lntoxicated Tiger J. I battle inter-galactic like Lucas dinematic
Retum like Jedi Bust mind tricks up in your red eye
My flow be like Conobi I decapitate your head I Be like optical confusion or
Is it an illusion?

I spit my verbs eatin' bean curd
Niggas tried to hear and heard about the kid With the fat knob word
Shoot it in your face in small amounts Hell no!
In large globs, sa I fertilige your ears With the sweet nouns
Contest my intelligence I inject my elegance to all you fat bitches to the curb
That's absurd Taking down the studio MCs
I'm the king with the crown No deception Is there a question?
( JK )
Lntoxicated Tiger dropping topics Hypnotize in illogical melodic sonic
Boom up your optic Sippin' gin without tonic Under the disco light I rocked it it ain't no
Optical illusion It's only logic
Hey I rocked take a flight I got the type
Of flow Yo, act like you know I gets tipsy off the Crisco
My brain's flyin' like Crisco While I'm eatin' sucker's style like
Nabisco
