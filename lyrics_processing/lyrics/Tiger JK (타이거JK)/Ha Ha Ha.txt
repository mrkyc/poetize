Emboxed, tum in notes to hip-hop straight through your heart
You've been de-ranked, straight juiced because you refuse to
Get loose You thrusted but when I'm untrusted, you gets dusted
Even a brother I tap that ass like oops I have no pity for the
No-soul-havin' commitee I'm like Enddy Ran through pyramids with
Your city Ball wippin', ball-shittin' niggas That style been bitten
While minds been hidden under deep walls layers of reason I leave
It smilin' and you can get high from the contact Lyrical fomats
Blow your wig back I get ya open like a ass-wippin' MCs are
Flippin' so I'd advise that they start dippin' I caught ya slippin'
Like petroleum jelly Your girlie hit me on my paper, so I called
Her on my celli Tell me who don't want to get up on the mic, a
Pretender Send'em to the principal's office and I'll suspand'em
Like just like that My rap'll handicap individuals with every syllable
The caravan becomes more minimal the minerals attack ya mind
Just like umbilical chords of MCs Diseased can only get D's All of
Them had rapped, they stopped that after they met me. But all
The while I free-style pullin' the file of MC's labels My lyrics
Travel as I un-raval the cable of the microphone Suckers pass
The mic when my rhymes take(s) flight. I get that type o'flow So
Act like you know I slay wack MC's at the disco Tipsy off the
Cisco my brain is frying like crisco while I'm eatin' sucker's
Styles up like nabisco cookies Steppin' to me you just can't do
Me rookies Compared to my rhyme techs you just can't flex I
Don't know what next about ya. Talk about ya girl how I' ooched
& 'ooched ya bounsta' pounsta' Just like groceries in a basket
And now it's time for me to put you in your casket. Fast kid
But filst you might get your ass kick(ed) Maybe blasted like a
Bastard when I told you not to chance it Yourstyle's ancient
