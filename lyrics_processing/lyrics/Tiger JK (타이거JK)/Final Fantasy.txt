(Drunken Tiger in background)
 So we representin' it
Charter legend shit
You feelin' it, probably bet again, it's definite
 Impresive
As rippin' the skeleton, that of an elephant
We took your wives, gentlemen
With Boogie Night measurements
 The best at this
Tiger JK, Micki Optical
If you comin' out the hospital, we got another pocket full
 Of ass whippin'
For any cat that's actin' Nash Bridges
 Crashin' ya kitchen, smashin' your glass dishes
 We stickin' models and actresses, while y'all be kissin' all of the
Fat bitches and midgets
My man jiggalicious
 Sho' nuff
 Hey, can you dig it? I'm a flip it like a Benihana chef do
Intoxicated wit, it's still uplifted from that
 Marijuana shit, too, gonna hit you with the shit that be
Bangin' up on the tracks
Me and Tiger J go back like we was
Tango and Cash, like we was Meth' and Redman, or like we was
Axel and Slash (Dat-dat-dat-dat, dat-dat)
 Dat, dat, dat

One for my haters and two for my peoples
Three times five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for your mamas and two for my hoes
Three, four, five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for the busters and two for the hustlers
Three times five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for my haters and two for my peoples
Three, four, five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
(Verse 2)
I be silent like stealth
Screwin' on the silencer
Anticipating for the kill, now
I'm a have to silence ya
Packin' more heat, than the sun, that's my word (Word)
Stepped in my path, then got instantly murdered
Now that your dead, I'm so glad, cause you deserved it
You was worthless
Had you taken out
Due to a
Nervous distinctive purpose (You'se a bad motherfucker)
True, indeed, my brother
I punish the punisher
He cometh, the summoner
I played around with death
As if it was a game like chess, not even bullet proof vest can protect your
Chest
I bring the pain like Baby Tash' up on the mic and um
Brook-l-yn keeps on taking it, and me, too, came to get some
Me without the mic be like the Smif without the Wessum
I'm wettin' niggas with my rhymes, I'm lyrically handsome
The king, plus the ransom now
Follow the movement
From the Africa to Canton, stomp ya feet
It's Drunken, for the kingdom, Tiger for your soul (Drunken)
Throw your fist, now we the champion (Buck, buck, buck, buck)
Repeat Chorus

How many emcees must I run through
Before they figure out, there ain't no fucking with my crew
One, two
I break it down and set it off for all my peoples
Cause when I grab the mic, there won't
Be no kind of sequels
Kuya Roscoe
Umali
The freshest Filipino
You better know your role like Rob Deniro in Casino
Ain't no equals
I keep it raw with styles you can dig
That's word to Drunken Tiger and my DJ James Jhig
"Ask 'em"
"What is it"
