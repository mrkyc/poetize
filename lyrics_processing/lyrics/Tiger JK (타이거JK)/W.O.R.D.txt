Four elements, the fifth is representin' it
Water and sediments
The fire from my pen ignites connection with the earth
Because hip hop is life manifested through the word
I'm overdonsin' off the potion
Got the pen in motion
My rhyme style components will leave my opponents
Swollen
Chosen one
Sword swingin' like a shogun
Secret style
Show none
I'll let the crowd indicate the outcome
You wonder how come
I prophecize like Malcolm
Records get spun by big brother James Jung
From sun up to sin down
Leave 'em dumbfound
It's the blood hound
I knock 'em out in just one round
DJ Shine:
I'm old school
I've been doing this since the 80s
Quick to take your manhood right in front of your lady
Not maybe but surely
Snatch your goods like I was Tracy MacGrady
It's like taking candy from a baby
Woman:
Ah!
DJ Shine:
I ain't a villain
I be robbin' like Williams, giving back to civilians
From pennies to millions
It's not stealin'
It's hip hop, Jack
To rich to dealers' crops I get props nonstop
For dodging bitch ass cops
DJ Shine, you know the name
The name that gives you chills in your spine
One of a kind
Murderin'
You heard of him
Don't let me catch you slippin, niggas
Talk madd smack
Cause I be big pimpin'
Roscoe:
Spendin' cheese
Bendin' trees
Got your girl on bended knee
Never seen an emcee rip mics as splendidly
Tryna, steal the recipe and run off offending me
You better relocate and switch identity
'Cuz enemism of mine feel the wrath of my mind
My rhymes should be a crime
'Cuz there's dope in every line
Save your punchline
I'm eatin' emcees at lunch time
Roscoe Umali comes from a royal bloodline
I'm loyal
Plus I'm blessed with a special enzyme
That makes me ten times sicker than the best rhyme
Spitter
Slit a throat, kill your hope
I ain't no joke
It's the Drunken Tiger mafia
Mashin' trench coats
Tiger JK:
Simultaneous combustion and concoction when I'm
Busying
Automatic rapid fire
Drunken Tigers
We destructing any of those whom that oppose and get
In my way
What I be lusting, to crack your cranium
Raccume they brainium
Injection venomous
Syllables till they visions blurry
Locked up in delirium, delirious
You strangulate yourself until you suffocate
You fetal, feeble-minded
I kick you back to your section
Now Tiger J accomplishes impossible accomplishments
Bash and kill, demolishes like Nostradamos prophecies
I'm doing it for my populaces
Intoxicate accomplices
Equipped with criminal knowledges of rocking the mic
Scientists
Now we marching thru your continents
Conquering your providences
Micki Eyez:
Micki vision
My lyricals cut like an incision
If I spit 'em in the air the shit could chop apart
Pidgeon
Like got cut up in an engine of a 747
My pen produces venom
Leavin' the microphone infected anyone steppin' to us
Gonna need some medical attention
Tell the paramedics bring an extra stretcher for
Intestines and some some crutches
I'm throwin' some punches right into your stomach
Punches right into your stomach
Puncturin' your lungs
My knuckles faster than a friggin' gun is
I'm from Drunken Tiger
Can't nobody do it better
We representin' the fourth and after that the
Twentieth letter
With the breakin' and graffin, rappin' and scratchin'
Four elements the fifth is grippin' the mic until your
