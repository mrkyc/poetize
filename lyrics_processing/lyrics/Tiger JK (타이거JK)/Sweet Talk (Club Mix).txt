Upon the raggae is bam bam(hey!)# (X2)
I get you overflooded like Han River
Make you hot, Make you shiver
I get your kidneys shifted when I deliver
I start delivering on point like decimal
Your spot start trembling
Like treble I Get deeper than Hyman diamond tip drilling
You bust a rhymin' Now what's the reason?
Why you sighin'? Let me wipe off those tears Stop crin'
Scent of your presence was true essence of your beauty
The complexions reminiscent be like
Blinding twenty twenty
From the git go Couldn't let go
You had my hearty mad looney tooney
From the full moon to the crescent
Reminiscing about your beauty
Feeling blue indeed like the time You didn't
Do me When I'm alone I'm in a love Jones Baby boo
I'm truly your Like honey dip from Gothem
You let me in for a pleasure
Voulez-vous couchez avec moi?
Now you drop your draws, uh!

Hey, Asiatic chicken You got me finger-lickin' The way you sip on
The drink got me mad Pumped like jeep music Give me your eyes
And beauty Then I promise I wouldn't abuse it Won't you hit me
A ring? Tonight is the night You be the gaddist intoxicated Tiger
J Yo bebe I got the fattest apparatus Afro Jimmy addicts
I'mma eat your lettuce And my flow be like Oasis, but I'm still
Thirsty I murder dim bumberclotz boo You like mercy You attack
Me with your body fuctions Attack you with my man assumption
Getting freak My appearance makes you start bum and sizzle
Tender, ripe and juicy Snake about to erupt and fizzle Lethal
Injection of your love's got me erected No question and guessing
I come magnum like protection No need to hurry Take your time
Shoot it in your eyes They might get blurry you so me fine Your
Elegance blows my mind Give me a chance so we can bump and
Grind
