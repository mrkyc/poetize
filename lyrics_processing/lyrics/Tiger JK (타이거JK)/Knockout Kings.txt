Brill: You try to use your weaknesses as strengths
Robert Clayton Dean: Such as?
Brill: Well, if they're big and you're small, then you're mobile and they're slow. You're hidden and they're exposed. You only fight battles you know you can win. That's the way the Vietcong did it. You capture their weapons and you use them against them the next time. That way they're supplying you. You grow stronger as they grow weaker

Yo it's intoxicated Tiger J, you know the rest the fucking legendary
Yeah I said it just in case you didn't know
I was tapping that ass in cemeteries
After I buried all you sorry suckers dared me with hilarious And dumber than Jim Carrey is
Your karaoke vocal tone from Tokyo to Sony Hollywood
Emcees are phony like Blair Witch Project
Ain't no logic if no DJ Jhig no Shine and Kuya Roscoe
No Opticals and (hmm) gimmick and some mockeries
Hip-hoppin it's hypocrisy, no definite solution
Just some bunch of fucking probabilities so follow me the Drunken to the light out of the darkness
I'm quick to turn the brave emcees into a heartless carcass

Yo Imma settle this once and for all, last call
For alcohol meet me at Umali's bar we gonna rage war
Don't even try to stall you got yourself involved
With that bitch-ass remark you made just last fall
And now you come to me frontin' like you know me when you really owe me
For bringing hip-hop to our land which was lonely
And so deprived sacrificing every thing, but you almost made me
Lose my pride that shitty kayo crap vibe
You just happened to suck like Yang Hyun
Fakin' like you got guns when really Korea's got none
I'm just curious how ya wife and my kids
It's nothing personal I tell it how it is in showbiz

Walk like a champion talk like a champion
Crews wanna battle but already know the outcome
Walk like a champion talk like a champion
Crews come come not ready for the outcome

Ay yo this homegrown hydro got my eyes low
Roscoe the dallow I make my foes die slow
Cause I been rockin' shows since back in '9-0
Duck from the 5-0 got these hoes like "woah!"
Flows never stop drop hot like a buckshot
Your girl sucks cock like a Wall Street stock
Up and down while my crew pounds beats profound
If you didn't know you know now we came to get down
I know it sounds rugged, raw, and hardcore
When I'm in your parking lot you better lock your car door
Your team ain't even score and I'm already 4 for 4
With more in store I'm swoopin through like a condor

They say that Micki Opti. keepin' it hot we wasabi
Rhymes so fat if I went diving yo I'd probably start tsunamis
Roll with a clique of thugs but I could handle my shit solo
If a picture's worth a thousand words I wrote a book of photos
Keepin' real like survivor, my life they always taping it
A lyrical MacGyver make a mic out of some paperclips
And rubber bands while these other bands all actin' goofy
Backstage before the show they wearing makeup like Kabuki
Yo this ain't a movie gotta be keepin' it real when you be busting
Stop acting like you tough with a million guns inside your trunk kid
With or without a weapon I got an arsenal of protection
Micki Optical, I did it now you never gon' forget it
