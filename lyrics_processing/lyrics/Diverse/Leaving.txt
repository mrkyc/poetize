There ain't no comin' back, I'm tryna cover maps
I'm tired of thunder claps waking me flagrantly
And blatantly breaking the night's calm
Guess it's everywhere
This planetary atmosphere is hard to breathe
(And so I'm leaving) without recourse
There's gotta be more to this, so I sorta miss
Magenta sunsets  and winter backdrops
And visions from the Hancock
The cityscape that affiliates with commotion
Evokin' the worst in human beings
Too busy being preoccupied to notice what's been compromised
While illusions personified I wonder where the bottom lies
Upon this featherless descent spirallin' down down
This survival found fit for the fiendish
God's creatures disguise features that make them just that
So many resources go untapped these outer layers unwrap
To access the mainframe and gain calm
To all the soldiers in the booth may just remain strong
I'm outta this, peace, to seek solitude amongst the stars

So many days spent on a planet with no dreamers
Half ass circles I hope they don't linger
I promise not to sing the blues
I won't leave her but I'm leaving
So many days spent on a planet with no dreamers
Half ass circles I hope they don't linger
I promise not to sing the blues
I won't leave her but I'm leaving

No transfer at a ride
I'm fantasizin' about where I might arrive at as I recline back
Just lookin' out the window losin' time tracks
This planet mothered me but my discoveries
Have been limited, inhibited by the hindrance
Of my captors tryna master my fate
Capture my grace, fracturing in the infrastructure
Give a brother some refuge to rest through
They got me needing to be rescued
From the order that they let move
Thus it's through its these wet grues of passages
Pieces hard to fathom with the streets playing antagonist
Opposin' how I handle biz
Imagine it'd take a miracle to make the stakes settle
As we chase levels of understandin' some abandon the mission
Wishin' that it wasn't so elusive. truth is I'm feelin' that way
Thirsty for change, adversely the rain
Forever cascades over us holdin' us hostage
While we're unconscious to it
I got the key to tranquility it's time I use it
I'm leaving the earth in search of higher meanin', meanin'

So many days spent on a planet with no dreamers
Half ass circles I hope they don't linger
I promise not to sing the blues
I won't leave her but I'm leaving
So many days spent on a planet with no dreamers
Half ass circles I hope they don't linger
I promise not to sing the blues
