Your back on a blue sky
Are you gonna play this part
Til there's no tears to dry
So who you gonna hold
When the night is moving on
And who you gonna blame now
For the aching that you feel
So are you gonna stay
In the place where you started
Or do you wanna hold my hand
In the middle of america
Are you gonna run
Are you gonna run
Til you can't anymore
You know it's gonna hurt
You know it's gonna hurt
With your heart on the floor
But you want to fall in love
Do you want to touch
Light of morning
Cause its who you're thinking of
Its you I'm thinking of
Are you gonna let go
When the past holds you down
And how you gonna carry your own weight
When I am not around
Or do you want to rest your head
In a field in the moonlight
Or do you want to hold this slave
And let it burn through the night

Are you gonna run
Til you can't anymore
You know it's gonna hurt
You know it's gonna hurt
With your heart on the floor
But you want to fall in love
Do you want to touch
Light of morning
Cause its you I'm thinking of
Its you I'm thinking of
You don't have to hold breath
Til you can't breathe
Don't have to cry yourself to sleep
And you've been walking after midnight
On a tight rope
I can see you shaking now
Are you gonna run
Are you gonna run
Til you can't anymore
You know it's gonna hurt
You know it's gonna hurt
With your heart on the floor
Are you gonna run
Are you gonna run
Til you can't anymore
You know it's gonna hurt
You know it's gonna hurt
With your heart on the floor
But you want to fall in love
Do you want to touch
Light of morning
Cause its who you I'm thinking
Its you I'm thinking of
