And we've got miles to go before we can sleep
I said, we've been walking a thin line
You've got one hand on the devil baby and one hand in mine
But don't let go no it's not too late you know
Hold on we're gonna make it if it takes all night
Hearts racing like a rocket at the speed of light
Don't fight it we've been running for far too long
We're going back where we belong
So hold on we got our wings and we're chasing the wind
Farewell to all the places that we have been
And if it takes us all night long
We're going back where we belong
So we'll build temples in our heads
When we've grown frail and all our bones are of lead
We've been walking a winding road
Let's go, no footsteps to follow baby and no signs to guide us home
But don't let go, no it's not too late you know
Hold on we're gonna make it if it takes all night
Hearts racing like a rocket at the speed of light
Don't fight it we've been running for far too long
We're going back where we belong
So hold on we got our wings and we're chasing the wind
Farewell to all the places that we have been
And if it takes us all night long
We're going back where we belong

More than a soul in a boat in a sea of sinking dreams
And I have to be sure that there's gonna be a cure
'cause somewhere down the line, I lost that part of me that's pure
But don't you let go yet no it's not too late you know
Hold on we're gonna make it if takes all night
Hearts racing like a rocket at the speed of light
Don't fight it we've been running for far too long
We're going back where we belong
So hold on we got our wings and we're chasing the wind
Farewell to all the places that we have been
And if it takes us all night long
We're going back where we belong
Hold on we're gonna make it if it takes all night
Hearts racing like a rocket at the speed of light
And if it takes us all night long
We're going back where we belong
