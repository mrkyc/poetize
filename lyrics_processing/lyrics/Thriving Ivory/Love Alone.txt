I know you're bruised
But it's only on the inside
I know you're lost
And you're confused
It's only on the inside
I see you walk
And you're dragging your feet
But it's only for a moment
Stuck at the part
Where you're feeling complete
Yeah, it's only for a moment
It's not too late to walk in my direction
When honey everything you'll needs in your reflection
Who's gonna walk you home
And who's gonna hold your hand
When you're heavy like a stone
And there's trouble where you stand
No I won't tell your heart where to go
Or make it feel something it won't
You could rearrange the stars
And make them all your own
But you can't fall in love alone
You might also likeI know you're torn
And in between dreams
But it's all you've ever known
And I know you're worn out at the seams
Yeah, it's all you've ever known
Well there's no place left for you to run
You can cast your past into the sun
Watch it light up the night
And honey you will be fine
It's not too late to walk in my direction
When honey everything you'll needs in your reflection
Who's gonna walk you home
And who's gonna hold your hand
When you're heavy like a stone
And there's trouble where you stand
No I won't tell your heart where to go
Or make it feel something it won't
You could rearrange the stars
And make them all your own
But you can't fall in love alone
You can't fall in love alone
Tell me who's gonna walk you home, yeah, oh
Who's gonna walk you home
Who's gonna hold your hand
When you're heavy like a stone
And there's trouble where you stand
No I won't tell your heart where to go
Or make it feel something it won't
You could rearrange the stars
And make them all your own
Tell me who's gonna walk you home
Tell me who's gonna walk you home
