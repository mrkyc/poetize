You don't say any more than you have to
Have you lost touch
With the ones you adore and sought after, yeah
And you don't know why
Yeah, they put a bullet through your heart
And told you not to cry
You know life should be beautiful
So come on out of your shadow for while
I wanna know where you go
When you're dreaming
I wanna see what you see
When your eyes close
And when it all goes down
Will you have a place to run?
Cause I don't know and I can't tell what you're thinking
So we'll just drive through the night
Till we find some kind of home
I swear I never mentioned this to anyone
So go on, you can tell me what it is
You see I, I'm barely hanging on to you
And the way I feel, yeah, somethings got to give
I wanna know where you go
When you're dreaming
I wanna see what you see
When your eyes close
And when it all goes down
Will you have a place to run?
Cause I don't know and I can't tell what you're thinking
So we'll just drive through the night

Yeah, some kind of home
It's hard enough to walk a line in pieces
But you don't have to do this on your own
We can pass the time by reading signs along the freeway
You don't have to do this alone
I wanna know where you go
When you're dreaming
I wanna see what you see
When your eyes close
And when it all goes down
Will you have a place to run?
Cause I don't know and I can't tell what you're thinking
So we'll just drive through the night
Till we find some kind of home
I wanna know where you go
When you're dreaming
I wanna see what you see
When your eyes close
And when it all goes down
Will you have a place to run?
Cause I don't know and I can't tell what you're thinking
So we'll just drive through the night
Till we find some kind of home
