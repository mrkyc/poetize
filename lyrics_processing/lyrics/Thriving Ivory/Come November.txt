You will stand a fool in the Desert
A boy with no plan
The day's on her last leg again
I cross it all slowing while the next
One comes in
But it don't really matter
Noo
You can't have the world see you like this
And you can't stay for more than a Night
That you'll be close where you are
And that I will be missed
But still I can't turn out the
Lights
I don't want to live in limbo baby
I don't want to come home to an empty bed
Said I'm so tired of the quiet baby
And I'm to young to play
Dead
So come on and go out with grace
Lay down for a season and down for the rain
You might also likeSay you can't have the world see you like this
And you can't stay for more than a Night
That you'll be close where you are
And that I will be missed
But still I can't turn out the
Lights
I can hear you footsteps at the front door
I can feel your heart pressed upon your poor soul
But it don't really matter
Cuz you'll be home Come November
I can see you tremble from here
I can see you tremble from here
And I think I'm gonna to break soon
Said I think I'm gonna break soon
You can't have the world see you like this
And you can't stay for more than a Night
I can hear you footsteps at the front door
I can feel your heart pressed upon your poor soul
But it don't really matter
No it dont really matter
You can't have the world see you like this
And you can't stay for more than a Night
That you'll be close where you are
And that I will be missed
But still I can't turn out the
Lights
I can hear you footsteps at the front door
I can feel your heart pressed upon your poor soul
But it don't really matter
