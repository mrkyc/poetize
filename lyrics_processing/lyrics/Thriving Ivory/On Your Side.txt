Where I stood with you
And my safest bet
Was to disconnect
Yes it?s been so long
But the chemicals are never wrong
Don?t you get me wrong
You see I don?t mind falling in love again
My heart on the line again
No I don?t mind
When I?m on your side
See I?m not ready to go alone
So no one told you that a heart could be forever
When I?m not leaving cause were in this thing together
And I don?t know which way will take us home
I?m not ready to go alone
So no one told you it don?t matter where the road leads
Cause where were going no we won?t need anything
And this is not
Goodbye
I?m always on your side
On your side
Well I never quite knew how to handle you
Will it play out soon?
Or should I make a move
Can you see what you started?
Now I?m wounded and guarded
You lead me to believe that were all broken hearted
See I don?t mind falling in love again
My heart on the line again
No I don?t mind

This is not goodbye
I?m always on your side
No this is not goodbye
