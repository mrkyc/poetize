I don't know how you ended up walking out of that bar
Same time I was trying to remember where I parked
I was thinking I should just walking
But damn it if you didn't start talking
You said how you been girl? Hear you're doing good
Wanted to call but I never know if I should
I noticed you were leaving alone
I said I'm tryna beat the storm home

Stood there waiting for goodbye
Thinking I'd never see you again
It was a flash of lightning
Your eyes caught mine

And then it started raining, coming down and soaking my dress
You started saying how without me you can't breathe
And then you pulled me in, we kissed and we danced
Everything I missed came pouring back
I swear I was doing just fine baby
Then it started raining

There was something inside of us standing there
Under the street light, the sky falling in our hair
Caught up in the flood
As it was storming all around us
I was one breath away taking two steps back
It ain't easy getting over getting hurt like that
My heart was telling me to leave
But memories got the best of me
You might also like
When it started raining, coming down and soaking my dress
You started saying how without me you can't breathe
And then you pulled me in, we kissed and we danced
Everything I missed came pouring back
I swear I was doing just fine baby
Then it started raining
Then it started raining, coming down and soaking my dress
You started saying how without me you can't breathe
And then you pulled me in, we kissed and we danced
Everything I missed came pouring back
I swear I was doing just fine baby
Yeah, I was doing just fine baby
Then it started raining
Ooh, ooh
