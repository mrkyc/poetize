Casey needs another spray-on tan
Momma's here to keep Cheyenne
It's almost nine o'clock and time to go
She's livin' in a single-wide
Doin' what she has to to survive
And Tuesday nights are always kinda slow

But she hops into that old TransAm
Cranks up some Marshall Tucker Band
Puttin' make-up on singin' 'long to Can't You See
Yeah, she walks into that backstage door
Changes out of what she wore
Pours herself a double shot of Jackie D

Ain't exactly where she wants to be
Next month's rent don't grow on trees
And she tries to put a smile upon her face
As the DJ calls her up to the stage
She goes by another name
And hides behind the whiskey and lace

She spins around to Purple Rain
Every night's the same damn thing
She drifts off into another place
She don't wanna see who's here tonight
Thank God the spotlight blinds her eyes
And it won't take long 'til the music starts to fade
You might also like
Now she's pickin' up dollar bills
Leaves the runway in her heels
Starts countin' out the cash she gets to keep
She towels off, checks her hair
Falls into her dressin' chair
Pours herself another shot of Jackie D

Ain't exactly where she wants to be
Next month's rent don't grow on trees
And she tries to put a smile upon her face
As the DJ calls her up to the stage
She goes by another name
And hides behind the whiskey and lace

This shift's about to end
And now it's almost two AM
And she's wishin' she was home there with Cheyenne

Ain't exactly where she wants to be
Next month's rent don't grow on trees
And she tries to put a smile upon her face
As the DJ calls her up to the stage
She goes by another name
And hides behind the whiskey and lace
Ooo, ooo, ooo
