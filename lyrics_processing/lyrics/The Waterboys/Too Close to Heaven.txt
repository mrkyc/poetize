You are gonna see those blue skies bursting right through the rain
The higher you climb, the lower you fall
You got too close to heaven, that's all
Now in the morning you can cry all that you want to
We'll spend the whole day weeping
Right now I want you to lay down your weary head
And let me see you sleeping
You've been walking around baby, inflamed and ashamed
Feeling like you're one inch tall
You got too close to heaven, that's all
You're way too hard on yourself baby
You got some pretty basic things wrong
You wouldn't believe me if I told you why I wrote you into this song
You're looking at your heart baby, and you're calling it black
But like Icarus and like Saul
You got too close to heaven, that's all
Now I know this hurt you're feeling - I've felt these same things too
I've got spaces way down deep inside of me that are just the same as you
You wanna wrap your arms around your head, turn out the lights
And roll yourself into a ball
You got too close to heaven, that's all

Are you dazzled by the Light?
Why is it I see nothing but emptiness in your tired beaten eyes
That once were bright
I know you just can't help but run when you hear that sweet voice call
You got too close to heaven, that's all
I walked a mile for you, baby
I walked a mile for you, baby
I walked a mile for you, baby
So won't you smile for me, baby?
So won't you smile for me, baby?
Smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Won't you smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Come on and smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Come on and smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Smile for me, baby
Ooh
Smile for me, baby
Come on and smile for me, baby
Come on and smile for me, baby
Smile for me, smile for me, smile for me
