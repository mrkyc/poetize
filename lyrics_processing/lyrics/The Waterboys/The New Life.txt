And I'm free at last
All my chains are
In the past
The new life starts here
(I was trying to get happy
I thought it was hard
Until I found that
In my own back yard
The new life starts here)
The day is wide open
The sky is blue
The world is a miracle
And so are you
The new life starts here
My papers arrived
Stamped and complete
All previous dispatches
Are obsolete
The new life starts here
I can see my way so clear
Rejoice for...
The new life starts here

But it ain't in my head
I just declared a state of
Peace instead
The new life starts here
(Tempters and tricksters
Banging at my door
I'm not fighting with them
Anymore
The new life starts here
/
Users, abusers
Banging at my door
I'm not fighting with them
Anymore
The new life starts here
Tempsters and tricksters
Wondering how
To seize my attention
They cannot touch me now
The new life starts here)
Generals, Presidents
How do you do?
I can make it with or
Without you
The new life starts here
I can see my way so clear
Rejoice for...
The new life starts here
Are you under the Mercy?
Are you under attack?
Are you going forward?
Are you going back?
The new life starts here
(Are you coming to grips?
Are you coming apart?
Are you listening to fear?
Or to your heart?
The new life starts here
/
Are you building heaven
Or are you building hell?
When that great day comes
Will you be able to tell?
The new life starts here)
Citizen, criminal, child
Woman or man
The keys to the Kingdom
Are in your own hands
The new life starts here
(God of our love
Who ignited the sun
Not my will
But thine be done
The new life starts here)
Mock the devil
Make him sweat!
He hasn't won
The battle yet
The new life starts here
(A whole new age in seven more years
A brave new age in ten more years)
Rejoice for...
