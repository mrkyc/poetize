In full effect!
("Word up!")
("Know we need it. Know we need it.")
("Give it to me. Give it, give it")

It's the New Jack Swing
Yes, it's something funky that you can cling
All you gotta do is c'mon and sing
Word for word, every lyric that I bring
And if you surely swing your body
When you step in cool inside a party
Watching all the girls just pumping like hotties
They have parts that look better than Ferraris
So I had to try these
Dancing, with this girl, on my luck
I was chancing, hoping she was the type for romancing
But my rap needed a little enhancing
Because this girlie wasn't answering
Nothing I said, I started getting fed and turning red
Then, I told her just a bit about Ted
She gave a wink and started to think
But didn't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing

("You got to get down, you got to get down"
"You got to get down, down, down, down")
Didn't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing
("You got to get down, you got to get down"
"You got to get down, down, down, down")
("Give it, give it, give it to me")

I made the New Jack Swing
Yes, T.R., is my name
Making you dance to my thing
Is the way I entertain, baby
I make the beats you like
Yes, that's right, it's outta sight
All my beats are very hype
Yes, G.R. is moving it, right?
I got Keith Sweat, Heavy D
Today, Moe Dee
B. Sure, and my man Bobby Brown
I got Zan the Man, Redhead
Boy George, James and
Deja, and my homeboys Guy
And you got to get fly


Back to the matter
The New Jack Swing is the sound that can flatter
Any other sound around town doesn't give the
Same type of feeling that this one delivers
So your body shivers, so bad
Some dope beat medicine you wish you had
Dipping your feelings from glad to sad
But you're not getting a thing
So just chill and get whipped by the New Jack Swing
