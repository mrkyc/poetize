A man sat down beside me, he had scars upon his hands
He told me some stories, I told him some lies
Light shone in the darkness, cast shadows from my mind
His eyes they looked right through me, oh I knew he carried weight
Something real was going down that day
Oh I told him, "I'm a sinner"
He said, "That's okay"
I'm not here to change you anyway
He was gone when I turned around
Was that Jesus? Jesus on a Greyhound
We talked about the world gone bad, the trouble we had seen
We talked about the dirt brown shoes he wore on his feet
He said, "I'm tired and weary, I've been riding a long way
Let me rest my eyes for now, let me drift away"
Oh he acted like he knew me and then he fell asleep
I had no more secrets I could keep
Oh I told him, "I'm a sinner"
He said, "That's okay"
I'm not here to change you anyway
He was gone when I turned around
Was that Jesus? Was that Jesus on a Greyhound?
Somewhere in the sunlit mornin'
I stepped off the bus in the middle of the city of angels
And that long haired hippie was up and gone
Where devils run and play and lust lookin' for the danger
Oh and I looked at my feet and saw the shoes that he had worn
And thank God for that beautiful stranger
Was that Jesus?
Was that Jesus?
Was that Jesus?
Oh I told him, "I'm a sinner"
He said, "That's okay"
I'm not here to change you anyway
He was gone when I turned around
Was that Jesus? Jesus on a Greyhound?
Was that Jesus on a Greyhound today?
And I'll rise again
Oh there ain't no power on earth can keep me down
Say and I'll rise, I'll rise again
Oh ain't no death can keep me in the ground
Was that Jesus?
Was that Jesus on the Greyhound?
