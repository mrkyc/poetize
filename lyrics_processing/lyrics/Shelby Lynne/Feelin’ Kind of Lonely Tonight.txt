It was good for you to go
A little time apart would tell us
What we need to know
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
We said we wouldn't talk
To one another on the phone
A little time apart to try
To make it on our own
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
**Well, maybe it's better
And maybe it's not
Maybe we should look
At everything we've got
Maybe those bad times
They weren't so bad
And maybe those sad times
They weren't so sad
Well I don't think I like
The way this thing is workin' out
I don't think this pain
Is what our love is all about
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
You might also like(32 count wait)
**Well, maybe it's better
And maybe it's not
Maybe we should look
At everything we've got
Maybe those bad times
They weren't so bad
And maybe those sad times
They weren't so sad
Well I don't think I like
The way this thing is workin' out
I don't think this pain
Is what our love is all about
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
(32 count wait)
**Whoa, maybe it's better
And maybe it's not
Maybe we should look
At everything we've got
Maybe those bad times
They weren't so bad
And maybe those sad times
They weren't so sad
Well I don't think I like
The way this thing is workin' out
I don't think this pain
Is what our love is all about
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
Well, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
Yeah, I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' kind of lonely tonight
