Superfly
Stays high
Sneakin down the alleyway to make another buy
Talkin bout a big deal
Big wheel
Nothins real
Wouldn't know the truth if it looked him in the eye
Sneakin out the back door
Top floor
Dirt poor
You know the boys gonna get himself in jail
Living on the back street
Concrete
Fast speed
Lost in the jungle with the tiger by the tail
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
He's just barely getting by
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
He's down there getting high

Whats it mean
Bad dreams
Shiverin and shakin in the middle of the night
Down in a cold sweat
In debt
Upset
Hidin in the back room to keep ot of sight
Walkin that tough walk
Jivetalk
Double cross
Sneakin down the side street hidin from the sun
Makin them big plans
Big man
Be this man
Gonna make a million but he never gets it done
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
He's just barely getting by
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
He's down there getting high
Thinks he's a loverboy
Super joy
Tough toy
Thinks he's kinda sexy but the ladies say he ain't
Nothing but a no class
Jiveass
Movin fast
Wants to be a winner but the monkey says he can't
After hours nightspot
Whatcha got
Hot shot
Gotta keep movin just to keep from going down
The boy won't ever learn
Slow burn
Overturn
End up in a coffin there six feet in the ground
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
He's just barely getting by
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
Everytime I see him
