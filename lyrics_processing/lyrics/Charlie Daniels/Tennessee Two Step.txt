There's a dance they do down in Tennessee
It's just as simple as one two three
The old folks do it and the young folks too
Your little brother Billy and your old Aunt Sue
It's just a hillbilly rhythm with a touch of the blues
It ain't nothing but a simple little country song
Keep moving to the music and you can't go wrong
Do the Tennessee two-step all night long
They do it down in Memphis on a Saturday night
And them folks in Chattanooga think it's out of sight
Down in Music City, it's all the rage
They do it on the Grand Old Opry stage
Even heard them talking bout it on Crook and Chase
They say it even makes the Smoky Mountains smoke
Like wildfire spreading everywhere you go
And it's a Tennessee two-step they do it on a hardwood floor
I said the Tennessee two-step one time you're going to holler for more
You put your right foot forward and your left foot back
Start a little wiggle in your sacroiliac
And that's a Tennessee two-step they do it on a hardwood floor
From the Mississippi River to the Cumberland Gap
They don't want to hear no rock any they don't want to hear no rap
Tennessee people like to do it up proud
They turn the lights down low the music up loud
Grab yourself a partner and follow the crowd
Everybody's smiling cause they're feeling fine
Get yourself together in a big long line
To a Tennessee two-step, they do it on a hardwood floor
I said the Tennessee two-step one time you're going to holler for more
You put your right foot forward
They say it even makes the Smoky Mountains smoke
You put your right foot forward
I said a Tennessee two-step they do it on a hardwood floor
