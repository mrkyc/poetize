What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pick-up truck
And I'm full of American pride
I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in minding
No one's business but my own
And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame old John Wayne
Didn't live to run for president
And I don't care what nobody says
I don't trust old Gorbachev
And I don't know who turned him on
But it's time to turn him off
You might also like
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

Now they're trying to take my guns away
And that would be just fine
If you take them away from the criminals first
I'll gladly give you mine
And I don't mind paying taxes
But it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes
To make some politician rich
What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothing but a working man
And he makes his living
By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothing that you can do
Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

That's what we need
