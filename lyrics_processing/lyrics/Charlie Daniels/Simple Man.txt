I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things goin' on that make me mad down to the core
I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder than hell, and I ain't a-gonna take it no more

We tell our kids, "Just say no"
And then some panty-waist judge lets a drug dealer go
He slaps him on the wrist and he turns him back out on the town
But if I had my way with people sellin' dope
Take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Now I'm the kinda man wouldn't harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house
I got twelve-gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side
So don't go pushin' me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
If you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by
You might also like
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the rapin' and the killin' and the child abuse
But I got a way to put an end to all that fast
You just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Watch where you go and remember where you been
