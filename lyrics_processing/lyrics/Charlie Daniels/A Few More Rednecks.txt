Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need
I was raised on beans and cornbread and I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck and I'm full of American pride
I keep a Bible on my table, I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in mindin' no one's business but my own
And I love them Rambo movies, I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame ole John Wayne didn't live to run for president
And I don't care what nobody says I don't trust ole Gorbachev
And I don't know who turned him on but it's time to turn him off
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need
You might also likeNow they're tryin' to take my guns away and that would be just fine
If you take 'em away from the criminals first, I'll gladly give you mine
And I don't mind payin' taxes but it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes to make some politician rich
What most people call a redneck ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin' by the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us
Common folks then there ever will be of you
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need
