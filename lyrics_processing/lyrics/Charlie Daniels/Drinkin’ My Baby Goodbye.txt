That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye
Everytime we disagreed
She was always askin' me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone
She probably thinks I'm home
Just a mopin' around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing
I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer
As long as these bottles hold out
Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool
That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye
You might also likeEvery time I try to sit down and talk to her
It always ends up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up to the time
She got on that Greyhound bus
It would be better if I could forget her
'Cause she sure forgot about me
And if takes all night I'm gonna' do it right
I'm gonna' sit here till I can't see
Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool
That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
