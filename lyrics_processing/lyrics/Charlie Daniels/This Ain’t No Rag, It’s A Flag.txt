And we don't wear it on our heads
It's a symbol of the land where the good guys live
Are you listening to what I said
You're a coward and a fool
And you broke all the rules
And you wounded our American pride
And now we're coming with a gun
And you know you're gonna run
But you can't find no place to hide
We're gonna hunt you down like a mad dog hound
Make you pay for the lives you stole
We're all through talking and a-messing around
And now it's time to rock and roll
These colors don't run and we speak as one
When we say united we stand
If you mess with one, you mess with us all
Every boy, girl, woman and man
You've been acting mighty rash
And talking that trash
Let me give you some advice
You could crawl back in your hole
Like a dirty little mole
But now it's time to pay the price
You might've shot us in the back
Now you have to face the fact
That the big boy's in the game
And the thunder's been crashing
And the lightning's been flashing
And now it's getting ready to rain
You might also likeThis is the United States of America
The land of the brave and free
We believe in God, we believe in justice
We believe in liberty
You've been a-pulling our chain
We should've done something 'bout you a long time ago
But now the flag's flying high
And the fur's gonna fly
Soon the whole world's gonna know
This ain't no rag, it's a flag
Old Glory, red, white and blue
The stars and the stripes when it comes to a fight
We could do what we have to do
Our people stand proud
The American crowd is faithful and loyal and tough
We're as good as the best and better than the rest
You're gonna find out soon enough
When you look up in the sky
And you see the eagle fly
You better know he's a-headed your way
This ain't no rag, it's a flag
And it stands for the USA
USA
USA
USA
USA
When you look up in the sky
And you see the eagle fly
You better know he's a-headed your way
'Cause this ain't no rag, it's a flag
And it stands for the USA
