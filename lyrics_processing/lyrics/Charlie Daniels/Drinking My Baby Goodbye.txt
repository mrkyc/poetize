Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye

Every time we disagreed
She was always asking me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone
She probably thinks I'm home
Just a moping around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing
I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer
As long as these bottles hold out

Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye

Every time I try to sit down and talk to her
It always ends up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up to the time
She got on that Greyhound bus
It would be better if I could forget her
Because she sure forgot about me
And if takes all night I'm going to do it right
I'm going to sit here till I can't see

Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
