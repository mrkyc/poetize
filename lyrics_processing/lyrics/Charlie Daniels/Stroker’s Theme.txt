He had a mean streak ten feet wide
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and
More than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with the devils
Nerve and make a car dance across the mud
Hauling 'shine was his regular line 'til the
Track got in his blood
Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot but
Man that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with the bed-room eyes
And in a racing tide or a bar room fight old Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a race track Romeo
Mama lock your daughters up
That wild bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky
When they hear that racecar sound
They're bringin out the yellow flag
Somebody's brakes have failed
There's an oilslick on the inside
And a wreck along the rail
You better stand on it, Stroker
Cause a bandit's on your tail
You might also likeIt's a downright joy for a country boy
When he hears them engines moan
But you gotta hang tough and it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own
Cause they'll push you around, they'll knock you down
They'll shove ya up against the wall
And you always know when your engine blows
And a man can't win 'em all
You could push that car
Just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you break your neck
In some damn fool wreck they forget about you soon
But old Stroker Ace was born to race
And it's worth all the trying
Just to drink champagne in the Victory Lane
And to hear that concrete whine
Stroker get your dander up
This ain't no time to lag
You've got to make a lap up
If you gonna to take that checkered flag
Number ten is closin' in to even up the score
It's time to wave bye-bye and put the pedal on the floor
You better stand on it Stroker
Cause you're blowin' off their doors
Blow their doors off, Stroker
Stand on it, Son
