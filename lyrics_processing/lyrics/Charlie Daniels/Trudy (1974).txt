Call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

Now John Lee Walker was a card mechanic
Had a hand for trouble and a eye for cash
Luckiest man in Dallas County
He had a gold watch chain and a black mustache
And he loved his whiskey and he loved his women
Drove a big long Cadillac limousine
Kept a big, fine, fancy townhouse in Dallas
And a hotel suite in New Orleans
Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket
And a .44 hog leg up under his coat
Cut you down in a New York minute
If he catch you cheating, that was all she wrote

So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

I just got to town last Friday evening
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay
I was on my way back to Louisiana
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay
I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on Deep Elm
I was flying high and feeling mean
Poured down a bottle and a half of Red Eye
I dropped thirty-five dollars in the slot machine
And the boys in the back was a-dealing seven card
I sat down and won me a hundred and ten
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond
'Til big John Lee come a-strolling in
He ripped off the table like a 707
Pretty soon, he done won all of my bread
I accused him of cheating, he reached for a pistol
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head
Then I took off a-running like a motorcycle
Heard the bullets whining and the sirens wail
But it took half the cops in Dallas County
Just to put one coon-ass boy in jail

So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
