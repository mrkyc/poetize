You could keep into the grinds, in your grinds
Didn't you?
People call, say: "Beware doll"
Though your mind was filled with other thoughts
They were all a-kidding you
You use to laugh 'bout everybody
That was up hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
Your next meal
Well-a how does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Oh, how you gonna go to find a school
Oh, I'm writing this a letter
'Cause you know you only use to get juiced
Nobody's ever cause you had to live out in the street
But now you're not out to get use to it
You might also likeYou say you'll never compromise with the mystery tramps
But now you realize he's not selling any alibis
As he stares into the back of you both of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
Oh, who does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no directions home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Oh, you never been around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did their tricks for you
You never understand this is ain't no good
To let other people get your kicks for you
You use to ride on a chrome home house
With your daytimes
He carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover
That he really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal
Well-a how does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no directions home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made
Exchanging all the precious gifts and thinking
That you better live
Paid you a diamond ring you better pawn it babe
You use to be so amused at Napoleon in rags
At the language he used
Go to him now he calls you, you can't refuse
You've got nothing to lose
You've got nothing to lose
You're invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
Well, how does it feel?
Ah, how does it feel?
To be on you on your own
With no directions home
Like a complete unknown
