And a half million pounds. That's more money than most people
Can dream of. But then
Some people have big dreams
What if we get caught? - 'Course we won't! - But say we do? -
Don't worry
Just think about the money
Imagine what you can do with it
This is the last job I'm gonna do. I'm in for this one
Then I'm out
It's a life of luxury
My son. -
I'm off to Spain and that's it. -
Go to Spain
This is gonna be the crime of the century!
Some are willing to murder for a night out on the town
Others hang around you when there's lots of it around
But worst of all are people who really have no need
They do it for these reasons
In spite and out of greed

They're clean
Don't worry. Hey

Worry ! -

Their mess. -
