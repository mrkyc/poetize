A special lady so warm and true
You'd always show me how much you care
In times of trouble you'd always be there
And for your children you did all you could
You made my life happy and good
Then came the news
It cut like a knife
It was the coldest day of my life
It seemed that time was not on your side
Your right to live had been denied
You may be gone
But you'll never be forgotten
You may be gone
But I still think about you often
I don't know how, I can't say when
But I know one day we'll meet again
Maybe in heaven, where you made your home
You're with the angels, not on your own
You may be gone
But you'll never be forgotten
You may be gone
But I still think about you often
And now I'm looking at your picture
It's hard to believe I won't see you no more
But I'm gonna say thank you
The only way I can
I keep telling you again and again...
You may be gone (oooh)
But you'll never be forgotten (I'm gonna miss you)
You may be gone
But I still think about you often
From when I wake up till I go to sleep
These memories I'll always keep
The stairway to heaven
You have now climbed
Eternal peace I hope you find
You may be gone
But you'll never be forgotten
You may be gone
But I still think about you often
You may be gone
You may be gone
You may be gone
But I won't forget you
I hope so hard this song will get through
To let you know
Let you know we're still thinking of you
We're thinking of you
I don't know how, I can't say when
But I know yes I know
I'm gonna see you again
You may be gone (you'll climb the stairway)
But you'll never be forgotten (to heaven)
Never be forgotten
Never be forgotten
You may be gone
