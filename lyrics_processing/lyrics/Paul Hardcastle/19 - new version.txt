It was different in many ways, as so were those that did the fighting
In World War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26
In Vietnam he was 19
In-in-in Vietnam he was 19
The shooting and fighting of the past two weeks continued today
25 miles west of Saigon
I really wasn't sure what was going on
Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19
19, 19, 19, 19
In Vietnam the combat soldier typically served
A twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday
Ni-ni-ni 19, Ni-ni-ni 19
Hundreds of thousands of men who saw heavy combat
In Vietnam were arrested since discharge
Their arrest rate is almost twice that of non-veterans of the same age
There are no accurate figures of how many of these men
Have been incarcerated
But a Veterans Administration study
Concludes that the greater of vets
Exposure to combat could more likely affect his chances
Of being arrested or convicted
This is one legacy of the Vietnam War
All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average was 19
De-de-destruction
De-de-destruction
War, war
De-de-destruction, wa, wa, war, wa, war, war
De-de-destruction
War, war
After World War II the men came home together on troop ships
But the Vietnam vet often arrived home within 48 hours of jungle combat
Perhaps the most dramatic difference between
World War II and Vietnam was coming home
None of them received a hero's welcome
None of them received a heroes welcome, none of them, none of them
Ne-ne-ne, ne-ne-ne, none of them, none of them, none of them
None of them received a hero's welcome
None of them received a hero's welcome
According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered from what
Psychiatrists call
Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight hundred thousand men are still fighting the Vietnam War
De-de-destruction

When we came back it was different, everybody wants to know
"How'd it happened to those guys over there
There's gotta be something wrong somewhere
We did what we had to do
There's gotta be something wrong somewhere
People wanted us to be ashamed of what it made us
They had no idea where we've been 5 to 10 years now
All we want to do is come home
All we want to do is come home
What did we do it for?
All we want to do is come home
