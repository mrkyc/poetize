Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
All I do is a constant reminder
The future's here and it walks right behind you
All I see is a constant illusion
My head spins and my world's in confusion
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
All I see is self-rearranging
The moment's here but it's already changing
Take one step and that's your direction
You ain't sure, now, was that the intention?
Pre - Chorus:
Close my eyes, I think of times
And this memory's twisting my head
I've got a feelin' that it's all not over yet
I've got some things that I just cannot forget
Chorus:
All I do is think of you, you've got me on the run
On the run, on the run
On the run, on the run
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Look in, look in, look in
Looking round, you can take it or leave it
You got a feeling but you must believe it
All you do is constantly changing
You feel a rise and it's already fading

(Guitar Solo)
It's taken so long for the sun to appear
(look in, look in, look in, look out)
Now the blue sky above is so clear
(look out, look out, look out, look in)
And everything you need is so near
(look in, look in, look in, look in, look in, look out)
It's taken so long for the sun to appear
(look in, look in, look in, look out)
Now the blue sky above is so clear
(look out, look out, look out, look in)
Oh, and everything you need is so near
