I can't stop
Keep movin'
Yeah yeah
I can't stop
You made your decision
And left me crying in the cold
There's no turning back, girl
On this love thing you let go
Maybe tomorrow you'll find yourself another man
I hope you treat him with passion
Not like a fairweather friend
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
All through the good times
We were good lovers
There could be no other
Then came stormy waters
You replied
Can't stop now
I must be moving on
Can't stop-keep movin'
Can't stop my emotions
The feeling has gone
Keep movin'
Keep movin' on
