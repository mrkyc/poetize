This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline? Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene? Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it, but I've gotta know

"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
See Red Hot Chili Peppers LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
I saw you out there yesterday. What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray. What did you wanna say?
A masterpiece of DNA caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died, I could not get my copper clean

I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it, but I've gotta know

"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling  all I can do to you

I am a misfit, I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray, a mash of DNA
