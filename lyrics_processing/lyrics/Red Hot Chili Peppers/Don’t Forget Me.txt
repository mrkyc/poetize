I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you wanna resume
Now we know it all for sure

I'm a dance hall, dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go


I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go

(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, get me excited
See Red Hot Chili Peppers LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like

I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go

(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, make me excited
(Oh-oh)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
There's a match, now let me light it

I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Comin' down and more are comin' to believe
Now we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go

I'll be there but tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
