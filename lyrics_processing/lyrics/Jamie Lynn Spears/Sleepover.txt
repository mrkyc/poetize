You don't know me well enough to see me with my makeup off yet
But I bet you'd like my hair all messed up
If you can get through the night without my kiss
Then call me in the morning sayin' you miss me
When you wake up, then maybe we can give this another shot

Cause I like that takin' me out, treatin' me like a lady
While I'm figurin' out do I wanna be your baby?
Give me that old school dinner for two
You like the Stones? Well hey, me too
I ain't saying you ain't gettin' to me, yeah
And I ain't saying I ain't feelin' the heat
I ain't drunk and you ain't sober
Sure feels good here leanin' on your shoulder
But this ain't no, this ain't no
This ain't no, oh no no
This ain't no sleepover

I think love should take it slow
It's good that they have somewhere to go
But when it's this electric
If we go too fast then we might wreck this
You might also like
Cause I like that takin' me out, treatin' me like a lady
While I'm figurin' out do I wanna be your baby?
Give me that old school dinner for two
You like the Stones? Well hey, me too
I ain't saying you ain't gettin' to me, yeah
And I ain't saying I ain't feelin' the heat
I ain't drunk and you ain't sober
Sure feels good here leanin' on your shoulder
But this ain't no, this ain't no
This ain't no, oh no no
This ain't no sleepover

Cause I like takin' me out, treatin' me like a lady
While I'm figurin' out do I want to be your baby?
Give me that front porch goodnight kiss
Give me that look in your eyes like this
I ain't sayin' you ain't getting to me, yeah
And I ain't saying I ain't feelin' the heat
I ain't drunk and you ain't sober
Sure feels good here leanin' on your shoulder
But this ain't no, this ain't no
This ain't no, oh no no
