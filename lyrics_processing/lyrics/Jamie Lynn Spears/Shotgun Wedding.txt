Wasn't nothing but a Friday night
He told me he loved me and it just felt right
Didn't take more than a couple weeks
I got the news in the ladies room at the bp
A little pink plus and there wasn't no guessing
We're gonna have us a shotgun wedding

It ain't cause mama didn't raise me right
Ain't cause daddy didn't try try try
Two bored kids on a Friday night
Got to kissing in the dark in a parking lot

Calling up family and we're making plans
Getting me a hand-me-down wedding band
Ready or not daddy's gonna give his blessing
On a shotgun wedding

My white dress might be off a shade
But it still gonna be my perfect day
And knowing the redneck side of the room
There might even be a shotgun or two
The backyard's gonna be the perfect setting...
We're gonna have us a shotgun wedding

I ain't trying to say it's right
Cause you can make a lot of plans but you can't plan life

It ain't cause mama didn't raise me right
Ain't cause daddy didn't try try try
Two bored kids on a Friday night
Got to kissing in the dark in a parking lot

Calling up family and we're making plans
Getting me a hand-me-down wedding band
Ready or not daddy's gonna give his blessing
On a shotgun
On a shotgun
On a shotgun
On a shotgun wedding
Yeahhh
