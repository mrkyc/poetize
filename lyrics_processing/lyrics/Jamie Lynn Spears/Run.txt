I'm bored, it's hot
Let's play a little game of ready or not
Gas up, drive through
Pick us up a margarita or two
Two lanes no phone
No time I gotta get back home

You know I know
You wanna know
No need to fight
It'd be a crying shame
To waste this night

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come
So baby let's run

Be bad be good
Wait 'til you see what's under this hood
It's fast it's strong
Brace yourself you better hold on
You might also like
You drive I'll ride
Take you cross the river to the other side
Round here we don't fool around
Ain't no moon tonight for slowin' down

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come
So baby let's run

Run with me honey
Run with me honey
Run with me honey
Run with me honey
You ain't got nothin' better to do than...

Run with me honey
I'll take you on down to where I'm from
Come with me honey
Where everything's sacred and nothing gets done
We got a whole town full of saints and sinners
Late to rise and early for dinner
Either way the sun's gonna come
Don't you know that you could be the one
So baby let's run
You know you wanna run
Mm, mmmm, mm, mmmm
Run
Mmm, mmm
