Oh I hear that river
It knows me all too well
It's begging for a party
And I ain't going by myself
Awww, don't just sit there
Say yes and make it fast
Don't tell me you don't wanna
Make some footprints in the grass

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Mandolin summer sun

It sounds like innocence
It sounds like letting go
Sounds like you've got it made
And not afraid to let it show
Get out your wild and reckless
Get out your two left feet
A little side of crazy
Yeah, yeah that's all you need
You might also like
Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Mandolin summer sun

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around

Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Find somebody and fall in love
Close your eyes and spin around
Sing it out, shout it out
Tell the moon that you ain't done with that
Freer than you've ever been
Throwin' caution to the wind
Prayin' that it never ends
Mandolin summer sun
Come on now, come on now
Get out your two left feet
Come on now, come on now
Yeah, yeah that's all you need
Pick it up, pick it up
Dance around 'til the sun goes down
Pick it up, pick it up
