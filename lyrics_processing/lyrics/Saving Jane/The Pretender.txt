I'm gonna pack my lunch in the morning and go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
Amen
I wanna know what became of the changes we waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams of each others awakening
I've been aware of the time going by
They say the end is the wink of an eye
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Amen
Caught between the longing for love and the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait for the ice cream vender
Out into the cool of the evening strools the pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams begin and end there
You might also likeI'm gonna find myself a boy who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors of each others paint by number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strenghth is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Do it again
I'm gonna be a happy idiot struggle for the legal tender
Where the eyes take aim
And lay their claim to the heart and the sole of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
And those things the money can buy
Your true love could have been a contender
Are you there
Say a prayer for the pretender
Who started out so young and stong
Only to surrender
Ahh
The laughter of the lovers as they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others but to choose off and fight
And chilling the world with all their might
While the ships, barring their dreams, sail out of sight
Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer for the pretender
Say a prayer, Say a prayer for the pretender
(Ahh the lovers as they run through the night)
Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer for the pretender
Say a prayer, Say a prayer
Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Say a prayer for the pretender
Say a prayer, Say a prayer, Saya prayer for the pretender
Say a prayer for the pretender
Gonna rent myself a house in the shade of the freeway
I'm gonna pack my lunch in the morning and go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
