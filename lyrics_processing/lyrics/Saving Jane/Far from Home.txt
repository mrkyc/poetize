Do you miss me? I really miss you
Hey Dad, what's been going on?
Tell me how's my brothers, yeah, how's my sister
Lately, I feel so far away
I'm too old to be a baby anymore
Yes, I've colored in my skin
Yeah, I know how much you hate that
But it's part of who I am and that's for sure
I'm leaving you but I'll be home soon
Don't cry, you know I love you
I gotta see the world but I'm still your girl
Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always love you
Hey friend, caught a movie by myself
It's not the same here, it's no fun without you
Some day is I feel like somebody else
Some kind of stranger when I'm not around you
So I guess I'll hit the road, never know where I am going
Every city different than the day before
But I'll call you on the phone, how I love to hear you talking
Gets me through a little dark and that's for sure
You might also likeI'm leaving you but I'll be home soon
Don't cry, you know I love you
I gotta see the world but I'm still your girl
And I'm fine, I'll always love you
Please don't forget that I'm thinking of you
Your fingerprint's on everything that I do
Please don't be lonely 'cause I'm coming home
I'll be back before you ever knew I was gone
Well, I gotta hit the road, I'm so tired but I'm going
'Cause a dreamer never sleeps and that's for sure
I'm leaving you but I'll be home soon
Don't cry, you know I love you
I gotta see the world but I'm still your girl
And I'm fine, I'll always love you
I'm leaving you but I'll be home soon
Don't cry, you know I love you
But I am far from home, I am far from home now
