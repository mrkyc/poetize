Small town homecoming queen
She's the star in this scene
There's no way to deny she's lovely
Perfect skin, perfect hair
Perfumed hearts everywhere
Tell myself that inside she's ugly

Maybe I'm just jealous
I can't help but hate her
Secretly I wonder if my boyfriend wants to date her

She is the prom queen
I'm in the marching band
She is a cheerleader
I'm sitting in the stands
She gets the top bunk
And I'm sleeping on the floor
She's Miss America
And I'm just the girl next door

Senior class president
She must be heaven sent
She was never the last one standing
A backseat debutante
Everything that you want
Never too harsh or too demanding
You might also like
Maybe I'll admit it
I'm a little bitter
Everybody loves her
But I just wanna hit her

She is the prom queen
I'm in the marching band
She is a cheerleader
I'm sitting in the stands
She gets the top bunk
I'm sleeping on the floor
She's Miss America
And I'm just the girl next door
Oh, and I'm just the girl next door

I don't know why I'm feeling sorry for myself (Myself)
I spend all my time wishing that I was someone else

She is the prom queen
And I'm in the marching band
She is a cheerleader
I'm sitting in the stands
I get a little bit, she gets a little more
She's Miss America, yeah
She's Miss America
And I'm just the girl next door
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey
I'm just the girl, ooh, I'm just the girl next door
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just the girl, I'm just the girl next door
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just the girl next door
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She is the prom queen
And I'm just the girl next door
