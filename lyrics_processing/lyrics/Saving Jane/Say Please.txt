And I begged for a sinner's reprieve
And I'll never forget the shame that I felt
When you loosened my grip on your sleeve
You said baby you didn't do anything wrong
There's just something that I have to say
And I said I'll never forgive you for this
Not even if you say please
I wanna hear say please baby
Please baby
I'm stupid, I was wrong
And you knew it all along
So get down on your knees baby
Swallow up your pride
You know it wouldn't hut to cry
And say please
Oh baby please
After you left you know it took me a while
To get myself off of the ground
It was maybe a month before they got me to smile
Baby I've never been so down
I know you think that I'm just being mean
And you're right 'cause I'm still mad at you
So if you want back in my graces tonight
There's just one thing you gotta do
You might also likeI wanna hear you say please baby
Please baby
I'm stupid, I was wrong
And you knew it all along
So get down on your knees baby
Swallow up your pride
You know it wouldn't hurt to cry
And say please
Let me hear you say please
You must have thought I was clay in your hands
That I needed the strength of your two legs to stand
Well baby guess what, I'm standing just fine
It turns out that I've got a little steel in my spine
I wanna hear you say please baby
Please baby
I'm stupid, I was wrong
And you knew it all along
So get down on your knees baby
Swallow up your pride
You know it wouldn't hurt to cry
And say please baby
Please baby
I'm stupid, I was wrong
And you knew it all along
So get down on your knees baby
Swallow up your pride
You know it wouldn't hurt to cry
And say please
Oh baby please, please
