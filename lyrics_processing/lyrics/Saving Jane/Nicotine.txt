The way you need your nicotine
I watch you when you take a drag
Yeah, like a lover in your hands
Baby I was just a sugar buzz
A little high, but not enough
You felt me for a little while
But those highs they never last
But I don't wanna be just another bad habit to you...
When you're down to your last cigarette
And you think about what you regret
Oh, when your hands start to shake
And you're down on your knees
Do you want me, like nicotine?
Like nicotine
Am I running through your blood
Am I everything you crave?
Do you miss the way I smell
Ah, do you miss the way I taste?
Do you reach for me at night?
Do I linger on your skin?
Am I ever on your mind?
Do you wonder where I've been?

Oh, but I don't wanna be another bad habit to you
When you're down to your last cigarette
And you think about what you regret
Oh, when your hands start to shake
And you're down on your knees
Do you want me, like nicotine?
Like nicotine
Go on, go on, go on
Try to give me up
But you know you can't quit
I'm the one who burns in your mouth
You can't spit me out
You can try
But you can't forget
When you're down to your last cigarette
And you think about what you regret
Do you miss me at all?
When your hands start to shake
And you're down on your knees
When you're down to your last cigarette
And you think about what you regret
Do you miss me at all?
When your hands start to shake
And you're down on your knees
Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Like nicotine
