And I'd be lying if I said that you still looked good
Cause you don't look good
I dodged a bullet there
That could have been me on your arm right where she stood
Right where she stood
Well I don't miss you
And I don't wish you would call
And I've been happy since the day we hit the wall
Cause I don't have to wait around for you
And I don't have to change the way I am
I don't have to cry myself to sleep
And I don't have to hope you like my friends
Oh, I don't have to cover up the bruises
Cause baby you're a liar and a user
And you're still a loser
You won't believe
How much I've grown up since the days of me and you
Have you grown up too?
I used to be
Such a puppet and the strings were in your hands
Things have changed since then
You'll be glad to know I sold your ring for extra cash
And I'm glad to know some things were never meant to last
You might also likeCause I don't have to wait around for you
And I don't have to change the way I am
I don't have to cry myself to sleep
And I don't have to hope you like my friends
Oh, I don't have to cover up the bruises
Cause baby you're a liar and a user
You're such a loser
You haven't changed after all these years
And I'm glad to know that I didn't throw my life away
Couldn't be more yesterday
Cause I don't have to wait around for you
And I'm not gonna change the way I am
Well, I don't ever cry myself to sleep
Cause I never have to see your face again
No, I don't have to wait around for you
And I'm not gonna change the way I am
Well, I don't ever cry myself to sleep
Cause I never have to be with you again
But baby it was really good to see you
But you're still a loser
You're still a loser
