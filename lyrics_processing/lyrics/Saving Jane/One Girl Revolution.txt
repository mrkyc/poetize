What those platinum girls wear
Raise your hand if you're just here
To have a good time
Raise your hand if your lipstick
Doesn't make you a dumb chick
Raise your hand if the shape of your hips
Don't compare to the shape of your mind
You don't even stand a chance
I'm not takin' off my pants
I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not a barbie doll, shopping mall, silicon substitution
I thought I told ya
I'm a soldier
And I ain't leaving til' the battle's over
One girl revolution
Raise your hand if you're smart girls
More than push-ups and curls
Let 'em stare at our pictures baby
While we take over the world
Raise your hand if you're not another
Carbon copy wannabe like everybody else
Raise your big old hand if you've got somethin' more to say
You might also likeI'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not a perfect ten, paper thin, hollywood illusion
I thought I told ya
I'm a soldier
And I ain't leaving til' the party's over
One girl revolution
What are you sellin?
Our brains are rebellin'
But what are you buyin?
Don't you know that they're lyin'
What are you cryin' about
Don't you sit there and wait
While they are sellin' us out
You don't even stand a chance
I'm not takin' off my pants
I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not the girl next door anymore
Baby I'm an institution (I'm an institution)
I thought I told ya
Don't wanna know ya
Pack your bags, baby cause this part is takin over
I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm the kind of chick that leaves you cryin' for your mother
Keep on lookin' if you're lookin' for a cookie cutter
I'm here to start a revolution
