Hours fade in the days that never end
I see myself reflected in your eyes
And I hate the way I'm wearing all these lies
So I let you go and I watch you leave
And I hold my breath so you don't hear me scream
When you walk away
But the words are only in my head
It's not what I said
It's what I didn't say
Is she everything you wanted her to be
Yeah, I bet she never breaks your heart like me
So with one more night I cover up with you
And I hate myself for what I didn't do
So I let you go and I watch you leave
And I hold my breath so you don't hear me scream
When you walk away
But the words are only in my head
It's not what I said
It's what I didn't say
Should've known better
Now all I have left is a permanent stain
The only part of you I get to keep forever to prove I lived this pain
Maybe I was never as smart as I thought
Maybe we can never be as good as we want
Maybe you just didn't need me enough
Maybe we're too clever to be falling in love like this
Like this
You might also likeSecrets told in the silence of my sin
And I'm the one who loses in the end
So I let you go and I watch you leave
And I hold my breath so you don't hear me scream
When you walk away
You walk away
But the words are only in my head
It's not what I said that's keeping me away
Keeping me away
It's what I didn't say
Yeah, what I didn't say
It's not what I said that's keeping me away
It's what I didn't say
