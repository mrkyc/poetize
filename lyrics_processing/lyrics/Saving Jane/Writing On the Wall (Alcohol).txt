You what you need
And I'm sorry that I couldn't keep you
Bet you never thought that I would leave you
In the cold like this
Too broke to fix
You promised but I don't believe you anymore
Took your picture off the shelf
I don't wanna remember
I couldn't save you from yourself
I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim
You don't see the writing on the wall
I can't stand to watch you self-destruct
Threw away your magic and your luck
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol
You and me and alcohol
What happened to
The boy I knew
Every now and then you know I miss you
Every now and then you know I still wish you were
Here with me
But honestly
You'll never even know the damage that you've done
You might also likeWe couldn't reach the other side
But at least I know I tried
I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim
You don't see the writing on the wall
I can't stand to watch you self-destruct
Threw away your magic and your luck
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol
So misunderstood
Well, not everybody gets what's good
And maybe that's alright
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
And I wanted to believe that it just might
It just might
I'm giving up on the way we've always been
Don't you see the writing
Don't you see the writing on the wall
I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol
I'm giving up on the way we've always been
You don't see the writing on the wall
Alcohol
I can't stand to watch you self-destruct
Threw away your magic and your luck
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol
