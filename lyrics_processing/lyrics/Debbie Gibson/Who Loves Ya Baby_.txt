Busy life, not enough time
To look in the mirror
Life in the fast lane...
Look around and take note
Who really loves you?
Don't get caught up in the clouds
Or you'll go insane
When it seems everyone is needing something
Remember who's always been there for you
CHORUS:
Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves ya baby?
Who's always been on your side morning and night?
Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves ya baby?
Who's gonna see to it that
You're treated right?
VERSE 2:
Just a smile is alright
Don't owe me anything
Come escape with me...(laugh)
You have got the world at your feet
That's not always easy
All those people caring
Yet you're still alone
I understand what's behind the feelings
I think I know you better than anyone (anyone)

BRIDGE:
I believe in you...yes!
You believe in me too
Don't ever get swept away by something not real
'Cause the way I feel...
Oh I will always feel that way
