I've been searching
I've been thinking
I've been searching so long
What I am looking for
I've been hearing love will hit you
But everybody's wrong
Cause I just happen to notice
That certain look in your eye
CHORUS:
I'm reading between the lines
I didn't need no neon signs
To notice baby
I never before had you on my mind
But now I really do
VERSE 2:
Nothing major ever happened
But it's the greatest feeling I've ever had
Strong emotions all have left me
Just a tenderness inside my heart
Just happened to notice a knowing smile
CHORUS

Just happened, I noticed
That certain look in your eyes
I'm reading between the lines
I didn't need no neon signs
To notice baby
I never before had you on my mind
I'm reading between the lines
I didn't need, didn't need no neon
To notice baby
I never before, never before
I knew it, I knew it
BRIDGE:
Started dreamin about you baby
Now I know just what I'm feeling
Can it be you are my baby?
Never gonna let you go
Oh it took so long to feel it
(So very long to feel it)
But it was worth the waiting baby
Never gonna-never gonna let you go
(Read between, read between the lines)
Didn't need no neon signs
Oh it took so long to feel it
(So very long to feel it)
But it was worth the waiting baby
(Read between, read between the lines)
Didn't need, didn't need, didn't need no neon
(notice baby)
(Read between, read between the lines)
I didn't need no neon signs
I knew it, I knew it
(Read between, read between the lines)
Between the lines
(Read between, read between the lines)
