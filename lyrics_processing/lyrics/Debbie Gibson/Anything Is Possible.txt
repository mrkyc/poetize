Thought I couldn't slow him down
Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league
Wouldn't give me time of day
Thought he was like all the rest
Love her
Leave her
No remorse
But I guess that I misjudged
And this thing just ran its course
He taught me

Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it

Break it down now
No matter what it is
It's possible
Say, anything is possible

Much to my surprise
I felt a warm, not cold vibe
When he looked in my eyes
(Oh yeah, it's possible)
His bad boy front
Not charm
Was his disguise
Oh, whoa whoa
(Let me tell you)
He read so much into me
Listened so attentively
He liked me
I rest my case
Wasn't just a pretty face

If you set your mind
You can do anything you want
Not every guy is a bad guy
Don't stereotype
'Cause this guy
He proved me wrong
(Anything is possible)
He taught me

Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
If you put your mind
You know you can do anything
Anything
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
Anything is possible
