My ears are gonna fade away
Without a word from you
My lips are gonna fade away
Without kissin' you
'Cause I'm missin' you
Can't you see I feel helpless?
So alone here
Out of touch with all I love
So helpless
So helpless in love
VERSE 2:
Forever is so long to wait
Well it seems like forever
It was so much more than fate
That brought us together
Together
Don't ya know I
Keep counting
The days 'til
I can see you again
So helpless
I'm missin' the love of my life
And my best friend

Oh, I can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I feel
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
VERSE 3:
I know that it's so hard to hear
The voice of reason
It's like goin' from summer to winter
Unwanted change of season
It's not pleasin' me baby
I can't see clearly
Even though the
Sun's been lifted from my eyes
So clearly
'til the day we said goodbye
CHORUS
Can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
BRIDGE:
I used to wonder if you felt the same
I know you do and now it's a different game
When someone you love's been taken away
Even though it's not for long
It seems like forever and a day
Can't you see I feel helpless?
So alone here
Out of touch with all I love
So helpless
So helpless in love
CHORUS
Can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
Can't count the stars in the sky
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
