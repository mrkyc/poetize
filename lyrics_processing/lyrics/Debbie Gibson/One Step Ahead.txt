Watch it
Watch it
Watch it!
Go!
Always gotta be one step ahead
You know where you're lying
When you make your own bed
You'll never end up in the red
So watch your step
One step ahead
Energy up!
Bring the energy up!
On the double

Stepping on toes is a common routine
Sneaking up from behind
You won't get anywhere
Dancing out of time
If you're living up to expectations
You may as well be dead
Gotta go for it
Gotta go for it
Always gotta be one step ahead
So

Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
Don't depend on lady luck
Can't walk
You just run instead
If you want to be one step ahead

Look over your shoulder
And predict what's to come
You're not feeling life
If you're simply numb
So don't be dumb
Grab the brass ring
You really can't depend on anything
Gotta make it happen all by yourself
Why rely on anyone else?
So


This dream is holding me tight
Keeping me up all night
Oh
It's not out of reach
Just out of sight
Do you think I'll get it?
Think I may
Say I might
Oh
This dream is holding me tight
Keeping me tossing and turning
It's not out of reach
Just out of sight
Do you think I'll get it?
With the way I'm burning
I just might!
It's time to rap
Huh!
Always gotta be one step ahead
You know where you're lying
When you make your own bed
You'll never end up in the red
So watch it!
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
(You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it)
Are you listening?
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
(You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
Don't depend on lady luck
Can't walk
Gonna run instead
If you want to be one step ahead
(I know you do, huh)
(Don't calm down, bring the energy up)
You gotta be one step ahead
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you
(Don't calm down, bring the energy up)
Don't
No
Why rely on lady luck?
Don't calm down
