I wanted to write the most beautiful love song
Because we have the most beautiful love
But words never came harder
It's not as blatant as days has gone by
It's hard to be as unique as you
But since it's for you I'll try
We're you feeling what I was feeling?
We're you dizzy when you let go?
Does it seem like sometimes when you're alone
I'm the only thing you really know?
CHORUS:
'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...
VERSE 2:
You touch something inside of me
That's been only touched in dreams
I never felt my happiness in heartache
Go to so many extremes
We didn't say what we're supposed to say
We just were ourselves
It turned out this way
Didn't know your impact
It just crept up and swept me away

'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...
No words can get me when they come from you
You finish everything
You follow through
It's not just a matter of consistency
Everything you do is new to me...
BRIDGE:
Everytime you talk about it baby
I think words
Do we really belong
In the same place, at the same time
Wasn't sure about faith but you changed my mind...
CHORUS:
'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...
No words can get me when they come from you
You finish everything
You follow through
It's not just a matter of consistency
