Everyone'll try to tell you no
If you've got a dream inside
You're the only one who can know
Don't let nobody own ya
Just say "One day I'll show ya"
Revenge'll sure feel nice
If inside you've paid the price -
CHORUS:
You know it and you've gotta stand your ground
You've earned it - no one can cut you down
They'll try to get what they can
When you're strong, everyone's your friend
Guard the jewel you've found
You've gotta stand your ground
Come on everybody clap your hands
Doesn't it feel good to take a stand?
Music is my only release
Gotta fight for peace
Fight for the beat
Whether you want for yourself or for others
Stand up for your sisters and brothers
Just do what you wanna do
No one can say what's right for you - Oooo!

RAP:
You know you feel helpless on your own
Swallow your pride - don't you go it alone
Don't you run away from what is right
Stand your ground - stay there and fight
The only police are in your mind
You gotta work - now work now double time
'Cause runnin' only lets 'em get the best of you
So stand your ground
Do watcha gotta do.....
Yo, Ira!
(You know it) You've gotta stand your ground
(you've gotta stand your ground)
(You've earned it)
No one can cut you down, down, down, down
They'll try to get what they can
When you're strong, everyone's your friend
Guard the jewel you've found
You've gotta (you know it) stand (stand)
You've gotta stand your ground
You've gotta stand (stand, stand) yeah!
Stand your ground
They'll try, they'll try, they'll try
Guard the jewel you've found
Listen up, listen up (listen up)
