Last night
I was driving in my car
And our song, it came on
I held tight
Like the memories were the wheel
I'd forgotten how to feel
But you took me

Boy, you took me right back, baby
We were young and little crazy right here
Then something started to crack
In my pretty little veneer

And the body remembers
What the heart tries to forget
So young I hadn't met me yet
But I feel you now
The body remembers
That sexy summer love
Close my eyes and you're above me now
And we are wishing on the stars that the night wouldn't end
And the whole world is ours, you are my best friend
And the body remembers
Yeah, the body remembers

I tried to
Tried to leave you far behind
I tried to hit rewind
I even cried too a time or two
'Cause you were it
But, how was I to know until it hit me?

Now you're so very fly guy
Ruinin' it for the next guy
Should he come along
But you'll always be my guy
Deep in my heart, deep in every song

Yeah, the body remembers
What the heart tries to forget
So young I hadn't met me yet
But, I feel you now
The body remembers
That sexy summer love
Close my eyes and you're above me now
And we are wishing on the stars that the night wouldn't end
And the whole world is ours, you are my best friend
And the body remembers
Yeah, the body remembers
Yeah, the body remembers
Yeah, the body remembers
Ooh
I remember, I remember, yes, I do
Ooh
You remember what is true
Wishin' on the stars
The whole world is ours
You were my best friend

And the body remembers (And the heart never forgets)
Yeah, the body remembers
It remembers, oh
The body remembers
That sexy summer love (Yeah, I feel you, I feel you)
We are wishin' on the stars
And the whole world is ours
Yeah, the body remembers
I cannot forget
The body remembers (Yeah, the body remembers)

Last night
I was driving in my car
And our song, it came on
And I held tight
Like the memories were the wheel
I'd forgotten how to feel
