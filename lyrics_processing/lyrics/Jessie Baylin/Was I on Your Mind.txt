Did it hit you like it should?
Was I on your mind?
Was I on your mind?
Were the lights in your eyes?
Did reflections leave you blind?
Was I on your mind?
Was I on your mind?
Ooh, did you think it was free?
Ooh, did you just wanna see?
Well, I don't want to be right
I want a good lie
I want a new truth, I want your fight
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Give me what I need
Just take my heart
Break my love and before you start
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Did you have to burn it down?
Did our ashes make a sound?
Was I on your mind?
Was I on your mind?

To have something to survive
Was I on your mind?
Was I on your mind?
Oh, did you think it was free?
Oh, did you just wanna see?
Well, I don't want to be right
I want a good lie
I want a new truth, I want your fight
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Give me what I need
Just take my heart
Break my love and before you start
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Now every breath feels
Like a new charade
I'm as lost as you
Just stumbling through our sad parade
And I don't want to be right
I want a good lie
I want a new truth, I want your fight
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Give me what I need
Just take my heart
Break my love and before you start
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong instead
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm wrong
Did it feel any good?
Did it hit you like it should?
Was I on your mind?
