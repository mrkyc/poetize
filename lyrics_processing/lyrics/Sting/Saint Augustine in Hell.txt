If somebody up there likes me
If somebody up there cares
Deliver me from evil
Save me from these wicked snares
Not into temptation
Not to cliffs to fall
On to revelation
Lessons for us all
She walks into the room
On the arm of my best friend
I knew whatever happened
Our friendship would end
A chemical reaction
Desire at first sight
Mystical attraction
Turned out all my lights

The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die

I don't know if it's pain
Or pleasure that I seek
My flesh was all too willing
My spirit guide was weak
I was deadly certain
These thoughts for me weren't kind
A switchblade in his pocket
Murder on his mind
Blessed St. Theresa
The whore of Babylon
Madonna and my mother
All rolled into one
You've got to understand me
I'm not a piece of wood
Francis of Assisi
Could never be this good

The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(The less I need the more I get)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
(Make me chaste but not just yet)
The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(It's a promise or a lie)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
(I'll repent before I die)
Relax, have a cigar, make yourself at home. Hell is full of high court
Judges, failed saints. We've got Cardinals, Archbishops, barristers
Certified accountants, music critics, they're all here. You're not alone
You're never alone, not here you're not. OK break's over


The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(The less I need the more I get)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
(Make me chaste but not just yet)
The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(It's a promise or a lie)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
