Achoo, Branca-fest

I can't see anything at all
All I see is me
That's clear enough, that's what's important
To see me
My eyes can focus, my brain is talking
It looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
It looks pretty good to me

Sometimes I speak
Tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak
And laugh all day

Hold these pages up to the light
See the jackknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep freeze (Mary)

A simple word
Are you there in the cold country?
Your eyes so full and your head so tight
Can't you hear me?
Remember our talk that day on the phone?
I said I was the door and you were the station
With shattered glass and miles between us
We still flew away in the conversation
You might also like
My cup is full
And I feel okay
The world is dull
But not today

She thinks she's a goddess
She says she'll talk to the spirits
I wonder if she can talk to herself
If she can bear to hear it

This is Eric's trip
We've all come to watch him slip
He's slipping all the way to Texas
Can you dig it?

I see with a glass eye
The pavement view
A shadow forming across fields, rushing
Through me to you
We tore down the world, we put up four walls
I breathe in the myth
I'm over the city, fucking the future
I'm high and inside your kiss
We can't see clear
But what we see is alright
We make up what we can't hear
Then we sing all night

Scattered pages and shattered lights
See the jackknife, see the dream
There's something moving over there to the right
