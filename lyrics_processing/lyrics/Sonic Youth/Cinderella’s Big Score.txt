If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis

You really fucked up this time
Your old lady's really pissed
She's not just laughing
She's polishing her fist

If you could give me anything
Would you consider a fist?
Don't give me your soul
It's caught in an abyss

Here's a pack of ciggys
Fresh from the wonder lips
A dream, a wish, a heart's desires
Cinderella is a kiss
A cold is going to take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
You can be so near
Mind your heart aside you
Really got no sense of time
Ninety-nine inside you
That I'm scared if you were crying
You might also like
If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis

A cold is going to take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
