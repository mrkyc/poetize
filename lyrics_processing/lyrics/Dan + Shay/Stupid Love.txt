You sure know how to pick 'em now, don't ya?
That job, that smile, that might kiss you goodnight
So take it easy on me now, won't ya?
You know just what gets to me every time
Sayin' I ain't gonna call, then I call
Now I'm in a car, driving too fast, goin' too far

That stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Fallin' back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

I hate the way I need ya when you're leaving
You come and go
You do just what you like, yeah
We break up just to make up
Slide your makeup off the counter
Goin' back and forth for hours
Baby, I ain't got the power to fight

That stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Fallin' back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

That stupid love, love, love
That stupid love, love, love
Fallin' back in

That stupid love (hey)
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit (thought that I kicked that habit)
You work a little midnight magic (work that midnight magic)
And there I go again
Fallin' back in (oh) that stupid love (yeah)
Pulling me in like a boomerang (oh-oh)
It's always the same damn thing (damn thing)
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Need it too much, stupid love
Lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Oh-oh, yeah
