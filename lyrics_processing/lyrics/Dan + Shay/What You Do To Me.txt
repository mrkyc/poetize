I drive away from your house, chasing butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it

I said "Girl, you're beautiful, and you already know it
But I'll say it again and a million times after that"
You laugh and you shake your head and say
"Boy, you're crazy"
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then
Porch light flipped on and I saw your dad
Lookin' through the window, hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck
Through the yard to your front door
Said "Girl, am I gonna see you again?"
You answered me back with a kiss

I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me

I picked you up for our second date
You're sure looking pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Yeah, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shaking when you put your lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right
Follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leaning in to sneak one more
Said "Baby, when can I see you again?
How 'bout every night after this?"

I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it

But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do

I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
