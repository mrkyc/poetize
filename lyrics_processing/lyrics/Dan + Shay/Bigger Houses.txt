Used to dream about buyin' that bigger house
Sittin' on top of some hill
Losin' sleep about fillin' my bank account
Wonderin' if I ever will
But the older I get, I just care less and less
'Bout keepin' up with people named Jones
If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love
It ain't ever gonna feel like home

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined-up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup
If what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

I can hear the kids makin' little footsteps
Runnin' down the hallway upstairs
I can see the dogs playin' in a backyard
Through the kitchen window right there
Maybe life's kinda more 'bout a swing on the porch
Holdin' her while the sun disappears
Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world
When my whole world is sittin' right here?
