Lately, it's been hard to breathe
Just trying to keep my head above water
Sometimes life's in the way, all work and no play
And lately, it's been hard to see the way you used to be
And I wonder, if the words I don't say can make it okay

But I've been thinking bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough
So listen

Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle that I get to call you mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately

Baby, we can stay at home or ditch the phone, don't have to go nowhere
And get lost in your eyes
Let the time fly by
Baby, it don't matter what tomorrow brings
You know I'll be right there
Today and tonight, the rest of my life

Ooh mmm

Have I told that I love you, that you're funny that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you? Mmm
