You're like a sugar-sweet kiss in the morning
Sunshine pouring right into my window
Cool drink of water in the summer
Better than the other side of the pillow
You're everything that I'm not, and then a cherry on top
Yeah, girl, I gotta see you tonight
Yeah, I'm taking you out' cause damn baby I'm proud

When a guy like me gets a girl like you
Yeah, you better know we're going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what I'm crazy about
Anywhere we go, gotta let 'em all know
And I'mma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby, I just wanna show you off

You gotta boy feeling lucky, how you love me
And you're making my heart go
Ticking like a time bomb, baby when the top drops
And I'm watching your hair blow
No, I don't wanna miss another kiss on your lips
Yeah, girl I gotta see you tonight
Pick you up about 8, counting down I can't wait
