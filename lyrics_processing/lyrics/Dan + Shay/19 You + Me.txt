It was our first week at Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It was 102, nothin' to do
Man, it was hot, so we jumped in

We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19, you and me
Mm-mm

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
You said, "Let's just stay right here"
See Dan + Shay LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like
'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then, I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19, you and me, yeah, oh
You and me

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful (Beautiful), beautiful (Yeah)

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing (Oh)
You were California beautiful (Beautiful)
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down (Of every wave crashin' down)
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
Summer of 19, you and me
Mmm
First week, Myrtle Beach
