Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night

You and me and these headlights
Engine idling in your drive
45 in a goodbye, yeah
I should probably get to goin'
Sun will rise before we know it
But while the moon is still glowing
Let me leave a little taste on your lips
A little chill runnin' under your skin
So when it's a quarter past three, you're still thinking 'bout me

Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night (yeah)

A little spray of my cologne all over your pillows
Still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like you're still in my arms

Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
Mmm, oh, wanna be, I wanna be, yeah

So when you're wide awake
And I'm the only thing on your brain
Just call and I'll be there to fall right in your sheets

Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
