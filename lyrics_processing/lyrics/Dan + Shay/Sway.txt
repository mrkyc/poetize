Ba-da-dam
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Come on outside, I got somethin' to show you
The sun is sinkin' and I'm dyin' to hold you
There's a summertime, southern breeze blowin'
In the air tonight
Turn on the stereo and leave the door open
Let's watch the moon and the fireflies glow in the sky
Forget the day and let it float away, baby
Let's lose track of time

And just sway, put your head on my shoulder
Let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little bit closer
Baby, close your eyes, why don't we just
Stay right here in the moment
I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow, yeah
When there's nothin' words can say
Let's dance the night away
And just sway, hey

We don't need a DJ or a dance floor
So leave your high heels there by the back door
'Tween you and me, we got all that we need
So let me hold you tight from left to right
