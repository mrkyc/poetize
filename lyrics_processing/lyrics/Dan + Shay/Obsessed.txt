Candles burning, ruby red
Sheets are falling off the bed
Run your fingers through my hair
I know what you're thinking, take me there
You hypnotise me with your touch
And I can never get enough of you, it's true
And anywhere you wanna go
My hand is only yours to hold, oh you know

I'm so obsessed with the way that your lips
Kiss me like crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah

Every time you walk away
I guess your perfume likes to stay
On my pillow, on my shirt
Listen baby, for what it's worth

I'm so obsessed with the way that your lips
Kiss me crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah yeah yes
