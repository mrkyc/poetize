Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love

Can't take my eyes off you
Even if I wanted to
I swear I'm staring at heaven
Holding you here tonight
Watching all the stars align
I wanna stay for forever

Yeah, the sky could be falling
The world could unravel
But you'll still be safe in my arms, oohh

Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never
My heart is yours forever
If I couldn't call you mine
Then baby you know I don't want, no one
My car, my clothes, my money
Take it all but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love

Tattoo your name on me
So I can wear it on my sleeve
Make sure that everyone knows it
'Cause baby you're the one thing that I can't live without
You kiss me and there ain't a doubt
No changing my mind, I'm in it for life

Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never
My heart is yours forever
If I couldn't call you mine
Then baby you know I don't want no one
My car, my clothes, my money
Take it all but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love, my love, my love, my love, my love

As long as stars are dancing 'round the moon
There'll never be a me without you

Ain't no way nobody gonna steal my love, my love
No way, no how, no never
My heart is yours forever
If I couldn't call you mine
Then baby you know I don't want no one
My car, my clothes, my money
Take it all but there ain't nobody gonna steal my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
Ain't nobody gonna steal my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
