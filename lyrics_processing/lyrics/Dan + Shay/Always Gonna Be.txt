Paradise is a swing on a porch
Summertime is a little too short
The best things in life are free
And they're always gonna be
Hometown is a heaven on earth
Sundays are for football and church
The world turns, but I believe
There's always gonna be

Beer drinkin' kids on a backroad
Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday
Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps comin' up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be

Girl, your eyes are my favorite blue
I double-take when I wake up with you
I'm so in love with you lovin' on me
And I'm always gonna be
Holding you close for the rest of my life
Forever and ever, baby, just like

Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps comin' up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be

Always gonna hold your hand (Your hand)
Always gonna ask you to dance
Even when we're pushin' eighty
You're still gonna drive me crazy

There's always gonna be

Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday

Baby, just like you and me
