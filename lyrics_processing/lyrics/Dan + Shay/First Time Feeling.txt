She was 18, all about me, grew up good on the
Tennessee river and her
Daddy didn't like me much
Yeah that might have been part of the rush
I was 21, just a son of a gun rolling like a stone I was born to run
But I never met a girl like that
Had me turning round coming right back
We were crazy, crazy in love like you've never know
She said baby don't you ever let me go

We were fast car, top down
George Straight singing bare feet, slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling

Wrapped up there in a blanket
Nervous kiss, hands were shaking
Yeah we knew we were getting into
There was magic underneath that moon, driving me
Crazy, more than she could ever know
And I said baby I ain't ever gonna let ya go

Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling

Oh and the leaves fell down and the seasons changed
And that pretty little thing just moved away to
Texas I guess a part of me did too
Cause I miss her like crazy
She was my baby, take me back, take me back
