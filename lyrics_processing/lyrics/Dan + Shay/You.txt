Ooh, ooh

Baby, standin' here with you
With your arms around my shoulders
We're dancin' with the moon
And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me

I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I got you

You, you, and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
You and only you

For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright

'Cause I got you
You, you, and only you
