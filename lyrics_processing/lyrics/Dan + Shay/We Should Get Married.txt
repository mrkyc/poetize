Yeah, I know that we just met
So pardon my drunk confidence
And I know you don't know me yet
But my heart skipped ten steps ahead

Yeah, you can call me crazy, but I think maybe
We should start forever right now

Oh, we should get married, take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel, hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine, longhorns on the hood
Drinkin' champagne out the sunroof, we could
Get you in a white dress, I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other weddin' cake, book a little honeymoon
Seven days in Paris, yeah, I'm talkin' Tennessee
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I've been sayin'
We should get married (Ooh)

Yeah, we should, ah yeah
Oh, baby, we should get married, uh-huh

We could stay here for one more drink
Or we could double down on some pawn shop rings
Give a heads up to your mom and dad
Or we could let 'em know when we get back
See Dan + Shay LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like
I hear them church bells ringin', the choir singin'
See you walkin' down the aisle

We should get married, take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel, hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine, longhorns on the hood
Drinkin' champagne out the sunroof, we could
Get you in a white dress, I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other weddin' cake, book a little honeymoon
Seven days in Paris, yeah, I'm talkin' Tennessee
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I've been sayin'
We should get married (Ooh)

Yeah, we should, ah yeah
We shouldn't even think about it, we should just do it
We should do it right now
Let me hear that guitar playin' for me one time
Uh-huh, that sounds good

We could take it nice and slow
Or we could book a flight, let's go
And if you want me to, I'll get down on one knee
One, two, three, four, wait
We should get married, take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel, hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine, longhorns on the hood
Drinkin' champagne out the sunroof, we could
Get you in a white dress, I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other weddin' cake, book a little honeymoon
In Paris, yeah, I'm talkin' Tennessee
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I've been sayin'
We should get married (Ooh)

Yeah, baby, we should get married
Buy a house on a hill with a view, baby, me and you, yeah (Ooh)
Yeah
