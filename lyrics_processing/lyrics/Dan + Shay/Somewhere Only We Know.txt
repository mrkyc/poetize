Hey girl whatcha think about this, got a really good idea
Four wheel drive for the gas, whatcha think about that?
Forty miles off the map, we can get there real fast
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna

Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

Hey girl whatcha think about this?
I really wanna kiss your lips
Gotta lot more room in the back, whatcha think about that?
Oh yeah let's get a little closer, lean in and I'll take over
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna

Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

Baby let it go baby, let it go
Let's park this thing 'til the morning
I think we got a really good thing going
Whatcha think about that?
You know what I think about that

Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know
Baby let it go baby, let it go
