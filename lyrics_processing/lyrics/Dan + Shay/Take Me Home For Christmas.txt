Baby, when December comes, when it's gettin' cold outside
And your bags are packed, I don't wanna say goodbye
When I see the trees light up, when they hang the mistletoe
And I'm by the fire, I don't wanna be alone

Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas, show me 'round your town?
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
All of your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas

Take me home, yeah
Take me home
Take me home

I wanna spend the night before drinkin' with your high school friends
'Round the neighborhood, we could do a little caroling
Watchin' Santa fly 'cross a Christmas moon
Don't need gifts this year if I got you

Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas, show me 'round your town?
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
All of your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas
