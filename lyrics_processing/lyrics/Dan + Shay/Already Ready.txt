Got a call from a friend
Said "you should come over
All your friends are already over"
Took you 20 minutes just to find a dress
You like the dress, you say yes
Green, red, yellow, blue
Yeah, they're all just right on you
Don't worry, you look beautiful
Hair up, hair down
Another 20 minutes to get out the house
Call a cab and we jump in it

Finally walk in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes that you like so much
Everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go

Wall to wall
Way too many people
The noise, the crowd
I don't even see 'em
Cause I'm talking to you, you're talking to me
I'm not tryin' to be antisocial
Everybody's probably wondering why we're standing in the corner all alone
Girl, you're so beautiful, yeah
You look good in the lights, but I wanna see you in the dark
Kiss your lips, it's only been a minute since

We walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
We're halfway out the door
I can't wait anymore

Yeah, I know we just walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
