Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

I've been thinkin', yeah
It's been awhile since we got outta town
So, what ya thinkin', yeah
If you're ready I could come over right now
You call the girls, I'll call the boys
We'll pack it up and drive
Anywhere you wanna go, we'll go there tonight
We can fit four in the backseat
If the cops come, we'll hide
Are you ready?
You know I'm ready, let's ride

Road trippin', summertime living
With your hands out kissing the wind
Yeah, let's roll with it, radio kicking it louder we're at it again
Stuck a little somethin' in my old backpack (and)
Break it out later if ya like that
When the sun's dippin', we'll stop to start sippin'
Ro-o-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

Hit the river, yeah
Skinny dippin', jumping off of the rocks
Out to the ocean, yeah
Put a blanket down under the Boardwalk and kick it
We'll live it up and throw it down with all of our best friends
We'll drop the top and hit a spot where summer never ends
Cause a good time and a piece of mind are just around the bend
Are you ready?
You know I'm ready...
