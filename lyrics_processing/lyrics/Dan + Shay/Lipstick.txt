Oh

Its just another Friday
Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
Its just another deep breath
Half an hour and he'll be here
Its just another friend of a friend
Oh, it ain't nothing
Its only just a drink or two
It'll be alright

She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick

Sitting at a red light
Staring at herself in the sideview mirror
He says shes beatiful (She's beautiful)
Like he knows what she wants to hear
So she plays right along as the night goes on
It'll only be a drink or two

She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick
She's putting on her lipstick

So they drink and they dance
And he talks and she laughs
For a minute ain't nothing wrong
She's putting on her lipstick
Slippin' on her black dress
Turning up the music
Saying you can do this
Yeah you can do this
Putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick

Oh
Its just another Friday
Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
