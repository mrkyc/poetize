Mm

I remember when I first met you
Sippin' coffee in a corner booth
You were twirlin' your hair
And I just had to stare for a minute or two
I was laughin' at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl in your own little world
Let me in it

You got all of my attention
And you ain't even tryin'
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinnin' in a summer rain
Dancin' when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Somethin' about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you
See Dan + Shay LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like
When you're wearin' them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealin' my heart like a gypsy (Stealin' my heart)
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby, come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinnin' in a summer rain
Dancin' when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Somethin' about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah
Nothin' like you
Shades on spinnin' in a summer rain
Dancin' when there ain't no music
Nothin' like you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you
Never seen nothin' like you
Never seen nothin' like you
Never seen nothin' like you
Never seen, never seen nothin' like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you
Never seen nothin' like you
Never seen nothin' like you
