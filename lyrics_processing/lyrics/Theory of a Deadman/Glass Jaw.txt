All a blur, I was sure this is how it ends
Hit the mat on my back, that was it for me
Stinging sweat, out of breath, begging for relief
Wish I knew you were through, I'd protect myself
But now I'm down, bleeding out, begging for the bell
You bob and weave, lie and cheat to get me in the ring
In defeat I can see clearly everything
You hit me in the glass jaw
I never saw the hit at all
You hit me in the glass jaw
Whoa, whoa
You smashed me in a million pieces
I'm broken and beaten, please just leave me alone
You smashed me in a million pieces
I know you don't mean this, please just leave me alone
I'm shattered
You'd never put me back together
I'm shattered
You'd never gonna get me back
What you did could've been the very best for me
But instead in the end it was the worst thing
You could see I was weak, yeah, I should have known
But I was wrong, you were gone, now I'm all alone

Love was not my friend
Knocked me down again
The battle's done, bell is rung, yeah, you beat me good
I could probably hug it out like a fighter should
But instead I use my head and I walk away
So in the end I can stand to fight another day
You smashed me in a million pieces
I'm broken and beaten, please just leave me alone
