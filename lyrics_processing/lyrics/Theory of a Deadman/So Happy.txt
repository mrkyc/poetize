(Needless to say) That you've got problems
(There's no fuckin' way) that I'm gonna solve them
(It's never the same) Every time you slip, then you fall down, down, down
Ever wonder what I been thinkin' about ?
I been thinkin' bout throwin' you out
I'm so happy about you (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away

I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away
Put your problems down and pick up what's left of the pain
Take a good look at yourself and see who's really to blame
