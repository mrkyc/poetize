It's never enough to say I'm sorry
It's never enough to say I care
But I'm caught between what you wanted from me
And knowing that if I give that to you, I might just disappear

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do, you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind
I know, it's like tryin' to turn around on a one-way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see, maybe we're not meant to be

It's never enough to say I love you
No, it's never enough to say I try
It's hard to believe that there's no way out for you and me
And it seems to be the story of our life

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

Oh, it's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind
I know, it's like tryin' to turn around on a one-way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see, maybe we're not meant to be

There's still time to turn this around
You and me building this up instead of tearing it down
But I keep thinking maybe it's too late

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind
I know, it's like tryin' to turn around on a one-way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I finally see, baby we're not meant to be

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
