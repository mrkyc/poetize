You lie about you, and you lie about me
You lie about your ex's and the STDs
You grew up rich in the Florida Keys
You lie about everything
You lie about a baby being on the way
You lie to yourself if you think I'll stay
It's just a big game I don't wanna play
You lie about everything
You think you'll get everything you want
But you ain't gonna get it from me

The truth is
It was all pretend
All along I've been sleeping with your best friend
The truth is
I really hate your face
You were never all that hot in the first place
Bad in bed, you suck at giving head
You've gone and got me thinking I'd be better off dead
The truth is
You're fuckin' useless

The truth is
I lied about everything

You lie to your folks, say everything's fine
What you don't know, rent's 2 months behind
Tell all your friends that we have a great time
You lie about everything
You lie when you said your tits are real
They're about as fake as the way we feel
You're so full of shit how can I deal
Cause' you lie about everything
I don't think we stand a chance
Watch the things you can't take back



You lied about you and I lied about me
Now that you know I'm finally free
One last thing I'll say that's true
I lied when I said "I'm in love with you"

The truth is
It was all pretend
All along I've been sleeping with your best friend
The truth is
I really hate your face
You were never all that hot in the first place
Your ass is fat and you ain't that smart
Everytime you talk you got me fallin' apart
The truth is
You're fuckin' useless
The truth is
I lied about everything I lied about everything
