If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I guess you're going straight to hell!

Don't wanna leave you now or never
'Cause we're perfect together
Never wanna be apart
Dared to take on the simple life
There was trouble for us when I came home early
Never would expect to see this
It's fair to say I could not believe my eyes

You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
So I made a list of how you're going to pay

I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

Now I feel better
But it's hard to forget
I never think of looking back
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
This is what you get
Karma, bitch
Now I see who you really are
'Cause happiness is the best revenge

But caught red handed with a grin on your face
Didn't think you'd be easy to replace

I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
Again and again and again and again and e-yeah....
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I know I'm going straight to hell

I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
