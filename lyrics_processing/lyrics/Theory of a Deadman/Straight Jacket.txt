I wear a 36 long, white is my color
A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good
I wear a 36 long, white is my color
A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good
Anyone can see we're a perfect match
An innocent boy and a psychopath
A week's worth of dating and you talk about moving in
(I talk about moving too fast)
My mom disapproved and my friends would say
To break the girl's heart but I'm too afraid
Her clickbait body was a tractor beam
She was a Tesla Model S with the ludicrous speed
The sex was good but we always fight
I'd try to leave your sorry ass but end up spending the night
Your sweetness, my weakness, you're mean though ingenious
Nothing can go between us (Aye, have you seen us?)

I've lost it, you're toxic, I botched this, I'm nauseous
Man, I gotta be

Out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

Free at last, I'm free at last
Something I'll never say is "I'm free at last"
She ain't around so I can vent and get it off my chest
(So here we go, three, two, one)
And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business
Guys, let me witness, you got a Honda Civic
'Cause you're backseat driving my life

I just wanna sleep my life away
I must be

Out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

I'm freaking out, I'm panic attacking
Yeah, I mentally had it, now my living room's padded
I'm a sadist, I'm addicted to this heroin
You're Tonya Harding and I'm your Nancy Kerrigan
Like Lloyd Braun, I just wanted serenity
But you had to go testing me, gave me suicide tendencies
Your little games, your little, little games
You tricked me into staying, your playing is getting lame
From touching your sweet things to tracking your calls
Go from smacking your ass to punching holes in the walls
Go from sending me fire news to eyeing up other dudes
From picking a favorite song to playlisting breaking tunes
Started so high, now I can hardly breathe
Go from weak in the knees to be too weak I can't leave
You called it, it's all my fault, this I know
Guess I'm better off dead inside than being alone
I just wanna sleep my life away
Oh!

I must be out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

Yeah, yeah, oh
I must be out of my mind
And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business
