My mind is racing with thoughts that I can't erase
Like if we've had a house to call our own
If we had a little girl would she have your nose
This voice inside won't leave me alone
Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end
Cause even though we're set and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one, one
When you come around you always ask if I'm okay
I tell you that I'm fine yeah just like a guy would say
I know you know somethings wrong
Cause you know me better than anyone
The truth is I never felt more alone
Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end
Cause even though we're set and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one, one

I just really fucking miss you and that will never change
Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end
Cause even though we're set and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one
Could've been the one, you were the one, one
