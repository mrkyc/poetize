You're the best that the world will know
No one'd ever guess how far you'd go
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
You're a star, you really are
You're the one shining bright from all the rest in the dark
A champion with nerves of stone
You trained for this since the day you were born
Full of pain, full of sweat, full of tears
But never giving up or giving into the fear
A quick breath for the ones you love
Props to the gods as they watch from above
Your enemies line up for miles
You crush them all with your hope and a smile
When you win, put your fists in the air
Your fans cheer you on while your victims stare
So go all the way
And they will scream your name
You never settle for less than gold
You're the best that the world will know
No one'd ever guess how far you'd go
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
You never quit till the finish line
You always win with your head held high
Your legend will never die
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
Ever was, ever was
Ever was, ever was
Ever was, ever was
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was

The best of the best don't need no fame
Full of love, full of heart, full of soul
Never get weary, never grow old
Now is the time when your heroes call
The faces appear on your bedroom walls
Staring back as you're in the zone
Reminding you that you're not alone
Give it up, give it up they'll say
But not today, no, not today
You never settle for less than gold
You're the best that the world will know
No one'd ever guess how far you'd go
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
You never quit till the finish line
You always win with your head held high
Your legend will never die
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
Ever was, ever was
Ever was, ever was
Ever was, ever was
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
Find your strength, feel alive
Find your power deep inside
Speak the truth, never lie
Live forever, never die
Be the greatest, the greatest of all time
You never settle for less than gold
You're the best that the world will know
No one'd ever guess how far you'd go
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
You never quit till the finish line
You always win with your head held high
Your legend will never die
You're the greatest, the greatest that ever was
Ever was, ever was
