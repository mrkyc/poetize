I guess I'm misunderstood
I guess I probably should
Try and be more friendly
And like you
I wish I wasn't so shy
I'm just the weirder type
'Cause you don't know
How life goes for me

Never thought I'd be the kind
To want you to see my other side

No, I'm not afraid to stand up and say
I'm a loner, could be cooler, but that's okay
Don't need lots of friends who think I'm funny when
The ones I have think I'm God and don't have to pretend
None of it matters anyways
I'm a loner and that's okay

What's the point of dressing nice
I don't really even have a life
So easy just to be on my own, my own
I won't bother to ask you out
'Cause you won't get what I'm all about
'Cause I'm just fine, just spend my time at home, at home

Now I'm not a waste and it's not too late
To look at yourself and just appreciate
You are who you are, we all try too hard
Let's give it up, do what we want and leave our loner cards
None of it matters anyways
We're all loners and that's okay
None of it matters anyways
