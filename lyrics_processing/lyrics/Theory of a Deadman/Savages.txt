Run run run
For your life, lock your door and stay inside
Save yourself
If you can, cause your god has a heavy hand
Red blood sky
Overhead my dark side is coming so you better play dead
Deep down
We're all enraged, don't wake the beast inside its cage

I know that you've been bad, shame on you for what you did
When will it be enough, shame on us, shame on all of us!

Apocalypse is on its way, we're all trained to be afraid
Just animals that can't be tamed, we're all just savages
Never know who you can trust, how far is hate from love
Turn on you before you turn on us, we're all just sava-savages

War war
Is what we need, steal your money and feed our greed
Fear those
With nothing to lose, 'cause when it all ends, it's me or you

Apocalypse is on its way, we're all trained to be afraid
Just animals that can't be tamed, we're all just savages

Turn on you before you turn on us, we're all just savages, we're all just sava-savages

Time after time we never learn from our mistakes, when will we realize we're all just the same?
We're all humans, fighting human nature to stay alive
We are predators teaching our children to be just like us, fear and hate like us
Will we ever realize we're just savages? God saves us all

Apocalypse is on its way, we're all trained to be afraid
Just animals that can't be tamed, we're all just savages
Never know who you can trust, how far is hate from love
Turn on you before you turn on us, we're all just savages

Apocalypse is on its way, we're all trained to be afraid
