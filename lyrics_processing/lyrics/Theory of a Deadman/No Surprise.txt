So I'll drink myself to sleep
And Sunday is when I'll wake up
Not to remember a thing
My friends all say the same thing
I don't know my new girl too well
(I know)
That all this lying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
(The way)
She talks to every guy in the bar
(I guess)
It should've raised some kind of alarm
Who'd ever think I'd go in and end up
Like all the other guys that you've gone and fucked?!
Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need
It ain't no surprise
That that bitch is leavin' me

They say I don't break up too well
(They know)
All this crying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
Well I know you want to
So go on and say it
Just go on and say it
Just go on and say it
Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need
It ain't no surprise
That that bitch is leavin' me
(Leavin' me)
Friday is when you left me
So I drank myself to sleep
And Sunday I never woke up
Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need
It ain't no surprise
That that bitch is leavin' me
