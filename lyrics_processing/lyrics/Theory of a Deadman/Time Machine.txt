They say the past is gone forever
So how come I can never get over it
The ocean steals our steps away
Our tears get lost in the rain
Just knowing that

We shone like the stars
Exploded over time
You can't pick the pieces up
That you can never find

I wish I had a time machine
It'd still be you and me
Be you and me
I'd laugh and breathe
If I had a time machine
I'd do anything
To love, just live, live long, and leave

Nothing heals me like the pain
Of knowing you could be okay without me now
If I'd go back, would you meet me there?
Do you still love me? Do you still care?
You break me down

We shone like the stars
Exploded over time
In the end the memories
Are all that's left behind

I wish I had a time machine
It'd still be you and me
Be you and me
I'd laugh and breathe
If I had a time machine
I'd do anything
To love, just live, live long, and leave

We shone like the stars
Exploded over time
We burned our broken hearts
And no matter how we try
We can't pick the pieces up
That we can never find
Life is so much better
With you and me together

I wish I had a time machine
It'd still be you and me
Be you and me
I'd laugh and breathe
If I had a time machine
I'd do anything
To love, just live, live long, and leave
Life is so much better with you and me together
But it's gone, mmm but it's gone
Life is so much better with you and me together
