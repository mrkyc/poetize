Just the two of us
We couldn't make it if we tried
Just the two of us
Our love died

Look, I don't want a war, I just want a warnin'
Next time you're gonna freak out
Turns out you're a fighter, not a lover, you're the worst
Then you say I never fuckin' listen, but I'm tired
That I make up situations, I'm a liar
Sometimes you wanna take a lighter to the curtains
Let us burn

How somebody can be so pretty
Be so ugly on the inside, yeah
How somebody can be so shitty to me

Just the two of us
We couldn't make it if we tried
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Ain't gonna make it out alive
Just the two of us
Our love died

Like the take-out on the counter, we've turned
We've bein' eaten by the flies and the worms
'Cause we're rotten to the core
And these words you're sayin', they hurt
We've snapped like the keys in the lock, stuck inside
Where our lives and our dreams go to die
Rigor-fuckin'-mortus, outta time, goodbye, you and I

Just the two of us
We couldn't make it if we tried
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Ain't gonna make it out alive
Just the two of us
Our love died

How somebody can be so pretty
Be so ugly on the inside, yeah
How somebody can be so shitty to me, you said
How somebody could act so petty
Then pretend to be a nice guy, yeah
How somebody could be so shitty to me, me, me, me
Stuck in solitary with you
Being dead so long, we're turnin' blue
And I don't know what to do 'cause we are stuck

Just the two of us
We couldn't make it if we tried
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Ain't gonna make it out alive
Just the two of us
Our love died
