Did you ever picture life like this?
No shooting star to grant your wish
Are you everything you hoped you'd be?
Or caught somewhere in between?
You dropped your nickel down a wishing well
And prayed for luck to cast its spell
To bring you closer to your dreams
That always seem just out of reach

You pray to God the moment when
You feel the current pull you in
Try to keep your head above water
Has never been harder
Even when it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water, gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this

Have you ever felt like giving in?
Tried for hours but just can't win?
Tell yourself you're not good enough?
The struggle alone is just too much
No one's there to hear you scream
You gasp for air but cannot breathe
Did you ever think you'd see the day
When you'd watch your life get washed away?

You pray to God the moment when
You feel the current pull you in
Try to keep your head above water
Has never been harder
Even when it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water, gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this

Did it ever hurt so bad?
That the thought of feeling lost would never end?
Well you will think again
Try to keep your head above water
Has never been harder
When it feels hopeless
You're gonna get through this
Head above water, gotta fight from going under
Even when it feels useless to wish
You're gonna get through this

Head above water, never been harder
Tryin' to keep your head above water has never been harder
You're gonna get through this
