You were there, now you're gone
Big mistake, how do I move on?
Love was wasted and it's tainted now
But it's still there, fading in and out
We were so much better then
Catch yourself saying, "remember way back when?"
Perfect were the days spent staying out
Heaven was ours to paint, you were so much fun

So why is the world so cold?
How did you get so cold?

Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong with my life?
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind
Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong felt so right
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind

When did it all go completely sideways?
Yeah, it's so easy in hindsight to say
But what if our past is our future's clue?
Cause I don't wanna live if I can't be with you

Why is the world so cold?
How did we get so cold?

Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong with my life?
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind
Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong felt so right
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind
Like a bridge we keep burning forever
I thought we were dying together
I must move on if I want to get better
But you know I'll still love you forever, ever, ever

Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong with my life?
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind
Say it once, say it twice
Over and over in my mind
What went wrong felt so right
It echoes, echoes
It echoes in my mind
