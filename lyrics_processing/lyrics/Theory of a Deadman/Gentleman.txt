I let the door, Hit you right in the face
And when the cheque comes I'll make you pay
Don't Have a car, Guess you're picking me up
And in the back seat we'll be falling in love
My only job is... to lie on this couch
And while you're workin' I'll be hangin' out
Now don't get mad cause you knew from the start
I was an asshole who would never go far

Cause when you're really good to girls
Give them your entire world
They end up walking away Hey, Hey
They don't want a stand up guy, rather have you cheat and lie
And do something they hate...

Girls don't want a gentleman
They say they do but in the end
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me
Girls don't want a gentleman
If you want to get to them
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me

Your parents cry when you bring me around
They raised you up just so I can take you down
There goes your life right before their eyes
I'll have you bare foot pregnant, going out of your mind

Cause when you're really good to girls
Give them your entire world
They end up walking away Hey, Hey
They don't want a stand up guy, rather have you cheat and lie
And do something they hate.....

Girls don't want a gentleman
They say they do but in the end
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me
Girls don't want a gentleman
If you want to get to them
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me

I used to be a nice guy
But that don't get you anywhere
So now I'm just a piece of shit, idiot
Who's too stupid to care
If you give a girl respect
Treat her like she's the best
You're nothing to her
She'd rather have you playing games
Piss her off and make her wait
If you want it to work...

Girls don't want a gentleman
They say they do but in the end
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me
Girls don't want a gentleman
If you want to get to them
Girls don't want a gentleman
They want a loser like me.
