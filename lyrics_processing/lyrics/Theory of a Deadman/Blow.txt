Sometimes it makes me think the world has gone officially insane
Everything's a scandal
The news too hard to handle
The world is so unbearable like wearing socks with sandals
I'm lover not a fighter respectable to women
I ain't Chris Brown I don't feel the need to hit 'em
It's sad to see a 12 year old acting like a little ho
Takin' naked pictures while she's livin' in her parents' home
Post 'em up on twitter
It'd make u reconsider
Every time you go online to find a babysitter
Sometimes it makes me wanna blow my fuckin head off
Sometimes it makes me wanna go a little mental
We celebrate the idiot
Pretend that we're so into it
Dumb down our intelligence
Just to make us relevant
Sometimes it makes me think the world has gone officially insane
The lovable NRA, they're totally to blame
The only people to actually have a "give your kid a gun" day
The governments a joke, a fuckin sinking boat
But hey, don't complain, you're the one who cast the vote
Kanye West says rock is dead, I guess he's off his meds again
He lost his mind, about the time he got with that Kardashian
What happened to De Niro
Reality stars are heroes
It's the proof that our IQs has finally dropped to zero

Sometimes it makes me think the world has gone officially insane
Think the world has gone officially insane
Think the world has gone officially insane
Stop!
And take the time to realize it's over
If you live to have some kids they'll hate u when their older
They'll dump u in a home, to die there all alone
Finally you'll rest in peace not like they'll ever know
But, don't listen to a word I say cuz it don't really mean a thing
The world is full of hypocrites and I'm the fucking king
It's not like I mean it
We're all in agreement
As soon as u hear this freaking song I'm sure you'll just delete it
Sometimes it makes me wanna blow my fuckin head off
Sometimes it makes me wanna go a little mental
We celebrate the idiot
Pretend that we're so into it
Dumb down our intelligence
Just to make us relevant
Sometimes it makes me uhuh
