Just leave it up to me to say goodbye
Because these good times will never last
Keep a hand on the wheel and a foot on the gas
We thought it would last forever

Will anything change your mind?
(She said)
A one way ticket was a pretty good sign
(And I said)
Well how can you leave it all?
(And she said)
There ain't much to leave behind
Just say goodbye
So say goodbye
Say goodbye
So say goodbye
Just say goodbye
So say goodbye
Say goodbye
Next time I'll take it slow
And as for you I'll never know
At least next time I'll try to understand
So please don't leave this up to me to say that you don't love me anyway
I'll just leave it up to you to say goodbye
'Cause these good times will never last
Keep a hand on the wheel and a foot on the gas
We thought it would last forever
In case you don't remember
