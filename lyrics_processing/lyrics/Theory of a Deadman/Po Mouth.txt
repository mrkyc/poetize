You get po mouth, when we go out
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
Your lack of funds is like the LA drought
You opened up your wallet and a moth flew out
Make excuses 'bout being in debt
You could get a job but buy clothes instead
You pick a nice place for us to dine
You order nothing but eat half of mine
You try to find a way to pay off student loans
But you hit the liquor store on the way home
Wanna burn it down, have a sick-ass time
You try your credit card and it says declined
Ain't got cash but you're trying your luck
ATM says you as broke as fuck
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
H&R Block fucked up your taxes
Dropped university, cancelled your classes
You're upset 'cause your grandma died
Supposed to leave you money but the old bag lied
Debt collector's gonna kick your ass
You bought a new car but I'm paying for gas
You wrote an IOU to your 401(k)
But, hey, broke tomorrow, rich today

You try your credit card and it says declined

ATM says you as broke as fuck
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
How come every time we want to go out

Get rich or die trying
No bitching, complaining, and whining, and crying
We all have one friend that's broke as hell
But you give him twenty bucks and you wish him well
'Cause you love him and that's what friends are for
They're really good people and they deserve more
And it's easier than saying no and starting a fight
And sound condescending, 'cause you know so much about life
And if there's one thing that my mom taught me
Is shit costs money and life ain't free
Wanna burn it down, have a sick-ass time
You try your credit card and it says declined
Ain't got cash but you're trying your luck
ATM says you as broke as fuck
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
How come every time we want to go out
You get po mouth, when we go out
(Po mouth, po mouth)
(Every time we go out, go out)
(Po mouth, po mouth)
