You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me

But, baby, I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

Hit me, my darling, tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up
Live it up, live it up

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Hurt me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why but I like it
Scary? My God, you're divine
Gimme them, gimme them dope and diamonds
