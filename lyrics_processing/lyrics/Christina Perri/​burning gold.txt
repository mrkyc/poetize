Looking for an exit in this world of fear
I can see the path that leads away
Mama never left and daddy needs me here
I wish the wind would carry a change

Looking through the window to a world of dreams
I can see my future slip away
Honey, you won't get there if you dont believe
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough, I'm standing up
I need I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go
We're starting fires we're starting fires
Until our lives are burning gold
Until our lives are burning gold

Looking for my ticket to a higher place
I can see my chance begin to fade
One step forward and two back again
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough, I'm standing up
I need, I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go
We're starting fires, we're starting fires
Until our lives are burning gold
Until our lives are burning gold

Looking back I see I had the flame in me
I'm the wind that's carrying change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go
We're starting fires, we're starting fires
Until our lives are burning gold
I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go
We're starting fires, we're starting fires
Until our lives are burning gold
