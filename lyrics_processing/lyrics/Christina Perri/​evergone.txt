Thoughts of you bring me back
To times I thought we'd always have
Who knew the world could spin so fast? I didn't
I write letters to you in my head
Things we did and things we said
Today I heard someone say your name again

In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
But no one is evergone
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
No one is evergone

I think about a better place
And learn to live with the heartache
Between the nights and days, they'll wash away
And every time I think of you
I feel you in the things I do
With every step, you're in my every breath
You might also like
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
But no one is evergone
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
No one is evergone

I don't wanna keep going on without you
Grow around the pain if I have to
So I make a space inside my heart
No one is evergone

In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
But no one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories (No one is evergone)
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
No one is evergone
Thoughts of you bring me back
To times I thought we'd always have
