Take me back to my room on Mechanicsville Road
With my drawings of flowers all over the walls
My mom downstairs pushin' all of our problems under the rug
My friends comin' 'round on a Friday night
'Cause they know I got cigarettes and homemade wine
We walk around South Street, just killin' time, fallin' in love
Now, I'm sittin' here at this party
And everyone's talkin' too loud
Nobody here even sees me
Can we go right now?

Oh, won't you take me home?
Oh, won't you take me home?

LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time
To the people I know
To the people you don't
So won't you take me home?

I wanna go back to the moment in time
With the windows down, driving I-95
Singing Counting Crows, tryin' to drown
Out the sounds of my mind
I hate everyone at this party
'Cause they're so in love with themselves
Nobody here understands me
I wish I was somewhere else
You might also like
Oh, won't you take me home?
Oh, won't you take me home?

New York's fine in the summertime
But I wanna be far from the city lights
With the people I know
And the people you don't
So won't you take me home?
Oh, won't you take me home?

I don't belong at this party
I don't belong in this town
I need to go back where we started
Can we leave right now?

Oh, won't you take me home?
Oh, won't you take me home?
Oh, won't you take me home?
(LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time)
Oh, won't you take me home?
(LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time)
