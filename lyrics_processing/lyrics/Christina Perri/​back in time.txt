If I had a time machine
That went right back to you and me
For a minute
I wouldn't get in it
Okay, maybe I would climb inside
Press some buttons and turn the dial
To that summer
Where my heart felt younger

I'm not sayin' things were better then
But I wish I could see you smile at me again

'Cause I was in love, I could not explain it
We spoke in tongues, written in our own language
I was yours and you were mine
I made you mad, you drove me crazy
So simple then, but so complicated
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time

If I had the chance again
To stop the ending when it came
I wouldn't do it
Yeah, we were done and we knew it, mm
See, I remember how it felt
All the heaven, all the hell
That we went through
It doesn't mean I was meant for you
You might also like
'Cause I was in love, I could not explain it
We spoke in tongues, written in our own language
I was yours and you were mine
I made you mad, you drove me crazy
So simple then, but so complicated
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time

And you're happy now, I've settled down
I guess life is full of things that we can live without
But that doesn't change the truth
Part of me was made by you

'Cause I was in love, I could not explain it
We spoke in tongues, written in our own language
I was yours and you were mine
I made you mad, you drove me crazy
So simple then, but so complicated
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time

If I had a time machine
That went right back to you and me
For a minute
