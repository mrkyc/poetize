With some guy I didn't know named Joe, a friend of my friend Susie's
Waitin by the window, not expectin to see
Anyone who was any interest to me
You drove up in a powder blue corvette, it was a stingray
With Tony Bennett on the stereo and a rose stickin out of the ashtray
You jacked up your shades and you smiled at me
You said "Hello" I said "Oh no, here we go again"
With lips like yours you could talk me into anything
And with arms like yours you could hold me all night long
I guess I'll dance the dance, take my chance, a leap of faith
Fly further than I've ever flown before
And even though it's frightenin, I've got a taste of lightnin
With lips like yours
So we drove into the night, three hundred and fifty horses, hot as a piston
Said you didn't know what I liked so you got sushi to go, and a bag of crispins
You said you were a black belt, had a kitten, loved your mom
Lookin for the right girl to travel the world
With lips like yours you could talk me into anything
And with arms like yours you could hold me all night long
I guess I'll dance the dance, take my chance, a leap of faith
Fly further than I've ever flown before
And even though it's frightenin, i've got a taste of lightnin
With lips like yours
You might also likeI didn't plan it but halfway through the movie
I couldn't stand it so I kissed you then you whispered to me
With lips like yours you could talk me into anything
And with arms like yours you could hold me all night long
I guess I'll dance the dance, take my chance, a leap of faith
Fly further than I've ever flown before
And even though it's frightenin, I've got a taste of lightnin
With lips like yours
Oh yeah
From lips like yours
Ooh yeah
I guess I'll dance the dance, take my chance, a leap of faith
