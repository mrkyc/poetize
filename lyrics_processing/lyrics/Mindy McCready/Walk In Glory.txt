Come on out in the sunshine, baby
Come on out and trust yourself
Come on out
Come on out in the sunshine, baby
And put your blues up on a shelf
I just wanna wrap my arms around you
But I would never hold you down
I been waitin on the day I see you kick some dust up off the ground
And you step out of the shadows, yeah
You're gonna step out of the shadows
When you step out of the shadows
You're gonna walk in glory
Come on out
Come on out of the darkness, baby
Show the beauty in your soul
Feel your heart
Feel your heart pounding, yeah
Let the rhythm and the breath of life unfold
I just wanna wrap my arms around you
But I would never hold you back
Come on, c'mon, c'mon you've got to cut yourself some slack
And you step out of the shadows
You step out of the shadows
When you step out of the shadows
You're gonna walk in glory
