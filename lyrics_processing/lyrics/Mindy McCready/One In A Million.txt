And a young girl sighs
What he won't try
Just to catch her eye
Rolls his sleeves with the cigarette pack
And revs his motor at the traffic light
Tries to act like he didn't look back
But oh his heart cries
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Only one i love
Its an age old game
Where the rules all change
And your heart might break
That's the chance you take
Just to dream when you look in those eyes
Of sweet deep kisses in moonlight
Just to feel the surrender inside
And oh your heart cries
You might also likeDont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Only one i love
No body's arms around me
Until your love found me {yeah}
And my heart stood still
And i felt that chill
The walls came down
That my heart had built
Touch my hands
You'll be watching me melt
My heartbeat setting off an avalanche
Had to know how kissing you felt
I could not miss that chance
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the
Dont you wanna be the one in a million
Dont you wanna be
Dont you wanna be
Dont you wanna be {oh yeah}
The only one i love
