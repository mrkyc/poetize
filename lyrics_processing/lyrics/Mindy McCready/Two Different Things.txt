You don't need the time to talk about it
When you hear
You're heart says that you'll be fine without it
It's hard to find the strength to fight a battle
You're not winning
From the outside we appear to be
The way we've always been
How I look and how I feel
What I'm told and what is real
That's two different things
What they ask and what I pay
What I think and what I say
That's two different things
It isn't kind, it isn't fair
I have to draw the line somewhere
And face the tears that it brings
'Cause what you've got and what I need
Is two different things
Don't you see
We've been nothing but a grand illusion
Pardon me if I show the world trace we're using
Well I'm the first to tell you now
That half the blame is mine
We could keep pretending that tomorrow will be fine

What I'm told and what is real
That's two different things
What they ask and what I pay
What I think and what I say
That's two different things
It isn't kind, it isn't fair
I have to draw the line somewhere
And face the tears that it brings
Cause what you've got and what I need
Is two different things
Everything you offer me
Should make me turn and stay
Black is white and wrong is right
And it's hard to live that way
How I look and how I feel
What I'm told and what is real
That's two different things
What they ask and what I pay
What I think and what I say
That's two different things
It isn't kind, it isn't fair
I have to draw the line somewhere
And face the tears that it brings
Cause what you've got and what I need
Is two different things
Cause what you've got and what I need
Is two different things
Oh yeah, two different things
