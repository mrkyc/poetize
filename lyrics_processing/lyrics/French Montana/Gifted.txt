All these bitches hate you
This is something I know
Because you're real enough to give it up
There ain't nothing wrong with groupie love
You're the only one I notice
It's really hard for me to focus, yeah
'Cause my body so numb
All I do is kill pain
All I do is smoke loud
Put you niggas to shame
I be rolling all day, mix it in the champagne
And these bottles all free, not a single drink paid
Because they want me, they want me in their club
But if you got the numbers, I'll be glad to show you love
'Cause, baby, I'm an XO nigga coming up
Every time they play my song, I'ma fill another cup
'Cause I'm down for whatever, I can always keep it up
All I need is some liquor just to keep a nigga up, oh yeah

I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
Said I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me, I get money, I get money, I get money, oh

Come and find me, Da Gianni's, that's from '92
Heard you spoil her ass when I bought her a number two
Dipping and you know it, I be pimpin' like I owe it
Come and find me now, I got an army with me now
Turn your brains oodles and noodles
For thinking you got a screw loose
I tighten you up, them coroners will button you up
