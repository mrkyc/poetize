I hope no one discovers you
Hope no one sees her
I hope no one falls in love with you
I've got my reasons
'Cause if they knew what I know then I know
I wouldn't stand a chance
There's no way you would go for a man like me
If you had options

Even though the world was made for you
I hope you don't get famous
'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah
Hope you don't get famous
Stay home with me
Stay home with me
I'll always love ya, I'll always
Hope you don't get
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous
Hope you don't get famous, yeah

Baby live your life, just how you are
Shining star
Hope you never get famous
Flying low with the angels
They said, "Fake it 'til you make it"
I guess you fake when you make it
I told you, "Stick to the basics"
Built an empire started from the basement
If you tryna fix a glass that's broken
You know it might cut ya hand
Never want to see you with another man
Truth might eat you if you're mumbling
When it get too cold for a blanket
Need you hugging me
Because nobody gonna love you like I do
