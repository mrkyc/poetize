Crawl through the darkness, fear all that don't, fate is a gift

Can you see the eyes and the daggers that follow?
Anything and everything that stand in the way
Wait, please wait, to the boy who hears the father
Reaching for his hand as his heart starts to sway
Reaching for his hand as his heart starts to sway

Truth by truth you'll break men in town
What makes a man drink and another man cry
If not a gift no change to make way
Through these fine hours of a our lonely lives
Through these fine hours of a our lonely lives
