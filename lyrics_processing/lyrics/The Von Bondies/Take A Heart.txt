"Have you ever been in love?
I'm speakin of true love, the only love
I've been in love, I've broken hearts in my day
Lord you know my hearts been broken too
You know who you are
You know who you are
Everyone has rhythm
Everyone has a beat
Short, tall, black or white, we can all keep a beat
If you have a heart, then you know you have a beat
Sweet lord, you gave us that heart"
Sweet lord, you gave us that heart"

Cause we're doin something we love
Everyday, everynight"
