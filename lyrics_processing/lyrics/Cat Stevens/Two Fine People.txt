How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down?
If I led you around, I'm sorry but I never meant to worry you know
Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
If I ever had, do believe your tears  won't come back again
I love you, though the stars may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you till my body changes into an old man
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain
La la la la la la
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead
Anything that Heaven can give you, I can give you instead
La la la la la la
How could I lie to you baby? I'll never lead you around
I'll take care of everything you need, darling every little need will be found
I love you though the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain
You might also likeNow that you've shown your heart
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold
And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love
Flying on the power of love
I love you, though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you, till the very same come back to the land
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain
Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other
Two fine people should love each other
