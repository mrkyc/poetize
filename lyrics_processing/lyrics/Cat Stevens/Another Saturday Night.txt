Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I got in town a month ago
I've seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I can get em, but as yet I haven't met 'em
Thats how I'm in the state I'm in

Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way, mhm

Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Ooh Lord, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

Oh no, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Ah, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Ooh, I'm in an awful way (He's in an awful way)
I'm in an awful, ooh, I'm in an awful way
