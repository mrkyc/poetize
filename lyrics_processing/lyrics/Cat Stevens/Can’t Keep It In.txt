Oh, I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out
I've gotta show the world, world's gotta see
See all the love, love that's in me

I said, why walk alone?
Why worry when it's warm over here?
You've got so much to say, say what you mean
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything

Oh why, why must you waste your life away?
You've got to live for today, then let it go, oh
Lover, I want to spend this time with you
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know, oh oh

And I can't keep it in
I can't hide it and I can't lock it away
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love, oh

Oh, I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out, oh
I've gotta show the world, world's gotta know
Know of the love, love that lies low
You might also like
So why can't you say?
If you know, then why can't you say?
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light
Light has to shine, I said shine light, shine light

Love, that's no way to live your life
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do, no
Lover, I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you, oh

And I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out
I've gotta show the world, world's gotta see
See all the love, love that's in me

I said, why walk alone?
Now why worry when it's warm over here?
You've got so much to say, say what you mean
Mean what you're thinking, think anything, why not?
