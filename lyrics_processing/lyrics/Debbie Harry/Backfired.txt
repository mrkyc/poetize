Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face
You came into my life to test me
Your diplomatic drag depressed me
The glitter in your eyes undressed me
You were polished slick. Really thick
Wasting time dropping lines like "I could get you into movies"
But we would up at HoJo's for hamburgers to go!
Backfired. Your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face
To steal my mind was your objective
The way you spoke was too aggresive
The silly jokes were not impressive
Like "a traveling salesman met...", "farmer with three daughters", yet!
All the quips were so suggestive
Then we ran down to HoJo's for hamburgers to go!
Backfired. Your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face

Give me just what I want and I'll give you a break
Well, don't slip on your lips cuz you're talking so fast
Buying for first, crying for last
Well come on my little lady, don't shoot me down
I've got strong connections all over town
Just drop to a dead stop
What?
