First I was thinking that you're OK
Then I was thinking you're far away
Thought how I might like to get to know you better
I just got to, got to get to know you much, much better

I want you (you), I want you (you)
I want you (you, don't you know that I want you?)
Hey, I want you (you), I want you (you)
I want you (you), baby, I want you (I want you)
(I want, I want)
(I want, I want, I want you)

Made up my mind and I made my plans
I'm onto you like a hardcore fan
I've got trackers and lookouts, electronic scanners
Got you on my mind and it's mind over manners

I want you (you), I want you (you)
I want you (you, don't you know that I want you?)
Baby, I want you (you), I want you (you)
I want you (you), baby, I want you (I want you)
(I want, I want)
You might also like
I've got the inside news
I've got the latest point of view
I'm looking to pursue
Any stories that I hear of you

Packing my bag and I'm playing my hand
He looks to me like the promised man
Got no time for poses, set my explosives
I'm gunning for you, I got power-packed motives

I want you (you), hey, I want you (you)
I want you (you, don't you know that I want you?)
You know I really mean it!
I want you (you), hey, I want you (you)
I want (you), baby, I want you (I want you)

I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want you
I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want you
I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want
I want you (I want)
I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want
I want (I want), I want you
