How could I fall in love at zero gravity?
From a weightless condition to a heavy circumstance
Like a voice with a vibrato, do I tremble for the chance?
And will I hurt myself? Am I like the man who fell?
And will I burn myself if I have to go through hell?
And if I did make you love me, will you make me belong?
And I'm waiting for the time, like the calm before the storm
Oh no, you're not free to fall
Free to fall
Oh no, you're not, not free to fall
Oh no, oh no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This must be someone else 'cause the part just isn't me
Can this be happening? 'Cause it sounds like lines to me
First you're sailing then you're swimming
Then you're sinking in the sea of love (sinking in the sea of love)
Still you sparkle and you sizzle 'cause a live wire always does
Oh no, you're not free to fall
Free to fall
Oh no, you're not, not free to fall
Oh no, oh no
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can see my liquid love light fading, fading, draining
It's raining, raining
And if I did make you love me, what did I do wrong? (what did I do wrong?)
And I'm waiting (waiting), waiting (waiting)
Like the calm before the storm
Oh no, you're not free to fall
Free to fall
Oh no, you're not, not free to fall
Oh no, oh no, oh
(You're not free to fall, you're not free to fall)
(You're not free to fall, you're not free to fall)
