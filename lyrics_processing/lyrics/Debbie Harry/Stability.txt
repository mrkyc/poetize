I wake up with the thought of you penetrating my head
Instead, I wanna fill my bed with thoughts of us joined at the heart like we were at the start
You left me talking to myself, underneath the weather
No good-bye kiss or long love letter
Don't orchestrate my life, just be-bop
Must I take pills for stability?
With you I can hardly speak
Must I confess to the stress that I feel?
(yes, you must.)
You take me right to the edge
You take me right to the edge
I need some more of your time
I'm not trying to be funny!
If you think I'm a joke you got another thing coming
When your orders came by phone today... I'm not alone
I heard you, but what did you say?
So now you're talking to yourself
Do ya like it?
Well, do you like it any better?
Don't orchestrate my life, just be-bop
If you are so sophisticated, why am I still denigrated when I should be venerated?
I'm sick and tired of repudiation where upon your orchestration leads to endless complication and causes me great consternation
Cha cha cha!
You love to dance, but you maintain you're not romantic
Bla bla bla!
You love to talk, but I'm still out here stranded
La la la!
You love to sing, but don't you know a different key?
Ha ha ha!
If I'm your last laugh, are you sure the joke's on me?
You don't have to "hubby love" me
Don't try to chubby shove me
You don't have to tell me I'm your ultimate honey
Medicinal value, na na natural cure, don't analyze the 98% pure
Value for value with no medicinal taste
He should had a license for that thing below his waist
Don't ya know the leash laws?
Sittin' on a seesaw, hanging out with bull dogs and assorted pit frogs
Put him down if ya don't know where he's been
Pick him up if he's looking too thin
Don't inhale or derail or curtail
My train of thoughts overwrought, can't be bought
You got me talkin' to myself, sweating in my sweater, underneath the weather
No good-bye kiss or long love letter
