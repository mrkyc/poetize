In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around
Another night comes and goes
So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go
Somewhere more home than a house
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over
Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn t-shirt made it all danger again
I don't like flashbacks in movies
I like the story to proceed
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead
So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all
I don't want it different
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen
You think how much fun a line-up would mean
And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind
That one special face takes over your mind
That end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run
You might also likeI knew it then
It won't be back again
We stood in the cold night, though we should be warm, in the back of the lot with me in your arms
The sun was falling
The grey rain was pouring
The cars were all dirty and slow
We both had our kiss and, out of the depths and darkness, with my eyes closed I still see you fine
Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true
There was no limit to what we could do
The end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run
I knew it then
He won't be back again
Once that tape starts playing it's too hard to make it rewind
With my eyes closed I still see you fine
That was the season we make our dreams come true
There was no limit to what we could do
The end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run
I knew it then
