In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love, in love even when we're apart

I wondered the difference of how it could last
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass
No wonder, it's no wonder why I'm

In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love, in love with the form of the art (yeah, yeah, yeah)

We love through the fighting of everyday life
Of glass that gets broken and cuts like a knife
I wonder and I wonder why I'm

In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love then on with the delicate march (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire

Ablaze with reflection, our hot house is set
Blazing with a flaming with a fire
It's so passionately racing with a chaser
It's so hard to keep my wits about me

Heart of fire, house of fire

Heart of fire, house of fire
Heart of fire, house of fire
