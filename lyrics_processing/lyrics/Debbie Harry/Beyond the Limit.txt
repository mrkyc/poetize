It's not the way that I want
It's just the way it is
Beyond the limit, beyond the limit
It's not the way that I want
It's just the way it is
Beyond the limit, beyond the limit

The landlord says he's gonna renovate the walls
"Be prepared for a little noise," but then the ceiling falls
So you try to sleep with the pillow on your head
Toss, turn, start to burn, top floor lands in bed

It's not the way that I want
That's the way it is
Beyond the limit (beyond the limit)
Beyond the limit (beyond the limit)
It's not the way that I want
It's just the way it is, huh
Beyond the limit (beyond the limit)
Beyond the limit (beyond the limit)

You watch TV, but there's nothing on the screen
Spotlight on the visual, nothing on the beam
Call the handyman to come fix your machine
He tells you, "Now, your kitchen works"
"But all your toast is green!"
