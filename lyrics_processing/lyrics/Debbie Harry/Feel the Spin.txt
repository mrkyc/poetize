Uno, dos
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

Hey, now honey, I'm about to begin
Hear the intention near me again
Been too impatient and I'm ready to spill
So tired of waiting for my turn to thrill

Trying to fly, trying to get a break
A space to move and the movement to make
Triangle toes, two loves continue
Why in the world? I'm a circular girl

Ooh baby, I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me 'round and 'round
Making my madness drown

Hey, now honey
My rotation's set into a driving dimension, do it again
Hey, I'm standing on top of the world
Grinning and spinning, free as a bird
You might also like
I'm dizzy from pressure, I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula
It's off with me, oh, I'm a circular girl

Ooh baby, I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me 'round and 'round
Making my madness drown
Ooh, I feel the spin
Taking me 'round and 'round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh, I feel the spin
Doggin' me around
Driving me out of town

I'm dizzy from pressure, I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula
It's off with me, oh, I'm a circular girl
Ooh baby, I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me around
Making my madness drown
Ooh, I feel the spin
Taking me 'round and 'round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh baby, I feel the spin
Doggin' me around
Driving me out of town

Ooh baby, I feel it
Baby, I feel it
Feel the spin, feel the spin, feel the spin
I feel the spin turning me around
Feel the spin, feel the spin, ooh
Oh baby, I feel it
Oh, feel the spin
