You rage and roar, you pace the floor and soon enough you're gonna have your day
Get your way
Got no time for temperament
Bad attitude won't make a dent
Don't cry baby, don't cry at all
Got no need to take the fall
Don't go on strike. you know what I like. you know how to love me, daddy - loose but tight
Your mood is down, I'm losing ground and soon enough you're gonna have your day
Get your way
There's no need to stay at home alone
No need for slamming the phone
Got no need to kick the cat or get too high
No need for that
The silences when you don't speak - much worse than when you scolding me
The silences when you won't speak - it's not the silence that's golden to me
Look out!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

You know I always get my way
I'm hot!
I do succeed
Like washington at valley forge, I get just what I need
Like iron mike with a tko and jesse james with a .44, I keep on coming moving slow and put them on the floor
Get up!
Turn it up a bit
Get up!
Turn it up a bit
I'm self contained
I use my brain and I keep the people entertained
It's a long way up with no elevator, but I'm gonna get there sooner or later 'cause the last thing that I'm gonna do is not do what I wanted to
Get up!
Turn it up a bit
Get up!
Turn it up a bit
Like frankenstein and danger mouse I'm gonna make some noise and rock the house!
