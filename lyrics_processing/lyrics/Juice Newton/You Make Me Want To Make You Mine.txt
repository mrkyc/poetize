You make real good love, good, good love

Never being without you, way too much
My heart just can't wait, I can't think straight
I want to be with you all the time

You've got that something
You've got me coming back for more, that's for sure
You've got me under a spell
Wondering if you're gonna tell me, say, hey baby, I'm yours
My heart just cannot wait, I can't think straight
Just wanna be with you all the time
You make me want you

(You make me want to make you mine
You make me want to make you mine, mine, mine)
