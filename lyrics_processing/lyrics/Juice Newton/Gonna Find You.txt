Sometimes dreams really can come true
Well, you've closed the door
'Cause your heart's been broken
But I got the key
That could swing it wide open
Sitting all alone
In a stone cold house
There ain't no way you could keep love out
You can turn off the lights
You can lock all the windows
You can pretend you're not at home
And turn off the phone
So there's no way to get through
Turn the radio down, down, down
You can even leave town
But it really doesn't matter what you do
'Cause my love's gonna find you
You were sneaking around like a fugitive
It ain't no big secret
I know where you live
Baby, this ain't no James Dean movie
When the lights go on
You're gonna give your heart to me
You might also likeDon't try to say
You don't need no one
Love's the only thing that you can't outrun
You can turn off the lights
You can lock all the windows
You can pretend you're not at home
And turn off the phone
So there's no way to get through
Turn the radio down, down, down
You can even leave town
But it really doesn't matter what you do
'Cause my love's gonna find you
Sitting all alone
In a stone cold house
There ain't no way you can keep love out
You can turn off the lights
You can lock all the windows
You can pretend you're not at home
And turn off the phone
So there's no way to get through
Turn the radio down, down, down
You can even leave town
But it really doesn't matter what you do
'Cause my love's gonna find you
(Gonna find you)

Gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
(Gonna find you)
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
(Gonna find you)
