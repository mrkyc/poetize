Oh, my, oh, my, what a vision
John told of shining streets of gold
Where all God's saints shall forever stroll
I've wondered time and again
How could it have been
To gaze upon that heavenly throne
But I'll wonder no more
When I step on that shore
To walk upon the golden ground
That John saw
John saw a land (I know I'll share)
He saw a river (flowing there)
John, tell me more (John, tell me more)
John, tell it all
John saw a throne (So bright and fair)
He saw the gates (with beauty rare)
Someday, I want to walk the golden ground
That John saw
John saw jasper walls
Oh, my, oh, my, what a vision
John told of shining streets of gold
Where all God's saints shall forever stroll
I've wondered time and again
How could it have been
To gaze upon that heavenly throne
But I'll wonder no more
When I step on that shore
To walk upon the golden ground
That John saw

I'll brush your tears (all tears away)
John, tell me more (John, tell me more)
John, tell it all
He said no death (Shall enter there)
No grief or pain (for us to bear)
Oh, how I long to walk the golden ground
That John saw
Just in the midst (of paradise)
John saw a tree (a tree of life)
John, tell me more (John, tell me more)
John, tell it all
The sun and moon (no longer shine)
The Lamb of God (shall give the light)
Forever shining on the golden ground
That John saw
John saw jasper walls
Oh, my, oh, my, what a vision
John told of shining streets of gold
Where all God's saints shall forever stroll
I've wondered time and again
How could it have been
To gaze upon that heavenly throne
But I'll wonder no more
When I step on that shore
To walk upon the golden ground
That John saw
John saw, John saw, John saw
Where all God's saints shall forever stroll
I've wondered time and again
How could it have been
To gaze upon that heavenly throne
But I'll wonder no more
When I step on that shore
To walk upon the golden ground
