To enter Heaven's gate
You must be born again
Oh, friend, why do you wait
If you get down on your knees
And seek Him for His love
He will guide you safely
To that land above
Oh, you must be born again, my dear brother
(Ooh, my dear brother)
Oh, you must be born again to reach that goal
(Ooh, to reach the goal)
If you look to God above and heed the warning
(Ooh, heed the warning)
He will keep you free from sin and save your soul
We read about His coming
About the saving power
And no one knows the time
And no one knows the hour
He will come like a thief
In the middle of the night
To gather all His children
So get your business right
