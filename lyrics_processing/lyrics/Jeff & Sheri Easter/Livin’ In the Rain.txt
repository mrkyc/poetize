I've been livin' in the rain
Soaking up the blessing of the Good Lord
I've been livin' in the rain
I don't need to find a shelter
Don't want the weather to change
'Cause all my days are better now
Since I've been livin' in the rain
I wandered in the desert for many years
My soul was running dry
The sky grew heavy with a cloud of grace
It came pouring like a river of life
I've been livin' in the rain, child
I've been livin' in the rain
Soaking up the blessing of the Good Lord
I've been livin' in the rain
I don't need to find a shelter
Don't want the weather to change
'Cause all my days are better now
Since I've been livin' in the rain
The rains been falling since He saved my soul
The floodgates are open wide
All of my sins are washed away
They've been rollin' with the risin' tide

There ain't nothing to worry about
I'm gonna jump right in, get my bare feet wet
