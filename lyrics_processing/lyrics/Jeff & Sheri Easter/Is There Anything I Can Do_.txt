And I was too weak to fight
I felt like I had been beat
Within an inch of my life
I was needing some help
I didn't know what to do
Then you walked in the room
Slammin' out of the blue
And you gave me that smile
In that old soothing way
And I remember so plainly
What you had to say
Can I toss you a line
Can I shoulder your load
Can I walk a little ways
With you down this road
Can I listen awhile
Can I give you a ride
Can I laugh when you laugh
Can I cry when you cry
Can I keep you awake
Can I sit while you sleep
Can I pull you along
When the water gets deep
Let me know how I can help
To get you through
I'm here
Is there anything I can do

Coming through my front door
'Cause nobody ever asked me
Those things before
I saw God in your hands
I saw God in your eyes
And your "here I am" smile
Made me realize
I can help you too
Like you helped me that day
So if you're ever in need
You're gonna hear me say
Can I toss you a line
Can I shoulder your load
Can I walk a little ways
With you down this road
Can I listen awhile
Can I give you a ride
Can I laugh when you laugh
Can I cry when you cry
Can I keep you awake
Can I sit while you sleep
Can I pull you along
When the water gets deep
Let me know how I can help
To get you through
I'm here
Is there anything I can do
Can I toss you a line
Can I shoulder your load
Can I walk a little ways
With you down this road
Can I listen awhile
Can I give you a ride
Can I laugh when you laugh
Can I cry when you cry
Can I keep you awake
Can I sit while you sleep
Can I pull you along
When the water gets deep
Let me know how I can help
To get you through
I'm here
Is there anything I can do
Said, I'm here
Is there anything I can do for you
For you, for you
