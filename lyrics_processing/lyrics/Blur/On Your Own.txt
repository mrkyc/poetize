Holy man tiptoes his way across the Ganges
The sound of magic music in his ears
Videoed by a busload of tourists
Shiny shell suits on and drinking lemonade
Now I got a funny feeling which I bought mail order
From a man in a teepee in California
Said he once was that great game show performer
Then he blew all his money away, blew it all away

So take me home, don't leave me alone
I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad
No psycho killer, hooligan guerilla
I dream to riot, oh, you should try it
I'll eat parole, get gold card soul
My joy of life is on a roll
And we'll all be the same in the end
'Cause then you're on your own
Then you're on your own

Well, we all go happy day-glow in the discos
The sound of magic music in our brains
Someone stumbles to the bathroom with the horrors
Says, "Lord, give me time, for I've jumped into space, I'm in outer space"
You might also like
So take me home, don't leave me alone
I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad
No psycho killer, hooligan guerilla
I dream to riot, oh, you should try it
I'll eat parole, get gold card soul
My joy of life is on a roll
And we'll all be the same in the end
'Cause then you're on your own

La, la, la-la la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la la-la-la
La, la, la-la la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la la-la-la
La, la-la

So take me home, don't leave me alone
I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad
No psycho killer, hooligan guerilla
I dream to riot, oh, you should try it
I'll eat parole, get gold card soul
My joy of life is on a roll
And we'll all be the same in the end
'Cause then you're on your own ('Cause you're on your own, 'cause you're on your own when the beat stops)
Then you're on your own ('Cause you're on your own, 'cause you're on your own when the beat stops)
Then you're on your own ('Cause you're on your own, 'cause you're on your own when the beat stops)
