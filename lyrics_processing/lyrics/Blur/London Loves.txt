A malady has taken him over
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor
The lights are magic and he feels lucky
And he's got money, shoots like an arrow, oh

London loves
The mystery of a speeding car
London loves
The misery of a speeding heart

It's love you like and everyone's at it
And words are cheap when the mind is elastic
He loves the violence, keeps ticking over
So sleep together before today is sold forever

London loves
The way people just fall apart
London loves
The way you just don't stand a chance
London loves
The mystery of a speeding car
You might also like
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

London loves
The mystery of a speeding car
London loves
The misery of a speeding heart
London loves
The mystery (Oh)
(Hey, hey) London loves
The way people just fall apart
London loves
The way we just don't stand a chance
London loves (How much London loves)
A speeding heart
