Bill Barrett has a simple dream
He calls it his "Plan B"
There were buildings in the sky and the air is sugar-free
And everyone is very friendly
Well, Plan B arrived on a holiday
Took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate 'til he could do neither any more
Then found love on Channel 44

La, la-la-la-la
He wants to go to magic America
La, la-la-la-la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all those magic people

Bill Barrett sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever known, they read
"Fifty-nine cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel"

La, la-la-la-la
He wants to go to magic America
La, la-la-la-la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people (Mm-mm)
With all the magic people
