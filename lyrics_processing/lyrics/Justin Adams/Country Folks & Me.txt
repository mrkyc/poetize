We don't need no man's religion (Religion)
'Cause we've already been set free (Yeah, set-set free)
And if you wanted war now you got one (Got one)
With the hard workin', God fearin'
Sweat drippin', hard headed country folks like me
(Church, Church, Church)

Tats cover my young skin
Guns full in my bedroom
Ammunition like the armory
'Cause they say that a war might be comin' soon
I shit talk 'cause I speak for most
Let 'em think that I won't come back it up
Bulletproof windows on the Z-71
Back seat lookin' like Cabela's son
I am the All-American
And I speak for the folks who ain't heard
The underdogs, the under class
And the ones pushed down deep in the dirt
Wake up every day prepared to die
Front yard watchin' my three colors fly
With a couple four wheelers and a four-wheel drive
And some money to shoot like they live to snipe
Got a chain wallet, my careers at risk
For bein' realer than you punk bitches
And I'll stand up and say what needs to be said
'Cause America was built on rage and freedom
You respect me, I respect you
Lets come together build a greater us
Black, white, or a blue suit
Don't matter we're all Team America

Sweat drippin', hard headed country folks like me

Listen up, hear me loud and clear
'Cause I'm only gonna say it one time
If I catch you on my land ithout a warrant in your hand
I'm gonna draw along bloodlines
And no I won't listen, I ain't never been known to abide
By the laws and rules of these political fools
Try to make us all live by

We don't need no man's religion (Religion)
'Cause we've already been set free (Yeah, set-set free)
And if you wanted war now you got one (Got one)
With the hard workin', God fearin'
