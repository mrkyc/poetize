We stopped and heard a sweet and sad refrain
It filled the sundown skies with a lonesome tune
It was one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We stopped and heard a sweet and sad refrain
Two wise old night owls calling "come home soon"
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard three big elk, a bugling through the trees
Two wise old night owls calling "come home soon"
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard four little dogies lowin' in the breeze
Three big elk bugling through the trees
Two wise old night owls calling "come home soon"
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard five prairie dogs a whistling at a snake
Four little dogies
Three big elk
Two wise owls
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard six beavers slapping tails upon a lake
Five prairie dogs
Four little dogies
Three big elk
Two wise owls
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard seven geese a honkin' across the sky
Six beaver slap
Five prairie dogs
Four little dogies
Three big elk
Two wise owls
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard eight mustangs whinnying, wild, and high
Seven geese
Six beaver slap
Five prairie dogs
Four little dogies
Three big elk
Two wise owls
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard nine buffalo stampede and run away
Eight mustangs
Seven geese
Six beaver slap
Five prairie dogs
Four little dogies
Three big elk
Two wise owls
And one little coyote howling at the moon
As I rode my pony across the western plain
We heard ten cowboys singing loud 'cause it's payday
Nine buffalo stampede and run away
Eight mustangs whinnying, wild, and high
Seven geese a honkin' across the sky
Six beavers slapping tails upon a lake
Five prairie dogs a whistling at a snake
Four little dogies lowin' in the breeze
Three big elk bugling through the trees
Two wise old night owls calling "come home soon"
