With a million or two
(Mike)I'd live in a penthouse
In a room, with a view
(Sulley)And if I were handsome (No way)
It could happen
Those dreams do come true
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin
(Mike)Can I tell you something?
For years I have envied (You green with it)
Your grace and your charm
Everyone loves you, you know? (Yes I know I know I know)
I must admit it
Big guy you always come through
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have you
(Both)You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothing to me, nothing to me
(Mike)Ya I wouldn't be nothin, (Aw now)
If I didn't have you to serve
I'm just a punky little eyeball
And a funky optic nerve
Hey I never told you this
Sometimes I get a little blue (Looks good on you)
But I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have you
(Sulley)Let's dance (haha)
(Mike)Look Ma! I'm dancin!
Would you let me lead?
Look at that its two big guys who're light on their feet
Don't you dare dip me don't you dare dip me don't you dare dip me
Ow I should have stretched
(Sulley)Yes I wouldn't be nothin
If I didn't have you (I know what you mean Sulley because)
I wouldn't know where to go (me too because I)
You might also likeOr know, what to do (why do you keep singin my part)
(Both)I Don't have to say it (Aw say it anyway)
Cause we both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
Youuuuu
(Mike)One more time! Big one!
(Sulley)Don't have to say it
(Mike)Where'd everybody come from?
(Sulley)Oh we both know its true
(Mike)Let's take it home big guy
(Both)I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have
You, you, you!
A-E-I-O that means you
