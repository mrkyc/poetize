Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
One blue eye and some tentacle feet
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
She looked good
(She looked good)
She looked fine
(She looked fine)
She looked good
She looked fine
I could not believe my eye
Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
Snakes on her head just as happy as could be
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
Then we stopped
(Then we stopped)
At my door
(At my door)
Then we stopped
At my door
And we kissed a little more
Woah-oh-woah I knew we were falling in love
So I told her all the things I've been dreaming of
I said "Celia, schmoopsie-poo, I'm on my bendin' knees"
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
"Celia, sweetie-pie, please marry me"
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
She said "yes"
(She said "yes")
I said "yay"
(I said "yay")
She said "yes"
I said "yay"
Then we set the wedding day
You might also likeOh-oh-oh they knew they were falling in love
So he told her all the things he'd been dreaming about
"Celia, sugar-pie,I'm on my bendin' knees"
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
"Celia, honey-baby, please marry me"
Singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
She said "yes"
(She said "yes")
I said "yay"
(I said "yay")
She said "yes"
I said "yay"
The wedding march began to play
Oh-oh-oh and it was "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
We're singing "doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
(Right down the aisle!)
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
(Just see her smile!)
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
("You may place the ring on her tentacle")
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
("I now pronounce you, 'monster and wife'")
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
("I love you so, Celia!")
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
("You make me feel like singing! Let's go!")
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
"Doo-wah diddy diddy-dum diddy-doo"
