These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing

I had a dream
I had a dream when I was only five
To work at a bar
I wanted to see over the other side
And I had a friend
Her name was Fern and she had a blue bike
So we'd ride through the streets
I would sleep over on Saturday nights
Then I went to school
My family moved to a village nearby
At thirteen years old
I started drawing black under my eyes
Cause I met a boy
First time I kissed him, well it was the last
Cause I got afraid
When everyone there started moving too fast

These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I never took in when
I was just standing there wishing
I could grow up and my life would be different
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
You might also like
I've been so caught in the motions
Forgetting right where my home is
These are the moments I'm missing

In the back of her mum's car
On the way to the old bars, yeah
Raising my anxiety
Using her sisters ID, yeah
In a skin tight short skirt
Sixteen and we danced till our feet hurt
But I had a dream, I had a goal
Got a guitar and a camera phone
Then over the time
I started racking up numbers online
At the end of July
I met somebody who changed my life
Then I was signed
And falling in love for the very first time
But that fucked me up
So then I had issues with falling in love

These are the moments I'm missing
There are the moments I never took in when
I was just standing there wishing
I could grow up and my life would be different
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
I've been so caught in the motions
Forgetting right where my home is
These are the moments I'm missing
Now these are the moments I'm missing

Born in the snow, nothing there for me
I had to let go, found the world on my own
Wandering, looking for where to call home
With a beat up guitar and a bunch of highways to endlessly roam
Never did have a car, but I got a few friends to help me along
Then I met a few girls in the City of Angels
Thought they all were the one, but they all ran away
So I've been writing these songs
All about love and about finding home
I'm alone, I don't know where to go, all I know is...

These are the moments I'm missing

Cos I've been so caught in the motions
Forgotten right where my home is
These are the moments I'm missing
Cos I've been so caught in the motions
Forgotten where my home is
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
