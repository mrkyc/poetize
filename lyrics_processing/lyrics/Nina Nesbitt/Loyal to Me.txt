All of us girls, we're in and out of love
We're vulnerable, but we'll tell you that we're tough
Some of these guys never think that they'll get caught
Think that we're blind, but they're forgetting that we talk
(Sing it with me)

If he never calls when he says he will
If he always tells you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby, then you know he was never real
If he never wants you to meet his friends
If he ain't tagging you on the 'Gram
Take your heart and turn around while you still can

And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
"I got somewhere else to be"
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody
Yeah, if you have to question, "Is he loyal to me?"
Well then he's probably not and you should probably leave

Says he's online, but he told you he's asleep
You stay inside like he never wants you to be seen
Ain't got a job, no, says he models on the side
Swears you're the one, oh, but he's not the label type
(Sing it with me)

If he never calls when he says he will
If he always tells you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby, then you know he was never real
Hope you never let those pictures send
He'll only go show them to his friends
Take your heart and turn around while you still can

And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
"I got somewhere else to be"
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody
Yeah, if you have to question, "Is he loyal to me?"
Well then he's probably not and you should probably leave

Yeah, ha, ooh, ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh (No-oh)

They're not, they're not loyal to me (No-oh)
They're not, they're not loyal to me (No, no)
They're not, they're not loyal to me
They're not, they're not loyal (Oh no)
And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
I got somewhere else to be (No-oh)
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody
Yeah, if you have to question, "Is he loyal to me?" (Is he loyal?)
Well then he's probably not and you should probably leave
(Oh, won't you tell him?) And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
"I got somewhere else to be" (No-oh)
And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody (Nobody)
Yeah, if you have to question, "Is he loyal to me?"
Well then he's probably not and you should probably leave
(Oh, won't you leave him now?)
Yeah, if you have to question, "Is he loyal to me?" (Is he loyal?)
