You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they'd come crashing down, no

No you don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
You tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
Bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (hey, hey)
You might also like
You know they say some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have thought it

No you don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why'd you leave me all alone?
You tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
Bridges are burned
And now it's your turn, your turn to cry
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (ooh)
Oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (ooh)
Oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving

No you don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
