Either I'm too thin
I got a breakout on my skin
It makes me break down, lose my shit
I see myself, I wanna quit
Either I'm a slut
I got with way too many men
If I'm not sleeping with the guy I'm hanging with
I must be a virgin

Everybody asks me when I'll settle down and marry
Get a house out in the country
Have a baby, well, I'm sorry
I'm just tryna make it through the bullshit flying at me
Turn it into something catchy
And then make it into money

Cannot talk, but I'm trying (Mmh)
Kinda done with the fighting
I got the heart of a lion (Yeah)
And pressure makes diamonds
I know the things that I'm wantin'
So I'ma work till the morning
I got the heart of a lion (Yeah)
And pressure makes diamonds, I

Every year I'm older I just keep on getting closer
To my career being over

And I, I know I'm not a rich girl
My dad weren't famous in the 80s
Oh, but I don't let it faze me, yeah

I'll just keep on swimmin' through the patriarchal system
Kick them down with my ambition
Yeah, I do it on the daily
I'm just tryna make it through the bullshit flying at me
Turn it into something catchy
And then make it into money

Cannot talk, but I'm trying (Mmh)

I know the things that I'm wantin'
So I'ma work till the morning
I got the heart of a lion (Yeah)
And pressure makes diamonds, I
Pressure makes diamonds
