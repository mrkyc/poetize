Sitting in my bedroom tonight
Thinking of how to change your mind
Since you walked out my life again
Yeah
So I strike a pose and tilt my chin
And hold the light to suit my skin
Your favorite t-shirt on again

Counting hours, counting lies
3, 2, 1, and I smile

Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
I guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored
Now you're telling me I'm vain, vain, vain, yeah
But you don't feel my pain, pain, pain
Facing life upon the shelf, shelf, shelf
Taking pictures of myself, myself, myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself, oh oh
You might also like
I'll post it up in black and white
With a depressing quote on my life
So that you see what I'm going through
Yeah
This is desperation at it's best
A conversation to be left
But all my pride was burnt by you

Counting days, counting takes
3, 2, 1, I'm away

Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
I guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored
Now you're telling me I'm vain, vain, vain, yeah
But you don't feel my pain, pain, pain
Facing life upon the shelf, shelf, shelf
Taking pictures of myself, myself, myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself, oh oh
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
I guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored
Now you're telling me I'm vain, vain, vain, yeah
But you don't feel my pain, pain, pain
Facing life upon the shelf, shelf, shelf
Taking pictures of myself, myself, myself
