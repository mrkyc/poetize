Standing at the edge of sanity
I've been here a couple o' times
But I swore I was better, I was better
And it hurts, to keep inside
Feeling worse, 'cause I know I
Could be in control-ol, if I let them know-ow

Keep thinking that I'm finally awaken
But I'm mistaken
Now I'm sitting all alone in the basement
Hands are shaking

'Cause I hurt myself, myself again
Crying for help, for help again
Didn't feel so precious under all this pressure
I hurt myself, myself again, myself again

Myself again
Myself again
My, myself again
My my, my
Myself again
Myself again
My, myself again
My my, my
You might also like
I know I'm my own worst enemy
I've got a double-sided mind
But I swear I'll get better, I'll get better this time
I need to believe, these times don't make me weak
And I'm in control-ol, my life's beautiful-ul

My head and my heart's been aching
Feelings are fading
Now I'm sitting all alone in the basement
Hands are shaking

'Cause I hurt myself, myself again
Crying for help, for help again
Didn't feel so precious under all this pressure
I hurt myself, myself again, myself again

Myself again
My my, myself again
My, myself again
My my, my
Myself again
My my my, myself again
My, myself again
My my, my
Anything bad that's ever happened to me
Is playing so fast like a messed up movie, oh, oh
When it's like that, it's hard to see the beauty
That's when I hurt myself, myself again

'Cause I hurt myself, myself again
Crying for help, for help again
Didn't feel so precious under all this pressure (no)
I hurt myself, myself again, myself again

Myself again
Myself again
My, myself again
My
Myself again
Myself again
My, myself again
My
Myself again
My my, my
