You could turn this bar into a good time
Feel like I'm not needing anything
When you hold my body like my blood does
After I've had a couple drinks
You could turn this dive into a five-star
We can use your backseat as a bed
Racin' 'round the city like a gangster
Least until we're breaking down again

You see the best in me, ooh
And you're making me believe, oh

That I'm somebody special
That I'm somebody, yeah, I'm somebody
That I don't have to settle
Not for nobody, not for nobody
I've been losing myself, but lately
You got me thinking maybe I got potential
To be somebody, to be somebody
To be somebody special

I could just be dancing in the kitchen
Wearing your t-shirt like a dress
Treasure me like I cost a million
As you whisper under your breath
You might also like
You would do anything, ooh
Just to make me believe, me believe

That I'm somebody special
That I'm somebody, yeah, I'm somebody
That I don't have to settle
Not for nobody, not for nobody
I've been losing myself, but lately
You got me thinking maybe I got potential
To be somebody, to be somebody
To be somebody special

Somebody, somebody
To be somebody special
Somebody, somebody

I've been lonely way too long
I've been loving all the wrong kind
I've been falling in your arms
Feeling like I'm good here for life
I've been lonely way too long
I've been loving all the wrong kind
I've been falling in your arms (Yeah)
Somebody special
That I don't have to settle
I've been losing myself, but lately
You got me thinking maybe I got potential (I got potential)
To be somebody, to be somebody
To be somebody special

Somebody, somebody
To be somebody special
Somebody, somebody
To be somebody special
Somebody, somebody (I've been lonely way too long)
(I've been loving all the wrong kind)
To be somebody special
Somebody, somebody (I've been falling in your arms)
(Feeling like I'm good here for life)
