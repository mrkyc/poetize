You're far away tonight
I haven't seen you in a while
It always feels like a climb
On this never-ending hill

And I keep saying, wait, just one more day
But days slowly drift away
And I can hold on to the memories
But they won't hold me in the same way, as you

And this distance between us
Has come and cut as clean as a sharp blade
And this distance between us
Has made my heart as weak as silk that's frayed
And I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
You're the one that keeps me, keeps me, on the ground
I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
Can we turn this knife the blunt way around?

And I feel empty, my eyes are closed
It's getting dark and I'm alone
And I sleep next to the window
In case you decide to come home
You might also like
And I keep saying, wait, just one more day
But days slowly drift away
The memories I have begin to fade
Cause you're so far away

And this distance between us
Has come and cut as clean as a sharp blade
And this distance between us
Has made my heart as weak as silk that's frayed
And I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
You're the one that keeps me, keeps me, on the ground
I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
Can we turn this knife the blunt way around?

And I can only stay, one more day
It's like waiting on the rain
In a warm summer haze

And this distance between us
Has come and cut as clean as a sharp blade
And this distance between us
Has made my heart as weak as silk that's frayed
And I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
You're the one that keeps me, keeps me, on the ground
I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya now
Can we turn this knife the blunt way around?
