I haven't played a show in way too long
People keep asking me where I have gone
I started fading quick, yeah
When I should've been making it, oh
I guess that I lost my sight, I was way too young
Doubting what's in my mind, I guess I'll never learn
Still tryna figure it out, yeah
It's all that I'm thinking about, ooh

I'm gonna take it for what it's worth
Put in the hours 'til I have earned it
Show everybody what I deserve, oh (Yeah)

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire

Everyone in this game, we lie too much
Say we're doing it for the love, only for the love
But I'm not ashamed to say, yeah
That I wanna be rich someday
'Cause never had it when I was a kid
Mum and Dad working double shifts
Kinda hard on relationships, oh
You might also like
But I'm gonna show them just what they're worth
I'm gonna put in the work (Yeah)

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
And a kingdom from my bed, oh
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
And a kingdom from my bed, oh

Making the sacrifices I gotta make
Missing out on the times, wish I coulda stayed
Breaking my heart into pieces when I go away
Watching it fade
Gonna build an empire (Ooh)
Gonna build an empire, yeah (Yeah, oh)

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
And a kingdom from my bed, oh
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
