Oh, Chloe
I still remember the day that you told me
Got me thinking about the way that we are, we are, we are
Drifting apart now
Your body's bigger, lost the figure that you had
Heart is beating like a drum
Soon she's gonna be someone
And I start to shiver
Somethin' 'bout you has changed

Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Got me thinking 'bout a few things
Watching you, wanting to
Feel the things that you do
Yeah

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind
Am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
Oh, Chloe
You might also like
Wearing someone else's clothes
Tryna play the biggest shows
I worry 'bout the radios
Tryna make a house a home
We are, we are, we are, we are (We are)
Drifting apart (Oh, oh)
But I'm still here for (Oh, oh) you

Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Got me thinking 'bout a few things
Watching you, wanting to
Feel the things that you do
Yeah

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind
Am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
Oh, Chloe
Your body's bigger
Little finger like her thumb, mmm
Now your body's bigger
Soon, she's gonna be someone
Soon, she's gonna be someone

There's a heart, there's a life
There's a look in your eyes
'Cause I know that you found the answer
There's a doubt in my mind
Am I doing it right?
'Cause I don't think I found the answer
