You must be blind, you're blind, you're blind
Or maybe I'm unkind, unkind, unkind
You're the rich boy from my town, my town, my town
But that can't win me 'round, me 'round, me 'round
Oh, you and all your people

You think I like you 'cause you bought me a drink
But I'm just short of cash and able to wink

Excuse me, Mr C
Who you tryna kid?
I'll take the drink, but if you think
You're coming home with me
Who you tryna kid?
Oh, you're so vain

When you're under the lights, the lights, you're alright
But conversation's dry, you're dry, you're dry
Just trying to boast about your parents' house, in the south of France
And I'm laughing at the way you dance
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Oh, you and all your people
You might also like
I've come to the conclusion you're quite fit
But I'm under no illusion you're a dick

Excuse me, Mr C
Who you tryna kid?
I'll take the drink, but if you think
You're coming home with me
Who you tryna kid?
Oh, you're so vain, I can't believe it

I, I never meant to hurt or make you cry
Your mum's outside, she's waiting for you in her new X5
I'm sure she'll dry those eyes

Excuse me, Mr C
Who you tryna kid?
I'll take the drink, but if you think
You're coming home with me
Who you tryna kid?
Oh, you're so vain, I can't believe it
Excuse me, Mr C
Who you tryna kid?
I'll take the drink, but if you think
You're coming home with me
Who you tryna kid?
Oh, you're so vain, I can't believe it
Excuse me, Mr C (Excuse me, Mr C)
Excuse me, Mr C (One more champagne please)
Excuse me, Mr C (And a Strawberry Daiquiri)
