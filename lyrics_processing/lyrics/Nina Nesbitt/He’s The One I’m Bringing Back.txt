I hear them all say, I'm going crazy
But I don't give a fuss
'Cause he's the one I'm bringing back
All my life I've lived on the sideline
But now I've had enough
And he's the one I'm bringing back

So you can keep all your little remarks, to yourself
I know our ages may be far apart, but you can't tell
Me any reasons not to, he's got eyes I've been locked on to
Put your eyes on someone else

I hear them all say, I'm going crazy
But I don't give a fuss
'Cause he's the one I'm bringing back
All my life I've lived on the sideline
But now I've had enough
And he's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back
You might also like
Go out together on a Tuesday night, never rest
He's got a car that goes 100 miles, you've probably guessed
I crash when he holds me, forgot what you ever told me
Put your eyes on someone else

I hear them all say, I'm going crazy
But I don't give a fuss
'Cause he's the one I'm bringing back
All my life I've lived on the sideline
But now I've had enough
And he's the one I'm bringing back

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

I hear them all say, I'm going crazy
But I don't give a fuss
'Cause he's the one I'm bringing back
I hear them all say, I'm going crazy
But I don't give a fuss
'Cause he's the one I'm bringing back
All my life I've lived on the sideline
But now I've had enough
And he's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
He's the one I'm bringing back, back, back
