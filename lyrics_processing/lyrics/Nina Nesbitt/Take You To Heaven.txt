I've been flying through the clouds alone
Looking for somebody to hold
And you're here, you're here
And I keep on falling
And we're higher than the birds that fly
And we're closer than the lowest sky
'Cause you're here, you're here
And I keep on falling

For the way you feel like autumn
When you wrap your body around the
Girl in me that's sometimes haunted
But we don't let the world

I wanna take you to heaven
I gotta make sure you never think you're here alone
If you meant forever
Then look at me now
Just one place left to go
I wanna show you heaven
So take a deep breath and I'll take you all the way
If you meant forever
Then look at me now
Look at me and say
I'll take you to heaven
Look at me now
Look at me and say
You might also like
Everything that you've been wanting to say
Every part of me is for you to take
I'm here, I'm here
And I'm not going
Till you say that you're ready to go
'Cause I don't ever want to be alone
Stay near, stay near
Let's keep on going

For the way you feel like autumn
When you wrap your body around the
Girl in me that's sometimes haunted
But we don't let the world

I wanna take you to heaven
I gotta make sure you never think you're here alone
If you meant forever
Then look at me now
Just one place left to go
I wanna show you heaven
So take a deep breath and I'll take you all the way
If you meant forever
Then look at me now
Look at me and say
I'll take you to heaven
Look at me now
Look at me and say
For the way you feel like autumn
When you wrap your body around the
Girl in me that's sometimes haunted
But we don't let the world

I wanna take you to heaven
I gotta make sure you never think you're here alone
If you meant forever
Then look at me now just one place left to go
I wanna show you heaven
So take a deep breath and I'll take you all the way
Just look at me now
Look at me and say
Look at me now
Look at me and say
I'll take you to heaven
Look at me now
