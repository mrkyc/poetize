Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Ah-ah-mmm
Yeah

I've been tryin' to find the right time
To tell you everythin' on my mind
But I'm still tryin' to find the right time
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
And I know you're goin' through hard things, so
I'm givin' everything to fix things
But I'm tryna figure where to draw the line
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Sometimes you talk, got me thinkin' that you hate me
Still love you, but some days I'm kinda suffocating
I don't wanna see, I don't wanna see you down, but

How am I supposed to carry
The weight of your love
When it gets this heavy?
I should be a bird
But I don't really feel like flying
'Cause my wings are hurt
Yeah, I'm tired of trying
You might also like
I feel like I'm living for the days when
Think that I'm finally seein' changes
And there ain't nothin' more amazing
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Sometimes I wonder, are we flyin' 'round in circles?
I'm in the sky, but you're bringin' me back down low
But I don't wanna come down
I wanna lift you back up

How am I supposed to carry
The weight of your love
When it gets this heavy?
I should be a bird
But I don't really feel like flying
'Cause my wings are hurt
Yeah, I'm tired of trying

Should I stay or should I go?
How long is it gonna be this way? I just really wanna know
Am I afraid to let you know?
'Cause I don't wanna be the one that hurts you while you're hurtin' the most
How am I supposed to carry
The weight of your love
When it gets this heavy?
I should be a bird
But I don't really feel like flying, no
When I'm tired of the trying
Oh, tell me
How am I supposed to carry
The weight of your love
When it gets this heavy?
I should be a bird
But I don't really feel like flying
'Cause my wings are hurt
Yeah, I'm tired of trying

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I should be a bird
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I should be a bird
