I never loved him, him
Sorry that I left and cut you out
Took a little while but I worked it out
Now I'm never wondering if I'm good enough, mmm
You hold me like a diamond in the rough, rough

Oh, and I don't feel no pain
'Cause real love ain't that way
Oh, and it feels fucking crazy
When you touch me lately
I think I finally know

I never loved him, not even for a minute
Thought I did then, but you don't see when you're in it
Nobody has gone half as high, come as far
As you and I
I never loved him, oh

He took me from Stockholm
On a train to Oslo
Got a boat to Helsinki
He said, "love ain't gonna hurt
If the one you love deserves you"
Bodies close, I feel it all
I'm never wondering if I'm good enough, mmm
You hold me like a diamond in the rough, rough
You might also like
Oh, and I don't feel no pain
'Cause real love ain't that way
Oh, and it feels fucking crazy
When you touch me lately
I think I finally know

I never loved him
Not even for a minute
Thought I did then, but you don't see when you're in it
Nobody has gone half as high, come as far
As you and I
I never loved him, oh

I oh I, oh, I oh I
I oh I, oh, uh, uh
I oh I, oh, I oh I
I oh I, oh, uh, uh
I oh I (never), oh, I oh I (loved)
I oh I, oh, uh, uh (him)
I oh I (never), oh, I oh I (loved)
I oh I, oh, uh, uh (him)
I oh I, oh, I oh I (I never loved him)
I oh I, oh, uh, uh (not even for a minute)
I never loved him (I oh I, oh, I oh I)
Not even for a minute (I oh I, oh, uh, uh)
Thought I did then (I oh I, oh, I oh I)
But you don't see when you're in it (I oh I, oh, uh, uh)
Nobody has gone half as high (I oh I, oh, I oh I)
Come as far, as you and I (I oh I, oh, uh, uh)
I never loved him (I oh I, oh, I oh I)
Oh (I oh I, oh, uh, uh)
