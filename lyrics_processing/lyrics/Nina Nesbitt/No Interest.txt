Sit on the bus and I get on the backseat
With a hooded and a bottle of JD
I'm throwing looks 'cause the baby's crying
Wish the mother would stop denying them milk
So I put on The Vaccines
Look out the window and I see you go past me
You wave your hand and you shout out my name
I would've called you if you hadn't fucked me off

No interest in you, I've no interest at all
There's nothing to lose, 'cause there's nothing at all
I've no interest in you, no interest at all
'Cause there's nothing to lose, there's nothing at all

Yeah I'm livid, yeah I'm livid, oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm livid, yeah I'm livid, oh oh oh oh

I get off the bus and I walk around George Street
An old man in a hat playing violin
Girls wearing Jack Wills and Abercrombie
Stop asking me who I'm dating now
Get a text from Claire and a Rachel
Telling me that my ex tried to kiss them
Last night we were at Revolution
Had enough so I went to get some chips
You might also like
No interest in you, I've no interest at all
There's nothing to lose, cause there's nothing at all
I've no interest in you, no interest at all
Cause there's nothing to lose, there's nothing at all

Yeah I'm livid, yeah I'm livid, oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm livid, yeah I'm livid, oh oh oh oh

Getting home late, to find him standing at my front door
There's no reason for him to be here at all
Pushed past him, and he pulls out a rose
Does he even really know me at all?
I climb the stairs, and I walk up my hallway
He tries ringing and it goes to the answer phone
Then says that he's nothing left to say
Except the fact that he's allergic to my dog

No interest in you, I've no interest at all
There's nothing to lose, cause there's nothing at all
I've no interest in you, no interest at all
Cause there's nothing to lose, there's nothing at all
Yeah I'm livid, yeah I'm livid, oh oh oh oh
