Before you jump in
Tryna' get under my skin
Something I should let you know
It's gonna be impossible
'Cause I'm a made-up mess
In a backless dress
I don't wanna lead you on
Cause I'd only do you wrong,  oh oh-

You can have my heart
But you're not gonna leave with it
Light in the dark
Yeah you almost believed in it
You've got me wrong
I've got you hanging round my neck
Saying romance isn't dead

Oh, you know that I'm down for whatever
But oh, I told you that it won't be forever
Oh, how come you still think that you're the one
Baby, I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh, ah ah
I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
You might also like
Let me tell you straight
I could be your worst mistake
Or you could get the best of me
Forget about the rest of me
With your cigarette
In between your teeth
You could light me up
If I forget to breathe, oh oh-

You can have my heart
But you're not gonna leave with it
Lying in the dark
Yeah you almost believed in it
Thought you were strong
Now I've got you tied up in the bed
Screaming romance isn't dead

Oh, you know that I'm down for whatever
Oh oh, I told you that it won't be forever
Oh, how come you still think that you're the one
Baby, I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh, ah ah
I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone (gone)
Oh oh oh, ah ah
I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
Yeah, you're stuck on me
Now I can't move
Give it just a night
And I'll cut you loose
Oh what a thing to do, yeah

Oh, you know that I'm down for whatever
Oh oh, I told you that it won't be forever
So how come you still think that you're the one
I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's (flavour's) gone
You know, you know, oh-
Cause I'm, I told, I told you-
Oh, how come you still think that you're the one
Baby, I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh, ah ah
I'm just chewing gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh, ah ah
