We're sitting in a taxi, racing on the 405
We just left the party, off Dakota Drive
Now you're shouting from the left seat
You take your hand off my thigh
And I wish I could explain, but you say I lie

The truth is I got jealous she was with you and my ex
And when you walked on over, I got a pain in my chest
And I know I wasn't sober but I meant what I said to you
And I don't wanna break I wanna work this through
'Cause when I think about my future all I think about is you
But we're the only reason that we ever seem to argue

Gotta keep in the moment, gotta keep in the now
Gotta keep it, oh keep it, I gotta keep it way deep down
Gotta keep in the moment, I'm in love with you now
Gotta keep it, oh keep it, I gotta keep it way deep down
Keep it way deep down
Keep it way deep down

'Cause he was just first love
Doesn't mean he's the one
And now you're running in circles
Over and over
You might also like
So many complications in our new relationship
But getting back together's always gonna be a risk
Now either we let go of the past or we'll be part of it
But parts of my past have hurt me so bad
And although I'm over it I am still close
To the memories I have, I hope you understand
'Cause I'm ready to bury this all in the sand

Gotta keep in the moment, gotta keep in the now
Gotta keep it, oh keep it, I gotta keep it way deep down
Gotta keep in the moment, I'm in love with you now
Gotta keep it, oh keep it, I gotta keep it way deep down
Keep it way deep down
Keep it way deep down
Keep it, oh keep it

We're like California rain in the summer
And I don't wanna run for cover, no
Soaking you into my skin
Drowning out those that have been
(Gotta keep in the moment, keep in the moment, oh)

We're like California rain in the summer

Gotta keep it, oh keep it, I gotta keep it way deep down

Gotta keep in the moment, keep it way deep down
Gotta keep in the moment, keep it way deep down
