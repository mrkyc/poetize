We started good, crossed our hearts, we made a promise
Misunderstood, 'cause all my friends say you're dishonest
You had me questionin' what I was worth
Yeah, you know and I know now

Say what you want, but I know that it's only
Words that you use to anyone, anybody
Myself and I, yeah, we're done with your sorrys
Get out my face, it's safe to say

When I was your girlfriend, you said it'd be different
You wanted other girls, then you wanted commitment
But you couldn't get it to-to-together
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter
Oh, I was your girlfriend, I thought you were different
I tried to make it work, gave a million chances
But I know I can do, do, do better
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter

You'd sit at home, tokin' on that marijuana
Pick up your clothes like you forgot I'm not your mother
Yeah, you were getting way too comfortable
Yeah, you know and I know now
You might also like
Say what you want, but I know that it's only
Words that you use to anyone, anybody
Myself and I, yeah, we're done with your sorrys
You'll be replaced, it's safe to say

When I was your girlfriend, you said it'd be different
You wanted other girls, then you wanted commitment
But you couldn't get it to-to-together
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter
Oh, I was your girlfriend, I thought you were different
I tried to make it work, gave a million chances
But I know I can do, do, do better
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

By the time you get it, I'll be out on the road
'Cause I packed up all my things, put your name on a note
Yeah, you thought you were clever, but you didn't know
That my heart left you 'bout two months ago (My heart left you)
By the time you get it, I'll be out on the road (The time you get it)
'Cause I packed up all my things, put your name on a note (Packed up all your things)
Yeah, you thought you were clever, but you didn't know (Oh)
That my heart left you 'bout two months ago
When I was your girlfriend, you said it'd be different
You wanted other girls, then you wanted commitment
But you couldn't get it to-to-together
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter
Oh, I was your girlfriend, I thought you were different
I tried to make it work, gave a million chances
But I know I can do, do, do better
I'm sending you this love, love, love letter (My heart left you, oh)

By the time you get it, I'll be out on the road (Sending you this love letter)
'Cause I packed up all my things, put your name on a note
Yeah, you thought you were clever, but you didn't know
