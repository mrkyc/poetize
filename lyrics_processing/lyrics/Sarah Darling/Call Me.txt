That late night goodnight call when you had too much to drink
That skinny dip in the moonlight, that magic summertime thing
That highway I've been drivin', wanna feel every curve
That taste of whiskey when you wanna kiss me

But you don't have enough
Wanna be, wanna be there for you
If you want, if you really want me to

I'll be there, head rush, little too much
Moonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey
I'll be that song you wanna sing
Like you're seventeen, wild and reckless
All you gotta do is call me
Gonna be there
Wanna be there for you
Gonna be there

Last thing, all I need, I'm filling in the color of a new tattoo
That Roman candle that you're holdin', shootin' red white and blue
That full moon halfway there when you're barefoot in the grass
Sayin' oh babe, let's it slow babe
You might also like
But your heart beats too fast
Wanna be, wanna be there for you
If you want, if you really want me to

I'll be there, head rush, little too much
Moonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey
I'll be that song you wanna sing
Like you're seventeen, wild and reckless
All you gotta do is call me

I'll be that song you wanna sing
Like you're seventeen, all you gotta do is call me

I'll be there, head rush, little too much
Moonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey
I'll be that song you wanna sing
Like you're seventeen, wild and reckless
All you gotta do is call me
That feelin' that you get
When you're runnin' out of breath so fast
All you gotta do is call me
I'll be that song you wanna sing
Like you're seventeen, all you gotta do is call me
Wanna be, wanna be there for you baby
If you want, if you want, you want me to
Wanna be, wanna be there for you
