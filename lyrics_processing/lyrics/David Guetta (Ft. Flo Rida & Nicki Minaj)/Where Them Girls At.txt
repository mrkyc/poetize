Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends

You wanna ball, let's mix it, I swear you're good
I won't tell nobody ('Body)
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited ('Vited)
Hairdos and nails, that Louis, Chanel all up in the body

Bottles of my reach, we can all get buzz
Holla 'cause I'm free till whenever, it's no rush
