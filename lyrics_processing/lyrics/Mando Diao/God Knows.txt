I get excited by the moves you do
I'm on a mission and I'm gonna get away
Well I saw her standing all colored in red
I felt the blues just by the things she said
I want my mission so I can escape today
God knows - I ain't sleeping but I want my line
God knows - I ain't happy so I want it bad tonight
Oh brother can you help me out
God knows - I've got nothing so accept my time
God knows - it ain't easy to behave in this spotlight
Oh brother can you help me out
Brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
Well I turned the page from number three to four
You had nothing on you by my bedroom door
You had your mission now I'm gonna get away
When this is over and our souls are saved
When I am buried when I've got my own cave
I've done my mission so I won't be here today
God knows - I ain't sleeping but I want my line
God knows - I ain't happy so I want it bad tonight
Oh brother can you help me out
God knows - I've got nothing so accept my time
God knows - it ain't easy to behave in this spotlight
Oh brother can you help me out...
Brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
You might also likeI turned right just like I thought you would
I got excited like you said I would
I'm on a mission and I'm getting blown away
Well I saw her standing all colored in red
I felt the blues just by the things she said
I want my mission so I can escape today
God knows - I ain't sleeping but I want my line
God knows - I ain't happy so I want it bad tonight
Oh brother can you help me out
God knows - I've got nothing so accept my time
God knows - it ain't easy to behave in this spotlight
Oh brother can you help me out
Brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
Yeah yeah
