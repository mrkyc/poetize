Break your happy home
Learn to sing along
To the music
To the music
Clap your hands and shake
On a summer's day
To the music
To the music

I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

I'm gonna dance with somebody

When you're all alone
We become your home
We're the music
We're the music
When your love's away
And you feel betrayed
We're the music
Sweet music
