For your love to set me free
Been starving for too long on my own
Gravity can hold you down
Shooting through my lonely mind
Won't you take me home?
Shake me all around
Shake me to the ground
Shake me with no fear
Shake me out of here
I need somebody to call me honey
Girl, you got me
Won't you take me home?
Shake me all around
Shake me to the ground
Shake me with no fear
Shake me out of here
I need somebody to call me honey
Girl, you got me
Won't you take me home?
I've been trying endlessly
To deny this chemistry
How long can this go on
I wanna know

Shake me to the ground
Shake me with no fear
Shake me out of here
I need somebody to call me honey
Girl, you got me
Won't you take me home?
Shake me all around
Shake me to the ground
Shake me with no fear
Shake me out of here
I need somebody to call me honey
Girl, you got me
Won't you take me home?
