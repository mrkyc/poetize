It takes time
Too much time
To deny
All my lies
Though I love them
Like the truth
In your eyes

I lose time
Precious time
So cold inside
Still in denial
If you show me
Your sweet dreams
I'll take them out

Oh, Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
No means, no I didn't do it
No means, I know I didn't do it
No means, I keep doing it
No means, you know I keep doing it

No means, I know I didn't do it
No means, I keep doing it
No means, you know

Lights are out
I'm alone
Gotta feed my need
Staring at the phone
Feel the pressure
In my head
Growing fast

I got time
Endless time
I turn the TV on
Distract my mind
When you see me
Remember old
Old good times
Oh, Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
