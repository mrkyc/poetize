Chill out, you're moving too fast
Yeah, she's coming over and you need to relax
And just slow down, take a big deep breath
Can't you see you're making me a nervous wreck?

Heart, don't blow my cover when I get her inside
Don't want her to see you when she looks in my eyes
I know you don't want to, but you gotta play it cool
So, don't go getting crazy, no you don't wanna rush
Until we know for certain how she feels about us
It's going good right now, don't sell a brother out
Yeah, I know you love her
So heart, don't go and blow my cover

There's a good chance she's wearing that dress
The one that always gets you jumping out of my chest
And if she leans in and gives me a kiss
Gotta keep it all together 'cause I know how you get

Heart, don't blow my cover when I get her inside
Don't want her to see you when she looks in my eyes
I know you don't want to, but you gotta play it cool
So, don't go getting crazy, no you don't wanna rush
Until we know for certain how she feels about us
It's going good right now, don't sell a brother out
Yeah, I know you love her
So heart, don't go and blow my cover
You might also like
Just try and take it easy when she gets here
Until she lets us know that the coast is clear

Heart, don't blow my cover when I get her inside
Don't want her to see you when she looks in my eyes
I know you don't want to, but you gotta play it cool
So, don't go getting crazy, no you don't wanna rush
Until we know for certain how she feels about us
It's going good right now, don't sell a brother out
Yeah, I know you love her and I know you know I love her
