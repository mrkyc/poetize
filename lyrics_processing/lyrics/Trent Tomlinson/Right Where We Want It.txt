Weatherman's callin' for a good night
Said it's the kind of sky that we don't wanna miss
And I know you're a sucker for sunset
That's why I got us parked up out on the ridge
And we can sit and watch it all go down
Kick back and turn up the slow jam
And after that, it's all about us
What happens in the truck stays in the truck

Ain't no way, baby, we can mess this up
All the stars gonna line up for us
Got the world at our fingertips
It don't get, don't get any better than this
Countin' down the minutes 'til we're in the dark
'Til I can wrap you up baby in my arms
And when the moon comes out, girl, we'll own it
We got the night right where we want it

I won't lie the sky is really somethin'
It's like heaven painted us a hell of a view
All the colors mixed up together
It ain't got, ain't got nothin' on you
Gettin' closer, what we came here for
A little closer to a whole lot more
As soon as we see the day fadin'
It's gonna be ours for the takin'
You might also like
Ain't a way baby we can mess this up
All the stars gonna line up for us
Got the world at our fingertips
It don't get, don't get any better than this
Countin' down the minutes 'Til we're in the dark
'Til I can wrap you up baby in my arms
And when the moon comes out girl we'll own it
We got the night right where we want it

Ain't a way baby we can mess this up
All the stars gonna line up for us
Got the world at our fingertips
It don't get, don't get any better than this
Countin' down the minutes 'Til we're in the dark
'Til I can wrap you up baby in my arms
And when the moon comes out girl we'll own it
We got the night right where we want it
