He's got an I love Jesus fish stuck on his bumper
With a rebel flag rippin' like a razor in the wind
A sign sellin' watermelons and cucumbers

Ya, He parks there off the pavement just slightly in a ditch
He's got a two-tone tattered lawn chair where he smokes his pipe and sits
And when the sun goes down the price goes down, and everybody knows

Get what you need fresh from the garden
A little less ripe if that's how you like it
If you ain't tried it you better not knock it
If you didn't go to church the Sunday before
You can hear all about it and a little bit more
About what it takes to make a man a man
Down at Henry Cartwright's back home, home grown, prayer and produce stand
Verse 2:

The know how and the plow he used to make it
And when you sink your teeth in it's a sin to taste it
And if you had to stand in line it's worth the wait!

We got potatoes, vine ripe tomatoes
Big yellow squash, and oh my gosh

And mend your life to mind the Lord
