I know that number, but I ain't picking up
She's coming over, gonna pick up her stuff
Ain't in the mood for a real big fight
Wrecking my mind, hell no not tonight
Turn off the lights and lock it all up
Grab the keys and goes fire up the truck
Ain't gonna be nowhere to be found
When it all goes down

I don't wanna be here when she goes there
So I can't see that she don't care
If I don't see the leaving all over her face
I can keep believing everything's okay
If I don't feel the hurting hit
And her goodbye rolling off her lips
There's still a chance she ain't going anywhere
So, I don't wanna be here when she goes there

For long as I'm bellied up to a bar
I won't see her climbing out of her car
I won't see her stepping up on that porch
Come in that door, get to doing what she came here for
I know there's no way I can't take her
Looking so good while she's walking away
If I'm gone I could brush it off
Like it never really happened at all

I don't wanna be here when she goes there
So I can't see that she don't care
If I don't see the leaving all over her face
I can keep believing everything's okay
If I don't feel the hurting hit
And her goodbye rolling off her lips
There's still a chance she ain't going anywhere
So, I don't wanna be here when she goes there

Turn off the lights and lock it all up
Grab the keys and go fire up the truck
Ain't gonna be nowhere to be found
When it all goes down

I don't wanna be here when she goes there
So I can't see that she don't care
If I don't see the leaving all over her face
I can keep believing everything's okay
If I don't feel the hurting hit
And her goodbye rolling off her lips
There's still a chance she ain't going anywhere
Hey, there's still a chance she ain't going anywhere
So, I don't wanna be here when she goes there
