Like I messed with your woman or I stoled your car
What's your problem
I don't even know your name
You got a chip on your shoulder 'bout two-foot wide
If you're lookin' for trouble, son, step it outside
An' if you want me to play, I'll get in the game
An' I'll be singin', hey, batter batter
Hey, batter, batter, swing
Step up to the plate
Hoss, do your thing
My whole day's been goin' south
Last thing I need is you runnin' your mouth
One more strike an', buddy, you struck out
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter, batter, swing
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter, batter, swing
Well, I didn't come here in the best of moods
An' you ain't helpin' matters with your attitude
Get yourself a whiskey, an' put it on my check
Well after that, if you still wanna go
We can stand face to face an' toe to toe
An' if your buddy wants a piece of me too
Tell him he's on deck

My whole day's been goin' south
Last thing I need is you runnin' your mouth

Hey, batter batter, hey, batter, batter, swing
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter, batter, swing
(Come on, boy)
I don't need this confrontation
Better rethink your situation
Ain't no minor thing to me
Welcome to the major league
Singin', hey, batter batter
Hey, batter, batter, swing
Step up to the plate
Hoss, do your thing
My whole day's been goin' south
Last thing I need is you runnin' your mouth
