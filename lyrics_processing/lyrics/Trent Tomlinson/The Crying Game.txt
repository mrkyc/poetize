It ain't like her to walk in here
On a Friday night like she owns the bar
It seems this time the sting of goodbye
Just really ain't hitting this hard
And it's been a while
Since anybody's seen her smile

I guess we all just kinda got used
To her hanging 'round this place
With her head hung down and memory to drown
And makeup running down her face
Oh, but not tonight
Yeah, I could see it in her eyes

She's getting good at the crying game
She getting better every time she plays
Every single teardrop that falls
Is another give a damn rolling off
It won't be long until all those scars
Will fade away just like a broken heart
She'll never be the same, all the rules have changed
She's getting good at the crying game
You might also like
It won't be long now before she won't break down
And he'll be gone as he could get
Just a little more time, he'll be out of her mind
And nothing more than a regret
And it's starting to show
Hey, then everybody knows

She's getting good at the crying game
She getting better every time she plays
Every single teardrop that falls
Is another give a damn rolling off
It won't be long until all those scars
Will fade away just like a broken heart
She'll never be the same, all the rules have changed
She's getting good at the crying game

It's good, it's bad, it's bittersweet
Everybody knows she needs
Just a little time, time

It won't be long until all those scars
Will fade away just like a broken heart
She'll never be the same, all the rules have changed
She's getting good at the crying game
She'll never be the same, all the rules have changed
She's getting good at the crying game
