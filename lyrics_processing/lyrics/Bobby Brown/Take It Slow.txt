I can't wait for the moment to kiss your tender lips
But you told me we should take it slow
I'm so in love with you, don't know what to do
And these really blowing my mind
And I know you know you got me going on
And you're all that I need, oh
(Let me get close to you
I'll take it slow) Oh, oh, oh

Slow, let's take it slow
(You and me, baby)
Slow (Slow)
Slow (Hey, girl)

After finding you, baby, how could I ask for more
So I'm sending you roses, my love
And I want you to know what I feel inside
And you're always on my mind, girl
Yes, it's new to me, the things you do to me
It's got me begging for more, girl
(Let me get close to you
I'll take it slow) Oh, oh, oh

How I really feel inside
Does anybody know what I'm talking about, baby?

Slow (Break it down, break it down, break it down)

Yo, first time I laid eyes on you, baby
You, like, blew my mind, word
It was like, it was like heaven from up above, you know what I'm saying?
But now you see I got this having you written all over my face
I never thought love could be this way
You mean a lot to me, baby
I want you to be my girl
Can you do that?
Please? (Do that) Baby, please
You for me, I for you
Girl, I know what to do, to you, to you, girl
To you, girl
I wanna tell the world, sing it
You for me, I for you
Girl, I know what to do, to you
To you
And it'll never stop
Baby, hoo, let's take it
Slow (Can we?) Let's take it slow
(Can we?)
Slow, slow (I won't hurt you, baby)
Slow (Do it my way) Let's take it slow
