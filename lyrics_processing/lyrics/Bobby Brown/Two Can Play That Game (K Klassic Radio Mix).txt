Drop it

Stay with me, but if you want to leave
Take your things, forget all about me
Tell me why you fail to realize
That you might not ever get another try

Girl, think about it before you leave
'Cause Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you wanna do your own thing
I hear what you're sayin'
Two can play that game you're playin', yeah

(Two can play that game)
Two can play that game
(Two can play that game)
Hey, oh, two can play that game
(Two can play that game)
Two
(Two can play that game)

Lately you've been acting mighty strange
To me it seems your attitude has changed
And suddenly you just don't seem the same
Instead of playing all those silly games

Two can play that game you're playin'

(Two can play that game)
Two can play that game

Two can play that game
Girl, think, about it before you leave

No, no-no-no, no-no-no, I said two
