Lately, it's been kind, it's been kinda, it's been kinda
You are now listening to the sounds
Of the Brown Bomber, baby
This how we do, yeah
Check it out, baby

You see now lately, there's been a funny feelin'
That won't stop bothering me
See, I tried to shake it
Erase it from my heart and mind
But it just don't want to leave, oh

I can't explain the way you're driving me insane
(I can't explain the way you drive me insane, no I can't)
(And I) And I can't complain
(Baby, I can't complain)
'Cause, girl, I love that thing
(I love the things that you do when you do what you do to me)

I've got this feelin', baby
(I've got this feelin', baby)
I've got this feelin' inside
(That tonight, tonight is gonna be alright, I've got this feelin', baby)
I've got this feelin', baby
I've got this feelin' inside
(Tonight is gonna be alright, check it out, check it out, check it out)

For so long to find the perfect one for me

And I've been yearning for someone to love me
Just for me, just for me
Well, well, well, well

'Cause, girl, I love that thing
('Cause I love the things that you do when you do what you do to me)
