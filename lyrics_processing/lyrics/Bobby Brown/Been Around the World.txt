Yeah, uh
Tour to tour
I've been around the world so many times, it kinda scares me, you know
That I've seen so many people, met so many people
Seen so many faces, forgot so many faces
But it's yours, baby, it's yours
I sit and wonder to myself, what was God waiting on?
Let me tell you something
Listen, baby

Lately I can't sleep at night
'Cause constantly you're on my mind
Have I found in you what no one else could do to me?
Turn me on to something else
I just can't believe myself
That you're inside my system
And myself control is gone
But, girl, it feels so good

Been around the world, and yes, I've seen a lot of girls
But it's you, baby, on my mind
I've been so many places, and yes, I've seen a lot of faces
(Seen a lot of faces)
But it's yours, baby, on my mind
You might also like
Is it my imagination or could be something's got a hold on me?
And I think that you the reason for the smile thats on my face, yes
Now, girl, can you promise me that you'll just take it easy?
On my heart, will never part for the rest of our lives
But ooh it feels so good

Been around the world, and yes, I've seen a lot of girls
But it's you, baby, on my mind (Baby, it's you on my mind)
I've been so many places, and yes, I've seen a lot of faces
(Seen lots of faces)
But it's yours, baby, on my mind (On my mind, yeah, oh)
Been around the world, and yes, I've seen a lot of girls
But it's you, baby, on my mind (You)
I've been so many places, and yes, I've seen a lot of faces
(And I see lots of faces)
But it's yours, baby, on my mind (Yours)

Is it me on your mind? (Yeah)
Is it you on my mind? (On my mind)
Yes, you're all on my mind (Uh-huh)
Boy, that's for sure (For real, baby)
And, oh, it feels so good
Been around the world, and yes, I've seen a lot of girls
But it's you, baby, on my mind (You're on my mind, yes you are, lady)
I've been so many places, and yes, I've seen a lot of faces
But it's yours, baby, on my mind (Sugar, listen)

I don't want nobody else, baby
I don't need nobody else, girl (It's you)
I don't want nobody else, baby (On my mind)
I don't need nobody else, girl
I don't want nobody else, baby
And I don't need nobody else, girl (It's you)
I don't want nobody else, baby (On my mind)
