I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for
Throughout my travels, girl, I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in the bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be that we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstasy, there's something about this love

We, we have something in common
Girl, you mean so much to me it should be plain to see that we
We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old-fashioned rules and old-fashioned ways
Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm you're girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side 'til the very end
All in all, best of of love, we are friends

We have something in common
Boy, you mean so much to me, it should be plain to see that we
We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together
We, we have something in common
Yes, we do (Yes, we do) Yes, we do (Yes, we do)
Oh baby
We, we have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Girl, you know it's you that I adore (Adore you, I adore you)
And there is no-one in this world that I love more, baby
You know I do, I really
Baby (Baby) Baby (Baby)
Don't you know that we

We have something in common
We have something in common
(You and me) Me and you (Ah, tell the world about it)
We have something in common
(Yeah) And it means so much to me, boy, when we're together, said we
We, we have something in common
We'll never have no problems, baby
Baby, ooh baby, more and more
Girl, you know
We have something in common
(You and me) Me and you (Me and you) You and me
We'll be together
We have something in common
Oh, baby you (Baby you) Baby you (Baby you)

Let's sing it, baby
(I love you more and more and more and more and more, baby)
We have something in common
(Said I need you) I need you
(Said I love you) I love you
(Said I gotta have your love) Gotta have your love
(Go ahead and sing, baby) Gotta have you, baby
We have something in common

Wanna tell the world about it
That I'll never, never, never let you go, baby
