Yeah, on the remix tip, Sunday afternoon, y'all
DOA, bring it to me, baby
Well, well, well
Listen here, baby

Bright and early Sunday morning
I go to church and thank the Lord for another day
And when the service is over
I spend a little time with my family, ooh
And then we all get together
Just for a bite to eat and to cool out
That's when I gotta go somewhere by myself
I need a minute to unwind

And when the sun starts going down
That's when I go to the park
(On a Sunday afternoon) On a Sunday afternoon, having fun
(Having so much fun) Everybody's just chillin', yes they are
(Everybody's just chillin') On a Sunday afternoon
(On a Sunday afternoon) Yeah

I see the brothers outside
Gettin' their cars together for that evening ride
They'll be cruising through the park, haha
Checking out the honeys way before it gets dark
Everybody's having fun, everybody's cold gettin' down
Rollin' in their Jeeps
Pumpin' the funky sounds of me, Bobby Brown

DOA, do me a favor, play baby, come on

Listen, on a Sunday afternoon
On a Sunday, when the sun is going down
We'll be coolin' and just kickin' it around (Kickin' around)
Everybody's just having so much fun, Sunday afternoon
(On a Sunday afternoon)
We'll be strollin' and rollin' through the park (Rollin')
Just cruisin', havin' fun after dark (Oh oh)
On a Sunday afternoon

Just me and my lady (On a Sunday afternoon)
Well, well, and my two little girls (Having so much fun)
And I can't forget about my two sons, the two Beresfords
We're just chillin' (Everybody's just chillin')
On a Sunday afternoon (On a Sunday afternoon)

You know, well I'd just like to say
After all the talk they have said about me, and about my family, uh
(On a Sunday afternoon) We're all just chillin', yo
Still together, and we're still together, hahaha
Yeah, B. Brown is outta here, ghost
On a Sunday, when the sun is going down
We'll be coolin' and just kickin' it around
Everybody's just having so much fun, Sunday afternoon
They'll be strollin' and rollin' through the park
Just cruisin', havin' fun after dark
