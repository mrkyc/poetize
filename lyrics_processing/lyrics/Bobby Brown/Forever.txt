My love, you're the only one that I live for
I finally found someone that I die for
Endlessly forever, girl
I adore the tender love you given to me

I hope I never wake up from this love dream
Because I'm in another world that's so free
But look what you've done to me
'Cause I'll keep giving my all to ya, lady

I finally found the woman I need (The woman I need)
The ultimate world of you and me
And baby, I feel your love (Your love)
Let's make this forever and ever

Incredible, show me a new way to give love
Unconditional from my heart
And I'll do anything to make you smile
Smile, smile, smile for me, yeah

I hope I never wake up from this love dream
Because I'm in another world that's so free
But look what you've done to me
But I keep giving my all, oh oh
You might also like
I finally found the woman I need (The woman I need)
The ultimate world of you and me
And baby, I feel your love
Let's make this forever and ever (Ever)
I finally found the woman I need (I finally found)
The ultimate world of you and me
(Someone I can hold on to)
And baby, I feel your love
Let's make this forever and ever

Baby
Break it down, break it down
Just, just
Just a little bit
I finally found (Said I finally found)
I finally found someone
I finally found someone (Said I finally found)
I finally found (Said I finally found)
Finally found, finally found, finally found
