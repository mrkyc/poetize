Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (ooh)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (oh)
That's my prerogative
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Gettin' girls is how I live
Some messy questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't undersand me
Or really don't know the deal
About a brother
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I win this fight, sing!
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (oh)
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
It's my prerogative

No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing, I'm doing for you
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Egotrips is not my thing
All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothing wrong
In spreading myself around, sing
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)

Without all of the things that people say?
Yo, Teddy kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

What is this a blizzard
That I can't have money in pocket and people not talk about me?
This world is a trip, I don't know what's goin' on these days
Got this person over here talkin' 'bout me
Hey, listen this is my prerogative, I can do what I want to
I made this money, you didn't
Right, Ted?
We outta here
It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
It's my prerogative
