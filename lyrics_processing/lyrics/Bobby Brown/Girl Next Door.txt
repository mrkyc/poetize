This is crazy!
I mean, I meet the most beautiful girl
Come to find out
She lives right next door to me
I don't know what I'mma do
This is rough on me
I just, I JUST GOTTA TALK TO SOMEBODY!!!

Hey fellas, gather round
Lemme tell you about a girl, who's blowin' my mind
She's really new in town, fresh and lovely
And ever so fine
I said "How do you do?
There's never been another girl like you
My heart just skips a beat
Whenever you're near to me"
She lets me walk with her
I Thought it couldn't get any better
But there was even more
I found out she's a girl next door
I want to be with her forever more
You might also likeThe girl next door, yeah
I need to be with her
Now since I've been with her
I've found out my whole world is turnin' around
She never rocks the boat
Yes, she keeps it (she keeps it)
From runnin' the ground
Sometimes I can't believe
That she only wants to be with me
It seems like such a crime
Not to share such a lovely find
I never get too much
I'm livin' every moment for her touch
Because she lives next door
Next to me, baby
Girl next door 
Hey yeah now tell me baby

What could she have in store? The girl next door
Her very presence, her essence, I do adore
And bein' this close is drivin' me wild
I love her personality, her style
My life is bright once more again
Our lives are hot, our souls will blend
I love that girl more than all the world
She's like priceless diamonds, cultured pearls
I'll never bore, my girl next door
Each other's bodies will explode
Our love will grow forever more!
Girl next door
She caught me peekin'
