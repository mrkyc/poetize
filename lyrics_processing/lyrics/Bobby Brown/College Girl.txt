You've been away for so long
I just have a few words to tell you
I know
Your education is
A lot more important than
Me by now
I love you also
Let me show you

Lady, please tell me how you really feel
Deep inside your heart I hope that it's for real
I feel lonely, do you wish that I was there?
There right by your side showing you I care

(College Girl, won't you come over tonight?)
College Girl, come over tonight
(I want to make love to you)
I wanna make love, I wanna make love yeah
(College Girl, I can make it feel alright)
I can make you feel alright, alright, alright

Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout how we used to be
Something about your love that makes my life complete
I've never met a girl that make me feel the way you do
Girl, won't you come over so I can do the things I wanna do
You might also like

(College Girl, won't you come over tonight?)
(I want to make love to you)
I wanna make love to you
But not the kind of love that is just physical
(College Girl, I can make it feel alright)
I wanna make love to you 
And of course physically
I just wanna be near you and spend some time with you

College girl, please, let me know the deal
If you're for real about the love I give to you
Sounds so good to me
You know I need you
I need you 'round me at all times sweetheart
I'm not trying to take anything away from you
 education
It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to you
But I just need, I just need to spend just one night, just one night
I miss you so much
I do
I do
I wanna make love to you yeah
There is nothing in the world I won't do for you baby
All I want you to do is
Let me hear you say yeah yeah
Just say yeah yeah yeah
Let me hear you say yeah yeah yeah
I know there's not too much I can say by now
I just know I wanna see you, talk to you
Wanna hold you, massage you
Take some of that tension off that brain of yours
You've been working hard
It's getting close to the summer soon
Please
Come over tonight
Please come over
Please come over
Please come over
I just wanna hold you baby
Just wanna squeeze you baby
I just wanna love you baby
College Girl
I wanna make love when you wanna make love
I wanna talk when you wanna talk
I wanna do the things you wanna do
