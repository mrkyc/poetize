Just a kiss
I can't resist
The fever courses through your veins
Ignites the flame inside
You start to burn
You start to yearn
Heartbeat races like a train
The hurricane beats tonight

(I need you)
To feed this love obsession
(I need you)
I can't flush this fever from my heart
(I need you)
Freed from lust's possession
(I need you)
I can't keep my mind from falling apart
Apart girl

Eye to eye
Scent is fly
Nerves unleash a final touch
It's all assured inside
The way you feel
Has a 
That I've been searching for so much
Gotta keep your body close to mine
