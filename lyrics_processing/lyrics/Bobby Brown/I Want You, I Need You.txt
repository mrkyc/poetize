B. Brown back, yeah
Ayo Stanley, do me a favor
Drop it

I want you (Hey, yeah), I need you
(I want you, I need you)
I want you (You, yes), I need you

I've been around the world
Seen lots of pretty girls
But no one has seemed to catch my eye
Feelings and faces change
Nothing remains the same
As long as you're not by my side

Baby, when I first met you
I realized that I needed you in my life
And after all that we've been through
I hope you understand the way I feel for you

I want you (I want you), I need you
I need you, baby, nothing can change my mind 'cause I
I want you (Ooh yeah, baby), I need you
Yeah, take me to the second verse, uh
You might also like
Now that I have you here
To you my love I give
And no one could ever take your place
'Cause you make me feel so strong
With you I can't go wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, when I first met you
I realized that I needed you in my life
And after all that we've been through
I hope you understand the way I feel for you

I want you (Yeah, baby), I need you
(I want you, yeah)
I want you (I need you, baby), I need you
(Now let me take it back to the streets, drop it)

Alright, grab a hold and don't let go
Get ready for the solid and steady slow flow
A physical lust 'cause it's a must that I bring ya
Love, squeeze me tight, don't let me slip through your finger
'Cause a brother like the B-R-O-W-N
Is in it to win it for a girl who's a perfect ten
So coming into my life, a pretty lady
Let me show that I need you and I'm going to
Treat you the right way because I want you
Baby, when I first met you (Met you)
I realized that I needed you in my life
And after all that we've been through
I hope you understand the way I feel for you, baby

I want you (Hey, hey), I need you
(You, hey, yeah, yeah)
I want you (I need you, baby), I need you
There's nothing in the whole wide world that I wouldn't do for you, baby
I want you, I need you

I want you (No no no no), I need you
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, you know I want you)

I want you (I want you), I need you
