You know a man likes a good time
He likes to wine and then dine
A beautiful woman
And love her through the night
And if the lovin' feels right
He likes to do her two times
Pleasing that woman
Until she's satisfied

But when all the lovin's done
Who wants love that's on the run
One good time
But there's so much more
How 'bout conversation
Some communication
Someone who loves you
And stimulates your mind, baby

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind
All of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman
Who'll keep love comin'
All of the time
All of her life
You might also like
You know a man likes to have fun
He likes to get into some tender young roni's
As pretty as they come
He likes to love all night long
And makes 'em feel they got it goin' on
Sometimes, it's lonely, cause there's know one at home

But when all the peaks are done
No one still knows anyone
We've had fun
But I need so much more
How 'bout conversation
Some communication
Someone who knows you and stimulates your mind

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind
All of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman
Who'll keep love comin'
All of the time
All of her life
I'm not ashamed to say
I've been that kinda guy
Didn't want no lady
I just wanted a good time
But now, I think I'm ready for love
I need a woman that'll give it up
Someone to love me
And someone to be right by my side, baby

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind
All of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman
Who'll keep love comin'
All of the time
All of her life

Can you give me the lovin', all I need?
And if you give me the lovin', I'll give you all of me
'Cause I need a woman, to care for me
To love me, to squeeze me, and someone to be right by my side, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind
All of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman
Who'll keep love comin'
All of the time
All of her life

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind
All of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman
Who'll keep love comin'
All of the time
