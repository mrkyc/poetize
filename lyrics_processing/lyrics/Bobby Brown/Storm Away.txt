Down

Looking back on when I was a child
Not a care in the world
All I've learned, and all that I know now
Sometimes we go through pain
Please take us from the rain, yeah yeah yeah
How long must this world continue to be?
Seems like no one even cares, yeah
Think about the children and what they need
Help me find a way, yeah yeah
To take the storm away, Yeah

Somebody take the storm away (Somebody take it away, yeah)
Somebody take the storm away (Take it away)
Somebody take the storm away
Before it comes on down, yeah, yeah baby
Somebody take the storm away (Take it away)
Somebody take the storm away (Take it away)
Somebody take the storm away
Before it comes on down, yeah, yeah baby

I know we've come too far
But we must live in a world full of love
I know, I know, I know we can
I know we can take the storm away
Blow, Danny, blow for me, yeah, yeah

Somebody take the storm away (Ow)
Somebody take the storm away (Yeah)
Somebody take the storm away
Down

You know this world is in definite need for a change
We must ask ourselves:
Do we want all of our kids growing up into a world of hate?
A world of prejudice? A world of heartaches?
A world of drugs and politics?
I don't think so
I think, everybody wants to see the same things happen
We must come together, and live together in this world

Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away (Somebody take it away, take it away)
Somebody take the storm away (I need you, I need you)
Before it comes on down (Somebody take it away)
Somebody take the storm away (Take it away, take it away)
Somebody take the storm away
