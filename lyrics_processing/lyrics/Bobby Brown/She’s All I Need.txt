Yeah
Ayo this one I want to dedicate to me wife
Baby, you know I love you, right?
Listen to this
Oh oh oh
Ayo, y'all listen

Oh, what a beautiful lady
Such a joy divine
And it feels so good to know
That the lady's all mine
I fell in love with her
From the very start
And just the thought of that lady
Touches my heart

And I just got to let her know
That I really love her so
She's the one that I adore
She's all I need

She's my only lady (She's my lady)
She's the other side of me
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need (My only lady)
She's my only lady (Well, well)
She's the other side of me
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need, she's all I need
You might also like
A love so tender and sweet
With a mind that's so unique
That I can't help but wonder
What she's thinking sometimes
Although she may not say it
And although she may not show it
She has her own way of letting me know
How she feels

And when the times get tough
And the going gets rough
I still love her, ha
'Cause we were meant to be, she's all I need

She's my only lady
She's the other side of me (The other side of me)
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need (She's my only lady)
She's my only lady (Well, well)
She's the other side of me (The other side of me)
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need, she's all I need
(Alex, play it Italian style for me)
You know, baby, I, I really care for you
No matter what's been said or what's been done in our lives
We have to make this work for ourselves, yeah

She is all that I need
When the world gets me down (My only lady)
She will always be there
When there's no one else around (I hope you'll always be around)
She is all that I need (Yeah, yeah)
When the world gets me down (My only lady)
She will always be there
When there's no one else around (Baby, I love you)
She's all I need

She's my only lady
She's the other side of me (The other side of me)
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need (My only lady)
She's my only lady
She's the other side of me (The other side of me)
When the world gets me down
She's the only one I need, she's all I need (My only lady)
She's my only lady
She is all that I need
When the world gets me down (Thank you, that's for you, baby)
She will always be there
When there's no one else around (Well, well)
She is all that I need
When the world gets me down (My only lady)
She will always be there
