I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away
Ain't nothin' but the funk, baby!

I need a peace of mind, I'm stressed out today
It's about that time to make that get away
Dealing with the people I deal with everyday
Got to find a place I can hide away

So I can be away from the madness
Far from the noise and the darkness
It's not too late, there's gotta be a way
For me to escape all this nonsense
Get away

I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
You might also like
They try to run my life but that's the way I live
Do what I wanna do, 'cause it's my perrogative
People always trippin' about the things I say
But I'm living for the future and I'm doing things my way

So why does the world just keep on doggin me
I have to leave it all behind
'cause there's gotta be a way
For me to escape all this nonsense
To get away

I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away

Yo check the groove
B's kicking a flow
Real smooth
E double S-S
With some cess
And it's a necessity to move
So hit it where ya fit in and let the rythm snatch ya
Throw a good rhyme so watch what's coming at ya
As I release another Brown batch of jams
That slam
And you can't touch so scram
I know you cram to understand
Who I am, damn by the way can I please get this dance?
Let's not free lance 'cause I'm just getting started
Believe me that was nothing but a Brown party
That's going on and got it going on
Bob and Ted'd rated number one so flow on it
And if you're in the house, pump your fists and say
Ho! (Ho!)
Say ho, ho! (Ho, ho!)
Ted, bring me on back, bring me on back
Dance!
There it is, oh!
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
Never in my life
Have I ever felt that something just ain't right
Baby
Baby
Tired of all this mess
Unhapiness
I guess it's I just gotta get away
Gotta get away
I don't wanna hurt nobody
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Please somebody
It just don't feel right
Baby I can't sleep at night
I need a peace of mind
Far away from the darkness
And you know it's
I need someone
To take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away baby
Please B Brown is outta here
