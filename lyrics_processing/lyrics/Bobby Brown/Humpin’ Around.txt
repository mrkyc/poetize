Come on, damn
Come on, kick it
Come on, damn
Come on, kick it
Now back to the B-B-Brown
Back to the B-B-Brown
Uh, ow
Come on, everybody, let's go
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way
You might also like
Get up off my back (Get off)
Save your heart attack (Yeah, baby)
Ain't nobody humpin' around (Ain't nobody humpin' around)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Come on
Dance
Flip it back

When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack (Uh)
Ain't nobody humpin' around (Ain't nobody humpin' around)
No matter what they say (No)
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl, when you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way, yeah
Back to the B-B-Brown
(I think I wanna dance)
Back to the B-B-Brown
Back to the B-B-Brown
When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
When you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah

Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(STOP!)

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cause I just wanna kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like "ooh" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
(I can make you bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl, you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

Get up off my back (Uh)
Save your heart attack (Ow)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Come on, everybody, let's go)
No matter what they say
(Bounce, bounce)
No, it ain't that way
(Bounce, bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Bounce, bounce, throw your hands in the air, come on)
Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
