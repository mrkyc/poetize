I found a lady, and she's so fine
My baby, she's got the flavors, and she's all mine
She keeps my lovin' when I'm not there
I know she loves me, and I know that she cares, oh

She's my lady
Drives me crazy, yeah
She's my lady
There ain't no maybes

She's the one who always stands right by my side
And we love to make love each and every night
They say in every life a little rain must fall
But she takes away the clouds, so there's no rain at all
We don't care what people say 'bout how we're livin'
We've come too far, we won't give in to ignorance
My baby promised me that she would leave me never
She'll be my lady forever and ever

She's my lady (She's my, my)
She drives me crazy, yeah
She's my lady
There ain't no maybes, no
