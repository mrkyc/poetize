I've waited for this moment for such a long time
Now that you're here with me, listen to me
This one is dedicated to my angel
Ha, bet you wonder who that is
Well, she knows

Now that you are here with me
Baby, let's do it right
Lady, you know just what I need
I want to hold you oh so tight
Baby, just touch Bobby anywhere
'Cause cutie, you turn me on, ooh baby
I'd like to run my fingers through your hair
So come on and stay with me all night

I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
Feeling's so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop
You might also like
All my love

Ooh, how about a little music now?
Let's hear some Marvin Gaye
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
Ooh, let me rub your shoulders down
And let's dance the night away, yeah
Feel your heartbeat next to mine
Now baby, I'll make you feel nice
I think I can tell what's on your mind
And I know (I know) I can make it right

I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
Girl, all night long (All night long)
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
(And I wanna roll)
Feeling's so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
Hey girl, all night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop

You and me, girl, share a drink of wine
We'll be one on one, lovin' through the night
And we're so lucky that we've found a love so right
'Cause we were meant to love all through the night
Give me your lovin'
Just give me your lovin', all through the night
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop
(Baby) I wanna rock, I wanna rock (Baby)
(Baby) I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock (All night long)
(Baby) I wanna rock, I wanna rock (Baby)
(Baby) I wanna rock, I, I wanna rock (All night long)
(Hey, girl) I wanna rock, I wanna rock
(All night long, just give me your lovin')
Rock and roll and roll and rock (Your lovin')
(Your lovin') Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop
Rock and roll and roll and rock
