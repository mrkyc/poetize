Tell me, would it be, baby
Tell me, baby

Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for us to get to know each other
At my place, just you and me

Sitting alone, just wondering what it'll take to get with you
Girl, I don't mind, just tell me what to do
I swear if you don't like it, I don't mean to be too forward
But I need you with me

Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for us to get to know each other
At my place, just you and me

See, I'll run away, girl if you tell me that I'm just not your type
(That I'm just not your type)
Then I'm gone, bye-bye baby
'Cause I wanna be with you the whole night through
All you gotta do is trust in me, baby please
You might also like
I promise you'll get the best of me
And I promise you'll get all of me
You know, all you gotta do is, uh
Give me a chance and I promise you won't cry no more
So what should I do?

Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for us to get to know each other
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for us to get to know each other
At my place, just you and me

I promise you'll get the best of me (You'll get the best of me)
And I promise you'll get all of me (Ooh, yes, you will)
Ooh, take my time
(Baby, just take, baby, just take my time, yes I will, yes I will)

Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be outta place for us to get to know each other
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for you and I to get together
At my place, just you and me
Would it be out of place for us to get to know each other
