How you doin', love?
I have a few things on my mind that I would like to discuss with you
It's been hurtin' me inside
Let me just tell you like this

Seems so long, but it was just last night
I held you close to me
But when you're not with me, time just passes by
Until the next time you are by my side, baby

And when the time comes, girl, I'm gonna hold ya
Wrap you up real tight into my arms, yeah
Tenderly I'll touch you til you'll feel all my emotions
And I'll never let go, never let go, till I have your heart

Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking you higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking you higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go

Now, baby, that the time is near, moments go by slow
And every minute, minute of the hour
I think of you, and how I love you so
You might also like
When the time comes, girl, I'm gonna love ya
Wrap you up real tight into my arms
Tenderly I'll kiss you, till you feel all my emotions
And I'll never let go, never let go, till I have your heart

Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking you higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking you higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go

You know, baby, there's so many things that I wanna say
But instead of saying 'em in words let me show you
Let's dance!

Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go

Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go

Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
(Always) All the way, never let go, never let go
Lovin' you down, lovin' you down, taking higher
