Somebody's been easin' in
Everytime you paint the town, drunk on women again
While you holed with the hare and run with the hound
Somebody's tearin' your dog house down
All the while you've been steppin' out
Somebody's been easin' in
Well, e're'ody knows you' runnin' 'round
Pissin' up every bowl in town
Then you run yourself to ruin
Without the left hand knowin' what the right hands doin'
When you're walkin' down the street in your brand new suit
At ol' little chiken done flown the coop
Cause all the while you've been steppin' out
Somebody's easin' in
All the while you've been steppin' out
Somebody's been easin' in
Everytime you paint the town, drunk on women again
While you holed with the hare and run with the hound
Somebody's tearin' your dog house down
All the while you've been steppin' out
Somebody's been easin' in

Ain't a woman I've met wouldn' let ya go
If you find yourself just a hang your head
You'll find another man's pants hanging in your bed
Well, I told you twice and I'll say it again
You best stop doin' what it is you've been
