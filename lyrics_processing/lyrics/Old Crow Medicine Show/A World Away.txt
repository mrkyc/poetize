I got money in my pocket and I Brought a nice bottle of wine
I think I'm on the list, do you see my name there?
I've come a long hard way and I'm lookin' for a better time
Oh well I tried to get over and I tried to get across
Now I'm standin' at the door but the door is locked
I can see those pretty gals dosey-doe
I can hear that music from the radio
I'm a world away
I'm a world away
Standin' at the gates
And I see her face
But I'm a world away
Hey it's a real nice place, do you need some help here?
I can sweep, I can paint, I can play a little violin
If you let me stay, oh you won't need to worry
I'll be the life of the party if you just let me slip on in
Oh girl I wade through the river and I marched through the sand
Now I standin' at the gates of the Promised Land
Oh but you say that you gotta leave 'em locked up tight
If you please, mister, I can sleep out here tonight
I'm a world away
I'm a world away
Standin' at the gates
With my suitcase
But I'm a world away

Kept in  and almost left for dead
I got a needle streakin' in my veins
I've come to 
I'm a world away, right outside your window
I got money in my pocket and I Brought a nice bottle of wine
I think I'm on the list, do you see my name there?
I've come a long hard way and I'm lookin' for a better time
I'm a world away
I'm a world away
Standin' at the gates
With my suitcase
But I'm a world away
I'm a world away
Standin' at the gates
With my suitcase
