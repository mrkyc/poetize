I'll show you a castle turn into sand
For we rise and we fall, and we crash on the coastlines
Only our love will last 'til the end
Fortune is fleeting, time is deceiving
Our bodies are weak and they turn into dust
Though follow blindly but love is like lightning
Strikes only one time and ain't it enough?
Ain't it enough to live by the ways of the world
To be part of the picture, whatever it's worth?
Throw your arms around each other and love one another
For it's only one life that we've got and ain't it enough?
Surely all people are made for each other
To join in together when the days turn to dust
So let the prison walls crumble, and the borders all tumble
There is a place for us all here and ain't it enough?
Ain't it enough to live by the ways of the world
To be part of the picture, whatever it's worth?
Throw your arms around each other and love one another
For it's only one life that we've got and ain't it enough?
Late in the evening, feeling the wind blow
Talk through the treetops, warm in the sun
Lying beside you, watching the moon rise
If that's all there is, babe, ain't it enough?

The stars just like diamonds all shining above
Where the heavens are beaming and all the world's dreaming
Peace everlasting and ain't it enough?
Ain't it enough to live by the ways of the world
To be part of the picture, whatever its worth?
Throw your arms around each other and love one another
For it's only one life that we've got and ain't it enough?
