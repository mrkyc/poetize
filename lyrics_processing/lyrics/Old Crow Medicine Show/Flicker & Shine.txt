Young and running wild
I've played with the fire that burns
And I'll live on the highway until I die
I'm living on borrowed time
Right up to the end of the line
But every light that flickers and shines
Will come together in the glory time
All together
We fall together
We ride together
We wild together
Yes, all together
We fall together
Every little light will flicker and shine
Well I drank the river dry
And I rolled the stars from the sky
I made a deal with the devil's wife
Got to live on the highway til I die
I know the time is nigh
And narrow is the way
But every light that flickers and shines
Will brighten up the darkest days
