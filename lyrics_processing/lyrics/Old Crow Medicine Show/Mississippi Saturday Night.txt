From up in Clarksdale
Shot his brother with a pop, pop, pop
Spent 20 yrs of hard time, before he saw the light
Now he's preaching on the corner of a Mississippi Saturday night
Drop by the pawn shop by the motel
Dream all you want, you ain't goin nowhere
Ohh ladies in the juke joint are lookin for a fight
Hell, they'll hunt you like a rabbit on a Mississippi Saturday night
Oh, Vicksburg, Natchez down to Crescent City
Gulf Coast blues, oh it sure is a pity
Don't make a lot of money
Baby that's alright
Cuz we make a lot of lovin' on a Mississippi Saturday night
Oh Mr. Semo
From? (City in Mississippi)
He's having coffee with your mama and your papa
If you're messin with his daughter
You better treat her right
Ohhh treat you like a possum on a mississippi saturday night
Oh, Vicksburg, Natchez down to Crescent City
Gulf Coast blues, oh it sure is a pity
Don't make a lot of money
Baby that's alright
Cuz we make a lot of lovin' on a Mississippi Saturday night

Out by the Walmart
Park on the levee, drinking 40's in the Skylark
People on the river, hopin' for a fight
Whole mess of catfish cookin' on a Mississippi Saturday night
Oh Mr. Hayworth
Sings like a jay bird
More like a jail bird inside a FEMA trailer
He's gonna need a pirogue, the water's getting high
Or you'll be sleeping in the river on a Mississippi Saturday night
Oh, Vicksburg, Natchez down to Crescent City
Gulf Coast blues, oh it sure is a pity
Don't make a lot of money
Baby that's alright
Cuz we make a lot of lovin' on a Mississippi Saturday
Oh, Vicksburg, Natchez down to Crescent City
Gulf Coast blues, oh it sure is a pity
Don't make a lot of money
Baby that's alright
Cuz we make a lot of lovin' on a Mississippi Saturday night
