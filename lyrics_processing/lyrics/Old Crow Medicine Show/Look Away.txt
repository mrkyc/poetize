To my tin roof shanty by the railroad sign where the whistle blows for days
Where the mountains bare the face, of an injun brave
And the green fields fade such a beautiful gray
Look away, look away
Hear the homeward call of the mockingbird
Gone to town just like a banjo ringin' from a dime store curb
See the sign on the cross, sayin' "Brother ain't you heard?"
That this is the land where salvation ain't a dirty word
Cold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money
Oh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?
Been lovin' you down through the years
Even on the darkest days
Look away, look away
I'm goin' where the cotton grows in rows of snowy bales
Where a man and a mule don't look much different to the boss man's scale
Where the long leaf pine hide a secret place
That everybody knows what it looks like but can't nobody see
Cold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money
Oh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?
Keep lovin' you down through the years
Even on the darkest days
I look away, I look away
To that  around the sun still spinnin' and shinin' over the Lee Highway
I look away, I look away, Dixieland

To my old homestead where the lights I trimmed and burnin' 'til day
Where the singin' river flows, and it knows every name
Of a thousand years of footsteps chasin' its wide domain
Cold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money
Oh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?
Keep lovin' you down through the years
Even on the darkest days
I look away, I look away
To that  around the sun still spinnin' and shinin' over the Lee Highway
