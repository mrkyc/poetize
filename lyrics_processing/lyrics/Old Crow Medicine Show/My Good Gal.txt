Tossed me round
Slandered my name all over town
My good gal ain't no good to me
She makes true love more like misery
I'm walkin' hunched
I get drunk a bunch
Sucker up and take a punch
My good gal ain't no good to me
N' I think I've acted reasonably
But I miss her....... mmmhhm
Last time I kissed her........ mmmhhmm
She sure tasted sweet
Like spoiled meat
And other's breath, you're so discreet
My good gal ain't no good to me
Oh no, no, no, no, no
She can powder her nose
'Til the bars are closed
Waitin' in the parking lot, where'd she go
My good gal ain't no good to me
Mama tell me how could this be...

All that I wish from her...mmmhhm
Is the time of day
Don't go out of your way
Just leave me with a stack of them bills to pay
My good gal ain't no good to me
She's supposed to have the courtesy
To shut the door
When she's been playin a whore
Pick his fuckin' rags up off the floor
My good gal ain't no good to me
And I only wish that she could see...
That I miss her......mmmhhmm
(one time through chord progression to let David pick away)
But I miss her.... mmmhhmm
All I have is a picture.... of her
Taken years ago
I was a kid you know
We were leaned up against that El Dorado
My good gal ain't no good to me
She robbed me of my liberty
Tonight I drove her out of town
Then I pushed her down
And I shot her brains onto the cold clay ground
My good gal ain't no good to me
Not even in my memory
