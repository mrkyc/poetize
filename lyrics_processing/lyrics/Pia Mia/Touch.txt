I'm lying in this hotel
Cuddling up to the body pillow
I'm trying not to call you
Cause I don't want to miss you no more, oh

Every now and then I get a little lonely
I can hold myself, but no, it's not the same thing
Need to feel the pressure somewhere on my body
On my body, oh

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me
So touch me
So touch me

I can't get to sleep
Damn, oh damn, I'm trying now
Oh, I put on the TV right here
Maybe it'll calm me down, oh
You might also like
Every now and then I get a little lonely
I can hold myself, but no, it's not the same thing
Need to feel the pressure somewhere on my body
On my body, oh

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me
So touch me
So touch me

All I want, all I want
All I want to do is be touched by you
If you want, if you want
If you want it too, tell me the truth
All I want, all I want
All I want to do is be touched by you
And if you want it too (touch me, baby) just touch me

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
(Oh, so touch me)
Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
(So touch me)
So touch me
Oh, come closer, baby
Oh, come closer, baby
Oh, come closer, baby
