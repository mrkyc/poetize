Back and forth, spin your tongue round and round
Kiss up on me 'til I make that sound
Back that up on you, make daddy proud
You make me feel like, this can't be real life

I know what you really like, I know what you really need
So many tricks on you sleeves, all your really need is me
I know what you really like, I know what you really need
Keep you satisfied, change you place of mind
I've been watchin' every single thing that you do
All eyes on you
Don't worry 'bout nothin', boy, just meet me in my room
You've been payin' all your dues
So let me treat your body right, give you that ooh-ooh
Give you that ooh-ooh, woah

Drink some wine and she pop a xanny
Go crazy, crazy when she off the candy
And it come in handy
Roll some tree up and I'm sippin' Brandy
