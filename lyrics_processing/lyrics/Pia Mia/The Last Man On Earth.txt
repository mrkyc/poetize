A first kiss standing on the pier
My heart raced, you made time stand still
I'd let the stars fall down as long as I had you
Carved our names into the sand
As you took my dreams in your hands
I'd never find another who could fill your shoes

Through all the wrongs and our mistakes
Through all the rumors that we face
When everyone has turned their backs
My first love will be my last

You're gonna be the last man on earth
Through the storm, we'll make it work
No other one will have my heart quite like you
Uh-oh, oh oh oh
It's gonna be you by my side
Promise me you'll never say goodbye
Till the end, you will be first
The last man on earth

Don't want the voice of someone else
Telling me they'd catch me if I fell
Cause in your arms you make the others fade to black
How you brush your fingers through my hair
How you wipe away my every tear
Can't teach another how to love me like that
You might also like
Through all the wrongs and our mistakes
Through all the rumors that we face
When everyone has turned their back
My first love will be my last, oh!

You're gonna be the last man on earth
Through the storm we'll make it work
No other one will have my heart quite like you
Uh-oh, oh oh oh
It's gonna be you by my side
Promise me you'll never say goodbye
Till the end, you will be first
The last man on earth

Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
The last man on earth

Just you and me
That's how it's supposed to be
When everyone has turned their backs
My first love will be my last
You're gonna be the last man on earth
Through the storm we'll make it work
No other one will have my heart quite like you
Uh-oh, oh oh oh
It's gonna be you by my side
Promise me you'll never say goodbye
Till the end, you will be first
The last man on earth

Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
Whoa whoa whoa, the last man on earth
The last man on earth
