They say I'm pretty, they say I'm flyer than ever

They say I'm cool, they say I set all the trends
All of my friends think they're tens
They say I'm perfect, I think I'm not
They say I'm gangster, they say I'm pop
They say I'm tryna be something I'm not
One thing I know is they sure say a lot

And if only they knew
I was less like that, and more like you
If only you knew (If only you knew)
I'm just misunderstood (What?)
I'm out here just going the best that I could
Just misundertood (Let's go)
