I didn't know bodies move that way
Big booty bump, make a straight girl (ay)
Ass-tronauts have a real good day
'Cause you can see that thang up in outer space

So pop it, pop it
Turn around and baby drop it, drop it
Show mama that you got it, got it
I'm hella dizzy like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I didn't know you could drop this flow
Big booty butt, and I got front row
Bite it off, make my head spiral
Ride the rope like a rodeo

So pop it, pop it
Turn around and baby drop it, drop it
Show mama that you got it, got it
I'm hella dizzy like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
