We should be together
We should be together

You should be with me in the shade
With a breeze, blowin' free, life is easy for right now
And I should be with you in the bed, super cool
Ain't no room for the bullshit for right now

Yeah, we should be together
(We should be together)
Yeah, we should be together right now
(Oh)
Yeah, we should be together
(We should be together)
Yeah, we should be together right now
(We should be together)
Right now
(We should be together)

More money, more problems
Another day, another dollar
Every minute of every hour
You need a break from all that, get away from all that
Take a moment, take a shower
Take a shot of this fluid and get into it
You might also like
I ain't worried 'bout the whole world
I just wanna be your world
All I'm really sayin' is...

You should be with me in the shade

(Oh)

No friends, no phone
Just a little sex with the Netflix on
We ain't worried if tomorrow gon' come
We escape from all that, take a break from all that
No limits, no laws
Take a sip of this fluid and get into it
We ain't worried 'bout the whole world
Too caught up with being your world
All I'm really sayin' is...
You should be with me in the shade
With a breeze, blowin' free, life is easy for right now
And I should be with you in the bed, super cool
Ain't no room for the bullshit for right now

Nothing could be better than my here and now
Make it last forever, baby, wear it out
We got a little crazy
You can blame it on the Jack, I'll be blaming the Jamie, I
All I want to do is let it go and get it in with you

We ain't worried 'bout the whole world
Too caught up with being your world
All I'm really sayin' is...
You should be with me in the shade
With a breeze, blowin' free, life is easy for right now
And I should be with you in the bed, super cool
Ain't no room for the bullshit for right now
