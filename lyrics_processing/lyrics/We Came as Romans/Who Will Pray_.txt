We share our days
Together now the sun is gone
Am I another left here on my own, alone?
And I'm slowly sinking

Scared to say
What I'm feeling is the truth
I need to face reality
I choose to use to trick myself again into thinking

Short of breath and pulse erratic
The weight on my chest inciting panic

If I start to fade, gone without a trace
Who will pray for me tomorrow?
If I fall too far, disappear in the dark
Who will pray for me tomorrow?

Who will pray for me?
Who will? Pray for me
Who will? Pray for me
You might also like
The light to guide me back
It flickered 'til it's gone, but I know that
Its not the only one to shine this bright
And bring me back home
Cause nothing here gets easier
To keep on moving through the worst
Keep your head up through the hurt
Remember to be more than words

Short of breath and pulse eratic
I'll break away before I'm damaged

If I start to fade, gone without a trace
Who will pray for me tomorrow?
If I fall too far, disappear in the dark
Who will pray for me tomorrow?

Who will pray for me?
Who will? Pray for me
Who will? Pray for me
Who will? Pray for me
Who will pray for me?
We share our days
Together now the sun is gone am I
Another left here on my own alone
And I'm slowly sinking

If I start to fade, gone without a trace
Who will pray for me tomorrow?
If I fall too far, disappear in the dark
Who will pray for me tomorrow?

Who will pray for me?
Who will pray for me?
Who will pray for me?
Who will pray for me tomorrow?
Who will? Pray for me
Who will? Pray for me
Who will? Pray for me
