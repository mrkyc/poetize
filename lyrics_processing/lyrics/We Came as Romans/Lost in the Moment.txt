Am I drifting through existence?
Is my life just passing by?
With the ever-growing distance
Am I leaving me behind?

Like a part of my past trapped in the hour glass
That will never break
That will never break
Will I breathe again
And let the colors in, surrounding me?

I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide, breathing new life
I wanna let go of the burden
With my eyes wide for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, woah

We've been drifting through existence
Cause we're trapped behind our eyes
We're to blame for our indifference
When nobody questions why
You might also like
Like a part of my past trapped in the hour glass
That will never break
That will never break
Stuck in black and white
Drowned in old headlines
That nobody will read

I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide, breathing new life
I wanna let go of the burden
With my eyes wide for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, woah

I won't be caught in the hands of time
I won't be caught in the hands of time

I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment
Lost in the moment
I wanna live lost in the moment
I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide open with a new life
I wanna let go of the burning
With my eyes wide open for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Yeah lost, lost in the moment again
Lost in the moment again

I won't be caught in the hands of time
