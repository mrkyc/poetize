Am I still breathing?
I've stumbled over every obstacle
That has come before me
But at least I made it past
I've been fumbling over every word I wanted to write
But I've put those insecurities in the past
It's so much easier to leave my mistakes behind me
If I acknowledge that I've made them (That I've made them)

Am I still breathing?
Then nothing is as bad as it seems
So just keep breathing, and keep calm, keep calm
The only real control we have is over ourselves
So let's get over it
That we can't and we won't control anything else
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
So why miss the memory of something (of something) that didn't exist?
Everything is all right, just keep calm, keep calm
But everything is all right, just keep calm, keep calm

Anything besides the way you live your life
Everything is all right
Just keep calm, just keep calm
