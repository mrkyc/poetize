My mistakes are easier made a second time
And I can't move on since I've closed my eyes
Since I've closed my eyes
I've cut off myself from everybody else
To move on is to grow
Yet I haven't been able to accomplish either
I know the way to go
Yet I can't bring myself to move forward
I've been sleeping on stones and they've formed to my spine
My once straight back, now a crooked line
I've broken no bones and I appear to be just fine
My life's been emptied from the inside
Every decision is easier made a second time
Every decision is easier made a second time
But once you start down one line
The distance becomes greater to change your mind
To change the way you're living your life
To move on is to grow
Yet we can barely accomplish either on our own
We know the way to go
Yet we follow those with their eyes closed
You might also likeI've been sleeping on stones...
We've been sleeping on stones and they've formed to our spines
Our once straight backs now just crooked lines
When we all wake up inside the beds in which we lie
We will wish we had stopped the first time
When we wake up to the lives that we've created
We'll see we built nothing, but destroyed it
So turn around and head back the way you came
I'll follow you, encourage you
I'll follow you, encourage you
We'll be steadfast in our way
And as we make it back to where our lives branched off
We will take the path we should have taken all along
Once you start down one line
The distance becomes greater to change your mind
To change the way you're living your life
