I'll tear it down
I'll tear it down

You've flown way too high
Way too close to the sun
Feel the burn that you're falling from above
Another tale of failed ambition
Greed and wealth feeding your addiction
What's it like to wear a crown of dirt
Selling all those lies with that stupid smirk
What's it like to live the life of greed
Buying everything that you want and please

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
You might also like
Your wings took you up
But you're selfish and you don't know when to stop
Dreams turned into failed ambition
Affluence fueling your dependence
What's it like to wear a rusted crown
When you know your name will never resound?
What's it like to be king for a day
When you know they won't even remember your face?

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime

You know you did this to yourself
Your only focus was on your wealth
Now you've flown too close to the sun
You're outgunned
Now I'm gonna bring you down
Overthrow the crown
Now I'm gonna bring you down
Overthrow the crown
Overthrow the crown

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
