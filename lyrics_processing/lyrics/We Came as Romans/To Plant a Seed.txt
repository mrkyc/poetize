An ever growing wonder to a beautiful tree
Grow
Each branch outstretched and different from the last, from the last
Where the old have broken arms some easier than the last
The right ones have grown in to fill in the gaps
And all are equal in love and trust
And all are a part of something so much bigger than this
Through the trials our tongues are tied
To trying times, so many unsaid lines, so many unsaid lies
Our lives were over at so many moments, so many moments
And now they're all just beginning
And now they're all just beginning
Our lives were over at so many moments
I have never been so consumed and I have never loved it more
To be devoted to letting all see what it is to live in the love of others
To live in the love of my brothers
And spilling back all that anyone has ever spilled for me
To show that to those who have never seen
Four years ago we planted a seed
Found that foundation that we need
Strived for the perfect balance
To show love and show compassion

When we are dead
And our vision for this world will not die when we are dead
When we are dead, when we are dead
My future started with the first note that I ever played
The first note that was ever sang
My future started with the first note that I ever played
The first note that was ever sang
The first note that was ever sang
The first note that was ever sang
(When we started living with purpose and writing with meaning)
The first note that was ever sang
(This is what we were made for, every day I live this future)
The first note that was ever sang
