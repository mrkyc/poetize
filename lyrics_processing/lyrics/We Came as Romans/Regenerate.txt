Regenerate, regenerate this life
Regenerate, regenerate this life
We've returned to reclaim

On this unstable ground we're laying faces down
In a world that's sinking
Our faith is put in the stars, not in each other's hearts
In this world that's sinking

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own Hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together
We will regroup
Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change
You might also like
We're searching for a cure
Cause our world is drowning
We're quick to guard our hearts
Forget we share our scars
In this world that's drowning

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own Hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together
We will regroup
Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

Why condemn when you can confide?
Why condemn when you can confide?
You're all just too busy picking a side
Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, we will change this life
Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, regenerate this life
Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, regenerate this life
To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together
We will regroup
Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

Regenerate, regenerate this life
Regenerate, regenerate
