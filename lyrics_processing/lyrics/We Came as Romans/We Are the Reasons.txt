It runs through my rivers
Created and cured by the same, and it will flow
Tear through these holds, and rip away my heart
With an effort so constrained, this is the venom in my veins
This is the venom in my veins, created and cured by the same
This is the venom in my veins. (I've spoken reckless words?)
And I know I've built a bed of unrest
That destroys my heart once I lay my head down
Destroys the crutches that I've built
I thought they were sound
We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness
It will flow from my body to yours, an infection that can't be cured
We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness
We will tear through these holds
We will tear through these holds or we will keep them strong
We are the reasons for health and light
For illness and weakness, we will tear through these holds
Or we will keep them strong
We will keep them strong
With an effort so constrained, this is venom in my veins
Created, cured by the same
By the same
I've chosen selfless over selfishness
I've left a bed of disgust and unrest
You might also likeDestroyed the crutches that I built myself, I found that they were never sound
It won't consume my heart anymore
And I know I've built a bed of peace
That restores my heart once I lay my head down
Rebuilds the crutches that I destroyed myself
I plead to change my life, just before I dream
And wake to realize that change is inside me
We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness
We will tear through these holds
We will tear through these holds or we will keep them strong
