My body shivers at the thought of getting up
My heart is starting to accept that I am giving up
No strength left
Is it over yet?
Am I thinking with my heart or with my head?
Through distance, you remind me that
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me go!

So hold me close and never let me, never let me go
At my lowest of lows, when I need you the most
If our lives reversed, it's you who's falling, it's you who's falling first
I will hold you close, I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go

My hands welcome yours as you begin to see me
My heart is starting to accept your rescue completely
This new life that you placed in my heart
I hope that I will make it through to you
And in my steps you will follow behind, oh
Don't let me go!

So hold me close and never let me, never let me go
At my lowest of lows, when I need you the most
If our lives reversed, it's you who's falling, it's you who's falling first
I will hold you close
I will never let you go
You might also like
And if our lives reversed
It's you falling first
I will hold you close
I'll never let you go
And if our lives reversed
It's you falling first
I will hold you close
I'll never let you go

So hold me close and never let me, never let me go
At my lowest of lows, when I need you the most
If our lives reversed, it's you who's falling, it's you who's falling first
I will hold you close, I will never let you go
I will never let you go
