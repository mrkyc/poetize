Were too bright to see the spark
That I've been missing for too long
Something I've been missing for too long
My empty cup
Could never fill another
I have spilled all I've had
To make things better
But the love of all others
Has made me new
My empty cup
Could never (because of you) fill another
(I am made new) I have spilled all I've had
(because of you) to make things better (I am made new)
We've all been broken
So let us make each other new
We've all been broken
So let us make each other new
I've died inside every time I tried
To lie to myself about feeling alive, alive
(I've died)
I've died inside every time I tried
To lie to myself about feeling alive, alive
(I've died)

Were too bright to see the spark
That I've been missing for too long
Something I've been missing for too long
All these distractions
Kept me from seeing what I needed all along
An understanding
I am speechless tonight
As I stare into the sky
I feel endless compassion, forgiveness, and love
I feel everyone who is looking up sharing this
I feel unexplainably alive
I need to understand what we've grown to be
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
