Taking every comfort from me, leaving stones under my back
With a tongue that burns like yours and still a voice so bitter cold
Now I know, yeah now I know
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I can breathe, I can breathe, I can breathe
Now I can breathe in, now I can breathe in
To say I'm losing sleep is to assume I ever slept
Taking every comfort from me, leaving stones under my back
With a tongue that burns like yours and still a voice so bitter cold
Now I know, yeah now I know
I can breathe in, I can breathe in
I wish it was harder to watch you leave
The time that we spent never bought a thing
I can breathe in and finally let you go
I can breathe in and finally let you go
(I was trying, I was trying)
I was trying to breathe underwater
Just like two hands that can't hold each other
I was trying to breathe underwater
Like two hands that can't hold each other
So now your tide crashes harder
Surrounding my neck like a noose
It feels so much better to give up when you accept that you have nothing left to lose
You might also likeI'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I can breathe, I can breathe, I can breathe
Now I can breathe in, now I can breathe in
I wish it was harder to watch you leave
The time that we spent never bought a thing
I can breathe in and finally let you go
I can breathe in and finally let you go
I can breathe in and finally let you go
