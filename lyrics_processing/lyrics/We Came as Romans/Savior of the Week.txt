Oh-oh-oh-ahh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-ahh-oh

What's the addiction here?
Your taste for the insincere
Disposable high and you keep on wanting more
The world's at your fingertips but you can't get enough of it
Disposable high that you just can't ignore

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wondering...

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breathe the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
'Til the next one shows up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

They're all replaceable in your head you chase the whole Illusion that they give you all that you need
But you're never satisfied empty and lost inside
You'll come to find it's all temporary

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wondering...

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breathe the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
'Til the next one shows up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

Savior...
Savior...
Savior...

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breathe the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
'Til the next one shows up, up
You gotta be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be, who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be, who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior
Who's gonna be the one, one
