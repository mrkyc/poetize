I won't fade away

Like a flame burnt out
You're a shadow of yourself
A memory blacked out
The bridge has been burned down
Less is learned in time
When you fade to the background
Will you take my hand?
We will walk this road
We can change the map
I won't fade away
I know you've been hurt
But I will swear to stay

I can be your strength
To find your way back home

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away
You might also like
Like a thought recalled
Picked up when we fall
Held fast through it all
All these wars with you
Learned to make it through
You know our hearts are true
Now don't look to the past
Leave the thoughts you had
Those words and things you've planned
We won't fade again
We're all broken
We'll make it in the end

I can be your strength
To find your way back home

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away
Rise higher
Your mind is an echo
Your mind is an echo
Shine brighter
Get out of the shadows
Get out of the shadows
I won't fade away

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away

I won't fade away
