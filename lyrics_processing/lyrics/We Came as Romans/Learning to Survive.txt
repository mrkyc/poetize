I was blind to the darkness in everyone I know
Woah-oh-oh
Always looked for the good or the best intent
After years that have passed I see all the signs I missed
Woah-oh-oh
And it feels like a prison I'm living in
Did I earn all the pain in the consequence?
I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict
The weight of my pride caving in
I can feel them watching me while I'm learning to survive
Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide
So many demons I can't escape, burning my bridges to light the way
I can feel them watching me but I'll make it out alive
I'm learning to survive
Here I am wide awake, no I'm not dead yet
And I'm not as confused as I know I was back then
Whoa-oh
And it feels like a prison I'm living in
Did I earn all the pain in the consequence?
I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict
(I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict)
The weight of my pride caving in
(The weight of my pride caving in)

Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide
So many demons I can't escape, burning my bridges to light the way
I can feel them watching me but I'll make it out alive
I'm learning to survive
I'm letting go of my shame, that unbearable weight
I'm learning to survive
I'm letting go of the blame from my selfish mistakes
I'm learning to survive
With new eyes, with new eyes
It was the only way that I've forgiven me
