You got me thinking it's over, so hear me out

That look you have says it all without a single word
Years of calling out but not a thing was heard
We're holding on because it's all we know
We're just holding on to say we didn't let go

Go on and say it
We've known for so long that this was over
I need to hear it
Your silence is the sound of closure
Hear me out

You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

The words you said show a side of you I haven't seen
Years of looking past what was in front of me
You're just holding on cause you can't let it show
You're just holding on cause you're too proud to let go
You might also like
Go on and say it
We've known for so long that this was over
You need to hear it
The sound of closure

You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
The sound of closure in the discord
Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
Yeah

Are you listening now?
Can you hear the sound?
You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

You got me thinking it's over so hear me out
Your silence is the sound of closure
You got me thinking it's over so hear me out
