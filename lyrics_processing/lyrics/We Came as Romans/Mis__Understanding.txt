This world I've held so close to my heart
Is all against me now
And it wears, and it breaks
And it brings me down, so low, down so low
It wears me down, down to my bones
Straight through my skin
It wears me down, down to my bones
Wearing away until I'm nothing
Am I not understanding this now?
This world I've held so close to my heart
Is now more broken than ever
And I tried compassion and to love every other
I've tried forgiveness and to hold on close to my brothers
And look at where its left us did I ever understand enough?
Did all my words fall on deaf ears?
Was what I wrote only shown to closed eyes?
Have you ever felt like you did everything right
And it still all went wrong?
Am I not understanding this now?
This world I've held so close to my heart
Is now more broken than ever
And I tried compassion and to love every other
I've tried forgiveness and to hold on close to my brothers
And look at where its left us did I ever understand enough?

I'm not sure she was meant to be mine
Six years ago I married a bride
I'm not sure she was meant to be mine
So unsure of everything
So unsure of everything
I live in the marriage of life and love
But was I mistaken all along?
Have you ever felt like you did everything right
But it still all went wrong?
So here I am filled with doubt
Understanding with love will be my only way out
Don't give up on me because it might take days
Take comfort in me if you feel the same, feel the same
Don't give up on me, don't give up on me
Take comfort in me, take comfort in me
We need to fix ourselves
And make right all our mistakes
(It's all we can do)
It's all we can do
It's all I can do
