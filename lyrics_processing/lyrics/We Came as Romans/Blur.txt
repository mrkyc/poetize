I always saw you as something else
It looks like my eyes played a trick on themselves
But a careless hand and misguided shade
They erased the image of the life we made
I was set on you but you had to shift
Mistakenly you had your flaws burnt in
And it covers me till I fade to black
Unraveling the film of the life we had
Your black light was too bright but now I can see

Oh, I feel overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now it's just a blur
You got me feeling like oh, oh oh, oh oh, so overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now I know that it's out of focus, cause you're just a blur

You always saw me as something less
The trust that you had, snapped in a flash
Cause that careless hand and your filtered faith
They removed me from the center of the frame
So I let it go and we both move on
There was no contrast, just black and white
Now we leave our past kept unrestored
Just old photographs with the edges worn
You might also like
Oh, I feel overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now it's just a blur
You got me feeling like oh, oh oh, oh oh, so overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now I know that it's out of focus, cause you're just a blur

Oh, oh

Oh, I feel overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now it's just a blur
You got me feeling like oh, oh oh, oh oh, so overexposed
Our picture was perfect but now I know that it's out of focus, cause you're just a blur

Cause you're just, cause you're just, cause you're just a blur
Cause you're just, cause you're just, cause you're just a blur
You got me feeling like oh, oh oh, oh oh, so overexposed
