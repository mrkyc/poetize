The years I'll never forget
Good and bad all the same
Every hardship we met
And dreams we got to create
The life I've chosen is true through all the borders between
And we'll share the view even if there's nothing to see
Nothing to see

We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
I can feel it taking over, new ambition, though I'm older
We were so young, we were so vivid

We cut the arrogance from each others lives
Keep our feet on the ground, kill the ego inside
The life we've chosen is true since we were seventeen
And we'll share the view even if there's nothing to see

We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
I can feel it taking over, new ambition, though I'm older
I can feel it taking over, even when there was nothing to see

And it leaves me in awe, twelve years this summer
No matter Heaven or Hell, forever my brothers
And it leaves me in awe, twelve years this summer
(I fought my way through blinding lights to see my path again)
No matter Heaven or Hell, forever my brothers
(Our vision for this world will not die when we are dead)
I fought my way through blinding lights to see my path again
Our vision for this world will not die when we are dead

When we are dead
When we are dead
I'll be there to share the view
I'll be there to share the view even if there's nothing to see

We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
(Even when there was nothing to see)
