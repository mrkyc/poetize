You had it up to here
You finally hit the wall
All the things I shoulda done right
I did 'em all wrong
Not changin' my ways, stayin' out late
Spinnin' out of control
I tried to fix us, but the problem was
You were already gone, yeah

And I watched your car turn up the gravel down the driveway
With a middle finger up to me and this town
Now I'm stuck here knowin' that I'll never get it my way
'Cause I lit a match and burned my last chance out
Now you're livin' it up, livin' it up
And I'll never live it down, yeah

Drove as far as you could go
'Til them tires hit the sand
Lookin' Gucci now, little less small town
With a drink up in your hand
Lookin' right at home in a new time zone
Showin' off that west coast tan
I'm all alone, scrollin' through my phone
Been livin' through your Instagram, yeah
