Yeah my momma saw your momma down in MAPCO
Said you moved to Tupelo a couple months ago
She said you loved it and you won't come back
If I'm being honest girl I hate to hear that
Somebody told somebody that you got a new man
I'd love to tune it out but I can't

'Cause this town likes to run its mouth
About how you're all in love and doing better now
This town is hard to drive around
When your memory's on every street I'm driving down
As long as I'm inside these county lines
I hear your name brought up a thousand times
Girl it's hard to move on
When this town loves to talk

Yeah I remember when you said that you'd never leave
You're sitting next to me in this Chevy seat
I guess the joke is on me now
Yeah that's the rumor going round 'cause

This town likes to run its mouth
About how you're all in love and doing better now
This town is hard to drive around
When your memory's on every street I'm driving down
As long as I'm inside these county lines
I hear your name brought up a thousand times
Girl it's hard to move on
When this town loves to talk
You might also like
Even though you've been gone for a minute
This town still got you in it

This town likes to run its mouth
About how you're all in love and doing better now
This town is hard to drive around
When your memory's on every street I'm driving down
As long as I'm inside these county lines
I hear your name brought up a thousand times
Girl it's hard to move on
When this town loves to talk
Yeah girl it's hard to move on
When this town loves to talk
