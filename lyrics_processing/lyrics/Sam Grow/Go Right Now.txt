Just a kid learning how to fish
On the banks of the river
Old man with a cricket in his hand
Teaching me how to stick her
Just once I wish his old watch
Would fall out in the water
'Cause that sun was going down
And Moday's rolling 'round

Dad, why we gotta go right now?
Can't we just stay a little longer?
So much we could talk about
Wishing this day could stretch a little farther
Yeah, I know we gotta go
But why we gotta go right now?
Can't we stick around?
Or maybe slow it down
Dad, why we gotta go right now?

Five speed F-150
Smelling them gears burning
He was shotgun riding, smiling and laughing
Knowing I was just learning
Yeah, that field knew them wheels
We tore it up without warning
Then we dropped the tailgate down
And shared our first round
He said, "Son watch your pouring
You still got school in the morning"

Man, why we gotta go right now?
Can't we just stay a little longer?
So much we could talk about
Wishing this day could stretch a little farther
Yeah, I know we gotta go
But why we gotta go right now?
Can't we stick around?
Or maybe slow it down
Dad, why we gotta go right now?

And I drove all night so I could be by his hospital bed
I made it just in time, he opened his eyes and I said

"Dad, why you gotta go right now?
Can't you just stay a little longer?
So much we could talk about
Wishing this day could stretch a little farther
Yeah, I know you gotta go
But why you gotta go right now?
Can't you stick around?
Just for me, maybe slow it down
Yeah, I know you're Heaven-bound
This ain't goodbye, it's see you 'round
Why you gotta go right now?
