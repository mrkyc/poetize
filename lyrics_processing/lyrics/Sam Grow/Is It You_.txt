A little southern drawl. Little how you doin little hey y'all
Little sun kissed thing with a belly ring
Calls me baby, sugar, honey, everything but my name
Pass the test with my mama. Ain't got time for no drama
Kick a beer back with my boys
I need a girl with an accent. Born and bred, southern fed, all of it tell me girl
Is it you looking so fine
Do your cherry lips taste like apple pie shine?
You're a dime on a sclale to 10
Ain't seen something so pretty since I dont know when
Its true with eyes that blue
Seeing all the all the things that I wanna do
And with a kiss or two we'll find out is it you?
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
I need a girl from the country
A sweet southern belle
A little bit of heaven
Who can raise some hell
A ride or die chick from the deep sticks
She dont take no bull. she dont take no shit
Had her feet in the mud. Been washed in the blood
Take a kick from a twelve guage
I need a girl with an accent. Born and bred, southern fed, all of it tell me girl
Is it you looking so fine
Do your cherry lips taste like apple pie shine?
You're a dime on a sclale to 10
Ain't seen something so pretty since I dont know when
Its true with eyes that blue
Seeing all the all the things that I wanna do
And with a kiss or two we'll find out is it you?
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Baby talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
Yeah talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
We'll find out
Is it you looking so fine
Do your cherry lips taste like apple pie shine?
You're a dime on a sclale to 10
Ain't seen something so pretty since I dont know when
Its true with eyes that blue
Seeing all the all the things that I wanna do
And with a kiss or two we'll find out is it you?
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
Woah oh ohhh oh
