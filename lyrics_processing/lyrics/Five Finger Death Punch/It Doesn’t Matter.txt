I've wasted a lot of time and effort
On motherfuckers like you
Now it's my turn
One, two, three, fuck you!
Fuck you!

You can't run away from anything that you have ever done
You're a victim to the system; you're a knife and I'm a gun
You wanna be a martyr, but you cannot take the pain
You're a voice without an echo, you're a droplet; I'm the rain

You want me to just turn the other cheek
Want me to admit that I am weak
Want me to submit
That ain't me, that ain't me

You're so self-righteous
And you're never gonna change
You're sick and spineless
You're the fake and I'm the fame

You can't convince me life is fair
'Cause you were never even there
In the end, it doesn't matter, matter at all
That's why I've never really cared
'Cause I was never really scared
In the end, it doesn't matter, matter, matter
No!

I wanna run away from everything I've ever said
It's hard to really care when everything I love is dead
Can't take away a single thing that I have ever done
I'm learning from the burning, and that's just half the fun

You want me to just turn the other cheek
Want me to admit that I am weak
Wanna wear the crown
Learn to bleed, learn to bleed

You're so self-righteous
And you're never gonna change
You're dead and lifeless
You're a pawn within the game

You can't convince me life is fair
'Cause you were never even there
In the end, it doesn't matter, matter at all
That's why I never really cared
'Cause I was never really scared
In the end, it doesn't matter, matter, matter
No!
Go!


You can't convince me life is fair
'Cause you were never even there
In the end, it doesn't matter, matter at all
That's why I never really cared
