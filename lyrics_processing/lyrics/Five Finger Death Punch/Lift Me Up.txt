It ain't no mystery I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back and runnin' you over
I've been thrown down, run around
Beaten till I hit the ground
I'm telling you right now that it's over
There's no room for mistakes, all the parts are in place
Say what you will, but say it to my face
Better back the fuck up, better shut the fuck up
I'll do what I want, and I'll never give up

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this, the flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
(Lift me up!)

I'm gonna change history, enlighten the world
Teach 'em how to see through my eyes
I'm gonna lash back, check that, fatal as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies
You can't convince me to change, we ain't on the same page
I've had my fill, now there's nothing but rage
Best get out of my way
'Cause there's nothing to say
Is that all that you got? Because I ain't got all day

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this, the flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
(Lift me up!)

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

(Lift me up!) To fly away
(Lift me up!) To fly away
