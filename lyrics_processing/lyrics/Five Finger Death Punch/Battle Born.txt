Once upon a time, I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know tore it all apart
Once upon a time, there was a part of me I shared
Years before they took away the part of me that cared

Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Every day, a castaway, a vagabond
Battle born

I'm battle born

Once upon a time, I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone?
Was there ever a time, and how would I have known?

Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Every day, a castaway, a vagabond
Battle born
