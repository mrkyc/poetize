Don't call it a comeback
I've been here for years
Rockin' my peers
Putting suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion (Explosion), overpowering
Over the competition, we're towering
Record? Shock, when I drop these lyrics
That'll make you call them cops (What?)
Don't you dare stare, you better move (Move)
Don't ever compare
Us to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition paying our price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Shadowboxing, when I heard you on the radio
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new toy
I'm going insane
Starting a hurricane releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name (A'ight)
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Past your soul

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
Breakdown!

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out (Yeah)
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Mama said knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Yeah!)
Mama said knock you out (What?)
