I never cared about the money, never really needed fame
You think it would've changed me, but I've always been the same
My label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to screw me
Blabbermouth can fuckin' suck it, 'cause they never fuckin' knew me
Everybody seems like they're waitin' for me to die
Talk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye
They say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded
Give a shit about it all because I love to be so hated

All in all, it's a good life
I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life
A toast to you now
It's all champagne (It's all sham pain)

I barely get to eat, and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face
Spread so fuckin' thin, I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus, I hate flyin' in the planes
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life, forgot the hope
The whole thing's turned into one big joke

All in all, it's a good life
I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life
A toast to you now
It's all champagne (It's all sham pain)


I mean no disrespect, but I ain't pickin' up the check
Takin' selfies on your phone while you're breathin' down my neck
It's gettin' pretty fuckin' old, and I'm almost nearly done
I'm glad that you were happy, here's another number one

I'm living the good life
A toast to you now
It's all champagne

All in all, it's a good life
I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life
A toast to you now
