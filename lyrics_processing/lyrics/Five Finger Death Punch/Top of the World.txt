I'm tired of bleeding for the ones that I love
Look to the heavens, but there's no one above
One day, you need me; the other, you hate
We've all got problems; I can fucking relate

I've tried my best to be humble
I've tried so hard to explain
I know that nothing is easy
Over and over
I know that all of it's my fault
I bring you nothing but pain
Look at the way that you treat me
That's why I'm insane

Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over

I'm sick of burning for the ones I despise
Have you mistaken me for some other guy?
One day, you love me; the other, you run
My life's a comedy; well, isn't this fun?

Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over


You know I'm living it up
Never giving a fuck
Heard you're down on your luck
I, I just want to take it
Living it up
Never giving a fuck
Never giving it up
I, I just want to break it
Down
Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over

Top of the world, living the dream
Wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world, living the dream
