There's just so much goddamn weight on my shoulders
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only gettin' colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

There's just so much goddamn weight on my shoulders
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only gettin' colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside
(Oh, yo, yo) I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

Is there just so much goddamn weight on your shoulders
That you can't just live your motherfuckin' life?
The story's gettin' old and my heart is gettin' colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fuckin' Hyde

You got rocks in your head, I can hear them rollin' 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always fallin' down
Is there a method to your madness? Is it all about pride?
Seems everyone I know, they got a demon inside

If I wasn't so deranged
Could I ever face the pain?
If I ever were to change
Would the song remain the same?
(Oh, yo, yo)
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
(Oh, yo, yo)
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
