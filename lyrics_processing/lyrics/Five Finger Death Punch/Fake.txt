This is the end, I can't take any more
This is where I'm fuckin' drawing the line
You talk a great game, trying to make a big name
Soon, you're gonna run out of time
I've got news for you: I got nothin' to lose
If you were smart, you'd simply run and you'd hide
You're such a dumb punk, such a fucking weak chump
Don't have the balls to look me dead in the eyes
Boom

You're a, you're a, you're a

You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat, but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake
You're a fuckin' fake

What's in a name, bitch? You truly make me so sick
Think about the shit that you say
You'll wish you never crossed me, you had me, then you lost me
You're losing all your bark when you beg
You've got a big mouth, makes me want to tear it out
Really don't have nothing to say
I'm not your scapegoat, ram it down your damn throat
For me, it's just another day

You're a, you're a, you're a

You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat, but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake
You're such a, you're such a
You're such a, you're such a fake
You're a fuckin' fake
You're such a fuckin' fake
You're just a fake, fake, fake, fake
You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat, but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake
You're a fuckin' fake
You're such a fuckin' fake
You're just a fake, fake, fake, fake
