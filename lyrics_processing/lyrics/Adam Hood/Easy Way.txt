I don't wanna add anything
To what's already been a long hard day
I just wanna take some pressure off ya
And get a little bit off your plate
You take care of a lot of stuff
Nobody seems to appreciate
Lord knows life can sure get tough
I think it's time we take the easy way

It's time to let the curtains down
Time to turn the TV off
You can get the glasses out
I'll put a good record on
It's time to stop and thank the Lord
For another beautiful day
Remember what we're put here for
And maybe try to head that way
It's time we take the easy way

We don't say it near enough
Where we used to say it every day
With your lipstick on my coffee cup
Or "I love ya" on a window pane
We tend to get ahead of ourselves
Drivin' in the passing lane
And we tried everything else
I think it's time we take the easy way
You might also like
It's time to let the curtains down
Time to turn the TV off
You can get the glasses out
I'll put a good record on
It's time to stop and thank the Lord
For another beautiful day
Remember what we're put here for
And maybe try to head that way
It's time we take the easy way

Well it's time to let the curtains down
Time to turn the TV off
Baby, you can get the glasses out
I'll put a good record on
It's time to stop and thank the Lord
For another beautiful day
Remember what we're put here for
And maybe try to head that way
It's time we take the easy way
It's time we take the easy way
It's time we take the easy way
