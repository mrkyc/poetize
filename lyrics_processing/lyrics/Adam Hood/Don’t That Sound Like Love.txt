When I'm trying to sleep late
Get to talking on the cellphone
Banging dishes in the sink
It's my first year at the top
And they make her work nights
So she can spend her whole paycheck
Just shopping online
Well all that opposition makes me tense
But every time I think about it
The more it makes sense
Don't that sound like love to you?
Ain't what people in love are supposed to do?
I tried to get mad but I know it's true
Don't that sound like love to you?
Ready for the weekend
Bring my buddies to the house
We cook the pig out in the back yard
And get the guitars out
We get to handing round the whiskey
It doesn't take long
She comes flying through the back door
Running everybody home
You might also likeAnd if I had any pride, I would be ashamed
But her daddy owns a trailer
So I don't complain
Don't that sound like love to you?
Ain't what people in love are supposed to do?
I've been trying to get mad
But I swear it's true
Don't that sound like love to you, baby?
I oughta pack up my shot gun
I oughta put in the wind
Moving in momma's basement
Where the party never ends
That girl's the mother to my children
And she's a really good friend
Well I haven't missed a payment
Since the day I moved in
And I'd rather live well
And just as well
Cause if I had to live it out
I'd be in jail
Don't that sound like love to you?
Ain't what people in love are supposed to do?
I tried to get mad but I know it's true
Don't that sound like love to you?
Ain't that how people in love are supposed to do?
I tried to get mad but I know it's true
