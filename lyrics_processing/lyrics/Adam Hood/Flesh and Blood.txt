Well, when I was fourteen, I picked up a guitar
Wrote a love song for my little sweetheart
Next thing you know I was rollin' down the highway
Goin' for broke, I was gonna be a star

It's hard to keep it in the road
Doin' what you're told
When you're just flesh and blood
Well, damn, I wasn't meant to live
Not like this
Nobody said it'd be a breeze
Still I never thought it'd be this hard

I spent a quarter of my lifetime burnin' up the pavement
It's a lot of fun when you're young and wild
But now I'm a daddy with a house and a payment
And the same temptations wearin' on my mind

It's hard to keep it in the road
Doin' what you're told
When you're just flesh and blood
Well, damn, I wasn't meant to live
Not like this
Nobody said it'd be a breeze
Still I never thought it'd be this hard
You might also like
Well, I wouldn't judge you
How you gonna judge me?
Ain't we all doin' the best we can?
We all walk our own path
I know where my heart's at
It's good to know God has a plan
I wouldn't judge you
How you gonna judge me?
Ain't we all doin' the best we can?
We all walk our own path
I know where my heart's at
It's good to know God has a plan

But it's hard to keep it in the road
Doin' what you're told
When you're just flesh and blood
Well, damn, I wasn't meant to live
Not like this
Nobody said it'd be a breeze
Still I never thought it'd be this
Hard to keep it in the road
Doin' what you're told
When you're just flesh and blood
Well, damn, I wasn't meant to live
Not like this
Nobody said it'd be a breeze
Still I never thought it'd be this hard
Well, I never thought it'd be this hard
