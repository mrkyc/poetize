I had a girl sweet as peaches, eyes as bright as the 'Bama beaches
Kissed me goodbye, left me speechless, she don't love me no more
I can draw from a dry well, I head down the lonesome trail
Lord I've figured what the hell, 'cause she don't love me no more

I can get down to Houston, I can get there by dawn
There's plenty of stuff in that city that gets somethin' good goin' on
And I wanna keep on comin', but she don't want me around
'Cause she stole my heart, killed my pride, but she can't put me in the ground
Naw it can't put me in the ground

Well my best friend since junior high, half as good lookin' and twice as wild
He and my sweetheart started makin' out, now she don't love me no more
Naw she don't love me no more

Well I can get down to Mobile, I can get there by 5:00
I got just enough money to get on with my life
Well I wanna keep on comin', but she don't want me around
'Cause she stole my heart, killed my pride, but she can't put me in the ground
Honey can't put me in the ground, naw

Well I can get down to Houston, I can get there by dawn
I got just enough money to get somethin' good goin' on
Well but I wanna keep on comin', if she don't want me around
Yeah she stole my heart, she killed my pride, but she can't put me in the ground
Well she can't put me in the ground
