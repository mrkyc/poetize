I don't wanna hear one more rap song
I don't wanna hear no dirty talkin' on the radio
All day long
I don't wanna hear any songs about Satan
I don't wanna hear any violent screams
How in the world can they call that music
When you're t-t-talkin' with a drum machine?
I wanna hear good old country music on the radio
I wanna hear lead guitar and a hot piano and an old banjo
I wanna hear people singing in sweet harmony
I wanna hear something that sounds like music to me
Well, I was driving around with my baby sittin' by my side
And on the radio came a song about suicide
I looked at her, she looked at me
I said, "We don't need this insanity"
So she flipped around for some variety
Checkin' out low and high society
When on came something that was nice and slow
Was a guy named Rabbitt and I said, "Whoa, don't touch that dial"
I wanna hear good old country music on the radio
I wanna hear lead guitar and a hot piano and an old banjo
I wanna hear people singing in sweet harmony
I wanna hear something that sounds like music to me
You might also likeNow there are those out there who would have you believe
That it's cool to be as bad as you wanna be
But as for me, what I'd rather hear
Something that sounds like music to my ears
I wanna hear good old country music on the radio
I wanna hear lead guitar and a hot piano and an old banjo
I wanna hear people singing in sweet harmony
I wanna hear something that sounds like music to me
I wanna hear good old American music on the radio
I wanna hear lead guitar and a hot piano and an old banjo
I wanna hear people singing in sweet harmony
I wanna hear something that sounds like music to me
I wanna hear something that sounds like music to me
None of my business what you listen to
It's up to you, it's a free country
I don't wanna hear any heavy metal
