Nobody can make me feel the way that I feel
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
And I know my baby's love for me is real
'Cause when I'm down she brings me round
She takes me where I need to be
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
Nobody can put that smile right back on my face
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
And my baby's love can't be replaced
And when I'm down she brings me 'round
She takes me where I need to be
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
Nobody can make me feel the way that I feel
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
And I know my baby's love for me is real
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
Nobody can put that smile right back on my face
Ain't nobody loves me like my baby
And my baby's love can't be replaced
