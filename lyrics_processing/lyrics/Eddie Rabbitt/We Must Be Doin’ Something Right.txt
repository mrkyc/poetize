We were barely out of school
And I learned what forever meant
When I fell in love with you
I put a ring on your finger
And we stumbled into life
We didn't know where we were going back then
Oh, but that was alright
We were just getting started
I was only seventeen
When I got my first job on the line
Oh, they worked me like a machine
But not one drop of my blood or my sweat
Or one day do I regret
I worked hard all my life
And this is as good as it gets
Chorus:
We must be, we must be doin' somethin' right
'Cause baby I'm still happy after all this time
You still bring out the best in me
And any fool could see, that you and me
O-o-oh, we must be, we must be doin' somethin' right
You might also likeAnd it's all so amazing
How the years go flyin' by
I look at my children growin' up
And I see myself in their eyes
And you still drive me crazy
And that old fire's burning bright
And yeah the guys still laugh at me
When I go rushin' home at night
Chorus:
We must be, we must be doin' somethin' right
'Cause baby I'm still happy after all this time
You still bring out the best in me
And any fool could see, that you and me
O-o-oh, we must be, we must be doin' somethin' right
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Chorus:
We must be, d-d-d-doin' somethin' right
'Cause baby I'm still happy after all this time
You still bring out the best in me
And any fool could see, that you and me
O-o-oh, we must be, d-d-d-doin' somethin' right
'Cause baby, baby I'm still happy after all this time
You still bring out the best in me
