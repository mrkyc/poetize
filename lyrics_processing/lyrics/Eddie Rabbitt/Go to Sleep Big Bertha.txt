Got a smile like the pure sunshine
She got style and grace and a pretty face
And a big, big, big behind
And when she sits around the house
I mean she sits around the house
But she's my gal and she's my pal
But she's plumb wearin' me out
I said, go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Pretty please, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more
Well, she likes to love a lot
And she's got a lot to love
Why, me and Bertha, we go together
Like a hand in a pair of gloves
I was short and fat when I met her
But now I'm tall and lean
Oh, good god, stop, don't get on top
Be the last you ever see of me
I said, go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Pretty please, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more

And a big, big, big behind
And when she sits around the house
Whoo, she sits around the house
Aw, but she's my gal and she's my pal
But she's plumb wearing me out
I said, go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more
Go to sleep, Big Bertha
Pretty please, Big Bertha
Go to sleep, Big Bertha, I don't wanna do it no more
