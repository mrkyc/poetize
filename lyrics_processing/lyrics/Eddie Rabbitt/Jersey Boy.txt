They settled in New Jersey, they bought a house with a big front porch
I went to school down on the corner
My old scout master taught me the guitar
I can still smell the autumn leaves burning in my old back yard
Oh I'm a Jersey Boy, Jersey Boy
From the Streets of old East Orange to the Jersey Shore, to the Palisades I'm a Jersey Boy
My first best friend was Charlie we threw snow balls at each other way back when
When Mickey Mantle and Phil Rizzuto were still in the game
And my first true love was Carol
She was pretty and she lived in the neighborhood
On the streets and trees and sidewalks where everyboby knew their neighbor good
Woo ooo, I'm a Jersey Boy, Jersey Boy
From the Old Pulaski Skyway to Lake Hopatcong to the Hurricane Bar deep in my heart
I'm a Jersey Boy
I remember thinking long ago and when telling a bartender named Stewart I don't think I'll be discovered singing country music in here in Newark
So I took a Grey Hound Bus down to Nashville knocked on some doors and made some friends
One opended up and I walked through and I never was the same again

Looking back it seemed so long ago, then again it seems like yesterday
And I'm Proud to say I'm a Jersey Boy
And my mind is full of images of another time and place with soda shops and scrimages and school girls pretty face
I'm a Jersey Boy, Jersey Boy
From the George Washington Bridge to the Clairmont Diner to the girls I knew through and through
I'm a Jersey Boy, Jersey Boy
From the streets of Old East Orange to the Jersey Shore to the Palisades
I'm proud to say I'm a Jersey Boy, Jersey Boy
