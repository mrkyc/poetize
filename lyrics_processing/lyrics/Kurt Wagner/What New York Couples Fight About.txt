It becomes an it
Like it's no longer alive
It's like a loss of vision
Or some dark impression
Or a black spot on your eye
If it's up to you
My little sweet baboo
Through the shouting and the fever
Think of life as queer
Think of it my dear
And some knobs or a fancy tone
From here there is no reason
Baby's got it made
But it's not what the life's about
What is imagination
May become a fact
If we think of it that way
If you want to know
I can tell you now
Oh if you make it through somehow
Or is it best to keep or fall to sleep
It isn't looking very good to me
From here

What do New York couples fight about?
Brothers gonna work it out
(Baby's got the bed sheet)
How do
(That was under you)
New York
(When your time and life expires)
Couples fight it out?
What these couples fight about
(Keeps it in the closet)
What do
(Keeps it to herself)
New York
(She should throw the damn thing out)
Couples fight about?
Brothers gonna work it out
(Why should you continue)
How do
(To shake it off)
New York
(Would you write things on the wall?)
Couples fight it out?
What these couples fight about
(You could make it hard)
To be
In the shouting you will see
Or is it best to change the world you're keeping
Down again

Such is the sound of sorry
Without the shy report
Or the grips that could hold you down
(just when things were looking up you act just like a horse's butt)
Everything was simple
But the body's worn
Got the life spread on the ground
(Powder pink and general, the kitchen sink, a funeral)
Every loving other
Don't you fade on me
Like a bomb that's about to blow
(Often we will overlook the things that make it undercooked)
We can make it hard
Or we can take the world apart
Or you'd never be that sure
Of the simple things that makes you want
To cry, again
