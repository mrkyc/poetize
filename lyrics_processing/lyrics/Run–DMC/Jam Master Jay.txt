Kick off shoes, jump on the jock
Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A

J-A-Y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, one, two, three
Jam Master Jay, Run-DMC

He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better 'cause he know he has to
In '84, he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master

We're live as can be, not singing the blues
We got to tell y'all all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not five, not four, not three, just two
Two MCs who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Because it's about time for a brand new group
Run-DMC to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstasy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay, that is his name
And all wild DJs, he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's best, y'all should say
Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay
You might also like
Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs, so won't you move your butt?

We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking 'bout Jam Master Jay

Huh, huh
