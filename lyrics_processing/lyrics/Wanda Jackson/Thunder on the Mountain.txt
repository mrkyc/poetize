A ruckus in the alley and the cops are coming soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere that I go
Kept thinking about Jerry Lee, couldn't keep from crying
When he was born in Ferriday, I was living down the line
And I'm wondering where in the world could Jerry Lee be
I been looking for him clear through Tennessee
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you'll sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to turn me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what I say
He's got the pork chops, I've got the pie
He ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I know one thing, I don't give a dang about your dreams
Thunder on the mountain, heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies in Oklahoma scrambling to get out of town
Looks like a thunder of love, better roll your windows down
Everybody going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take no chance with somebody new
I did all I could, I did it right there and then
I've already confessed, no need to confess again
You might also likeThunder on the mountain, rolling on the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside the King
I wouldn't betray your love for any other thing
The pistols are popping and the power is down
I'd like to try something but I'm far from town
The sun keeps shining and the North Wind's a-picking up speed
Forget about myself, going out to see what others need
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table and the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself
I've been sitting down, studying love
I think it might just fit like a glove
I want a real good man to do just what I say
Everybody's got to wonder what's the matter with the world today
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Going to sleep over there, where the music's coming from
Don't need a guide, I already know the way
