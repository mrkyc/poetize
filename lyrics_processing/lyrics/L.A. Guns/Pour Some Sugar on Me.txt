Razzle and a dazzle and a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent, sugar me, yeah
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
Pour some sugar on me
In the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah
Listen
Red light, yellow light, green light go
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up, loosen up
