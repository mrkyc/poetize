Without a doubt you're going nowhere fast
But rush wrong at the sound of the gun
Just the shadows that you cast
Dead ain't going to love (Whoa)
Dead ain't doing the talk (Whoa)
Stop sign are you ready or not
'Cause there ain't no turning back
(Whoa) You got a lot of nerve talking that way
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And there ain't no playing safe
(Whoa) you got a lot of nerve standing to me
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And I put it to your face
But that's the way that goes
(Knife to a gunfight)
(Knife to a gunfight)
Breathe in, breathe out in time
Without a chance for you to make it last
Cut and run to the burn of the Sun
Got my inhibition packed
Finish what's begun (Whoa)
I'll be redder than all (Whoa)
My God, I'm a hell of a shock
And a hell of a heart attack
You might also like(Whoa) You got a lot of nerve talking that way
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And there ain't no playing safe
(Whoa) you got a lot of nerve standing to me
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And I put it to your face
But that's the way that goes
(Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
Bringing (Knife to a gunfight)
(Whoa) You got a lot of nerve talking that way
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And there ain't no playing safe
(Whoa) you got a lot of nerve standing to me
And you brought a knife to a gun-gunfight
And I put it to your face
But that's the way that goes
