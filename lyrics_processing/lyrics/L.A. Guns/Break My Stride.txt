I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find you
You said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
You said
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
No one's gonna slow me down, oh no
I've got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground, oh no
I've got to keep on moving
You're on the road and now you pray you'll last
The road behind was rocky but now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and now you see your past
Is that the reason why you're running so fast?
She said
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
No one's gonna slow me down, oh no
I've got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground, oh no
I've got to keep on moving
