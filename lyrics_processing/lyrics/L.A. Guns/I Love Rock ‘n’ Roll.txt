I knew she must have been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
And I could tell that it wouldn't be long 'til she was with me, yeah me
I could tell that it wouldn't be long 'til she was with me, yeah me
Singing, I love rock and roll
Put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
She smiled, so I got up and asked her name
"That don't matter," she said, "'cause it's all the same"
I said, "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
And next we were moving on, and she was with me, yeah me
Next we were moving on, she was with me, yeah me
Singing, I love rock and roll
Put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
I said, "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
Next we were moving on, and she was with me, yeah me
Singing that same old song, she was with me, yeah me
