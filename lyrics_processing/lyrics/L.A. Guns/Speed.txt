Can't see the needle cause the gas is low
Got the top down and the radio
Can't hear a word you're saying
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna leave a trail of burning tar
Live fast ride far
Out to the moon on a shooting star
You and me, we need it
We got that wanderlust
Live for the forward thrust
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Blow past
A little bit will make you want a little more
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Blow past
A little bit will make you want a little more
Come on now
Eyes on the horizon line
Hit the quarter mile in half the time
I got the wheel and the road is mine
You better stay out my lane
You might also likeShe's gonna drink a lot of gasoline
You know I'm living in a V8 dream
Live hard ride mean
More like a fighter than a beauty queen
You and me, we need it
We got the wanderlust
Live for the forward thrust
Come on
Yeah!
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Blow past
A little bit will make you want a little more
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Blow past
A little speed will make you want a little more
Road signs passing by
Strobe lights trying to hypnotize
Long road could be anywhere
When I'm driving baby I don't fuckin' care!
Ooh
Come on
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Go fast
A little speed will make you need a little more
Go fast
A little speed will make you want a little more
Go fast
A little speed will make you need a little more
A little speed will make you need a little more
Go fast
