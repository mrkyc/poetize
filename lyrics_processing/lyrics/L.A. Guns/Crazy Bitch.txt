Break me down, you got a lovely face
We're going to your place and now you got to freak me out
Scream so loud, getting fucking laid
You want me to stay but I got to make my way
Hey, you're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Hey, you're a crazy bitch
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Take it off, the paper is your game
You jump in bed with fame, another one night paid in full, uh
You're so fine, it won't be a loss
Cashing in the rocks just to get you face to face
Hey, you're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
