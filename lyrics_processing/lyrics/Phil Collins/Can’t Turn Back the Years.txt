Could've given you everything that you need
But I cannot turn back the years
The perfect love was all you wanted from me
But I cannot turn back the years

So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you
Too bad I love you

Sometimes hits me in the morning, hits me at night
That I cannot turn back the years
So I look out my window, turn off my light
But I cannot turn back the years
Can't make it seem easy, when you're all that I see
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth
People are hurting and they're looking to me
And I look at you there's nothing more to say, it's too bad I love you

But I'm never going to (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No, I love you, and I'm never going to (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
I'll keep holding on to you (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
And I'm never going to give it up
(Give it up, give it up)
You might also like

All that I lived for, all that I dreamed
But I cannot turn back the years
You're the water I drink, you're the air that I breathe
But I cannot turn back the years

So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you

But I'm never gonna (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No, no, no never gonna (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
It's here to stay, and I'm never gonna (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
Never gonna give it up, never gonna (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No, I'm never gonna give it up
Never gonna give it up (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No, I'm never gonna give it up (Give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
