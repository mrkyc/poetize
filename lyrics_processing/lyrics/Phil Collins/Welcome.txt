There's nothing complicated
About the way we live
We're all here for each other, happy to give
Proud of who we are
Humble beneath the stars
We've everything we need
The moon, the sun
There is more than enough here for everyone
All we have we share
And all of us we care

So come on
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
We're happy givin' and takin' to the friends we're makin'
There's nothing we won't do
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our happy to be time
This is our festival
Ya know and best of all
We're here to share it all

There's a bond between us nobody can explain
It's a celebration of life
And seeing friends again
I'd be there for you
I know you'd be there for me too

So come on
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is our festival
Ya know and best of all
We're here to share it all

Remembering loved ones departed
Someone dear to your heart
Finding love, planning a future
Telling stories and laughing with friends
Precious moments you'll never forget
This has to be the most beautiful
The most peaceful place I've ever been to
It's nothing like I've never seen before
When I think how far I've come I can't believe it, yet I see it
Then I see family
I see the way we used to be
Come on!
