They came at night, leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back!" they heard him cry
And I believe him
Well, he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Billy, Billy, don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no

Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop till they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand
They never asked him why
"Get out of my way!" they heard him shout
Then a blinding light
Oh, all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night
You might also like
Now Billy, Billy, don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Don't give up, Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy, you better, you better
You better run for your life


Now Billy, Billy, don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

They came at night, leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back!" they heard him cry
And I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
