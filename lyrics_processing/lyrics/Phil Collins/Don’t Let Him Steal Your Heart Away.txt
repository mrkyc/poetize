You were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to tell you it'll all work out all right

Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

You can look at him the way you did me
And hold him close say you're never letting go
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of the wall, oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right
You might also like
'Cause I've been thinking and I know it was me
Leaving you lonely but hoping you could be strong
But can you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

Well he's gonna try to make it work for you
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss

And don't let him steal your heart away
Please, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my picture off of your wall, d'you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, you know I'm right
'Cause you were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be alright
But he's no good for you
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this
And whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss
Oh, no, no, no

And don't let him steal your heart away, your heart away
Don't let him take it, don't let him steal your heart away from me
Don't let him steal your heart away
