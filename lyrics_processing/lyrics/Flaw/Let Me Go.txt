I woke up today
And couldn't find the strength to say
A single word to you
Still find it so hard to loosen the noose
As the mental disturbance, it leads to abuse
Wake me up when your bitching is done
Cause I can't seem to gather the courage to run
Leave me, you make it so hard to be me
We can't become the people that we all should be
Feed me another lie that you need me
I'm stuck inside the hell this torment has made me

Let me go
There's so much that you still don't know about me
Let me go
And leave me here, I'm perfect all alone

These scars on my face
They constantly remind me that I'm fractured
And I hate you too
Still find it so hard to loosen the noose
As the mental disturbance, it leads to abuse
Wake me up when your bitching is done
Cause I can't seem to gather the courage to run
Leave me, you make it so hard to be me
We can't become the people that we all should be
Feed me another lie that you need me
I'm stuck inside the hell this torment has made me
You might also like
Let me go
There's so much that you still don't know about me
Let me go
And leave me here, I'm perfect all alone

We try to cope with the ups and downs
But we still don't feel right
It's just so hard to keep you around
When all we do is fight
We try to cope with the ups and downs
But we still don't feel right
It's just so hard to keep you around
When all we do is fight

Let me go
There's so much that you still don't know about me
Let me go
And leave me here, I'm perfect all alone
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
