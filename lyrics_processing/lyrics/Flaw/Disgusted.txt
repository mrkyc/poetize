My life is a twist up, that's right
You can't say that
You never fucking missed up
And to all those who have been great
So I turned to fate and jump off Long State
And in every area, I am so sick to want to live
And just to figure, I said I am over whelmed
Maybe just tell myself to go to hell

Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my, my life
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my, my life

United I stand and divided I fall
Seeing my soul all nailed to the fucking wall
All tied up in this cage
That's black, you got on my Bright and complete day
I should end it now
Because I feel it burning, itching, slowing me down
It's an easy way out
I'm bloated, can't speak, can't even shout
You might also like
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my, my life
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my
Fed up with, fed up with my, my life

Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
It would be much easier not to have to
Wake up, get up, stand up
Face the emotions inside
It's not self-destruction that fills my life, my days, my nights
So why can't it all just cease
The negative reflections have to decrease
Even with my future all blank
With all this evil and emptiness turned into dead crank
Of nothing is keeping to my mind
Is there a way out of this mental bind
Aching for help, assistance, asylum
Breaking the weight against this, my own mental bylines
And as I write my last words
All this life flashes by like film in my mind
In my head, it hurts but can't cry
It's only sealing my fate with disappointment and hate
I got to go through with this, that's right
I got to go through with this
I got to, I got to, that's right, I must go through with this
And I wait longer each day
I still wait, maybe today

I must succeed
Find purpose in life, find purpose in life
Pain close in me
Can't take no more, can't take no more
I must succeed
Find purpose in life, find purpose in
Pain close in me
Can't take no more, can't take no more

I must succeed any way
I must succeed any way
I must succeed any way
Brought to my knees again
