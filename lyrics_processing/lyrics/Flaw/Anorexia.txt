This is my message to you

So somebody did you wrong
Took away your only home
In the middle of a falling, yeah
Label if it caps you dry
A mother looks you in the eye and
Thought you were somebody else
Now

Now I am on the end
You won't have to pray and
Now I'm falling and I'm really just sad to say that
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You fucking make me sick bitch

It fucking makes me sick
It fucking, gonna make me fucking sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick, bitch
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick, bitch

Now that your hope is gone
You're asking for it all alone
Face the truth, we don't deserve it
Treated like a little child
I'm not sure if all the while
I'll make it all right instead

I am on the end
So go away and as you do
I have just one more thing to say and
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You fucking make me sick, bitch

It fucking makes me sick
It fucking, gonna make me fucking sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick bitch
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick bitch
You can look your mind and just
You might find that you would never learn to
Whatever enters the realm of the un-blind and
Equal everything that you see and
It will come right back to me
What we get is only what we deserve
Every part of us always returns to itself
Unless you, that's right

It fucking makes me sick
It's fucking gonna make me fucking sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick, bitch
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
And I'm lost once again

Now that you've found your home
Feels like the final song
Blame yourself, it's the only way
For me to be truly free
Live the life like it should be
Equal and very godlike
Now I am on the end
If you wanna stay, you must listen to me when I say
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You fucking make me sick, bitch

It fucking makes me sick
It fucking, gonna make me fucking sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick, bitch
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
It fucking makes me sick
You'll be fucking making me sick, bitch

Look inside your mind and just
You might find that you would never learn to
Whatever enters the realm of the un-blind and
Equal everything that you see and
It will come right back to me
What we get is only what we deserve
Every part of us will always returns itself
Unless you
That's right, that's right, that's right
I can't
