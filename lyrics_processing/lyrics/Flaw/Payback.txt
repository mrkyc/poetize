A wholeness that has just been lost
Striving hard for perfection but still nothing to find
Some value with a cheaper cost
And as I reach out to hear you the sound is so muffled
It makes a lesser man of me
So the only thing left to bring up to date is
You suck!
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
I'm at the point of retraction and still slipping further
This place is getting worse for me
There's such a lack of direction and models to live by
No bright skies ahead of me
But when I reach out for your hand
You turn and then wander
Why I simply just can't see
You might also likeNo separation of gender no difference in me
You're just leading me on and on and on
You lead me on and on and on
You lead me on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on
You suck!
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Bit much to me
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon you're gonna be the one that burns
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Guess what?!
You Suck!
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Be nice to me
