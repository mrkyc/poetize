We started following a certain description
We started simple and fair, once again
Before there wasn't any need for an answer
Things were much different then, but
Now you question who I am, who I am inside
Now there's nothing left to hide, so here it goes
This is my letter
Hope you're alright, it's been rough for me
Thinking all night, about the places I'd be
If I'd maybe, just did a little bit more
You might've let me, become a man for sure
And if I might, express one concern
It seems an issue, all day at every turn
What's the next step, the latest hole in my life
What's next for me to learn?
What's next for me to learn?
Engulf myself into a permanent mystery
No one day just as the next (Not for me)
It's so confusing when I look at my history
I just can't handle that yet, no

One more friendship ends, and then for awhile
I can breathe again
