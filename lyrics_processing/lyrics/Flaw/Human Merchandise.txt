Made up my mind today
When all the proof was made out right before
Lonely
But I look the other way
Inspired by the memory of past indifference
Was a tale?

The question is still haunting me
Where do I go, who should I be?
It really doesn't make much sense now
If I am myself, how do I succeed?
The key to health is the diary
Makes me feel like I just drown in hell again, again

Who cares what people say
We're not like them, we're in tune to our own frequency
You told me to feel strange
It's all right to set our own views of morality

The question is still haunting me
Where do I go, who should I be?
It really doesn't make much sense now
If I am myself, how do I succeed?
The key to health is the diary
Makes me feel like I just drown in hell again

Like every time
Like every time, yeah that's right
Like every time I'm not afraid to break these morals
Like every time, then
Like every day, yeah that's right
Like everyday, you got to break this moral
Like every day, that's right
Like everyday, yeah just give it time
You've got to break the morals
Just give it time, yeah
Like everyday you've got to break it
Like everyday you've got to break it
Just give it time, yeah
Just give it time, yeah that's right
Just give it time
You've got to bring this moral in
Like every time and then
Like everyday, yeah that's right
Like everyday, you've got to break your face no more
Like every time and then
Like every time and then that's right
Like everyday you've got to break these morals
Just give it time, that's right
Just give it time yeah that's right
Just give it time
We've got to break this fucking moral product
It's you
Motherfuck

So just step on the facts
And come right through

So just step on the facts
And come right through, ooh, ooh, ooh

And come right through

Motherfuck bitch

So just step on the facts
And come right through, oh
Look at us
I think it'll be okay
We got the right to live as free as we want to be
Let the others go their way
I need yourself to undo and have your destiny and
The question is not haunting me
I know myself, who I should be
It's starting to make more sense now
If you stand up straight and fight the rules
We'll look back on those petty fools
Who will still continue to drown in it
Cause I will go down in history, history, yeah
