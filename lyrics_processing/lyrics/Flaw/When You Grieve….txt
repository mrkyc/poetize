You're an open book staring at catastrophe
I'm hoping that you never see the darkest side of me
I'm ready for it
Don't hate me for it
If you decide that I am worth the time to try to be
Something that it seems only you can see in me
I'm ready for this
I was made just for this

And even though you don't believe
I'm right there with you when you grieve
You're not alone, I hope you see
You always get just what you need

You hide behind a mask of false reality
A broken image of the things that only you were meant to see
I'm waiting for it
You hate me for it
Just go inside my mind and take your time, I'm trying to be
The person that it seems only you can see in me
I'm ready for this
I was made just for this
You might also like
And even though you don't believe
I'm right there with you when you grieve
You're not alone, I hope you see
You always get just what you need
I'm crying out, it hurts to breathe
I feel so empty when you leave
You're not alone, I hope you see
You always get just what you... (need)

This is not your fault, circumstances say
With just a grain of salt, we find a better way
If this is not your fault, the circumstances say
With just a grain of salt, we can find a better way
If this is not your fault, things will be okay
Things will be okay
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Things will be okay (Things will be okay)
