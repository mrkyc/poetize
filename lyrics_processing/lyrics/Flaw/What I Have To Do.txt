Still can't find a reason or the right words to say
It'll be okay
Wrapped up in all the things that are wrong
It's the only trial so far as the verdict falls
Down you still break away
Caught up in our social degradation
You can't even see the truth
We're only half as good at personal relations
Look around and see the proof
Only a few of us go in the right direction
Even though we're singled out
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
I do what I have to do
How was I to know, force fed corporate trials each day
Every single day
But we must grow, echoing the single most important thing in the way
Every single day
Wrapped up in all the things that are wrong
It's the only trial so far as the verdict falls
Down you still break away
You might also likeCaught up in our social degradation
You can't even see the truth
We're only half as good at personal relations
Look around and see the proof
Only a few of us go in the right direction
Even though we're singled out
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
I do what I have to do
Not slipping, drifting, falling, one step further from the norm
What is the norm?
Not living, longing, trying so much harder than before
What if I, what if I, run far away
Would I still be seen the same, break away
Caught up in our social degradation
You can't even see the truth
We're only half as good at personal relations
Look around and see the proof
Only a few of us go in the right direction
Even though we're singled out
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
I do what I have to do
