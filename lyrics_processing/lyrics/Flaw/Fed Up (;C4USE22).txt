Every day in America, an average of 22 combat veterans commit suicide
This song is intended to bring light to this tragedy

Let's do this, my life is a twist up, that's right
You can't say that you never fucking missed up
And to all those who have been great
I can't turn the page, jump off the world stage
And in every area, I am so sick to want to live
And just the figure, it's too hard to think of
It's an easy way out
Knowing I can't speak, I can't even shout

I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with,  I'm trapped all inside my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my own life
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm wrapped up inside my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my own life

United we stand and divided I fall
Seeing my soul all nailed to the faded wall
All tied up in this cage
Pitch black, there's no light, in complete haze
Maybe I should end it now
Because I feel it burning, itching, slowing me down
It's an easy way out
No one can help me, I can't even shout
You might also like
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with,  I'm trapped all inside my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my own life
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm wrapped up inside my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my own life

And I wait longer each day
I still wait, maybe today

I must go through with this, but I can't
I can't go through with this, but I must
I must go through with this, but I can't
I can't go through with this, but I must
I must go through with this, but I can't
I can't go through with this, but I must
I must go through with this
I can't go through with this

I must succeed
Find purpose in life, find purpose in life
Pain close in me
Can't take it no more, can't take it
I must succeed
Find purpose in life, find purpose in
Pain close in me
Can't take it no more, can't take it
I must succeed
Pain close in me
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
Nothing but the facts, y'all
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with,  I'm trapped all inside my
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my own life
I'm fed up with, I'm fed up with my
I'm fed up with, I'm wrapped up inside my
