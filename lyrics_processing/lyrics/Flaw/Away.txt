Though I've made an awful mess, I've found a way out
It keeps me sane and helps me not regress
I believe there's no other route

Cause when you're hurting and you're down you're at your worst
Misinterpreted or maybe your own self you cursed
Action works, though true confidence won't align
Only fooling yourself thinking everything's just fine
You never opened up your mind anyway
Afraid of what you might find safe to say
Be real and face all the fears that you may
It all works out someday

So sick of the same old shit, I'm in deep
And it's almost like there's no way out
But then a light of hope shines down upon me
I realize just how I gotta let it out, gotta let it out

It's a pleasure that I'm in control, first time in my life
Doesn't matter how the ball rolls because I know I'll be alright

So sick of the same old shit, I'm in deep
And it's almost like there's no way out
But then a light of hope shines down upon me
I realize just how I gotta let it out
You might also like
Music is a drug
And you know God if I could
I'd shoot it all day long

Though I've made an awful mess, I found a way out
It keeps me sane and helps me not regress
You see, I believe there is no other route

So sick of the same old shit, I'm in deep
And it's almost like there's no way out
But then a light of hope shines down upon me
I realize just how I gotta let it out

Music is a drug
And you know God if I could
I'd shoot it all day long

Though I've made an awful fucking mess
I've found a way out
Keeps me sane helps me not regress, so what's wrong
Keeps me sane helps me not regress, so what's wrong
Keeps me sane
My music is a drug
